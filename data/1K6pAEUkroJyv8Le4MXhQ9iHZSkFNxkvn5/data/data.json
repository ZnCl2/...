			"body": "School: Wake Forest\nProgram: MA in Management\nDeadline: 2-6, 3-6\nThis section includes three scenarios and two free-response questions that are required for all MA applicants. As a guide, your responses to the five questions listed below should be limited to one paragraph (approx. 250 words max.)\nScenario #1\nIt is Wednesday afternoon of final exam week and you just completed your second to last final. Your last final, statistics, is tomorrow morning at 11:00 a.m. You currently have an 89% average in the course and want to use the term-end to earn a solid A. You plan to study for the stats final from 6:00-10:00 p.m. this evening with a couple of your classmates who are struggling in the course. In fact, your two classmates need to get at least a C+ to pass the course. You are getting ready to go workout before the study session when your best friend calls and invites you to attend a concert of your favorite band that evening. You attempted to get tickets earlier but the concert was sold out. Your best friend tells you that he/she won the tickets in a contest and that a person you have been very interested in dating is also attending the concert and would like you to come. Your best friend also reminds you this is the last opportunity to hang-out before he/she departs for year-long study abroad in Singapore. You realize this is a once in a life-time opportunity to see your favorite band in concert, share the experience with your best friend, and spend the evening with a person you would like to date. The stars have aligned.\n•Scenario #1 Question: What do you do and why? Be sure to discuss the reasons behind youractions\n(Notes: adjust meeting time with my classmates first---win-win. If not, go study with classmates. Because this is a “promise” with classmates and I need an A. )\n\n\nsimply answer the question first - what do you do, then why.\n"

The performance sealed his position as a dance legend up against the likes of Fred Astaire. After one of his performances The New York Times stated “The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing”\n"

He was one of the biggest stars and greatest innovators during Hollywood’s golden age of musicals. Kelly considered his own style to be a hybrid of various approaches to dance, including modern, ballet, and tap.\n\nKelly was a major exponent of 20th-century filmed dance, known for his energetic and athletic dancing style and the likeable characters which he played on screen. Although he is probably best known today for his performance in Singin’ in the Rain, he dominated Hollywood musical films from the mid-1940s until its demise in the late 1950s.

			"body": "The term \"retention rate\" is used in a variety of fields, including marketing, investing, education, in the workplace and in clinical trials. Maintaining retention in each of these fields often results in a positive outcome for the overall organization or school, or pharmacological study. In marketing, retention rate is used to count customers and track customer activity irrespective of the number of transactions (or dollar value of those transactions) made by each customer.[1]\n\n\"Retention rate is the ratio of the number of retained customers to the number at risk\". In contractual situations, it makes sense to talk about the number of customers currently under contract and the percentage retained when the contract period runs out.\" This term should not be confused with growth (decline) in customer counts. Retention refers only to existing customers in contractual situations. \"In non-contractual situations (such as catalog sales), it makes less sense to talk about the current number of customers, but instead to count the number of customers of a specified recency.\" In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 63 percent responded that they found the \"retention rate\" metric very useful.[2]\n"

			"body": "\nInspiration is a slender river of brightness leaping from a vast and eternal knowledge, it exceeds reason more perfectly than reason exceeds the knowledge of the senses. Sri Aurobindo, Thoughts and Aphorisms (1913); Jnana.\n\nIt's lack that gives us inspiration. It's not fullness. Not ever having driven, I can write better about automobiles than the people who drive them. I have a distance here. ... Space travel is another good example. I'm never going to go to Mars but I've helped inspire, thank goodness, the people who built the rockets and sent our photographic equipment off to Mars. So it's always a lack that causes you to write that type of story. Ray Bradybury [1]\n\nI got on with the task of turning myself into a brief professional writer. The term professional is not meant to imply a high standard of commitment and attainment: it meant then, as it still does, the pursuit of a trade or calling to the end of paying the rent and buying liquor. I leave the myth of inspiration and agonised creative inaction to the amateurs. The practice of a profession entails discipline, which for me meant the production of two thousand words of fair copy every day, weekends included. I discovered that, if I started early enough, I could complete the day’s stint before the pubs opened. Or, if I could not, there was an elated period of the night after closing time, with neighbours banging on the walls to protest at the industrious clacking. Two thousand words a day means a yearly total of 730,000. Step up the rate and, without undue effort, you can reach a million. This ought to mean ten novels of 100,000 words each. This quantitative approach is not, naturally, to be approved. And because of hangovers, marital quarrels, creative deadness induced by the weather, shopping trips, summonses to meet state officials, and sheer torpid gloom, I was not able to achieve more than five and a half novels of very moderate size in that pseudo-terminal year. Still, it was very nearly E.M.Forster’s whole long life’s output. Anthony Burgess, You've Had Your Time, Being the Second Part of the Confessions of Anthony Burgess (1990).\n\nGreatness is more than potential. It is the execution of that potential. Beyond the raw talent. You need the appropriate training. You need the discipline. You need the inspiration. You need the drive. Eric A. Burns, Gossamer Commons, 08-12-05\n\nInspiration is never genuine if it is known as inspiration at the time. True inspiration always steals on a person; its importance not being fully recognised for some time. Samuel Butler, The Note-Books of Samuel Butler (1912), Part XI - Cash and Credit, Genius, iii.\n\nI've described my usual writing process as scrambling from peak to peak on inspiration through foggy valleys of despised logic. Inspiration is better — when you can get it. Lois McMaster Bujold Young Miles (1997), \"Author's Afterword\".\n\nIf you ever have to make a choice between learning and inspiration, choose learning. It works more of the time. Lois McMaster Bujold Falling Free (1988).\n\nWherever we are, God’s in that moment, God’s speaking to us, and if we’ve just got our ears open and our antennas up, there’s no lack of inspiration. He’s not silent. We just have to be listening. Steven Curtis Chapman, Press conference after 2007 GMA Music Awards [2]\n\nThe inspirational value of the space program is probably of far greater importance to education than any input of dollars... A whole generation is growing up which has been attracted to the hard disciplines of science and engineering by the romance of space. Arthur C. Clarke (1917 - ), First on the Moon, 1970.\n\nTotalitarian art must be a form of classicism: the state which is founded on order and subordination demands an art with a similar basis. Romantic painting, however popular, expresses the revolt of the individual. The State also requires an art of reason by which appropriate works may be produced as required. Inspiration is outside state control. The classic attitude toward subject matter — that it should be clear and unequivocal — supports the attitude of unquestioning belief. Add the fact that totalitarian art must be real enough to please the ignorant, ideal enough to commemorate a national hero, and well enough designed to present a memorable image, and one sees how perfectly The Death of Marat fills the bill. That it happens also to be a great work of art makes it dangerously misleading. Kenneth Clark, The Romantic Rebellion (1973); Ch. 1: David\n\nI always thought that inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show and get to work. If you’re going to wait a around for the clouds to open up and lightning to strike you in the brain you’re not going to make an awful lot of work. Chuck Close [3]\n\nWhen inspiration does not come, I go for a walk, go to the movie, talk to a friend, let go... The muse is bound to return again, especially if I turn my back! Judy Collins, as quoted in Wise Highs: How to Thrill, Chill, & Get Away from It All Without Alcohol or Other Drugs (2006) by Alex J. Packer, p. 213.\n\nI assure you no art was ever less spontaneous than mine. What I do is the result of reflection and study of the great masters; of inspiration, spontaneity, temperament — temperament is the word — I know nothing. Edgar Degas, Said in conversation with George Moore and quoted by Moore in Impressions and Opinions (1891).\n\nI always urged my contemporaries to look for interest and inspiration to the development and study of drawing, but they would not listen. They thought the road to salvation lay by the way of colour. Edgar Degas, Quoted by Walter Sickert in \"Post-Impressionism and Cubism,\" Pall Mall Gazette (1914-03-11). According to Sickert, Degas had said this to him in 1885.\n\nThere'll be what you might call a moment of inspiration – a way of seeing or feeling or remembering, an instance or a person that's made a large impression. Like the sand and the oyster, it's a creative irritant. In each poem, I'm trying to reveal a truth, so it can't have a fictional beginning Carol Ann Duffy, Interviewed in The Guardian, December 4, 2005.\n\nGenius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration. Thomas A. Edison (1847 - 1931), Harper's Monthly, 1932.\n\nI believe in intuition and inspiration. Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific research. Albert Einstein; Cosmic Religion : With Other Opinions and Aphorisms (1931) by Albert Einstein, p. 97; also in Transformation : Arts, Communication, Environment (1950) by Harry Holtzman, p. 138.\n\nEverything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor in freedom. Albert Einstein, Out of My Later Years (1950).\n\nI don't believe in total freedom for the artist. Left on his own, free to do anything he likes, the artist ends up doing nothing at all. If there's one thing that's dangerous for an artist, it's precisely this question of total freedom, waiting for inspiration and all the rest of it. Federico Fellini (1920 - 1993) I'm a Born Liar: A Fellini Lexicon (2003) Edited by Damian Pettigrew ISBN 0306805200\n\nIt is with just that hope that we welcome everything that tends to strengthen the fibre and develop the nature on more sides. When the intellect and affections are in harmony; when intellectual consciousness is calm and deep; inspiration will not be confounded with fancy. Margaret Fuller, Woman in the Nineteenth Century (1845).\n\nWhat I mean by the Muse is that unimpeded clearness of the intuitive powers, which a perfectly truthful adherence to every admonition of the higher instincts would bring to a finely organized human being. It may appear as prophecy or as poesy. … and should these faculties have free play, I believe they will open new, deeper and purer sources of joyous inspiration than have as yet refreshed the earth.\n Let us be wise, and not impede the soul. Let her work as she will. Let us have one creative energy, one incessant revelation. Let it take what form it will, and let us not bind it by the past to man or woman, black or white. Margaret Fuller, Woman in the Nineteenth Century (1845).\n\nHarmony exists no less in difference than in likeness, if only the same key-note govern both parts. Woman the poem, man the poet; woman the heart, man the head; such divisions are only important when they are never to be transcended. If nature is never bound down, nor the voice of inspiration stifled, that is enough. Margaret Fuller, Woman in the Nineteenth Century (1845).\n\nYes, Shakespeare foremost and forever (Darwin too). But also teach about the excellence of pygmy bushcraft and Fuegian survival in the world's harshest climate. Dignity and inspiration come in many guises. Would anyone choose the tinhorn patriotism of George Armstrong Custer over the eloquence of Chief Joseph in defeat? Stephen Jay Gould, Eight Little Piggies (1993); \"The Moral State of Tahiti—and of Darwin\", p. 274.\n\nDarwin grasped the philosophical bleakness with his characteristic courage. He argued that hope and morality cannot, and should not, be passively read in the construction of nature. Aesthetic and moral truths, as human concepts, must be shaped in human terms, not “discovered” in nature. We must formulate these answers for ourselves and then approach nature as a partner who can answer other kinds of questions for us—questions about the factual state of the universe, not about the meaning of human life. If we grant nature the independence of her own domain—her answers unframed in human terms—then we can grasp her exquisite beauty in a free and humble way. For then we become liberated to approach nature without the burden of an inappropriate and impossible quest for moral messages to assuage our hopes and fears. We can pay our proper respect to nature's independence and read her own ways as beauty or inspiration in our different terms. Stephen Jay Gould, I Have Landed (2002); \"Art Meets Science in The Heart of the Andes\", p. 109.\n\nInspiration is the windfall from hard work and focus. Muses are too unreliable to keep on the payroll. Helen Hanson, in \"For Writers\" (14 July 2010).\n\nHe gave us his \"Curves and Functions\", in the form of lectures; and sometimes, even while stating his propositions, he would be seized with some mathematical inspiration, would forget pupils, notes, everything, and would rapidly dash off equation after equation, following them out with smaller and smaller chalk-marks into the remote corners of the blackboard, forsaking his delightful task only when there was literally no more space to be covered, and coming back with a sigh to his actual students. There was a great fascination about these interruptions; we were present, as it seemed, at mathematics in the making; it was like peeping into a necromancer's cell, and seeing him at work; or as if our teacher were one of the old Arabian algebraists recalled to life. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, regarding Benjamin Peirce, as quoted in The Early Years of the Saturday Club, 1855-1870 (1918) by Edward Waldo Emerson.\n\nThey who lack talent expect things to happen without effort. They ascribe failure to a lack of inspiration or ability, or to misfortune, rather than to insufficient application. At the core of every true talent there is an awareness of the difficulties inherent in any achievement, and the confidence that by persistence and patience something worthwhile will be realized. Thus talent is a species of vigor. Eric Hoffer (1902 - 1983) Reflections on the Human Condition (1973) Section 77.\n\nPoetical composition results from two intellectual phenomena, meditation and inspiration. Meditation is a faculty ; inspiration is a gift. All men, to a certain degree, can meditate; very few are inspired. Spiritus flat ubi vult. In meditation, the spirit acts; in inspiration, it oheys ; because the first is of men, the second comes from a higher source. He who gave us this power is stronger than we. These two processes of thoughts are intimately linked in the soul of the poet. The poet invites inspiration by meditation, as the prophets raised themselves to ecstacies by prayer. That the muse should reveal herself to him, he must in some sort have passed all his material existence in repose, in silence, and in meditation. He must be isolated from external life, to enjoy in its fullness that inward life, which developes in bim a new existence; and it is only when the physical world has utterly vanished from before his eyes, that the ideal world is fully revealed to him. It seems that poetic inspiration has in it some- thing too sublime for~the common nature of man. Genius can compass its greater efforts only when the soul is released from the vulgar cares that follow it in life ; for thought cannot take its wings till it has laid aside its burden. Thence comes it, doubtless, that inspiration is born only of meditation. Among the Jews, the people whose history is so rich in mysterious symbols when the priest had built the altar, he lighted upon it an earthly flame -- and it was then only that the divine ray descended from Heaven. Victor Hugo SCRAPS OF PHILOSOPHY AND CRITICISM. The New-England magazine. Volume 9, Issue 9 September 1835 [4]\n\nHappy he who possesses this double power of meditation and inspiration, which is genius! Whatever may be the age on which he is, or the country -- be he born in the bosom of domestic calamities, be he thrown on a time of popular convulsions, or, what is still more to be lamented, on a period of stagnant indifference --let him trust himself to the future; for, if the present belong to other men, the future is for him. He is of the number of chosen beings for whom a day is allotted. Sooner or later, the day comes ; and it is then -- fed by sublime thought, and elevated by divine inspiration -- that he throws himself boldly before the world, with the cry of the poet upon his lips ‘Voici mon Orient: peuples levez les yeux!’ Victor Hugo SCRAPS OF PHILOSOPHY AND CRITICISM. The New-England magazine. Volume 9, Issue 9 September 1835 [5]\n\nLet my inspiration flow, in token lines suggesting rhythm, that will not forsake me, till my tale is told and done Robert Hunter, Terrapin Station (1977); \"Lady With a Fan\".\n\nInspiration, move me brightly, light the song with sense and color, hold away despair Robert Hunter, Terrapin Station (1977); \"Lady With a Fan\".\n\nBatman: Everyone looks up to you. They listen to you. If you tell them to fight, they'll fight. But they need to be inspired. And let's face it, \"Superman\" ... the last time you really inspired anyone was when you were dead.\nGeoff Johns, Infinite Crisis#1\nThis is Paris. And I'm an American who lives here. My name Jerry Mulligan. And I'm an ex-GI. In 1945, when the Army told me to find my own job, I stayed on and I'll tell you why. I'm a painter. All my life, that's all I've ever wanted to do. And for a painter, the Mecca of the world for study, for inspiration, and for living is here on this star called Paris. Just look at it. No wonder so many artists have come here and called it home. Brother, if you can't paint in Paris, you'd better give up and marry the boss's daughter. Back home everyone said I didn't have any talent. They might be saying the same thing over here, but it sounds better in French. Alan Jay Lerner, Jerry Mulligan in An American in Paris.\n\nDon't loaf and invite inspiration; light out after it with a club, and if you don't get it you will nonetheless get something that looks remarkably like it. Jack London (1876 - 1916) 'Getting into Print', first published in 1903 in The Editor magazine. often paraphrased; You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club.\n\n\nDesire itself is an inspiration. Every man desires to do something in life.Where there is no desire no way would open out.Yet too much of desire creates problems.If we understand where to draw the limits to our ambition then we would experience a constant need to keep our inspiration alive and the desire to make something of one's life would never be ignored. Acharya Mahapragya, Thoughts at Sunrise (2007).\n\nWonder Woman: The only way you can rule anybody Steve, is the way we women do it -- by inspiring affection! Wonder Woman The Mysterious Prisoners of Anglona written by William Moulton Marston\n\nEveryone has a goal which appears to be great, at least to himself, and is great when deepest conviction, the innermost voice of the heart, pronounces it great. ... This voice, however, is easily drowned out, and what we thought to be inspiration may have been created by the fleeting moment and again perhaps destroyed by it. ... We must seriously ask ourselves, therefore, whether we are really inspired about a vocation, whether an inner voice approves of it, or whether the inspiration was a deception, whether that which we took as the Deity’s calling to us was self-deceit. But how else could we recognize this except by searching for the source of our inspiration? Karl Marx, Writings of the Young Marx on Philosophy and Society, L. Easton, trans. (1967), p. 36.\n\nEverything great glitters, glitter begets ambition, and ambition can easily have caused the inspiration or what we thought to be inspiration. But reason can no longer restrain one who is lured by the fury of ambition. He tumbles where his vehement drive calls him; no longer does he choose his position, but rather chance and luster determine it. Karl Marx, Writings of the Young Marx on Philosophy and Society, L. Easton, trans. (1967), p. 36.\n\nI'll get an inspiration and start painting; then I'll forget everything, everything except how things used to be and how to paint it so people will know how we used to live. Grandma Moses, As quoted in her obituary in The New York Times (14 December 1961).\n\nA breath of our inspiration\n Is the life of each generation;\n A wondrous thing of our dreaming\n Unearthly, impossible seeming —\nThe soldier, the king, and the peasant\n Are working together in one,\n Till our dream shall become their present,\n And their work in the world be done. Arthur O'Shaughnessy, Music and Moonlight (1874), Ode.\n\nI’m tired of ignorance held up as inspiration, where vicious anti-intellectualism is considered a positive trait, and where uninformed opinion is displayed as fact. Phil Plait, Bad Astronomy blog; \"The mainstreaming of crazy\" (8 September 2009).\n\nIf you're going to make a living at this business - more importantly, if you're going to write anything that will last - you have to realise that a lot of the time, you're going to be writing without inspiration. The trick is to write just as well without it as with. Of course, you write less readily and fluently without it; but the interesting thing is to look at the private journals and letters of great writers and see how much of the time they just had to do without inspiration. Conrad, for example, groaned at the desperate emptiness of the pages he faced; and yet he managed to cover them. Amateurs think that if they were inspired all the time, they could be professionals. Professional know that if they relied on inspiration, they'd be amateurs. Philip Pullman, from the Q&A section (found July 2010).\n\nEvery culture, if its natural development is not too much affected by political restrictions, experiences a perpetual renewal of the formative urge, and out of that comes an ever growing diversity of creative activity. Every successful piece of work stirs the desire for greater perfection and deeper inspiration; each new form becomes the herald of new possibilities of development. Rudolf Rocker, Anarcho-Syndicalism (1938); Ch. 1 \"Anarchism: Its Aims and Purposes\".\n\nMy inspirations don't come from outer space, they just come to me. I have no idea why they come when they do. Joe Satriani, As quoted in Guitar Magazine (March 1990).\n\nI decided that it was not wisdom that enabled [poets] to write their poetry, but a kind of instinct or inspiration, such as you find in seers and prophets who deliver all their sublime messages without knowing in the least what they mean. Socrates (469 BC - 399 BC), In \"Apology,\" sct. 21, by Plato.\n\nI believe that music can be an inspirational force in all our lives — that its eloquence and the depth of its meaning are all-important, and that all personal considerations concerning musicians and the public are relatively unimportant — that music come from the heart and returns to the heart — that music is spontaneous, impulsive expression — that its range is without limit — that music is forever growing — that music can be one element to help us build a new conception of life in which the madness and cruelty of wars will be replaced by a simple understanding of the brotherhood of man.\nMusic can be all things to all men. It is like a great dynamic sun in the center of a solar system which sends out its rays and inspiration in every direction. … It is as if the heavens open and a divine voice calls. Something in our souls responds and understands. We are speaking here of the most inspired music. Leopold Stokowski (born 18 April 1882) Music For All Of Us (1943); also quoted as \"...Music can be all things to all persons... \".\n\n\nThe past slips from our grasp. It leaves us only scattered things. The bond that united them eludes us. Our imagination usually fills in the void by making use of preconceived theories...Archaeology, then, does not supply us with certitudes, but rather with vague hypotheses. And in the shade of these hypotheses some artists are content to dream, considering them less as scientific facts than as sources of inspiration. Igor Stravinsky (1882 - 1971), Poetics of Music in the Form - Six Lessons.\n\nInspiration is not the exclusive privilege of poets or artists. There is, there has been, there will always be a certain group of people whom inspiration visits. It's made up of all those who've consciously chosen their calling and do their job with love and imagination. It may include doctors, teachers, gardeners — I could list a hundred more professions. Their work becomes one continuous adventure as long as they manage to keep discovering new challenges in it. Difficulties and setbacks never quell their curiosity. A swarm of new questions emerges from every problem that they solve. Whatever inspiration is, it's born from a continuous \"I don't know.\" Wisława Szymborska The Poet and the World (1996) Nobel lecture (1996-12-07)\n\nWhile I was held prisoner, sweet inspiration educated me\n and laws were imparted to me in a speech which had no words... Taliesin, The Tale of Taleisin.\n\nThe Cauldron of Wisdom and Inspiration must be kept boiling for a year and a day, and then the first three drops from it would impart ultimate knowledge to the one who drank them. But the rest of the liquid would be deadly poison.\n Long labored Ceridwen, roaming far to find the rare and exotic herbs she required, and so it chanced that she fell asleep on the last day of the spell. The boy Gwion was stirring the brew when three drops flew out onto his thumb, and they were scalding hot, so that he thrust it into his mouth to stop the burning. Instantly, he had the wisdom and inspiration of ages, and the first thing that occurred to him was that Ceridwen would be very angry. This is part of the folk tradition of how the boy Gwion became Taliesin, from \"The Tale of Taliesin\" as told by Jennifer Cochrane at Encyclopedia Mythica.\n\nWho knows where inspiration comes from. Perhaps it arises from desperation. Perhaps it comes from the flukes of the universe, the kindness of the muses. Amy Tan, as quoted in A Small Drop of Ink : A Collection of Inspirational and Moving Quotations of the Ages (2003) by Linda Pendleton, p. 129.\n\nEven the death of Friends will inspire us as much as their lives. They will leave consolation to the mourners, as the rich leave money to defray the expenses of their funerals, and their memories will be incrusted over with sublime and pleasing thoughts, as monuments of other men are overgrown with moss; for our Friends have no place in the graveyard. Henry David Thoreau A Week on the Concord and Marrimack Rivers (1849) Wednesday.\n\nI invented something called The Oxford Muse. The Muses were women in mythology. They did not teach or require to be worshipped, but they were a source of inspiration. They taught you how to cultivate your emotions through the different arts in order to reach a higher plane. What is lacking now, I believe, is somewhere you can get that stimulation not information, but stimulation where you can meet just that person, or find just that situation, which will give you the idea of invention, of carrying out some project which interests you, and show how it can become a project of interest to other people. Theodore Zeldin \"About The Oxford Muse Foundation\", The Gurteen Knowledge Website.\n\n"

			"body": "How do we find inspiration? How are we inspired? To many artists and musicians, inspiration is a mystery. They can be inspired by emotions, by love or loss, by triumphs and tragedies, by current events and scenes from nature. It is said that Napoleon was inspired by reading classic literature. Hadrian (who ruled Rome from 117-138 AD) drew inspiration from studying Roman generals. John Adams, America’s second President, was greatly inspired by his father’s honesty and love of country. Recently, a marketing guru confessed that he frequently is asked about his sources of inspiration. He described how, for people in marketing, this can be a continual struggle. It’s not easy to find constant inspiration, week after week, day after day, project after project. This expert concluded that his inspiration could “come from anywhere”: from commercials, reading articles, or just studying data. He could be inspired by thumbing through magazines or going to sporting events with his kids. Or inspiration could come from visiting new places, listening to conversations, or many “less obvious places.” But Believers have access to another dimension of inspiration—the inspiration that comes from knowing God, the Creator.

			"body": "The Top 10 Leadership Qualities\n\nUpdated: September 26, 2015\n\nIntroduction\n\nLeadership can be defined as one's ability to get others to willingly follow. Every organization needs leaders at every level. Leaders can be found and nurtured if you look for the following character traits.\n\nA leader with vision has a clear, vivid picture of where to go, as well as a firm grasp on what success looks like and how to achieve it. But it's not enough to have a vision; leaders must also share it and act upon it. Jack Welch, former chairman and CEO of General Electric Co., said, \"Good business leaders create a vision, articulate the vision, passionately own the vision and relentlessly drive it to completion.\"\n\nA leader must be able to communicate his or her vision in terms that cause followers to buy into it. He or she must communicate clearly and passionately, as passion is contagious.\n\nA good leader must have the discipline to work toward his or her vision single-mindedly, as well as to direct his or her actions and those of the team toward the goal. Action is the mark of a leader. A leader does not suffer \"analysis paralysis\" but is always doing something in pursuit of the vision, inspiring others to do the same.\n\n \n\nAnalysis\n\nIntegrity is the integration of outward actions and inner values. A person of integrity is the same on the outside and on the inside. Such an individual can be trusted because he or she never veers from inner values, even when it might be expeditious to do so. A leader must have the trust of followers and therefore must display integrity.\n\nHonest dealings, predictable reactions, well-controlled emotions, and an absence of tantrums and harsh outbursts are all signs of integrity. A leader who is centered in integrity will be more approachable by followers.\n\nDedication means spending whatever time or energy is necessary to accomplish the task at hand. A leader inspires dedication by example, doing whatever it takes to complete the next step toward the vision. By setting an excellent example, leaders can show followers that there are no nine-to-five jobs on the team, only opportunities to achieve something great.\n\nMagnanimity means giving credit where it is due. A magnanimous leader ensures that credit for successes is spread as widely as possible throughout the company. Conversely, a good leader takes personal responsibility for failures. This sort of reverse magnanimity helps other people feel good about themselves and draws the team closer together. To spread the fame and take the blame is a hallmark of effective leadership.\n\nLeaders with humility recognize that they are no better or worse than other members of the team. A humble leader is not self-effacing but rather tries to elevate everyone. Leaders with humility also understand that their status does not make them a god. Mahatma Gandhi is a role model for Indian leaders, and he pursued a \"follower-centric\" leadership role.\n\nOpenness means being able to listen to new ideas, even if they do not conform to the usual way of thinking. Good leaders are able to suspend judgment while listening to others' ideas, as well as accept new ways of doing things that someone else thought of. Openness builds mutual respect and trust between leaders and followers, and it also keeps the team well supplied with new ideas that can further its vision.\n\nCreativity is the ability to think differently, to get outside of the box that constrains solutions. Creativity gives leaders the ability to see things that others have not seen and thus lead followers in new directions. The most important question that a leader can ask is, \"What if … ?\" Possibly the worst thing a leader can say is, \"I know this is a dumb question ... \"\n\nFairness means dealing with others consistently and justly. A leader must check all the facts and hear everyone out before passing judgment. He or she must avoid leaping to conclusions based on incomplete evidence. When people feel they that are being treated fairly, they reward a leader with loyalty and dedication.\n\nAssertiveness is not the same as aggressiveness. Rather, it is the ability to clearly state what one expects so that there will be no misunderstandings. A leader must be assertive to get the desired results. Along with assertiveness comes the responsibility to clearly understand what followers expect from their leader.\n\nMany leaders have difficulty striking the right amount of assertiveness, according to a study in the February 2007 issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, published by the APA (American Psychological Association). It seems that being underassertive or overassertive may be the most common weakness among aspiring leaders.\n\nA sense of humor is vital to relieve tension and boredom, as well as to defuse hostility. Effective leaders know how to use humor to energize followers. Humor is a form of power that provides some control over the work environment. And simply put, humor fosters good camaraderie.\n\nIntrinsic traits such as intelligence, good looks, height and so on are not necessary to become a leader. Anyone can cultivate the proper leadership traits.\n"

			"body": "Some say great leaders are born, not made. And while there are some born leaders, many more have honed their leadership skills through extensive practice.  So, if you're not a born leader, but want to learn how to be, this article will show you what you need  to do to become the most effective leader you can be.  \n\nBe prepared for commitment\nEffective leadership is much more than simply giving assignments and direction. It requires vision, collaboration, planning and practice. And this all takes time and a lot of hard work. If you aren't one of those \"born\" leaders, be prepared for a serious commitment to honing your leadership skills.\n\nAssess your personal strengths and weaknesses\nA good leader excels in some areas, but also understands his or her limitations. Knowing these strengths and weaknesses will help you delegate responsibility accordingly, hire people who complement you, and know what areas you need to work on to become a better leader.\n\nLearn how people perceive you\nGood leaders have a thorough understanding of how they're perceived. This knowledge will make you better able to communicate with employees and understand what qualities you need to work on to manage more effectively. For example, if you are known as being a bit too harsh, you can work on your tone of voice and use more praise. It is often hard to know how employees perceive you, so try to observe them closely or ask them in a non-threatening way such as, \"If you had to name my best and worst qualities, what would they be?\" An anonymous comment box might also elicit the information you need.\n\nKnow the traits the group values in a leader \nThere is no one-size-fits-all leader. To be an effective leader for a certain group, you will need to understand what qualities the group values. Trust? Creativity? Organization? You should hone whatever qualities they value (ones that will also inspire them to work smarter and harder). If you don't know the answer to this question, observe your group members or simply ask them what makes a good leader. They will likely appreciate your commitment to their concerns.\n\nDevelop a vision and solid goals\nMembers of a group need to know what they are working toward. Your job as a leader is to work with your employees to set measurable goals with achievable milestones along the way. Your team members should know your vision for the group as a whole and for them as individuals.\n\nLearn and practice your skills\nKey leadership skills include communication, team-building, vision and planning, knowing when to take risks, motivating individuals and the group, delegating responsibility, and more. To become a good leader, you will need to practice these skills.\n\nKnow the organization\nAn effective leader knows the purpose and goals of his or her group, the purpose and goals of the overall organization, and the best strategies to achieve these goals. The leader understands not only how his or her group operates, but also how it operates in the context of the entire business. You should know what each department and individual (assuming your business is relatively small) does and how it affects the organization as a whole. You should also understand the external operations of the organization.\n\nKnow the industry\nYou should know the industry trends, major players, marketplace and other relevant information for the industry in which you work.\n\nMake your meetings work\nWhen you call a meeting, you need to know how to make it productive and lead to concrete action. The first step in this process is to set an agenda for the meeting and follow it. End the meeting by clearly outlining the \"action items\" or important points from the meeting.\nFollow up the meeting with notes about what happened in the meeting as well as any specific action items and who is responsible for executing them.\n\nLearn to communicate better\nA good communicator should not only speak clearly and with confidence, but must also be a good listener. Here are a few tips to speak with confidence and clarity:\n* Prepare what you have to say\nThis includes thoroughly researching your subject manner and outlining your speech.\n* Practice\nPractice your speech in front of others if possible. It might also be useful to take a public speaking class.\n* Know your audience\nTailor what you are going to say to your audience. Make sure you make it clear why this speech matters to them. Also, know what they want out of a speech - do they just want you to hurry up? If so, keep it short.\n* Visualize your success\n* Make eye contact with your audience\n* Act confident, even if you are not\n* Look your best\n* Be a good listener\n\nGood listeners look for verbal and nonverbal cues from others. It is often an effective strategy to paraphrase what the other person has said to make sure you have understood correctly.\n\nRecognize and encourage employees\nOne of the biggest motivators for employees is recognition for their good work and encouragement along the way. Motivate your employees to continue with a project, and then praise them as they do good work along the way.\n\nBuild your team\nAn effective leader usually does not, and should not, work alone. He or she should communicate with members of the team, as well as show team members how to work well with each other. All members should be encouraged to participate in the group.\n\nDon't be afraid to innovate and take risks. An organization that neither innovates nor takes risks is likely to fail in the long run. A good leader will step out of the safe zone for a good idea.\n\nLearn from your mistakes\nLeaders slip up. Use your mistakes as a steppingstone for improving your leadership skills.\n\nExhibit leadership traits\nA good leader is usually passionate about the organization and his or her work, exudes confidence in his or her abilities, can organizes and makes sense of complex situations, maintains high standards and inspires others to do the same, can motivate and inspire employees, and is generally looked up to as a person of vision.\n\nDevelop a leadership style that works for your team \n\"Situational leadership,\" one of the key management theories, is based on the idea that a leader should choose his style based on the willingness and ability of the group to accomplish its goals. If the group is unwilling and unable, the leader should be extremely hands-on, providing a lot of help, structure, direction and encouragement to the group. If the group is willing but unable, the leader can be more of a coach, providing direction, guidance and inspiration. If the group is willing and able, the leader can be more of a delegator. If the group is unwilling but able, the leader should focus on building relationships and motivating employees. These are merely guidelines. A leader must read the group, understand what it needs to succeed and how to make that happen, and then do it.\n\nPractice makes (close to) perfect\nBecoming an effective leader takes practice. Work on your skills. Seek feedback so you can improve. Try new methods when something doesn't work. The more you work on becoming an effective leader, the more likely you are to get there.\n"

			"body": "A remarkable amount of time, effort, and money has been devoted to the study of leadership. Despite all this research, there is little agreement about exactly what leadership is.\n\nStill, people know effective leadership when they see it. And while great leaders may sometimes be born that way, there are certain traits that great leaders share in common that anyone can practice and adopt to become more effective.\n\nWhat qualities are those? Well, to be a highly effective leader, you must ...\n\n... inspire action.\ninspiration, vision, optimistic, confident\n\n\nTry to paint a vision of the future that inspires your people to do whatever it takes to get there. The best leaders also clear away the organizational roadblocks that constrain employees’ natural creativity and initiative, unleashing a tremendous amount of energy in the process.\n\n... be optimistic.\n\nWe all want to work with and for people who lift us up into the clouds instead of dragging us down into the mud. Make sure to seek out the positives in your people, helping them overcome their own feelings of self-doubt and spreading optimism throughout your organization.\n\n... have integrity.\n\nResearch shows that the top thing that employees want from their leaders is integrity. Be honest, fair, candid and forthright, and treat everyone in the same way that you yourself would want to be treated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWATCH VIDEO\n\nHow to Be Radically Candid With Your Employees\n\n\n\nMORE: \n\nZappos CEO: Why Your Top Priority Should Be Company Culture  \n\n\nSalesforceView\n\nMore Aha!

Support your employees by creating this kind of environment, and it will facilitate their progress toward attaining your organization’s goals.\n\n... have confidence.\n\nHighly effective leaders know deep down inside that they and their team can accomplish anything they set their minds to. Failure is not an option. Tentative leaders make for tentative employees. If you’re confident, your people will be too.\n\n... communicate.\n\nIn any organization, knowledge is power, and great leaders ensure that every employee, from the very top to the very bottom of the org chart, is provided with complete and up-to-date information about the organization’s goals, performance, successes and failures. To achieve this level of connection, you should also provide ample channels for two-way communication between employees and managers, actively soliciting their ideas for improvement and rewarding employees for submitting them.\n\n... be decisive.\n\nOne of the most basic duties of any leader is to make decisions. Highly effective leaders aren’t afraid to be decisive and to make tough calls quickly when circumstances require it. Once you have all the information you need to make an informed decision, then don’t hesitate--make it. And once you make a decision, then stick with it unless there is a particularly compelling reason for you to change it.\n\nNo matter what type of organization or industry you're in, it's possible to become a more effective leader, inspiring your people to give their very best every day of the week. Make a point of practicing these 7 leadership traits, and you will be a highly effective leader too.\n"

The students then move to Los Angeles, CA, during the second year of the program to apply these skills in required nearly full-time internships or employment (4 days per week) while taking coursework taught by professionals in the entertainment field.\n\nMEIM students blend their classroom experience with real world application of their skills by:\n• Interning or working (if desired) on a part-time basis during their first year of school in Pittsburgh\n• completing the required full-time internship over the summer\n• working as an intern on a required nearly full-time basis during the second year of school in Los Angeles\n• completing a comprehensive team-based project (Capstone) for an entertainment client in year two\n• attending film festivals and conferences throughout both years of the program\n\nStudents can leverage a series of opportunities to optimize their graduate school experience, providing them with a competitive advantage in the job market upon graduation.\n\nDuring the School Year\n\nYear 1 (Pittsburgh)\n\nIn the Region:  The optional First-Year Practicum enables students enrolled in the MEIM program to work part-time (10-12 hours per week) for off-campus organizations while attending school on a full-time basis. Working in the community enables students to put their skills into practice, while enhancing their resume. Eligible US citizens who work for public and non-profit organizations are often eligible to be paid through the Federal Community Service Work Study program.\n\nOn-Campus: In addition to off-campus work opportunities, there are a variety of positions available on campus for MEIM students (regardless of citizenship) to pursue:\n• MEIM students can work as Research Assistants with our faculty and within our many research centers on topics.\n• Depending on their background and schedule, some MEIM students can work as Teaching Assistants for courses at Heinz College.\n\n \n\nSummer Internships\n\nMEIM students are required to complete a summer internship between their second and third semesters. The majority of our MEIM students complete their summer internship in New York City or Los Angeles, though other US cities are also acceptable.\n\nYear 2 (Los Angeles)\n\nThe Second-Year Practicum (REQUIRED FOR ALL MEIM STUDENTS) is an immersion in the heart of the entertainment industry, providing the students with a critical platform for showcasing their knowledge, skills and experience. Students are required to intern approximately 30 hours per week (or a minimum of 300 hours a semester) while in Los Angeles.\n\nCapstone Projects\n\nA key feature of the MEIM second-year curriculum is the Capstone Project. This yearlong course goes further than a traditional thesis by giving students the opportunity to work on a topical applied research project under the direction and guidance of a marquee entertainment company. The Capstone project offers students the opportunity to apply and demonstrate their analytical and practical management skills in relation to a specific concept or issue while addressing and deepening their understanding of the opportunities, challenges and issues the entertainment industry faces on a daily basis.\n\nThis Capstone Project embraces four educational goals that synthesize the Heinz College experience and apply it to the analysis of complex issues:\n• Develop problem structuring and solving skills;\n• Develop project management, teamwork, and communication skills;\n• Provide an experience that integrates and synthesizes core coursework;\n• Provide a real world organizational experience.\n\nFilm Festivals\n\nAll students in the program attend the South By Southwest Interactive Conference & Film Festival (SXSW) in the first year of the program and Sundance Film Festival in the second year of the program. The past few years, the MEIM program has also sponsored some students to attend Cannes Film Festival in France. While not everyone in the program attends Cannes, students can apply for a partial scholarship to the festival. Seminars and networking events are scheduled at the festivals to increase student-learning opportunities.\n"

His discussion centres on the kinds of souls possessed by different kinds of living things, distinguished by their different operations. Thus plants have the capacity for nourishment and reproduction, the minimum that must be possessed by any kind of living organism. Lower animals have, in addition, the powers of sense-perception and self-motion (action) Humans have all these as well as intellect.\n\n\n \n\n\n \"Expositio et quaestiones\" in Aristoteles De Anima (Jean Buridan, c. 1362)\nAristotle holds that the soul (psyche, ψυχή) is the form, or essence of any living thing; that it is not a distinct substance from the body that it is in. That it is the possession of soul (of a specific kind) that makes an organism an organism at all, and thus that the notion of a body without a soul, or of a soul in the wrong kind of body, is simply unintelligible. (He argues that some parts of the soul—the intellect—can exist without the body, but most cannot.) It is difficult to reconcile these points with the popular picture of a soul as a sort of spiritual substance \"inhabiting\" a body. Some commentators have suggested that Aristotle's term soul is better translated as lifeforce.[1]\n"

Kelly and his way of writing melodies that hover between speech and song, asymmetrical and syncopated.\"[77] While nostalgia, ULTRA featured both original music by Ocean and tracks relying on sampled melodies,[78] channel ORANGE showcased Ocean as the primary musical composer, of which music journalist Robert Christgau opines, \"when he's the sole composer Ocean resists making a show of himself—resists the dope hook, the smart tempo, the transcendent falsetto itself.\"[79]\n\nOcean's lyrics deal with themes of love, longing, misgiving,[77] and nostalgia.[80] His debut single \"Novacane\" juxtaposes the numbness and artificiality of a sexual relationship with that of mainstream radio,[77] while \"Voodoo\" merges themes of spirituality and sexuality,[81] and is an eccentric take on such subject matter common in R&B.[76] The latter song was released by Ocean on his Tumblr account and references both the traditional spiritual \"He's Got the Whole World in His Hands\" and the female anatomy in its chorus: \"she's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit / he's got the whole wide world in his pants / he wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band / then put the whole wide world on her hands / she's got the whole wide world in her hands / he's got the whole wide world in his hands.\"[76][82] Certain songs on channel ORANGE allude to Ocean's experience with unrequited love.[7] Culture critic Nelson George asserts that, along with Miguel, Ocean has \"staked out ground where [he is] not competing with those hit-driven [commercial R&B] acts\" and is \"cultivating a sound that balances adult concerns with a sense of young men trying to understand their own desires (an apt description of Ocean, particularly).\"[83]\n\nOcean describes himself as \"a baritone, with tenor moments.\"[84] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone calls him a torch singer due to \"his feel for romantic tragedy, unfurling in slow-boiling ballads\".[85] Ocean's stage presence during live shows is often low-key.[86][87][88]\n"

This is a complete avoidance of the traditional musical hierarchy. Ocean has a young, rabid fanbase that primarily interacts with him online; he doesn’t need to distribute physical copies of albums to thousands of stores like Adele or Taylor Swift. He is part of a small club of superstars who don’t need the label system, and who have the leverage to do deals with streaming services instead of re-signing their contracts. And that’s scary for music labels.\n\nAccording to a newsletter from music industry insider and critic Bob Lefsetz, Universal Music Group, Ocean’s former label, has banned exclusives on the heels of the release of Blonde. If true, the ramifications of that change could be huge on the labels’ stable of artists — most notably with Drake, who has an exclusive deal with Apple Music, having released his last three projects through the service.\n\nWhy the dramatic move from UMG? A-list artists bring in a large chunk of revenue for the labels, and allow them to lock up younger artists who probably won’t move records on their first release with advances that they otherwise couldn’t afford. If those superstar artists leave the label system altogether for streaming services, it could throw a wrench into the already delicate financials of the music industry and cause a power shift that the industry hasn’t experienced since iTunes hit the scene in 2003.\n"

Trend following can be counter-productive, since it has often led to a backlash. Towards the end of the life of each wave, record companies have found themselves faced with enormous losses, as consumers' tastes changed.

			"body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n\n81\n\n\nJust two days after Frank Ocean’s Blonde, one of the biggest releases of the year, was released on Apple’s iTunes, Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group and widely regarded as the most powerful executive in the music industry, has reportedly ordered the company’s labels to stop the practice of making “exclusive” distribution deals with streaming services.\n\n\nAccording to Bob Lefsetz, author of an influential music industry newsletter, Grainge sent out a company-wide email on Monday. UMG, which boasted seven of 2015’s 10 best-selling albums and 38.5% of the year’s recorded-music sales, will be the first major label to ban the practice, which many feel has begun to diminish rather than enhance the way music is distributed and consumed. \n\nThe directive will affect dozens of bands under the UMG umbrella, including all five of this year’s album of the year Grammy nominees: Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, the Weeknd, Chris Stapleton and Alabama Shakes.\n\nThe practice of artists offering exclusives to competing streaming and download services, including Apple and Tidal, has been gaining traction this year. Both Beyoncé and Rihanna launched their recent albums through Tidal, the streaming service part-owned by Beyoncé’s husband, Jay Z. \n\n\n\n\n\nFrank Ocean: Endless first-listen review – brilliantly confounding \n\n          \n\nFrank Ocean’s visual album mixes the avant garde with the accessible – but is it the precursor to an imminent pop collection? \n\n\n  \n \nRead more \n  \nThe ultra-hyped Frank Ocean release coming exclusively through Apple, coupled with a deal announced earlier this month between Apple and Cash Money Records, whose artists include Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Young Money and Birdman, appears to have been sufficient to provoke label executives to action. \n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nLefsetz, like many others in the business, believes making exclusive distribution deals is anti-competitive and ultimately harms the consumer and the artist.\n\nHe says the Cupertino hardware giant whose music arm, Apple Music, is steered by former Universal head Jimmy Iovine, should be investigated by the government over anti-trust concerns “because there’s a conspiracy between Apple Music and the industry to change the game, to get everybody to pay for a subscription by putting hit content behind a paywall”.\n\n\nBut, he continues, the truth is few care. “Most people don’t give a crap about the new Frank Ocean album. We’ve got an industry that promotes marginal products that appeal to few and makes them unavailable to most people? That’s hysterical!”\n\nUnhappiness over Apple’s exclusive control of the Frank Ocean release comes a year after Taylor Swift wrote an open letter to Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, finding it to be “shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company” that the firm was refusing to pay artists streaming revenue during its free, three-month trial period. Apple ultimately backed down.\n\nPreviously, Apple had been forced into an embarrassing apology after loading half a billion Apple iTunes users with the latest U2 album during an iPhone launch. The download, for which Apple paid the band a reputed $60m, proved to be a PR disaster for the company and the band. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHow Beyoncé's Lemonade became a pop culture phenomenon \n\n\n\n\n  \n \nRead more \n  \nThe company’s dispute with Swift predates the current trend for “exclusives” among streaming services – often accused of paying pitiful rates to copyright holders – as part of an effort to drive up subscriptions. For some artists, the war for subscribers has proved highly profitable even if, as many argue, the services ultimately serve to restrict rather than enhance broader consumer appeal. \n\nLast year, Apple paid the Canadian rapper Drake a reported $19m for an exclusive deal – a figure Apple has since disputed – to steal him away from signing with Jay Z’s Tidal. “I think that’s just his competitive nature, and I don’t know if he’s looking at the bigger picture: that it’s not about me and it’s not about him. It’s about the future of the music business,” Jay Z later said of Iovine. \n\nBut as the battle for artists, especially those from the hip-hop/R&B world, heats up, can Grainge – recently named the music business’s most powerful executive – or any other label rival hope to compete? \n\n“Upfront money talks,” points out one former record company head, cautioning that the deals work for the streaming services but not necessarily for artists and labels. \n\nBut with industry leader Spotify competing against the deep-pocketed tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon, hungry for market share, the stage is set for a new showdown over control as streaming becomes the dominant means of distribution.\n\nTo Lefsetz, exclusives represent a misreading of the market that will ultimately alienate consumers. “Apple Music is a me-too product that works badly that’s locked behind a paywall and the music industry wants it to be the dominant platform so the fan is squeezed and indie acts are pushed down to the bottom where they belong.”\n\nBut as the music industry awaits confirmation that UMG is pulling out of streaming exclusives, Lefsetz is also taking artists who sign exclusive distribution deals to task. \n\n“Shame on you Frank, and shame on everybody else who takes money from Apple and screws fans. There’s enough money in music without taking every last buck, and the joke is on you, for thinking so short term, you want your music available to everybody, because in these days of information overload we need nobody, everybody is superfluous, you don’t want to enter the marketplace with one hand tied behind your back,” he wrote.\n"

			"body": "Music Industry Hits Pause on Exclusive Album-Release Deals\n\nMusic Industry Hits Pause on Exclusive Album-Release Deals\n\nBY Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.\n— 5:44 AM ET 09/08/2016\n\n\n\nThe music industry's tradition of releasing albums via only one particular retailer or online service--often the one that pays for the privilege--endured through physical discs, digital downloads and into the streaming era. But at some record companies, the practice of granting \"exclusives\" now appears to be headed the way of the eight-track tape.\n\nThe music companies now realize that restricting desirable albums to one online service could limit the overall growth of subscription music--viewed by labels as key to their own long-term survival. In their place, streaming-music services are scrambling to hire well-connected \"ambassadors\" who can help them line up artists to make playlists, videos and other promotional materials to differentiate themselves.\n\nSince launching a year ago, subscription-streaming services Tidal and Apple Inc.'s Apple Music have been paying record labels for the exclusive rights to feature music from a range of artists to quickly attract subscribers. The deal terms vary but usually include a modest upfront fee and, more significantly, promises of millions of dollars of marketing via advertisements on the streaming service, TV or billboards. Both music services are trying to catch up to Spotify AB, which has been in business a decade longer and offers a free tier that they don't.\n\nSubscription-streaming services generated $2 billion last year for the $15 billion global record business, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.\n\nBut after watching Apple Music and Tidal battle it out for exclusive album releases over the past year, and attracting just over 20 million subscribers between them, some major record-label executives now fret that limiting new releases to one service--even for a week or two--could be costing them, despite the support they get for the exclusive deals. They worry that limiting an album's availability during its buzziest period reduces listening and frustrates subscribers to services that don't have the album.\n\n\"All the exclusives feel erratic at the moment,\" said Steve Cooper, chief executive of Access Industries' Warner Music Group in a recent interview with Music Business Worldwide, an online publication. \"That's confusing to fans, and that's not good for the industry.\"\n\nThe record industry is counting on revenue from subscription streaming to eventually replace falling CD and download sales, and is wary of making moves that could stifle the growth of the nascent and fragmented market, which counted 68 million paying subscribers world-wide last year, according to the IFPI. In an email to some subordinates late last month, Lucian Grainge, chairman of Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group, indicated that the record company should generally avoid long-term exclusive releases on particular streaming services from now on. The email was reported earlier by music-industry blogger Bob Lefsetz.\n\nR&B artist Frank Ocean, formerly signed to Universal, released his latest album, \"Blonde,\" exclusively on Apple Music through his own independent label, a move Universal likely wouldn't approve now without a more nuanced plan to widen the release relatively quickly, or at least broaden the album release in markets where Apple Music's reach is limited, according to a person familiar with the matter. Depending on the artist, even one week on a single streaming service alone could be costly, this person added--especially given that CDs remain the predominant format in some of the world's top music markets, such as Japan, Germany and France.\n\nStill, Mr. Ocean managed to top the charts by selling nearly 300,000 copies of the album in the U.S. during its first week on Apple (  AAPL \n \n \n\nLoading... \nLoading...\n   \n \n   ), which hired two antipiracy firms to patrol the internet for unauthorized copies, a person familiar with the matter said. Shortly after, Apple (  AAPL \n \n \n\nLoading... \nLoading...\n   \n \n   ) featured its third exclusive release from Sony Corp.'s Epic Records: rapper Travis Scott's new album, suggesting that the practice hasn't been written off across the board.\n\nMany record labels still support another form of exclusivity: releasing music to paid streaming services before it is available via free, ad-supported ones. But such decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe pullback on exclusives means streaming services must fight harder to stand out from the pack. To do they are courting big-name music acts to make playlists, host radio shows, and create short films and art projects, while in exchange helping to fund the artists' marketing campaigns that include splashy TV ads.\n\nLast month Pandora Media Inc. said it had hired Questlove, a producer and drummer for The Roots, to serve as the internet radio company's first \"artist ambassador,\" while Spotify several months ago created a similar role for Troy Carter, a prominent artist manager whose former clients include Lady Gaga.\n\nFor rapper Gucci Mane's album \"Everybody Looking,\" released in July, Spotify footed the bill for much of the album's promotion, from billboard and TV commercials to ice cream trucks--a nod to the ice cream cone tattoo on his face--in New York and Atlanta touting that the album was available on the music-streaming service.\n\nDespite the investment, Mr. Carter still pushed to allow the album to debut on other services at the same time as Spotify, because he said he believes \"exclusives are bad\" and hurt artists as well as the industry. In exchange for the funding, Gucci Mane is now effectively helping promote Spotify by association, \"but in a nonexclusive way,\" Mr. Carter said.\n\nWhen artists sign exclusive deals with Spotify's rivals, meanwhile, Spotify tends to not promote their songs on playlists it curates in-house for at least several weeks, people familiar with the matter said.\n\n"

			"body": "School: Wake Forest\t\nProgram: MA in Management\t\nDeadline: 2-6, 3-6\nThis section includes three scenarios and two free-response questions that are required for all MA applicants. As a guide, your responses to the five questions listed below should be limited to one paragraph (approx. 250 words max.) \nScenario #1\nIt is Wednesday afternoon of final exam week and you just completed your second to last final. Your last final, statistics, is tomorrow morning at 11:00 a.m. You currently have an 89% average in the course and want to use the term-end to earn a solid A. You plan to study for the stats final from 6:00-10:00 p.m. this evening with a couple of your classmates who are struggling in the course. In fact, your two classmates need to get at least a C+ to pass the course. You are getting ready to go workout before the study session when your best friend calls and invites you to attend a concert of your favorite band that evening. You attempted to get tickets earlier but the concert was sold out. Your best friend tells you that he/she won the tickets in a contest and that a person you have been very interested in dating is also attending the concert and would like you to come. Your best friend also reminds you this is the last opportunity to hang-out before he/she departs for year-long study abroad in Singapore. You realize this is a once in a life-time opportunity to see your favorite band in concert, share the experience with your best friend, and spend the evening with a person you would like to date. The stars have aligned.\n* Scenario #1 Question: What do you do and why? Be sure to discuss the reasons behind youractions\n(Notes: adjust meeting time with my classmates first---win-win. If not, go study with classmates. Because this is a “promise” with classmates and I need an A. )\n\n\nScenario #2\nYou are halfway through your midterm exam when you notice a close friend to your right consistently staring at his arm. As you look closer, you notice that he rolled up his left sleeve and has notes taped to his arm similar to what quarterbacks in football use to call plays. Your friend continues to use the reference notes taped to his arm to answer exam questions. You have no doubt that your friend is cheating. You know the honor code states a student will not lie, cheat, or steal or tolerate those that do. He has placed you in an awkward situation.\t\n* Scenario #2 Question: Please discuss what action (s), if any, you would you take and why you would take them\n\nScenario #3\nIt is Thursday afternoon and your team has to turn in its written case study tomorrow morning by 8:00 a.m. Your team has met over the past two weeks completing the analysis for the case. All that is left is to determine the key recommendations and insights gained  for the case. Your group is scheduled to meet at 4:00 p.m. to complete the case. You are excited to finish and meet your friends at 8:00 p.m. to attend a concert. The final team meeting goes well and you all generate superb recommendations and insights. During the meeting, you noticed that the teammate responsible for typing and formatting the final report seemed distracted and emotionally upset. After the meeting ends at 6:00 p.m., while everyone else departs, you approach this teammate to ask him if he is all right. Michael tells you that his language professor notified him that he was failing the class and unless Michael earned a B on the exam tomorrow, he would fail the entire course. Michael states that he needs to put in about eight more hours of studying to do well on the exam. Further, Michael informs you that if he fails the course, his scholarship is at risk.\t\n* Scenario #3 Question: What would you do in this situation and why? Be sure to discuss the reasons behind your actions\n\nQuestion #4\n* Question #4: Share an experience where you demonstrated integrity (i.e., being honest in both word and deed—acting in accordance with one’s and/or the organization’s values, and being transparent about thoughts and feelings). Be sure to discuss what drives you to maintain integrity\n\nQuestion #5\n* Question #5: Share an experience where you demonstrated openness to feedback (i.e., one’s degree of willingness to seek out and embrace new experiences, ideas, knowledge and perspectives) that stung and how you used the feedback to grow. Be sure to address how you maintain your openness.\n"

As a result, navigating a career requires you to be adaptable. Should the immediate goals that you provided above not materialize, what alternative directions have you considered?\n(Note: As noted above, arts management is more about nonprofit area. However, I believe having a comprehensive cognize of the business world is crucial today. It will be much more helpful for me to know both profit and nonprofit thing.

Your complete list should not exceed 2 pages.\nQuestion: The \"Team Fuqua\" spirit and community is one of the things that set the Fuqua experience apart, and it is a concept that extends beyond the student body to include faculty, staff, and administration. When a new person joins the Admissions Team, we ask that person to share with everyone in the office a list of \"25 Random Things About Yourself.\" As an Admissions team, we already know the new hire's professional and academic background, so learning these \"25 Random Things\" helps us to get to know someone's personality, background, special talents, and more.\nIn this spirit, the Admissions Committee also wants to get to know you—beyond the professional and academic achievements listed in your resume and transcript. You can share with us important life experiences, your likes/dislikes, hobbies, achievements, fun facts, or anything that helps us understand what makes you who you are.\n(Notes: international, love arts, love music, willing to try something new, pay attention to details, always do rigorous, want to carve out my career, leadership, can play a traditional Chinese instrument professionally, love to travel, enjoy personal time, love to chat with friends, love extremely hot & spicy food, high-demanding on appearance, willing to share my country’s culture with others, love peace, practice dance while I am in a bad mood, first person in my family study abroad,love to live in a metropolis, plan to settle in a small and quite county when I am elder, well-bred, always be rational, the liberal, treat everyone around me well, like photography…….)\n\nRequired Essay 2\nInstructions: From the two options below, choose only one of the questions to answer. Your response to either essay question should be no more than 500 words, with a font size of no less than 10-point. Respond fully and concisely using 1.5 line spacing. Do not copy the essay question in the document you upload with your application.\nOption 1 Question:For our MMS: FOB class, the Admissions team is looking for students who are eager to engage with, and learn from, their classmates. This learning takes place both inside and outside the classroom, as extracurricular engagement is an important part of the MMS: FOB experience.  Describe how you would plan to be engaged outside of the classroom, and how your unique perspective, experiences, and passions will add to the MMS community.\nOption 2 Question:The MMS: FOB program is developing leaders who are able to effect change in the communities of which they are a part. Share a time that you were able to make a change in your community: at school, at work, or at home. How will you use the lessons you learned and skills you developed from this experience as an MMS: FOB student?\n"
