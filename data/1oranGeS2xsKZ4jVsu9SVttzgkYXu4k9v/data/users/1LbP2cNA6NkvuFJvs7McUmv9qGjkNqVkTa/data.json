Now, allow me to show once again how the end justifies the means: If a computer were to be trained to successfully generate new CP content without the need of true CP training data then that would mean that LE agencies could have a virtually limitless source of bait for pedo-criminals.

I'm seeing among 3-4M for most vids and tears of steel one downloads 7M, probably is a fixed amount of time for each video but if your catalog grows it will download the start of all those videos. Unacceptable!!\n\nI think it may come from the usage of all those video players (I don't like them that way, but it is your zite after all).
