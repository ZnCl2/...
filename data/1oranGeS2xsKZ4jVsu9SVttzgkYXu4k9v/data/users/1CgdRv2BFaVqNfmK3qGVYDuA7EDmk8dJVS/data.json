You need your almonds to be active while watching it though.\n**Brazil** (1985) is an amazing dystopian sci-fi film by Terry Gilliam. Its striking visual choices have inspired among others Jean-Pierre Jeunet in his french movies *Delicatessen* (1991) and *La Cité des Enfants Perdus* (1995), worth watching with subtitles, they're some of the best French cinema has to offer.\nI don't know in how far the following have a cult following, but movie critics really didn't like them when they came out: **The Shining** (1980), **The General** (1926), **Stalker** (1979, Russian), **They Live** (1988), **Demolition Man** (1993)\nSome other ones I'd really recommend: **Akira** (1988, Animated), **Blade Runner** (1982), **Falling Down** (1993), **Twelve Monkeys** (1995)",

I would say ZeroNet is not without it's own problems, certainly with scalability. The problem is that we haven't been able to test it a lot. I'd say the (0)8chan influx showed that it can't handle active sites with a lot of peers well in its current state, but from the code I've read I'm confident it's something we can improve upon. It will take some experimenting though.",
