But \"у\" shouldn't be used in russian (though some other cyrillic-based languages have different pronunciation) transcription for romaji \"w\"; first of all, it wouldn't be read as diphthong, because russian doesn't have diphthongs starting with u. And secondly, it would introduce ambiguity between うあ (уа/ua) and わ/は (ва/wa).\n\"дж\" is the best approximation of \"j\", though some russian japanese transcription systems use \"дз\" (dz) instead for consonant in じ.\n\nHearing \"hard vowel\" about [iotated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iotation) ones is kinda painful. Usually the sound they make in syllables (when \"й\" (i/j/y) sound is not pronounced) is described as being \"softer\". Anyway, in russian there would be no official difference between чо and чё or джо/джё. But i still have my tastes ;) because there's theoretical difference following from other pronunciation rules.\n\nYet another difference is that you used \"з\" (z) instead of either \"э\" or \"е\".",

The way copyright laws and copyleft strategy work, it doesn't make sense to create competing incompatible licenses. Technically, there are a couple of other copyleft licenses that are compatible with gpl, but the possible benefits of using them are likely to be outweighted by their obscurity and possible confusions.\n\nThere is one other notable copyleft license, which has valid usecases: CC-BY-SA. From 4.0 version, it's one-way compatible to GPL, although it generally isn't meant for code and it does not protect source code (so people can make closed-source derivatives, even if they still have to be licensed under CC-BY-SA).\n\n>Some of you don't like GPL\n\nPeople who don't like GPL tend to also not like copyleft in general ;)\n\n>Do people ever put their projects under Public Domain?\n\nSome people do. In general, it might be better to use CC0 or similar in order to ensure compatibility with copyright laws in various countries.\n\n>I know I could draft my own license\n\nThat's a path to obscurity. Makes it harder for people to understand whether they can use your code and on what conditions. Also, copyleft licenses are generally incompatible with each other, unless specifically made so.\n\n\nMy personal preferences of licenses is\n\n- GPLv3+ for most code (possibly v2+ if there are essential compatibility issues; possibly LGPL, although i don't think i'd ever use it myself; then there is also AGPL, but i feel that full compatibility with GPL code is usually more important)\n\n- CC-BY-SA for works of art and other non-code content (although i may consider GPL if said work uses a lot of code for its final form generation)\n\n- PD/CC0 for its ultimate anti-copyright spirit or for convenience\n\n- Apache 2.0 for a \"lax\" non-copyleft license (compared to other such licenses, it offers some protection against patent abuse), although i'd never use it myself anyway (tbh, i don't see much point in this middle option between copyleft and public domain)",

People may bitch about \"free speech\" or something, but by and large they care much more about their wallet rather than any ethical values. Until they are personally banned they'll keep trying to keep the income flow\n  \nAnd it's really hard to imagine proper p2p platform ever getting comparable amount of ad revenue. And it's hard to bring users who are willing to sponsor you, too\n  \nWith all that said, in order to make someone make a move, you should make them care and engaged, not just give reasonable logical arguments",
