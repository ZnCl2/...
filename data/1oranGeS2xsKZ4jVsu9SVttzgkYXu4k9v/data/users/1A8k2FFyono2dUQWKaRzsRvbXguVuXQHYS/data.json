And if somebody did it, nobody would care, because we'd have no Moral compass.\nWe also have the freedom to criticize certain behaviors, as freedom goes both ways. Some people are under the impression that, because they CAN do something, it means they SHOULD do it, and that nobody can say a thing about it, otherwise it is Censorship. So do we have the freedom to talk about immoral behavior that we dislike and disapprove, and to boycott it as possible.\nNot only that, if we want this place to be functional, we also have the responsibility to criticize some sorts of behavior and to not allow this to be a place of disorder and disgraceful content.",
