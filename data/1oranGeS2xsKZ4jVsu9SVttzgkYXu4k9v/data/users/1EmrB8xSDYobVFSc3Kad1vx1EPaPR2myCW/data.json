For instance, Taylor Swift makes country music, where \"country\" is the *genre*. On ZeroLSTN, the song's genre defines where the song file is stored. Soon, I'll add playlists which will let you define a list of songs which you can send other user's which can include any song from any genre, but that feature isn't ready yet. Is a profile where you can share your playlists/uploaded songs also something you guys would want?",

Is there anything special I have to do to tell it to stream BigFiles? Either that or I need to tell the <audio> tag to force playing even though the file isn't fully downloaded.",
