Surprisingly, the Android version works ok, but I've never been able to get the iOS version to work. I'm not sure why they just don't use bluetooth, it seems like it would be a much better option to just push the pictures to other enabled devices.\n\nI do remember way back when with Blackberry devices, those did it right. Want to transfer a video from one to another? Just bluetooth. ",
