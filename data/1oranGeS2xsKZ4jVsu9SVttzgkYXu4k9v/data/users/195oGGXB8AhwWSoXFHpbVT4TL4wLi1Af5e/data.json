If you do the scaling in Gimp, you can choose between several different algorithms and in my opinion most are better than the one ZeroMe uses.\n\nBut of course when it comes to visual appearance, everything is subjective and a matter of personal preference.",

If you just embed the image, there's no mechanism to ask the user to add the site in order to display the image.\n\nCould [IFS](/12MVkvYGcRW6u2NYbpfwVad1oQeyG4s9Er/) possibly work for this purpose? It supports public upload of images, direct linking, and quite many active users already have the IFS CDN site added. If you are creating your own site, you could probably even add a dependency on the IFS CDN merger site, so that it is automatically added when someone visits the site. For sites you do not own, but allows embedding of images (for example [Unlimit Talk](/1HMLvnRWViMnuvZc5LK4Dm86sZNcSH1jdh/), are there others?), I don't know how to ensure the site is added though...",
