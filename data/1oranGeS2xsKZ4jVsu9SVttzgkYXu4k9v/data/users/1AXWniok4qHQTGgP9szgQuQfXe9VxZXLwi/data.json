He publicly destroyed all his chemical weapons. Assad and Syria are kicking rebel terrorist and invader #Ass. Personally I think limited chemical and biologic weapons are an acceptable defensive deterrents and options against foreign invaders. But not on your own people the way Israel gases #Palestinians in their own country of historic #Palestine! :-) ",
