It's not surprising it's too similar in every aspect since their bloods are sharing the same root from the beginning of their civilizations.\n\nWriting Japanese language in Korean characters is straightforward. So is vice versa, though Japanese characters are lack of a few syllables. And even grammatically they're almost the same. \n\nBut at a certain point (AD 1446), a man invented Hangul. lol.

They should have offered a listing or serializing sounds method (ex. ㅎㅏㄴ). Another is that they should have made an internet community like Zeronet to make the natives to type and read the useful information and news among them frequently. \nAnyway, Indonesian government admits only latin characters in every official writing as a law, so there's no way to make 한글 as an official character or teaching course in that place.",

The user of the book should not fall into the vague concepts but should exactly use it as a fortune telling, though actually doing so is the violation of the rule of the spiritual world. Sadly most politicians and religious leaders are still heavily depends on the fortune telling such as I Ching, Tarot and astrology as if those strong people like Wilhelm had done before.\n\nFor ur reference, TCC or even comic books could be used as fortune-telling medium like I Ching by choosing random page number with bamboo fortune sticks, and translate what the chosen page describes.

It's very unique characteristic of I Ching among other clumsy materials I mentioned before. That's why I Ching is so popular across the world.\n\nBut one should not be trapped in its beauty.
