In compiled languages, a constant will be replaced at compile-time and its use will allow for other optimizations like dead code removal to further increase the runtime efficiency of the code. Recent (loosely used term) JavaScript engines actually compile JS code to get better performance, so using the const keyword would inform them that the optimizations described above are possible and should be done. This results in better performance.\n\nBut... Const is an ES6 thing, and it seems [Babel can't keep it when converts the js to ES5](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40787268/why-babel-does-not-convert-a-const-to-an-unwritable-property-in-a-object)\n> Well, there are no consts in ES5, so there's no way for Babel to compile it into some kind of unwritable variable.

In Hungary, a monthly internet subscription costs around 4,000-10,000 HUF ($17-$41), so it could really put a constraint on different service providers, especially for streaming media. This kind of tax could set back the country's technological development by some 20 years — to the pre-internet age. As a side note, the Hungarian government's budget is running at a serious deficit. The internet tax is officially expected to bring in about 20 billion HUF in income, though a quick look at the BIX (Budapest Internet Exchange) and a bit of math suggests a better estimate of the income would probably be an order of magnitude higher.\n> - October 22, 2014\n\n[The discussion of this topic on Diaspora](https://pod.geraspora.de/posts/8c03de903c360132d00c543d7ed6cc36) is also pretty interesting.\n\n",

Throughout the 1920s, the United States Post Office Department burned copies of the novel.[40]\n> ...\n> ... The publisher contested the seizure, and in United States v. One Book Called Ulysses, U.S. District Judge John M. Woolsey ruled that the book was not pornographic and therefore could not be obscene,[41] a decision that was called \"epoch-making\" by Stuart Gilbert.[42] The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling in 1934.[43] The US therefore became the first English-speaking country where the book was freely available. Although Ulysses was never banned in Ireland by the Censorship of Publications Board, the government used a customs loophole which prevented it from being allowed into Ireland.[44][35][45] It was first openly available in Ireland in the 1960s.[46]",

I tried assigning `date_add` to the timestamp of feed item, `date_add` was `Null` ([data.json](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/tmpdata/1BaJkZ4ht15DoJdrKFH8HrwMi8YiKQDUoA/data.json)). I guess it may because the dates of feed are too old, likely older than the created date of my ZeroMe account and test hub, therefore they counldn't be added. So I also tried using the current time, because the script was too fast and all the posts were assigned with same `date` XD ([data.json](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/tmpdata/1BMGV1ZvWQbj5szkqwg7tk5XjiTmFYXUS6/data.json)), and only one or two items displayed in the datebase, and the `date_add` was still `Null`... I also tried deleting the `user.json`, creating a new ID, signing the test hub itself, publishing to proxy, rebuilding `ZeroMe.db` and the results were same ...\n\nI signed my ZeroMe content.json with code below:\n\n```\n    sign_command_path = SITE_ADDRESS + ' ' + '--inner_path' + ' ' + 'data/users/' + \\\n        AUTH_ADDRESS + '/content.json'\n    siteSign = subprocess.Popen(\"python2 ../zeronet.py siteSign\" + \" \" + sign_command_path,\n            shell=True, stdin=subprocess.PIPE)  # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/163542/python-how-do-i-pass-a-string-into-subprocess-popen-using-the-stdin-argument\n    siteSign.communicate(input=SITEKEY)[0]\n```\n\nBtw, adding `follow_id` works.",

When another user has read his last feeds, normally s/he won't scroll deeper to search for feeds that s/he hasn't read.\nBut if a user posts, replies many when s/he is offline, then lots of posts will suddenly appear to other users' timeline, which is quite freaky.\nSo we may need to add another feature, like feeds are still sorted by timestamp, but provide an option/tab to allow user to sort feed by publish_timestamp, useful when the user know some of his friends are outdoors or have bad network and sometimes post offline.",

You may get a high salary and bonus, but you probably don’t get fulfilment from your job. Having a side gig – in an area you’re passionate about – allows you to get some more meaning in your life.\n> 3. You mix with different people\n> One of the main advantages of an additional career is that you get to talk to people who you wouldn’t come across in banking.

Your banking career improves\n> Your side gig can help you become a better banker. Because of my work at Renmin University, clients regarded me not just as a banker but as a teacher, which is a respected position in China. Some of my students even referred their bosses to me. Your second job can get you a foot in the door with people who would otherwise be tricky to meet. If you own a restaurant on the side, for example, host special meals for potential clients.\n> 5.
