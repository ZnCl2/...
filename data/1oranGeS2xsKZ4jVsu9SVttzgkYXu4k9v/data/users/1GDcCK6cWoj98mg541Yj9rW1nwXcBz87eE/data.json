On top of that 0-gallery and 1+gallery use basically the same database structure and are fully compatible.\nAs Lotaplot said the error is related to the number of variables in a query, not to the amount of entries in the database. 1+Gallery and it's hubs should not be producing such ridiculously long queries. My guess is that this happened when you clicked `Help seed optional files`, whereupon ZeroNet helpfully sent sqlite a very long query with all of the files you wanted to add. Sqlite looked at the list and said: \"I'm not adding all that hentai in my christian database, but feed it to me in smaller queries and maybe I'll accept\". Just a guess though. @Nofish: how close am I?\n\nAlso 1+Gallery allows you to add favorites now :-) need to select a user/identity first though.",

			"body": "@Nofish: I wrote it that way (each gallery has a content.json) to allow large hubs to only sign the galleries they altered/added instead of one giant content.json, which could take ages, although I can think of a couple of other ways to implement it (eg. combining galleries in clumps, by upload date etc.), but that's really just kicking the stone down the road, and the problem will resurface when a hub reaches xK galleries (sqlite has a 999 limit iirc) it might also break compat with 0-gallery, which I'd rather not.",
