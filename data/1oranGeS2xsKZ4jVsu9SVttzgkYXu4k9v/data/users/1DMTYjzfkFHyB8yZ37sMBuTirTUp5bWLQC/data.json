Never been much into mFPS's but found a pair of clip-ons for cheap and thought why not give it a go, I love FPS's on the PC.\n\n\nFirst time trying PUBG Mobile with shoulder buttons, group MVP. Second time trying PUBG Mobile... Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner. Too OP, like having 100% more thumbs. Tried it without the clip-ons and it was horrible compared to keyboard and mouse. Never played it again.\n\n\nI still don't like mFPS, but I loved what those shoulder buttons did for the gameplay.",

Now that computer has an ad-blocker as well.\n\nMore and more YT creators incorporate ads into the video itself, and while some clearly mark it (Lindybeige is a good example), other bake it into their message in such a way that they lose credibility.",
