Researchers notified Intel about the flaws in June. Now, Intel faces a big headache. The vast majority of its CPUs in use today are impacted, and more class action complaints may be filed beyond these three.\n\nThe three complaints also cite suggestions that devices using Intel's CPUs will see significant slowdown as a result of addressing the security flaws. However, that point is in some dispute. In the course of its various public efforts to mitigate damage and address concerns, Intel has publicly said in a statement that these concerns are overblown:\n\nIntel has begun providing software and firmware updates to mitigate these exploits. Contrary to some reports, any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.\n\nGoogle, whose Project Zero team was involved in the initial discovery of the vulnerabilities, seemed to support Intel's claim when it wrote in its security blog about performance on its devices:\n\nThere has been speculation that the deployment of KPTI causes significant performance slowdowns. Performance can vary, as the impact of the KPTI mitigations depends on the rate of system calls made by an application. On most of our workloads, including our cloud infrastructure, we see negligible impact on performance. In our own testing, we have found that microbenchmarks can show an exaggerated impact. Of course, Google recommends thorough testing in your environment before deployment; we cannot guarantee any particular performance or operational impact.\n\nEither way, the costs for Intel after Meltdown and Spectre could be significant. The Guardian consulted sources such as Fort Pitt Capital Group analyst Kim Forrest to paint a picture of what Intel faces. Regardless of the outcome of these class action suits, the paper writes that Intel will likely find itself in a poor bargaining position with its cloud customers and other enterprise partners and that it will likely have to spend more heavily on security in the future.","date_added":1515272034},{"post_id":1515280547,"date_added":1515280295,"meta":"{\"img\":\"900,470,a948a827a17a07c38c8bd17c28c49c27c9cd7ad5ad6ad,001233322345655789585AB5A5849779C54ADE944A5844A5A4\"}"},{"post_id":1515375966,"body":"Hay guiz","date_added":1515375712,"meta":"{\"img\":\"394,700,aa9997544998865765876766444555654332455a9a98a879,012230014560072850964A53875A8B99699CCC9976CC5017970DE76DDEF5\"}"},{"post_id":1515422150,"body":"Modern feminism in the first world focuses exclusively on the first world, then when someone ever mentions third world nations with equal or worse rape culture without being a rebuttal but a completely isolated thread, it actively ignores it or comes out of the woodwork, going out of its way to call that someone a racist/Nazi.\n\nTo actively divert from the rape culture in third world nations with \"racist\" or \"Nazi\" labelling is called Freudian/psychological projection, and racists/Nazis use this all the time.\n\n(drops mic)","date_added":1515421895},{"post_id":1515506748,"body":"I don't see any reason why ZeroNet is not on F-Droid.

I know Kim got extradited on bullshit charges, but his company lives on... Might it be because that would have attracted the attention of Kim Dotcom's enemies in the US or because Kim went on trial in a corrupt court to inevitably be imprisoned? Development would move fast if companies placed their interest in ZeroNet, but I can see another problem with it: A need to make profit. Though, even mega corporations are now invested in open source technology, so are governments and a handful of good-willed organizations. I bet any adversaries to sovereign nations would also kind of ironically have an interest in such technology, even though it mainly brings people around the world together. You'll never see as many Chinese, Russian, and other nationalities so densely coexisting as here talking about pretty much anything, and that's pretty damn awesome by itself. So, going back to the main point: Why isn't there more interest in this from those packing a ton of money and man power? ZeroNet is a web utopia. All I can think is that this makes every corrupt power shake in their tiny boots, fearing greatly that any action taken for or against ZeroNet will spur a rise in popularity or a Streisand Effect, but the US Navy created and open sourced Tor, so there's that, but I look at militaries as neutral since there are good people who are sometimes commanded/herded by corrupt entities. That stands to further reason as to why I would expect more outside investment into ZeroNet's development. The fucking US Navy at the very least should be in on this, following the reason of them having created Tor. I find it strange that this isn't the case.

They're simply humans going about their own lives, and they work jobs that you do when they're old enough, but a few aspire a bit to learn software programming. They go hunting with rifles. They're mostly males, in fact, and they have no shame in that. They only enjoy life, not take away from others. Their parents, my siblings, struggle to keep their homes too. Most of them are children, and they live to laugh at nobody's expense. I don't care if you hate the Rothschilds and Rockefellers. Hate them for what they themselves have done. Hate Israel's human rights violations, those who cause it and those who promote it, not the Israelites who fight against it to defend the Palestinians subjected to the human rights violations. Hate radical Islam, those who promote it and cause violence, not the Muslims who would defend you on the streets and the front line. To every race and religion, there is a bigot in the bunch. Those who aren't bigots or aren't as bad recognize the biggest bigots, call it out, expose the truth, get law enforcement involved and keep their distance.

I stand behind people who promote kindness and respect for your rights, regardless of race and religion. This isn't a contradiction.

They will keep contact with you to always have their help within your reach, because they care. Your community isn't a race nor religion.

All services need their alternatives listed, such as email, maps, cloud storage, note taking, etc. They have to be easy to use with comfortably designed interfaces. Two-factor authentication is preferred where available since that's a great security feature and it's in demand, but already I know that isn't available on everything. It's not show-stopping if it's absent. An endless plethora of choices cannot be presented, as this overwhelms most people. For instance, with Mastodon, I recommend Tusky because the interface isn't crammed and there are around ten other Mastodon apps with inferior interfaces per platform. K9 Mail with RiseUp is good for people who aren't intimidated, but I'd recommend Tutanota instead because it's more bundled. It's ideal if they only need to remember one application for all operating systems. Requiring multiple accounts and passwords to remember isn't ideal and neither is recommending a password manager as the solution unless it behaves so transparently they don't have to think about it. One non-tech-savvy person I know uses a password manager and might migrate to more private alternatives, but most people can't be bothered to use one. This one is the privacy-conscious horse you can get to drink water. I guess that multiple accounts and passwords managers aren't a big deal for anyone who's serious about trying alternatives. Lastly, dank memes, funny/cute stuff and news has to be on the alternative social networks to keep most of your plebeian friends and family around. You can't push most people to change course, as it never works. It may be up to me to curate this list. I have to actually be a user to honestly say which choices I recommend. No currently existing website does exactly what is needed according to me, not Prism Break nor Privacytools.io. They overwhelm and might not have exactly what I would recommend, I'm not going to recommend anything to whistleblowers, only people just wanting distance from mega corporations. The requirements would make adherence challenging or impossible to be fully satisfied, but to make recommendations would still make things much easier. Most people don't go around reviewing the choices. If they don't like the recommendation, they lose interest.

I have too much time, spotting anything microscopically off. I don't know how much of attention to margins is just placebo. I'm pretty sure I notice. This is how I can be. Don't feel sorry. I don't lose my mind over tiles, bricks, and other physical objects. I don't root my phone to \"fix\" the UI. I let things that aren't mine or are physical be \"imperfect.\" This didn't go well with leveling a motor though, because I only wasted time, going nowhere I needed to, so applying that attention to detail has its limits, but it's not crippling. That's probably why interface design is the better path for me, as physics won't get in the way. Maybe this attention to detail is why I can connect the dots between some things that I have a clue about. You see here I'm trying to justify my OCD. No, I won't apply for quality control on an assembly line. Maybe it's better-suited for things that are mission-critical, like spotting irregularities and contamination of space equipment. I would probably waste too much time obsessing over a standard unit of measurement while not knowing for sure what's exactly right, so I don't think I should bother over some weights and lengths in the real world.

Sometimes it can be about getting exactly where you wanted to, and who doesn't want to save time? I've created the look of many different materials, not always on purpose, taking forever to nail any of them and struggling to replicate them from scratch. I could end up underslept. So, when I churned out a bunch of logos for a website, I was called a pro. I responded that I have too much time to burn, fiddling with sliders and dials until it nailed a texture. Half the shit I don't fully understand how it works, like some layer filters take a long time to understand. A pro wouldn't be constantly adjusting everything until it all works out like firing from the hip, would they? And yes, this is another thing I think can be fun to get into if you're bored enough or need a good logo. You can make fantastic designs without being trained nor being a professional. The professional part I imagine would be knowing exactly what you need to do, not burning away a whole day or so on one design, but that doesn't mean practice won't get you there. I didn't get there, but I enjoyed it, maybe too much, but there was determination too. It would be neat if a professional, even if self-described and self-trained, can tell me if I'm right or wrong. This is the latest in my series of posts hoping anyone is inspired to create digital things. A lot of us have gotten into any of these at one point. Amateurs (like me) can pull off professional quality just by being very dedicated to achieving the end result. Maybe you won't feel proud, because computers are extremely forgiving, but people do get impressed. You can be proud. I think that's fine, because it can take a lot to get those results.

What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.\n\n**Don’t Make Assumptions** – Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.\n\n**Always Do Your Bes** – Your best is going to change from moment to moment. It will be different when you are healthy as opposed to when you are sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.\n\n**Be Skeptical, But Learn to Liste** – Don’t believe yourself or anybody else.

This is the first FDA-approved drug that contains a purified drug substance derived from marijuana. It is also the first FDA approval of a drug for the treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome.\n\nCBD is a chemical component of the Cannabis sativa plant, more commonly known as marijuana. However, CBD does not cause intoxication or euphoria (the “high”) that comes from tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).\n\nIt is THC (and not CBD) that is the primary psychoactive component of marijuana.\n\n“This approval serves as a reminder that advancing sound development programs that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies. And, the FDA is committed to this kind of careful scientific research and drug development,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “Controlled clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of a drug, along with careful review through the FDA’s drug approval process, is the most appropriate way to bring marijuana-derived treatments to patients. Because of the adequate and well-controlled clinical studies that supported this approval, prescribers can have confidence in the drug’s uniform strength and consistent delivery that support appropriate dosing needed for treating patients with these complex and serious epilepsy syndromes. We’ll continue to support rigorous scientific research on the potential medical uses of marijuana-derived products and work with product developers who are interested in bringing patients safe and effective, high quality products. But, at the same time, we are prepared to take action when we see the illegal marketing of CBD-containing products with serious, unproven medical claims. Marketing unapproved products, with uncertain dosages and formulations can keep patients from accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious and even fatal diseases.”\n\nDravet syndrome is a rare genetic condition that appears during the first year of life with frequent fever-related seizures (febrile seizures). Later, other types of seizures typically arise, including myoclonic seizures (involuntary muscle spasms). Additionally, status epilepticus, a potentially life-threatening state of continuous seizure activity requiring emergency medical care, may occur. Children with Dravet syndrome typically experience poor development of language and motor skills, hyperactivity and difficulty relating to others.\n\nLennox-Gastaut syndrome begins in childhood. It is characterized by multiple types of seizures. People with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome begin having frequent seizures in early childhood, usually between ages 3 and 5. More than three-quarters of affected individuals have tonic seizures, which cause the muscles to contract uncontrollably. Almost all children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome develop learning problems and intellectual disability. Many also have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting and crawling. Most people with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome require help with usual activities of daily living.\n\n“The difficult-to-control seizures that patients with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome experience have a profound impact on these patients’ quality of life,” said Billy Dunn, M.D., director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “In addition to another important treatment option for Lennox-Gastaut patients, this first-ever approval of a drug specifically for Dravet patients will provide a significant and needed improvement in the therapeutic approach to caring for people with this condition.”\n\nEpidiolex’s effectiveness was studied in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 516 patients with either Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. Epidiolex, taken along with other medications, was shown to be effective in reducing the frequency of seizures when compared with placebo.\n\nThe most common side effects that occurred in Epidiolex-treated patients in the clinical trials were: sleepiness, sedation and lethargy; elevated liver enzymes; decreased appetite; diarrhea; rash; fatigue, malaise and weakness; insomnia, sleep disorder and poor quality sleep; and infections.\n\nEpidiolex must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug’s uses and risks. As is true for all drugs that treat epilepsy, the most serious risks include thoughts about suicide, attempts to commit suicide, feelings of agitation, new or worsening depression, aggression and panic attacks. Epidiolex also caused liver injury, generally mild, but raising the possibility of rare, but more severe injury. More severe liver injury can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice and/or dark urine.\n\nUnder the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), CBD is currently a Schedule I substance because it is a chemical component of the cannabis plant. In support of this application, the company conducted nonclinical and clinical studies to assess the abuse potential of CBD.\n\nThe FDA prepares and transmits, through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a medical and scientific analysis of substances subject to scheduling, like CBD, and provides recommendations to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regarding controls under the CSA. DEA is required to make a scheduling determination.\n\nThe FDA granted Priority Review designation for this application. Fast-Track designation was granted for Dravet syndrome. Orphan Drug designation was granted for both the Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome indications.\n\nThe FDA granted approval of Epidiolex to GW Research Ltd.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.","date_added":1561516149},{"post_id":1561517990,"body":"I've been thinking of extending App 0 to have multiple pages that can be added as home screen shortcuts, because at least one other page would let you listen to music hosted on ZeroNet while you browse, with native app behavior all the way.","date_added":1561516408},{"post_id":1561561598,"body":"I'm still fine with the idea of someone taking me away from this shit hole state of Michigan, or USA for that matter.","date_added":1561560015},{"post_id":1561581773,"body":"I've found a species of morning glory growing by the road.

Rape and murder come with a small fee for the banking elite and their families. They game us with our lizard brains when they rotate the parties' seats whose goals are the same and make us fear of danger from our neighbors as a strategy by the greatest players who are no less the strangers. They hire fake instigators to stir anger and disorder in order to hoard to their core desire. Smedley Butler whistle blew on a coup to make him dictator called The Business Plot. Military forces roam plains of poppy flowers, since drugs empower pharma thugs to make bucks by sellin' opiod drugs to get us addicted and convicted, calling it self-inflicted by sufferers of arthritis and neurologic conditions invited with less prohibition than smog emission. A liter of saline for seven hundred dollars is obscene. A world under plunderin' by thunderin' weapons as streams are turning red from blood and people lie in bed with anxiety wonderin' how much longer they will be lucky to be alive as the sick turn to crowdfunding campaigns, people die and children cry as their stomachs churn in hunger and pain and innocents are slain in vain, yet the first world is victimized? Huh? Why? We debate the world's max capacity population as we look the other way when 40% of food is wasted and the US population is hardly greater than the natives before invasions by jealous Caucasians calling themselves nations of God, yet we make room to hate and debate the logistics and ethics of eugenics while looking down upon immigrants displaced by a newer Holocaust caused by our leader's bought bombs. Lockheed Martin's greed impartin' death and destruction. Fertility drops as crops are poisoned by glyphosate. If capitalism is the best, then why do people die when their bank account balance and investments aren't ridiculously high enough to afford a prescription drug, but the thugs on Wall Street who sink the economy have more than enough... Where's the trickle down these clowns tout when we talk about economic inequality? It seems to me what we believed was nothin' but a dream when they steal with legal impunity, no repercussions heard of. There are better places to live than this land of poverty, and no, I didn't mistake the word \"opportunity.\" So let's have a discussion about giving the homeless amenities and instill disbelief in a land full of grief. The West Coast knows no such thing as irony when fortune 500 companies get away but the homeless can't escape. Let's stop dropping them bombs and looking the other way when refugees come here because we displaced them. Tell me where the dreamers gonna be when we blow their homes to smithereens and we send them to tent cities. All we do is point, missing the irony of our hypocrisy.\n\nFuck all who aren't this deep.","date_added":1585172415},{"post_id":1585239323,"body":"Web development is easier on Android.

If I can get the TOR v3 patch installed for the user-compiled ZeroNet bundle, then I'll be switching to it instead of using the precompiled bundle.\n\nFor some reason, signing and publishing with the precompiled bundle via commands requires root... at least with LMDE anyway. I should test everything out on Linux Mint 20.2 and see if that doesn't require root.\n\nEdit: root is still required for the pre-compiled bundle.\n\nI guess the lesson here is that LMDE is not great for a few very important reasons. I thought it was a rolling release and I've been told that it isn't anymore. It has 32-bit support, but you rarely need that, say for Kega Fusion, but little else.\n\nStick with what's tried and true, like distributions based on Ubuntu, Arch, etc., not experimental distributions like LMDE.

It's like if I and other people standardize making our faces obscured from cameras. The employment is selfish (\"I'm doing this for myself\" mindset), but the technique benefits others who take advantage of it, and that benefits the initial user. Sometimes, the more people do the same, the better it becomes. If I were the only one using anti-papparazi clothing and face paint, I would be easily singled out, but the greater number of people doing it means I'm harder to single out. This would of course put pressure on camera manufacturers to apply better CCDs or new techniques, but for a time, it's better than nothing and will make attempts to thwart the security more narrow and more expensive.

Don't knock it if the version you ran doesn't like your device.\n\nOpt-out seeding is nice. I agree.\n\nHowever, ZeroNet and IPFS both look like they fill the allotted storage and decide when unpinned files must be deleted to make room. IPFS goes by last accessed and ZeroNet goes by most seeded.\n\nPinning is a manual task and to my knowledge you can pin a node on IPFS like helping distribute all files on a site.\n\nIPFS is fundamentally different only for the fact that the PubSub thing seems rather new and IPNS is problematic. It's not easy to use with every hobbyist programmer's version as some are adding GUI and implementong OS APIs while others aren't, but IDK if on desktop that's the case. You should get an API page to do everything on, like less friendly ZeroHello, but it's not problematic. So, what I see here is a difference in user friendliness... and that won't be forever. Both are making improvements there.\n\nThe important difference is that IPFS is like BitTorrent with some improvements, and knowing ZeroNet doesn't fingerprint and version files the exact same, there are use cases where functioning like IPFS might be great, not always better but a good option, but yeah, IPFS needs support for multiple hop tunneling like TOR and i2p.\n\nAnd in the end they don't need to merge on a hybrid protocol at all, but that might make an even larger network. It's a perfect world pipe dream, I guess, but users of both will make similar demands as there had been a few common features and points of user friendliness made from within both of their go-to forum communities, so either way I think both will become very similar with slight differences in how they let go unpinned files and sites or nodes to make space for new files.","post_uri":"16NS3rBdW9zpLmLSQoD8nLTtNVsRFtVBhd_1548263936","date_added":1548302824},{"comment_id":977,"body":"The first comments I'm thinking were talking about Blocklists.

They've tried convincing people that Bernie is implicated in Russian influence, which is bullshit. In the past, Russia had worked with the US to fight terrorists. Hillary had connections with UraniumOne as well as Trump, but it's ignored by the media and that's not unexpected post Citizens United to have oligarchs and royalty foreign and domestic influence candidates. What Democrats don't want to do is prosecute Trump over general corrupt activities nor acknowledge overlap in Russian oligarch influence they too have accepted, which would also include influence from Saudi Arabian royalty or other oligarchs outside Russia. They could, but the reason they don't is because they too are corrupt, so it's the red scare and ignoring own guilt over stopping all corruption. It would undo Citizens United, the judgment that legalized unlimited donations by oligarchs and royalty domestic and foreign. Guess who's actually defending Syria: Russia. Who framed Assad? The CIA. The Russia collusion scandal is a distraction from the larger problem. Corrupt parties calculate their plans for prosecution so they themselves can still carry on corrupt activities, throwing the other corrupt people and innocents under a bus that they themselves no less deserve to happen to them as well. I'm not against Trump being prosecuted, but as I said, it misses the larger problem. Very few are truly innocent of financial influence by domestic or foreign oligarchs and royalty. We can't be satisfied with only Trump's cabinet being prosecuted. That's a narrow scope. Hillary and the DNC need to be implicated as well, but sadly they might drop charges on Trump if that ever happened, unless they hold all the cards, and the media is in their hands. The complexity of the whole fiasco is greater than the media would lead you to believe. I'm far from feeling satiated. The RNC and DNC are both corrupt. No outsider becomes president.
