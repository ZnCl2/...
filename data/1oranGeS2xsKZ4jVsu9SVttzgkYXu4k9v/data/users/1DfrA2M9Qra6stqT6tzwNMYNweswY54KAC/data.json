This is also intended to take some weight of the shoulders of the current hub runners, by being a place where posting (for example) childporn will be allowed.\n\nThe index.html of the PedoHub zite does not contain any illegal material and does not need to run JS, so you can give it a visit if you're interested in it.\nThe hub itself works like any other hub on ZeroMe, images are downloaded, only if you click on 'SHOW IMAGE'. This means that merely downloading the hub, to see the posts on there will not automatically download childporn onto your computer(i.e. get you in trouble).\n\nWhile PedoHub is targeted at pedos, it is not restricted to only them. If you aren't a pedo, but still want to be on this hub, then you are welcome to make your account there.\nAny accounts on PedoHub can post up to 100MB worth of text and 1GB worth on images and media. Accepted certificate providers are:\n\n- peak.id\n- polar.id\n- nobody\n- kxoid.bit\n- kaffie.bit\n- zeroid.bit\n- zeroverse.bit\n- zeropolska.bit\n\nYou can also register with these ones:\n\n- millchan\n- ifs.anonymous\n- 0ch.anonymous\n\nI (for obvious reasons) will not post it's address here for the general public to see. If you want to use the hub, please tell me you want the address(by sending me an [ZeroMail](../1MaiL5gfBM1cyb4a8e3iiL8L5gXmoAJu27/?to=pexo), ask me in the comments, tox or some other way to contact me) or visit one of the major pedo zites, as I will post it's address publicly on those, since they are not in the eyes of the general public.\n\nThe major blocklists have been notified about PedoHub and were given it's address.\n\nIf there are any questions, complains, suggestions, improvements or concerns you can always ask me and I'll try to address them as good as possible.\n~\nThis post was edited on the 28th of December 2018 to update, the supported ID providers.",

Doing the same in an `python2.7.15`, `python2.7.11` or `python3.7.2` console works as expected, which is weird because the `python2.7.11 re.py __version__ ` was 2.2.1, the exact same version as the one in `ZeroBundle/lib/Python2.7/re.py`.\n\nThe reason why the hub-content.json didn't show up is because it actually did, but when gathering the `directory, file_name` in `Db.py`(line 306) `re.match(...)` returned `none` and trying to call `groups()` on a `none` object threw an exception which caused the `1SomeHub/content.json` to be ignored when building the database.",

Inside millchans data folder I ordered all users by last modified date, looked at who has posted in a short amount of time looked into the fist few users data.json files and confirmed, that that was the spammer. After that I took all users that posted in with that same last modified timestamp and compiled the list.\nHowever what had (most likely) happened is that since zeronet is single threaded a lot of updates came all at one for millchan and were written to disk at the same time. Because I was only looking at the last modified date(which is equal to the time the files have been written to my HDD), I assumed they where also addresses of the spammer and took them in as well.\n\n>Do I need to adjust my mutes/bans?\nYes, well not anymore, since you already removed everyone except the five I listed above.\nOnly the users that are listed right now are from the spammer.

If you make a zite that works without hubs, you control every single file anyone uploaded on there and with reasonable effort would be able to delete certain users/posts at will(or in other words censor them).\nIf the zite is made with hubs that that is no longer possible since the zites that actually hold the content are not (at least not all of them) owned by the zite developer(s) and thus cannot be modified by them. This way you only need to trust in the guy that runs the hub(which everyone can do with little effort needed) instead of the one who also controls what gets shown to you (and more importantly what javascript gets run).\n\n>Is everything shared between them?\n\nKind of, everything you do on ZeroMe is stored on the hub you registered on(or chose in the hamburger menu if you registered on multiple hubs). If you visit ZeroMe for the fist time, you'll have no (content) hubs and thus will only be able to see the people that use either a `zeroID`-or `ZeroVerse`-ID. No posts no nothing. Then you need to start downloading some hubs. Once you visit a hub once(=downloaded it) ZeroMe will show you all users(regardless of ID provider), posts and comments that were made by those who registered on that hub or made comments(doesn't matter where they are registered in this case, it's only important that the ID-provider they use is accepted on that hub) on posts that are on that hub.\n\nSo aside from comments which are once on the hub where the post you commented on and once on the hub you are registered on, no data is shared or exchanged to another.\n\n>Do I just sign up with one and when I visit another it will add to what I see?\n\nExactly.\n\n>You have a hub and you're always being helpful so I hope this is a good place to ask :)\n\nThanks!
