A 0net zite that acts as a sort of intermediary which fetches and displays the clearnet articles you want but without you visiting them directly, with you staying within ZeroNet? Cause that sounds very interesting.\n\nSo, I actually had this idea. And it's possible to a certain extent with the PeerMessage plugin. I might experiment with this in the future. I'll probably start with something simple like a Google proxy for ZeroNet (zite to search Google *indirectly* from within ZeroNet by broadcasting a search requests to peers of this ZeroNet zite, and the peers that want to do the actual searching on Google will and will return the results back to your peer).",
