As for breaking into system he told us something along the lines of «Encryption is hard, it takes a lot of brains and calculations. Unless you absolutely have to, don't bother trying to break it. Humans are much easier to break: fingers and toes can hurt a lot, throwing some money in the bureaucratic cogs is another effective way to break security. People are generally ill-informed and naïve, tell them confidently you're from IT and there's a problem you need their help with, chances are they'll just give you whatever it is you need without a second thought.»\n\nMost companies do a lot better these days at teaching employees how to handle calls from \"IT\" though, so it's not as effective anymore.
