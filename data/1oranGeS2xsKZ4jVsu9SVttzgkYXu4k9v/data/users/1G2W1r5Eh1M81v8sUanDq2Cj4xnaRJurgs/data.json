This is a next step towards more privacy in these hard times.\nIt is not compatible to PGP. But in fact I often told my friends to use PGP. They don't. For common users it is too complicated. \nIn Tutanota you just write a mail and it is encrypted. Even if the recipient has no Tutanota. He gets a message with a link. And you give him a password, which he needs to open the link.\nI it simple and effective.",
