We have successfully started and run three of our own businesses in retail chain stores, education training, and internet companies. We have worked closely with many other small overseas businesses to open their China office and sell their products in China. \n\nIn this particular business segment, we do nothing else but one: naming your business properly in Chinese. Your business name can indeed make a difference. Sometimes it may cost you a fortune, or directly influence the fate of your business in China. \n\nPlease see the following link for some classical tales. They are true.\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/14qBuhh5LCSe9CQ6uTwBmpmeGAe93Ut6ci/?Post:17:Naming+in+Chinese+is+a+big+thing\n\n"
