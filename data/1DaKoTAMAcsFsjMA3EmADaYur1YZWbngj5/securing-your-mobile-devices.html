                    <p>Firstly, your lock screen.</p>
<p>Vital when talking about physical access. This is probably the downfall of many users, since a surprising amount of people think a four-digit passcode is enough to secure their device. Fun fact-it’s not. It might stop your little brother from “hacking” your Facebook, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>You need to realize that your cell phone’s password should stand up to a desktop password. Think about it. They are just as easy to hack and bruteforce, and they contain a huge portion of your personal life. Pictures, GPS data, timestamps to go with your GPS location, emails, contacts, messages, etc. And what’s more, your phone can be used to get any other information someone might want. I’ll use Twitter as an example. Let’s say you don’t have Twitter installed on your phone, you’re not signed in, and you haven’t reused that password. Once someone has access to your phone, they can just have Twitter send them a security code to your number and reset your password. And notice I said your number, not your phone. Even if your phone is encrypted to hell, an attacker could pop out your sim and stick it in a different phone. If they have the right amount of knowledge and money to manipulate SS7, they don’t even need access to your phone to do this. Suddenly all your texts and calls are going to their phone instead of yours. And don’t forget, a lot of apps (ex. Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, Authy) use your phone number as your login by default.
Yikes! So how do we go about securing them?</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, it’s vital that you have a strong password. For androids, use the highest amount of characters your device will allow. I think it’s only 16 for some devices, but some go to 40+. Having a very long password is better than having a short one with fancy symbols and numbers and such. If you’re on iOS you’re in luck. My old iPhone password was 40+ characters, and I have no idea what the max is. You may want to check out this website to test the strength of your passwords. Everything is done offline so you don’t have to worry about your password being sent anywhere.</p>
<p>Now we need to make sure this password actually does something. For androids, this means encrypting your device. If your device is encrypted, an attacker would have to bruteforce your password; bypassing the lock screen or dumping your data to a computer wouldn’t get them anywhere. If your device is not encrypted, an attacker could still access all the data on your phone without needing your password (bonus security lost if you have ADB enabled). So at this point we have our device encrypted, and we have a strong password. Invincible, right? Shocker- no.
There are still a few more things to worry about.</p>
<p>Most iOS users probably have iTunes installed on their computer. It’s what you use to copy songs over and restore your device if it’s broken, as well as to make backups of your devices. If you have a 64,000-character password, it will do you no good if all your data is sitting on your PC ready to be copied. Yes, you can encrypt your backups if you choose to, but again, this can be bruteforced. If your device is being backed up to iCloud or Google Drive, then it’s at the mercy of whoever has access to your account. And as I mentioned before, your online accounts can be taken extremely quickly if someone has access to your phone number or email.</p>
<p>Alright, no insecure backups. Are we done here yet?
What’s next?</p>
<p>Now we need to look at a few more things. Is your device rooted or jailbroken? Are you using developer mode/ADB? This can be bad. Keep in mind that in android’s case (if you know what you’re doing), root can be a good thing. However, for the less experienced, it can be negative. For iOS devices, I would never recommend jailbreaking if you’re in any way concerned about security. Jailbroken devices and root provide full access to everything. Invisible backdoors could be installed. Your files could be copied. Antivirus could be disabled- and that’s just a few of many potential consequences.</p>
<p>You should also learn about Cellebrite. Cellebrite is a tool with many different modes used to break into your devices. (Sidenote: I have not personally owned or used one, so this information is based on what I learned from reading the manuals (RTFM!).) The first mode uses your device’s built-in functions to basically ask for all the information it needs. This is why it’s important to disable backups and developer tools as well as keeping your device unrooted/jailbroken. The second mode just copies the files from your device- like if you plugged in a flash drive to your computer and copied the contents to a folder. The third mode is a full forensic bit-by-bit extraction (meaning it can probably see your deleted files too). That mode will not be stopped by anything we’ve done above; you have to rely on the strength of your password versus the computational power of your attacker. Cellebrite can perform many additional functions, including a password grabber, sim cloner, and various developer tools. The most important thing about this tool is that it can bruteforce your password even if you have a self-destruct set. On androids and iOS, there is an option to wipe your device if an incorrect password is entered ten times. This tool can bypass that. Also remember, if your device is jailbreak-able, Cellebrite can jailbreak it and bypass the password.</p>
