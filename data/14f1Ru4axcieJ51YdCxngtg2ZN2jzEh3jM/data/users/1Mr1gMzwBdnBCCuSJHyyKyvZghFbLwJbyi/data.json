			"body": "现在的B站大概有视频5000万，还在按照每个月100万的数量增长着。但是大部分视频都是短视频，按照平均10MB来计算的话，应该有50000万MB，大概500TB的容量。机械硬盘的价格大概是200元/TB，所以要存储完全部B站的视频，需要人民币10万元。\n\n---\n\n以上视频全部考虑为可选文件，然后在来考虑一下文本文件大小（即，任何人访问该站点必须下载的文件大小）。考虑一个视频必须有一个题目和超链接，估算为平均50个中文字符，也就是一个视频100字节，即0.1kB。5000万视频就大概需要5GB。也就是说任何通过ZeroNet访问零网版B站的用户必须下载5GB的必选文件，且每个月增加100MB。\n\n---\n\n现在看来，5GB必须文件对手机用户或许是不可接受的，所以手机用户最好通过代理或远程访问零网中B站(假想中的站点)。",
