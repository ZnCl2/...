				"body": "OK, so this is ***(他的网名？) , (in )this video I'll show you how to create a ()zeroproxy for a public zeronet proxy, so the previous video show you how to create a private one for (personalities), and in this one I'll show you how to create one for anyone here to use. \nSo first of you probably want to use the domain (to use) the proxy, it's optional, but it's much better, you can buy domain () pretty cheap from namecheap, you know .com .net .org ()you want. You can also get domain for free so freenom () you know you get zeroproxy.tk .ml .ga whatever, all these domains are 100% free, but they I (not like feel) a ()good rank on Google, ()\nSo, when she(蛤？) have your domain, you can add it into your DNS provider, my DNS provider is CloudFlare, so what would you (do) for first () ZeroNet, server, and network connected in DNS.\nSo first we have to do is 'cd plugins/'， 然后去掉Multiuser前面的disabled-，'cd ..', I have a ZeroNet configuration,()\n（打开zeronet.conf）This - All of this is global, you ip (settle?), and ui_port 80, so if you (running/owning) a web server, you () running an port 80, this ()with the DNS (send), also it some like school () block ports some () like port 443, just the () block 43110, () easily bypass that block. \n() this now, we can start 'python zeronet.py', we then start (our) server on port 80. So if you know remember before, IP which I don't actually remember, (all right it quick)now I have the IP address, (as) you can see (here) we didn't need () for allow 431(10) cuz we have on port 80. Now this is now a working public proxy, it's fine, so if you give that IP to anyone, they can (do) use () now a public proxy.\n()you bind your domain name to this so people (), port number, you need to go to DNS provider, so specifically on CloudFlare, you wanna () flexible SSL, you'd goto DNS settings, you need add ()so we gonna go zeronet, () IP for address in here, (), so this, now (we) point that to one IP address, so we can put here, it's https://zeronet.acelewis.com, () get enter. DNS can't be found, () do is (callback) cuz DNS takes () to propagate, might take 5 or 10 minutes, so come back in 5 or 10 minutes and see that the DNS is hopefully propagated so ().\nOK, so I'm now going () in Edge just because Chrome is () DNS,() and as you can see here we have runnung https, and this is a public proxy () (anyone making then) going use the proxy, log in, do whatever they want (they) do.\n() open () private window, see here, it tolds you \n不想做听力了。",
