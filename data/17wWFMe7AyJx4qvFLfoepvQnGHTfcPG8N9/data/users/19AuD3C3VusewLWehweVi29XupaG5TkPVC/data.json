			"body": "There is a criminal organization in Brazil using NSO Group's Pegasus to infect devices for hack for hire, to incite terrorism, blackmail people, produce illegal pornography and assist in assassinations. They also have other advanced malware, like UEFI implants and even persistent implants for Kindle and Raspberry Pi. Plus face/voice recognition on every camera and microphone they can get into, in public or private places.\n\nBrazil won't do anything to stop them. Only the FBI, CIA and NSA can stop them.\n\nThere is also the possibility that they were engaged on the hack of Bezos' smartphone.\n\nIf you know of any security researcher who wants to reverse engineer the exploits they are using, I am more than willing to help them.\n\nIf you want a story about how they operate, I am willing to work with you to expose them.",
