			"body": "List only stuff that you payed directly with Bitcoin. That means the value transfer was in Bitcoin. The motivation is to demonstrate to new people how useful crypto currency can be in the real world. The first question is always where it can be spent. There are great sites like [CoinMap](https://coinmap.org) that show where one could spend. But I want to collect here places where people actually took advantage and did spend.\n\n*OK to list here:*\n\n* The recipient keeps the BTC for later spending or for holding long time.\n* The recipient instantly converted to Fiat, e.g using a service such as bitpay.\n\n*Not OK to list here:*\n\n* You used a Visa debit card that is backed by Bitcoin\n* You payed the bill with [Bitwala](https://www.bitwala.com/), [Lamium](https://lamium.io/payments/) or [Bity](https://bity.com), and the merchant received FIAT\n\nThe important part is that the merchant knowingly accepted Bitcoin. \n\nTry to keep the order roughly descending in value.\n\n\n* [Tesla Model S electric car](https://ts.la) (used) from a private individual\n* KnC Saturn Bitcoin ASIC miner\n* [Ozone XXLite
