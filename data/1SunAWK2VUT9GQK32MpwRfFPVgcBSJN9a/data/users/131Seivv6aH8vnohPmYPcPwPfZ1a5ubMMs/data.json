Surely you should be *happy* that people can see for themselves what a big meanie I was to you, your suffering at my hands, and your brave resistance in the face of such atrocities.\n.\nFor example, some lesser individual, some **coward**, would have let my answer to the question [\"Hi I am looking for a site where can](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1MoonP8t4rk9QamBUPh5Aspkwa1Xhf5ux2/1Fnk5S9aU2kCvTFtYMWosbE9NFaRjgeemo/1555930698) [present tense] [get movies](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1MoonP8t4rk9QamBUPh5Aspkwa1Xhf5ux2/1Fnk5S9aU2kCvTFtYMWosbE9NFaRjgeemo/1555930698) [plural][?\"](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1MoonP8t4rk9QamBUPh5Aspkwa1Xhf5ux2/1Fnk5S9aU2kCvTFtYMWosbE9NFaRjgeemo/1555930698) slide, or just given some mealy-mouthed cop-out like \"*There's also KxoVid and ShareTube, which don't have much content yet but hopefully will have more in the future.*\"\n.\nSome **weakling** like that might have wimped out and preferred to tell themselves that I hadn't mentioned KxoVid and Sharetube in my answer because the last time I had checked those sites before writing that answer, Sharetube had only three videos total and no movies (unless one considers the Christchurch massacre video a movie) and KxoVid's Movies & TV category had just four videos (three of them not movies).\n.\nOnly someone with unwavering courage and laser-like perception would see through my charade of a seemingly helpful response and call it out for what it *really* was, clearly a personal attack by me on you, and thus respond in kind and make half their answer \"*- of course, klu9 already knew that, but chose not to tell you this (which is a deliberate disservice to you, imo - but of course he probably didn't like that I told him off for being a jerk, lol).*\" (oh, and make the other half of their answer the availability of things that are, umm, **not** movies).\n. \nOnly someone with admirable moral rectitude would have issued a devastating takedown of my awful and misleading attack, and taken some newb's simple request for info and, instead of merely answering it, turn it into a battlefield in your brave war against jerks like me. Just like the brave heroes in the movie *300*. You know *300*, right? It's the movie [singular] available on KxoVid (and, while I can understand why its name might confuse, is still actually just *one* movie [singular], and not, you know, three hundred movies).\n.\nFrankly ZeroNet, indeed, **the world** needs more people courageous enough to steam into any thread and start calling people \"brainless\" and \"jerk\" and telling them to \"stfu\" (and not meekly hold back from that just because the other people were simply **tricky** enough not to do it first.) And to take that war into other unrelated threads involving people who've got nothing to do with it. And do it all secure in the knowledge that it's all the other person's fault for their stupidity and their awfulness toward you and they're just getting what they deserve: **TRUTH**!\n.\nYou've been doing it in threads long before I came onto ZeroNet. You've been doing it regularly while I've been on ZeroNet. And you'll be doing it long after I'm probably gone from ZeroNet. **Keep it up and stay strong!**\n.\nPoor, brave Krixano / KxoBot / whatever other name you're using beginning with a K.\n.\n.\nWait a minute... *my* name begins with a K.\nWhoa! Am I in some ZeroNet version of *Fight Club*???",
