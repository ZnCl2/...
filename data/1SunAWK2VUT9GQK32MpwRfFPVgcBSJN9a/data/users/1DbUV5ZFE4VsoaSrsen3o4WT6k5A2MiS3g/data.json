Calling it \"racist\" to report on the gang rape of a woman because of the ethnicity of the perpetrators? And this is just one of many incidents.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/germany-springs-to-action-over-hate-speech-against-migrants/2016/01/06/6031218e-b315-11e5-8abc-d09392edc612_story.html\n\nHow about fining and arresting those in Germany who spoke out against the hundred or so assholes who went on a looting and raping spree? In the name of \"civility\" those speaking out against atrocities were silenced.\n\nIt's long overdue that we take back the internet.",
