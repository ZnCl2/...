			"body": "Yes, climate is changing, and climate changes all the time. Or, once every 400 years the Sun goes into a minimal state of activity which has a direct effect on our climate, has to do with solar energy output and the magnetic fields.\nI'd like everyone to know that things are about to get a lot worse, colder, more extreme, and overall more unpredictable weather. The main problem (is and) will be crop losses, due to unfavorable climate. I suggest everyone to look up Adapt 2030:\n\n- [Mini Ice Age Conversations (Adapt2030's podcast)](https://adapt2030.libsyn.com/)\n- [Adapt2030's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MyanmarLiving)",
