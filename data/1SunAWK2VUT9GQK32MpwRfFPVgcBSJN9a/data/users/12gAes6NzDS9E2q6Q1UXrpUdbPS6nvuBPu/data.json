Right now it's actually functional and usable - we already have many pretty good zites: ZeroMe, ZeroMail, ZeroTalk, ZeroVoat, ZeroSites, Kopy Kate, Thunderwave, ZeroBlog, ZeroNet Dev Center (the questions part), ZeroWiki, 0Play, ZeroTV (not being updated anymore afaik), Git Over ZeroNet, Search Engines like Kaffie, Zirch, and RVRE, IFS, something that I'm currently working on that will be released hopefully soon. Sure these may not be as good as the clearnet alternatives, but that's what you get when you are dealing with only a subset of the clearnet (no php/nodejs, no instant updates because there's not a central server so everything needs to be signed and published, etc.) IMO, ZeroNet has done some things that are kinda cool and would at the very least qualify it as a beta (considering how easy it is to setup, although could probably still be improved, how friendly it is to navigate, and all the different zites we have) - MergerZites, Optional Files, [Big File Support](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/7) *coming soon* (I believe this includes *streaming* content), Cloning, the way it handles Users, etc.",

Then, you can get the video id by doing this from anywhere:\n```\nRouter.currentParams[\"videoid\"]\n```\nOr you can use the `params` argument passed into the controller function. The router uses Angular-style routes. You can also use `.add` from anywhere in code that you can access the Router variable, so it doesn't have to be on initial load of document.

Everything taught in Hebrew Roots comes *directly* from the bible, and they put importance on the original Hebrew and Greek texts, especially keeping the original names (like YHWH). Additionally, Hebrew Roots believes many of the things on this Bless Yahowah site, so unless you are saying this site is also wrong...\n.\nSecondly: if the verse(s) in Habakkuk say exactly what you are saying they say, then, as far as I'm concerned, a person can lead many away without intending to - let's say if Paul's writings were misinterpreted. Additionally, there could be multiple people named Saul and further study is required before coming to a conclusion like this.\n.\nThirdly: The bible states pretty clearly that Paul was an apostle. And it just so happens that him being the 13th apostle lines perfectly up with the 13 tribes of Israel, where the 13th was turned into Priests.\nActs 9:1-19 Unless, of course, you want to say that Luke is a liar too.\n.\nFourth: The Jews either used Yod Hey Vav Hey *without* the vowels or replaced it with something else, so we don't technically know what the vowels are.\n.\nFifth: Paul was clearly a Pharisee and a Jew and a Benjamite (Acts 21:39 and Romans 11:1). He uses jewish ideas and proper form of Talmud writing in his letters.\n.\n> Yahowah says that Benjamin is a ravening wolf. And who did Yahowsha (erroneously known to many as jesus) warn to be wary of?\n\nVerses?\n.\n[https://torahclass.com](https://torahclass.com) is a great resource.
