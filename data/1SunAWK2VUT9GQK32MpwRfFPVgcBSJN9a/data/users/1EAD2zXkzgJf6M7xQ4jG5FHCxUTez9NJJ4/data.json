We have a similar message (as the one shown on 43110.cf) once we release our new proxy service. Although some of our plans were delayed last year, we are still no track to release several new services in the first quarter of '19. Check out our [github](https://github.com/d14na) for recent updates and activity.",

We haven't been working on it for a few months as focus shifted back to our core crypto business (dealing with crypto winter). \n\nThe MAIN purpose for this project is to support mobile users WITHOUT having to download and install a client. Hopefully, it serves its purpose to help boost adoption.\n\nThe problem with 0net.io is that its ONLY a proxy (not a client), so users DO NOT contribute back to the network.",
