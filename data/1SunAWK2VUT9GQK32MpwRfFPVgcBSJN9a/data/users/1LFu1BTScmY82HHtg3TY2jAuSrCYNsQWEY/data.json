There are also other similar static providers.\n\n* For classic PHP (some also Python or Node.js) shared hosing, there are many free providers. I don't know which would be the best, but some of them are actually very good for free hosting.\n\n* However, there aren't many free VPS providers, and most of them you can find on Google are actually scams.\n\n* For directly Heroku alternatives, there are some providers with (limited) free plans, but I also don't know them specifically. However, I found some Kubernetes providers which provide free plans ([Okteto](https://okteto.com/), [Kuber](https://kuber.host/), [KubeSail](https://kubesail.com/)).\n\nAlso, for some other services with free plans for developers, you might want to check [free-for.dev](https://free-for.dev/).",

			"body": "When I tried to register account few months ago for some my project, it also got blocked. The solution was... to enter phone number. But you can then remove your number immediately after verification.\n\nAnd I also had some \"great\" experience with Twitter support bots. They once banned my account because of \"age restrictions\" and require me to scan my passport to unblock it. So I sent them special marked version of passport with hidden sensitive information, as it is required by my country laws. And of course they didn't accept it. Then I asked their support about that, and after quite a long time (almost a week), I received automated reply that I my account was blocked and I need to send passport scan.\n\nThe solution was to try more times, also use different contact forms, and after some time, they finally accepted it. So you might also try that.\n\nAlso, it might be prohibited by European's GDPR to collect users' data if they doesn't want to. However, I don't know if requiring phone number for \"security reasons\" count as this. Also, it probably doesn't count if you are not from EU.",
