North Korea declared give-up of the nuclear bomb in exchange with handshaking with Trumph.\nJapanese rightists have always needed the tension among the countries surrounding the North Korea in order to release the lock which has been stranding Japan from militarizing as once they were so till they surrendered themselves to US Army in 1945.\nThis leads to the solution for another trouble Japan is facing now. To escape from Japan's current national debt which is a timer bomb without turn-off switch, Japanese rightists, as they used to do before, need a kind of huge military event which is huge enough to declare martial law in their country and to incinerate the debt owed to its own citizens. \nTo do this, they need to remove the lock so that they can start war against any countries around it. You must remember how many people they murdered during WWII.\nAnyway, Trumph stopped their movement. Then what left now? Japanese prime minister Abe is facing a big scandal involving with dirty money, together with his wife's as well. \nPity Abe. He could kill more people than his grand father did in Korea, China and other many Asian countries.\nLet's see how the Japanese rightists find another route to accomplish their bloody plan.",

No other option at the present to modify, but sometimes alliances could pretend a huge loaf of merged clay like EU or NATO.\n\nThe 3rd one depends on a huge financial support. It means unless it were a highly sophisticated capitalized nation it should have possessed a huge amount of natural(mineral) resources. (Though most times price of those natural resources are easily manipulated by the highly sophisticated capitalized countries as if USA did against Russia upon oil prices.)\n\nKim is lack of the 2nd and 3rd innately.

He seemed very kind and smart with fluent explanation. And got a kind of generic of Zelcom and walked out, but when I tried to search the package for a word 'Flubendazole' which is a key ingredient for Zelcom generics, only to fail. There was 'Albendazole' instead which is a key ingredient against 'Flubendazole' and known to be inferior. I returned to the pharmacist and told him it's not Zelcom generic but the other one. He pretended like \"Ah, there are two kinds of parasiticides I heard..!(??)\". And tried to find something and brought me the one which is double the price of normal Zelcom pill but liquid type with sweet flavor. Since I needed many to feed many dogs, asked him to give normal pill type. He said there's none and asked me with a bit questioning tone why I wanted it specifically as if I demanded him something abnormal. I didn't feel like teaching that stupid asshole the difference between the two, so I told him \"I don't know why but they(?) specifically want it? Bye.\" Next time I will be calling a drug store in advance before visiting. Such a shitty cartel of pharmacists doesn't even allow to sell via internet or via over-the-counter in the mart those shitty pills. Not even Aspirin is allowed.

He's genetically Korean but was born and grown up as a Japanese in Japan. He built a temple in the middle of the crowded entertainment district, Shinjuku. The name of the temple was \"Kakekomi Tera\" (=Temple you can jump in emergently). Since then he began to listen to the various people about various troubles and stories. He sometimes helped them with a knife and blood. Sometimes with money. And sometimes persuaded them to give up the hope of solving the problem. In case when he made them to give up, most were troubles about homosexuality of the clients' husbands. Interestingly most cases it showed were those who had lived as normal males having a family of their own at least until then. After being raped by a male once or twice they turned into homosexuality. It doesn't mean that being raped always leads to transgending his sexual role. Anyway it's an interesting source of real cases.",

The living one is my son; the dead one is yours.” But the first one insisted, “No! The dead one is yours; the living one is mine.” And so they argued before the king.\n23 The king said, “This one says, ‘My son is alive and your son is dead,’ while that one says, ‘No! Your son is dead and mine is alive.’ ”\n24 Then the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword for the king.\n25 He then gave an order: “Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.”\n26 The woman whose son was alive was deeply moved out of love for her son and said to the king, “Please, my lord, give her the living baby! Don’t kill him!” But the other said, “Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!”\n27 Then the king gave his ruling: “Give the living baby to the first woman.

			"body": "February 5, 2019 is Jan 1 of lunar calendar, and is called New Year, called 설(Surl) in Korea, or 春節(chūnjié) in China. \n.\nOn Jan 1 of lunar calendar the title of each year changes. There're 60 titles of the years beginning with the year 갑자(Gabja; 甲子) and ending with the year 개혜(Gaehae; 癸亥). After the year Gaehae, it's the year Gabja again. The front letter of a pair of letters which makes up each title is repeated in order of 10 [천간cheongan; 天干; Heavenly Stems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavenly_Stems), and the tail letter is repeated in order of 12 [지지Jiji; 地支; Earthly Branches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthly_Branches). The both letters make up total 60 titles ( = 10 x 12 ). It's a kind of sexagenary numbering system. Each of 10 heavenly stems and 12 earthly branches has its own meaning so that each of 60 titles comes to have a unique meaning as well. \n.\nFor example it's 기해(Giihae; 己亥) this year. Gii means Yellow and Hae means Pig. People used to call it Golden Pig's year. In Asia, pig as a symbol has a meaning of richness or prosperity, and yellow reminds of gold. So it is believed that it's very lucky year. \n.\nHow do they make it into their luck? They used to give a special meaning if a baby is born in the year Giihae. And his Asian star sign becomes Pig. But nowadays most people don't give it much meaning anyway. Most times it is used as only marketing purposes, it's like, to induce people to spend some extra money.\n.\nBut it's still meaningful to those who're preparing university entrance exam or civil service exams because in history many historical events were named after the year title of the year it happened. And in my case I even memorized the formula to convert Gregorian calendar year into sexagenary title and vise versa.\n.\nIn regard with the tail letter as the animal sign, Koreans call this a birth star sign 띠(Tii; year of animal) though it's actually not related to horoscope or constellation of the West, but this system was originally created based on Jupiter's 12 year routine anyway. If one was born in 2019, his animal sign is Pig.\n.\nWhen you meet someone in Korea and if u feel like asking his/her age, u can ask him/her his/her Tii rather than asking him/her his/her birth year or age directly since it's a little rude. And then u can easily find out how old he/she is if the age gap between u and him/her is less than 24 years. This is the usual way to find out someone's age because it has a little bit of funny thing to talk about animal signs of each other. ( born in 2019 pig, 2020 mouse, 2021 cow, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, chicken, dog, pig(again). Animal signs were introduced from 12 gods of Buddhism. )\n. \nThese 12 animal signs or earthly branches have been also used as unit of hours of a day in ancient times by saying each branch points a pair of hours so that total 12 make up 24 hours a day since thousands of years ago. That is, there was also duodecimal numbering system in Asia. \n.\nAnyway, if u're going to have time with ur family or friends during Surl holidays, this post will give u a small tip to make a talk with others. \n.\nHappy lunar new year!

Contrary to declarations by individuals at Google, the search company and Mozilla were not on the same team, charged Johnathan Nightingale, a former vice president of Firefox, who said decisions by Google that ended up hurting Firefox were too frequent to be coincidences. \"Focus on the behaviour of the organism as a whole,\" Nightingale tweeted. \"At the macro level, Google/Alphabet is very intentional. [And] Google as a whole is very different than individual googlers.\"\n>\n>Want to know why the current Brave CEO who was kicked by Mozilla and taken over? Blame Google. This is why I like Brave, despite it being Chromium. During the whole fiasco of Google going to disable uBlock Origin and ad blockers, Brave was going to become a fork of Chromium(I wished Google did go against ad blockers just so that happened, but Google stopped it, so yeah). This is why I stopped supporting Mozilla. The day that they kicked out that guy as CEO, is the day I knew Mozilla was going to shit. You can argue all you want about competition to Chromium(yes I want competition), but anti-censorship is my top priority. Brave's CEO is not looking to censor extensions anytime soon if you look at his Twitter. I am confident if the worse comes, Brave will just become a fork of Chromium that is better.\n",

While Xiaoming Li didn’t enter Tiananmen Square until June 5th, his unit was ordered to enter the square a day earlier but stopped when violence broke out. He says his unit commander ignored his orders and instead chose to remain removed from the violence. As the world remembers the bravery of those who stood in defiance against a brutal military crackdown, China continues to censor the event and arrest pro-democracy activists.

And Pedophilia.\n.\nLast week, 33 year-old serial murder case has been solved in Korea. \nIt's known as Hwasung Serial Murder and has made a few films (ex: Memories of Murder, 2003) and tremendous number of documentaries. \nIn 1994, suddenly the murder stopped to occur. And 10 years ago another legendary serial killer commented on Hwasung Serial Murder saying \"No one can stop a serial killer. The Hwasung murderer must have been jailed or dead since then\". And his idea was turned out to be true at last. \n.\nA guy who was arrested and sentenced to life in prison in 1994 got matched with the DNA from Hwasung Serial Murder crime scene evidence.\n.\nHe's known as a very kind person in the prison and was expecting parole in a few years. \n.\nBut his ex-wife and sons testified that he's brutal and very violent, and is a pervert sexually. His last murder was also against his sister-in-law or his wife's younger sister. Many crime profilers say \"It is very probable that he's going to do what he used to do to make himself pleasant again once he's released\".\n.\nPeople used to do what make themselves happy. Someone longs for too much sex or in a weird way, another longs for drugs, the others long for nylons, dolls, kids or murder. \n.\nI think it is somewhat natural born according to my case.\nBut I also think it can be corrected a bit if lectured properly according to my case. What can I say.. It's actually can't be fixed or corrected, but suppressed for a very very long time if he or she tries hard.\n.\nBut if he/she were mentally damaged, no one could predict anything. Keep away from heavy metals like mercury, toxic metals like aluminum in the food source, and any drugs damaging brain functions.",

Now people believe that Joh betrayed people by cheating everything in order to put his son and daughter into the best universities, and by violating every law in order to earn the profit in his family business.\n.\nEspecially most young people turned their back to them because it's like he sacrificed other young competitors for the benefit of his son and daughter.\n.\nSouth Korea has been walking through the textbook course toward the justice by shedding lots of blood of young people since Korean War in 1950. We could proudly say Korea is the number one model country of democracy in the world.\n.\nBut everything is in chaos now. There's a saying 'Pointing a deer but calling it a horse ([指鹿爲馬](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Gao#Calling_a_deer_a_horse); Ji-rok-wee-ma)' in Chinese history book, meaning that people lie or don't tell the truth in order to avoid threats or to take a benefit. \n.\nMany most respected famous people or people in the leadership class are calling a deer a horse now in Korea. \n.\nWas Moon a puppet?

Koreans don't have another choice at the moment. People are too confused in front of the legendary hypocrite. They wish it'd be just a dream, not true.\n.\nLegendary hypocrite.

And you may unplug the internet cable aka WAN cable from the AP, or just turn off internet in the AP's administrator's page. Now the both devices still have local IP addresses such as 192.168.0.*, but they cannot open google web page, etc since the external internet connection is blocked by AP physically or logically. Then you try to post an article to the cloned site on one of the both devices. Wait for a while till the other device updates the article list in the site on Zeronet. Try to post or comment on the 2nd device and 1st device in turn and carefully see if the opposite device screen is updated or stays dull. Sometimes only uni-directional updates occur just like my window7 zeronet and my ubuntu main PC zeronet. The two devices must be typically one Desktop or laptop PC and one smartphone. Thanks.!",

For many years before that it had been $1 a day. But the $1 a day used then would be $1.45 a day now if just inflation was accounted for.\n> The new figures from the World Bank therefore confirm concerns that **poverty has not been reduced by as much as was hoped**, although it certainly has dropped since 1981.\n\nThe following paragraph says as follows:\n\n> The use of the poverty line of **$1 a day had long come under criticism** for seeming arbitrary and using poor quality and limited data thus risking an underestimate of poverty. The $1.25 a day level is accompanied with some additional explanations and reasoning, including that **it is a common level found amongst the poorest countries, and that $2.50 represents a typical poverty level amongst many more developing countries.**\n\nYour justification is just a bullshit. The **REAL NEWS** is as follows:\n\n> China’s Gini coefficient, a widely used measure of income dispersion across a population, has risen more steeply over the last decade than in any other country, according to an International Monetary Fund working paper. https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-09-23/china-s-racing-to-the-top-in-income-inequality\n\nChinese Communist Party is not sharing China's profit equally with their citizens, but they're fattening only the top 0.01% pigs.\n.\nIt's like sucking blood from the lower 90% people and feeding the top 0.01% communists for their pleasure.",
