Yeah, I like Rust.\n2) No need to download a blockchain to use it (as a Client, at least).\n\nMAYBE interesting things, at least as proofs of concepts:\n1) Clients and Vaults are different things;\n2) They have a browser. Not that much of a feature, since it looks like an old Chromium \"in disguise\" (and somehow uglier).\n3) The \"Authenticator\" thing, that is something I was planning to suggest on ZeroNet. It's not as ZeroID and related \"zites\". It would be a way to store and access securely my private keys from the network itself.\n\nBad things:\n1) Cryptocurrency! MAN, I'm supposed to have a \"small ammount\" of SafeCoin to simply host my website, even if my machine already is itself a \"Vault\" (that is: I AM collaborating actively with the network). (At least is what I got from the \"paper\").\n2) They are LA-A-TE! Man, +7 years, already...\n3) Everyone seems to be looking for a solution for a problem that maybe doesn't even exist: people willing to give part of their hard drives and computing power to host other peoples content. Isn't that reasonably solved here at ZeroNet? I host a lot of content simply because, well, I BELIEVE. Absolutely no need to pay me no \"ZeroNetCoins\", thanks.",
