What truly distinguishes Bitcoin from others is It's high level of decentralisation and censorship resistance. Politics doesn't matter, greed doesn't matter, cleverness doesn't matter. Except as it serves the best interest of Bitcoin. Whose sole interest is the safety, security and value of the owners and users of Bitcoin. Likewise zeronet doesn't care about your politics, your greed or your cleverness. All zeronet cares about is protecting the value (free speech) of the owners and users of zeronet. Bitcoin adoption is still relatively small, though it's market cap is around a hundred billion!!! Zeronet is doing the same thing. Both #Zeronet and Bitcoin are something truly new. It will take awhile before others truly catch on. But they will. In the meantime both will continue to grow and improve the user experience and value..üëçüòÄ",

This usually required wiping my SD, formatting and re-partitioning my SD card. Pretty simple process with a custom recovery like TWRP.  It turned out that the big problem with drive corruption seems to be not exiting zeronet gracefully. But I found a way to exit gracefully in both single user and multiuser modes. In both single and multiuser modes you can use the normal  exit on the ZeroHello page. If you can't see the normal exit with your Android browser temporarily switch your browser to desktop mode. Then you will be able to see the normal exit. In multi user mode you can only exit with the account or identity you established in single user mode. Now I can exit zeronet gracefully in both modes. As a result zeronet app has been very smooth and stable, without corruption..üëçüòÄ",
