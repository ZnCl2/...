			"body": "Hi, there!\nYou can come across childporn fairly easily here, that is a thing to keep in mind. Depending on your local law, it is best to have tor always mode activated just in case. \nOther than that I suggest not using your certificate too often, to avoid correlation-attacks, if you are concerned about privacy/anonymity.\nEnjoy your time here at the infinite freedom we have here.",

			"body": "@Bybb: Do you mean legally or technically speaking? From a legal standpoint, that strongly depends on where you live, but in most countries today the act of simply viewing childporn is already illegal, in most cases even regardless of context, which sucks, a lot. We had an interesting discussion over at [zerotalk](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1527351127_19Qid9uyfWCTmx2cUpDboEKCscRd4fRWrL/Can+we+still+reasonably+enforce+an+ban+on+child+porn) about that topic, if you are interested. From a technical standpoint it is enough to delete the file, since deleting the entire zite would be a shame, just because one guy posted childporn. A good example for that is millchan, where you can just blacklist the user that uploaded it and you will never see that image again.",

So, the tor network anonymizes you by sending your traffic through other peoples computer in a way that each of those people only know about who the message came from and where it should go next.  Each time your send a new message the path(or rather the chain of computers from you to where ever you want your message to go) your message takes changes. This makes it impossible to know where the message originated from or where it's destination is. That remains impossible for as long as your computer could be anyones computer. However, as soon as your computer has something, that only your computer can know, an hypothetical attacker can lean information about you. For example you visit twitter through the tor network, first you just go there without being logged in, that means your computer asks a random other computer on the tor network to access twitter, which will in turn ask another computer and so on until the message \"get me twitter\" has reached the twitter server, that sends you their start page, back into the tor network and eventually to you. That chain tells nothing about you, twitter can't tell whether that last computer in the chain or you wanted the start page. (=correlating them),An attacker observing the network cannot know whether you are 'just another computer' in the chain or the intended recipient. This changes as soon as you log into twitter with your username, let's say 'PowerAxe42'. Now, your name certainly isn't 'PowerAxe42', so whats the problem here? Twitter now knows, whenever you reach their site(while being logged in), that it must be you, who requested the page, since only you know the password to your account. That means that all chains caused twitter to send the logged in page, must have one thing in common: Your computer. They can't know just by one connection who(or rather where) you are, but with each new message their guess gets better, because while the path always changes your computer is still the only thing in that chain, that knows the password to your account and therefore must be the same person. An observing attacker also can see this.\nThat is in essence what a correlation attack is, combining differed sets of data, to look for similarities or things that always happen together(=correlating them). There are other factors that can be used to speed up that process, like the timing between messages and similar things, but the ability to stand out is what weakens your anonymity.\nThe plus is that this attack only really works, because you are targeting one specific person and even doing only one person is really difficult. That attack is not feasible on a scale of let's say 100 people and impossible on a scale of 1000 people.\n\n>it can be helpful if you write some instructions on what may be \"too often\"\nThat is difficult to answer, I'd say avoid using it whenever possible, but on a zite like ZeroMe that kind of defeats the purpose. If you are on a zite like millchan, however where it is possible to generate a new identity for each post, I would advise to not use the same identity twice.",

On zeronet you would, even on unpopular zites do that about 20 times in a row, to take down a zite, that is not only infeasible but borderline impossible, much less a zite with 200 or 1000 peers.",
