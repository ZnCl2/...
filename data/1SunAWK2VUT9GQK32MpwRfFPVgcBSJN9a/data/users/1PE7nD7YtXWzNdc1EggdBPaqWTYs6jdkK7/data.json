I don't think there are a lot of people left there.\n\nI prefer not to say who I thought you were because it would make it much easier to associate this persona with the one I use there.

I'm not quite getting it.\n\nAnyways, the ukranian sympathy for nazism is quite old, which is comic because nazis hate slavs.\n\nWhen the nazis invaded ukraine the people received them with open arms, thinking they were there to save them from communism. Of course they were all raped and murdered. And to make things worse, they got the profound antipathy of Stalin, which in great part explains their poor fortune during the 20th century. ",
