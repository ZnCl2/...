I think however if one is trying to convince another to think critically it should be done through Socratic questioning which promotes critical thinking through asking questions for clarification etc. If we use any underhanded means to induce critical thinking, it is possible to loose our own credibility. We need to not only promote and induce critical thinking but do it in a way that respects the individual as well as ourselves.\n\nhttp://www.umich.edu/~elements/fogler&gurmen/html/probsolv/strategy/cthinking.htm ",

It can have it's merits I agree especially when someone is being taken advantage of. But it all really depends on how open the person is to idea. You cannot force or trick someone into thinking in a specific way. Only open the door for critical thinking to follow. So, while it has it merits I believe it should be used with caution.",
