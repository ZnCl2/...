HOWEVER, they have these little \"side stories\" written by third parties. Lo, and behold: one of them was written by Silverstring Media, the group that hosts all kinds of nutty SJW retreat workshops on \"State oppression jenga\" and \"dismantling masculinity.\" They also DDOS and DOXX their opponents, and were most well known for calling all Total Biscuit viewers \"scum\" and claiming that \"gaming is dead.\" These days they occupy themselves by writing several pages of articles about how video games should be used to fight right wing politics. And amazingly enough, the shameless losers called their side story's main character Quinn, as in Zoe Quinn.",

I think I fell out of it a couple years ago for my own reasons or something ... I checked the subreddit for it once kinda recently and was glad to see it's still around. ^^",
