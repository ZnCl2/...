We seem not able or willing to grasp the implications, and we have shown a weary cynicism that evidently masks a deeper indifference. Many have shown an eager complicity, free of defensiveness. If you are innocent, you have nothing to fear, we insist, forgetting the innocence of millions interned and murdered by Western governments within living memory. Surveillance will keep us safe from our enemies, we say, obediently accepting the pronouncements of our governments on the identities of our enemies and the proper sources of our terror.\n\nOnly by going back and understanding the roots of modern (perhaps apparent) structures can we properly criticize surveillance, governments and their various kinds.\n\n**bonus**:\nSurveillance and Espionage in the Roman Empire | JL Williams | TEDxBTNSchool \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnIzwcX9ml4",

It’s not just the philosophies espoused by the West that troubles them, but the way those philosophies were baked into the very architecture of the internet, which is rather famously engineered to ensure no one can prevent anyone from sending anything to anyone.\n\nthis is false, there was no known philosophy baked into the technology as the articles tries to infer, this is faulty observation from hindsight:\n[The evolution of the Internet: from military experiment to General Purpose Technology](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2016.1157619)\n\nwhat bothers me the most is the usage of the term \"Open Internet\" in this article. i mean, why is Ross Ulbricht rotting in prison?\n\n>They found that over the past four years, “digital decider” states – Israel, Singapore, Brazil, Ukraine, and India among others – have drifted increasingly toward a more sovereign and closed approach to information\n\nand then \"The reasons for their drift are varied\". why is that? why doesn't the article mentions why these countries aren't so very happy with our current awesome western \"open internet\"?\n\nexcept that they kinda do that at the end, but with a very different tone:\n>“More and more Western countries are being forced to think about what that means, sovereignty on the internet,” says Tack. In the wake of recent election meddling, and the well-documented practice by Russian governments to sow discord on Western social media, Western policymakers woke up to the idea that an open and free internet could actually harm democracy itself, Morgus says. “The parallel rise of populism in the United States and elsewhere, coupled with concerns about the collapse of liberal international order, saw many of the traditional open internet sword-bearers retreat into their shells.”\n\nand then:“It’s not about bad countries and good countries – it’s about any country that wants to suppress communications,” \n\nOh its not so bad when we do it, we are the good guys!  \n\nand of course this blogger is so very smart:\n>Internet protocols specify how all information must be addressed by your computer, in order to be transmitted and routed across the global wires; it’s a bit like how a Windows machine knows it can’t boot up an Apple operating system.

And i don't think that the word \"freedom\" should be burdened with his second meaning these days;\n&nbsp;\nthe ethical path was mostly derived from Christianity, good and truth, what he added however was that the first kind of freedom, which is elementary to the second, was the way in which we act upon nothingness is meaningless and eventually hurtful, however with truth, and truth alone may lead to authoritarianism requiring freedom of will and the act of good and even evil to not be authoritarian (the first kind).\n&nbsp;\nso, there is a dialectic between the two kinds. also his point about the first kind and the contradiction with scarcity is very much observable.\n&nbsp;\nand that is mostly what i find it useful to talk about freedom (in some contexts), to have an environment where freedom takes place (the nothingness) and therefore to have rational freedom, to have freedom not for the sake of having it but to liberate ourselves rationally in the process.\n\nat least we can go back to those kinds of synthesis without solely talking about freedom in the abstract. \n",
