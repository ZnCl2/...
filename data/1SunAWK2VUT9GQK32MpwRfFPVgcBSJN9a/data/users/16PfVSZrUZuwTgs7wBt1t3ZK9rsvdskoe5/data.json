And I'm not seeing any `[KxoNetwork]` logs in the browser's JS console. Is that not the console you were talking about? [this is what I'm getting since I sent that command](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1MgHVPCE1ve6QfKrgsqCURzRj72HrRWioz/?16PfVSZrUZuwTgs7wBt1t3ZK9rsvdskoe5_0).

			"body": "Yeah I have an issue with my IDs tbh, I kinda originally called it Kusoneko.bit and then realized since I don't own kusoneko.bit maybe I should remove the .bit, and while at it uncapitalize it so it stops bugging me. Except, even though I changed that in both the id zite and my users.json, it still shows the id I created with that as kusoneko@Kusoneko.bit... I still have no clue why it's doing that, I kinda figured changing it shouldn't involve removing the whole thing, but it doesn't appear to work like that?\n\nAlso, as for the blog, I'm pretty sure it's signed, but I read somewhere that using cert_signers besides KxoID and ZeroID sometimes causes it to stop comments for some reason... I'm not sure how I'm supposed to fix that though?",
