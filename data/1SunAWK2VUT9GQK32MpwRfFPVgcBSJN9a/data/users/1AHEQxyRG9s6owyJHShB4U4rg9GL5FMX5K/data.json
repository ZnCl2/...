Will need to think about that one more.\n\nmaybe using album IDs?\nas in a song can be in an album by it's ID(or the other way around or both ways)\n\n>Maybe just rework the genre system for this actually? Just rename it to tags?\n\nmaybe reworking the genre system into tags but i doubt there's any improvement that could be done, other then an offsite wiki for how to tags to set the standards for easy searching, and also what each tag means\n\nyes lyrics will be good, maybe option to import via clearnet? like a button that says \"try search lyrics over clearnet and contribute to this entry\"\n\n>Thanks for all these suggestions btw, they're awesome!\n\nNo problem, that's a cool project you have there\n\nalso i have a question on how to add album art after they have been submitted?\n\nmaybe there should be like a section of wishlist? maybe as a LSTN talk for contributing songs and talks on how to contribute",
