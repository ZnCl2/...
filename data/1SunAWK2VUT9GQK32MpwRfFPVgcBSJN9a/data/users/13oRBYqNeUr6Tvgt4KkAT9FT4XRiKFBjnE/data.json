The same as \"time\" or indeed \"freedom of will\".

And if we reassign its meaning to something that can, the concept is still there, we just lose ability to name it or have to invent new names (this sort of things is somewhat unavoidable in physics, where \"atom\" changes its meaning from abstract concept to rather concrete one and then we discover the latter is not really atomic; but in philosophy we aren't dealing with such \"discoveries\")",

Yes, knowledge sort of gives you more possibilities to consider, but adhering to ethics or even \"acting rationally\" doesn't. Absolute rationality with absolute knowledge would leave no place for freedom. But modern physics says we can't have absolute knowledge; and math has some concerns to consider about absolute rationality.. but even beyond that, it might turn out to be rational to not be rational all the time ;)\n\nWell, obviously i'm considering this from atheistic pov, so i can't fully appreciate what do christians think about freedom. Though i think this \"freedom dichotomy\" has rooted in christianity because it plays well with the usual christian dichotomy of body vs soul\n\n> there is one real world connection tho, which is the real scarcity of things when we discuss freedom,\n\nThis is another issue. I would probably separate freedom issues into three categories:\n\n- phenomenal freedom (freedom of will; which may posses or not, depending on how the world works)\n\n- external freedom: whether we have phenomenal one or not, we may still be forced by our environment or have a choice\n\n- being informed; while this can be seen as not directly related to freedom, it still is in that the more we know the better strategy of actualizing external freedom we may create",

Even if it is determined for me to write these lines, we have to access all the information to predict that. Leave out some pieces, and you get indeterminism which would include me not writing (so i have freedom to write or not to write).
