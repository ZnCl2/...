			"body": "[MOSREF](http://127.0.0.1:43110/bluishcoder.bit/2009/11/28/using-wasp-lisp-secure-remote-injection.html) the secure remote injection framework written in Wasp Lisp has a console process that spawns and communicates with remote nodes running on other machines called drones. Through the console you can execute lisp code or shell commands on the drones, copy files between them, etc.\n\nThe drones connect to the console via an IP address/hostname and port that the console listens on. For a project I want to be able to run the console behind a TOR onion service and have the drones connect through the onion address.\n\nThis turns out to be quite easy as Wasp Lisp has a package for implementing a SOCKS client and server. The server side is used in the MOSREF `proxy` command to enable a SOCKS proxy to run on the console that provides access to the internal networks of the drones.\n\nThe TOR daemon provides SOCKS support - to use Wasp's client side library to retrieve a web page over TOR we can use:\n\n    >> (import \"lib/socks-client\")\n    :: #t \n    >> (define (get-page out)\n           (send \"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" out)\n           (send \"Host: mh7mkfvezts5j6yu.onion\\r\\n\" out)\n           (send \"\\r\\n\" out)))\n    :: get-page\n    >> (define a (tcp-socks4-connect \"\" \"127.0.0.1\" \"9050\" \"mh7mkfvezts5j6yu.onion\" 80))\n    :: [os-connection CB0338B0]\n    >> (get-page a)\n    :: [os-output CB047E50]\n    >> (wait a)\n    ....page contents...\n    >> (send 'close a)\n\nIn that example I retrieve the page of my weblog via its onion address.\n\nTo make MOSREF drones that connect via TOR I modify the drone code that the console compiles to check if the address is an onion address and if it is connect via the SOCKS proxy [in this github commit](https://github.com/doublec/WaspVM/commit/ee19cbf089562013fb9f5ccd9760660cdce4efc7).\n\nThis is enough to get a simple use case working. If I configure Tor on a server to have an onion service that connects to the consoles listening port I can then create drones that connect using it:\n\n    $ mosref\n    console> set addr=myhiddenservice.onion\n    Set.\n    console> set port=12345\n    Set.\n    console> drone drone1 drone1 linux-x86_64\n    Drone executable created.\n    Listening for drone on 12345...\n\nStarting the drone on another machine that is running tor will connect via the tor daemon through the onion address:\n\n    # On drone machine\n    $ ./drone1\n    ...connecting messages...\n\n    # On console\n    console> nodes\n    drone1 online\n    console> on drone1 do (+ 10 20)\n    :: 30\n\nConsole/Drone communication is already encrypted so the main benefit of this is using Tor for its firewall evading mechanism and hiding the origin of the console. It's possible, via the Tor daemon API, to create onion services on demand which might be a useful addition to the MOSREF console.",

It doesn't use ZeroNet features since it was a direct mirror that I did back in the early days of ZeroNet. I moved some of the screencasts to optional files and I've been thinking how best to make some of the other content optional - eg, maybe making only the main page and posts on the main page non-optional files.\n\nThe reason it probably didn't work for you is exactly the file size. Some seeders have never agreed to the file increase - maybe they are proxies or not operated by a human. As a result there's nodes out there serving old content. At least that's what I see when I sometimes try to get it on a new node - I get an old version where I had tried removing all the files to get it to seed.",
