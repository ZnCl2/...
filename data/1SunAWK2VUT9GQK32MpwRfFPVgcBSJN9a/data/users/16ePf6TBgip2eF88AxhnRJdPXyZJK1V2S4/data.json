And that there's not a lot to do on the fediverse other than idle chit-chat. \"Nice\" isn't enough of a qualifier for me to invest my precious time in people I don't know, and my time on leftist instances leads me to believe \"accepting\" crumbles into a hugbox facade as soon as I step outside of the acceptable party lines.\n\n(Disclaimer: the above linked post is a little outdated, since I use neither Zot nor [Gopher](/1MeeJWbbQHArbqD6UUHSjh9EVycvnTUBFa/archive/blog/2019/december/death-of-a-gopher.html) anymore.)\n\nIf you could shoot me an email at vanevander(at)mayvaneday.art with who you thought I was, that would be great, since if there's someone trying to impersonate me I'd like to know about it. Don't worry about the assocation since I won't bother trying to connect the two.",
