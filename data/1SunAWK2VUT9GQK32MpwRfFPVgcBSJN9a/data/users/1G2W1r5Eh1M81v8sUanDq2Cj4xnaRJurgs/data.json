But in the last 40 - 50 years this money was spent for other _important projects_. So this deal fails. The government has saved no money for the streets. Today they know that our streets are very desolate and try to give enormous amounts for their fixing. So much went wrong in the last decades. \nIf I use a road in France or Luxembourg, I see it very clear. They have so pretty good streets. If you drive back to Germany you know, when you are here. It is the point, when you see potholes and the car is shaking. We are back home...",
