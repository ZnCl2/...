And in addition I thought i could shoot it with a rifle to get a nice firework. Yes, I thought rifles were fun before I went to the army. \nSo I went to the company selling bottled gas with my bycicle, asking for some hydrogen. The guy looked shocked at me. He said he didn't mind handling propane and buttane any day, but he would not touch hydrogen, because he was afraid of it. I ended up buying helium, and see the balloon raise and raise and raise ...",
