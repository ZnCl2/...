They've tried convincing people that Bernie is implicated in Russian influence, which is bullshit. In the past, Russia had worked with the US to fight terrorists. Hillary had connections with UraniumOne as well as Trump, but it's ignored by the media and that's not unexpected post Citizens United to have oligarchs and royalty foreign and domestic influence candidates. What Democrats don't want to do is prosecute Trump over general corrupt activities nor acknowledge overlap in Russian oligarch influence they too have accepted, which would also include influence from Saudi Arabian royalty or other oligarchs outside Russia. They could, but the reason they don't is because they too are corrupt, so it's the red scare and ignoring own guilt over stopping all corruption. It would undo Citizens United, the judgment that legalized unlimited donations by oligarchs and royalty domestic and foreign. Guess who's actually defending Syria: Russia. Who framed Assad? The CIA. The Russia collusion scandal is a distraction from the larger problem. Corrupt parties calculate their plans for prosecution so they themselves can still carry on corrupt activities, throwing the other corrupt people and innocents under a bus that they themselves no less deserve to happen to them as well. I'm not against Trump being prosecuted, but as I said, it misses the larger problem. Very few are truly innocent of financial influence by domestic or foreign oligarchs and royalty. We can't be satisfied with only Trump's cabinet being prosecuted. That's a narrow scope. Hillary and the DNC need to be implicated as well, but sadly they might drop charges on Trump if that ever happened, unless they hold all the cards, and the media is in their hands. The complexity of the whole fiasco is greater than the media would lead you to believe. I'm far from feeling satiated. The RNC and DNC are both corrupt. No outsider becomes president.
