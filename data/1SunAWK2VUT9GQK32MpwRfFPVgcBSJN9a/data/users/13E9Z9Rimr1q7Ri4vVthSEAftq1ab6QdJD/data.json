			"body": "A short summary of the video:\n\nProblems: \n1. The banking cartel has captured (bribed) the centralized regulators\n2. The banks legally made themselves a mandatory third-party intermediary in every transaction\n3. The banks proceeded with rent-seeking (extracting profits from the flows of money they should manage).\n4. The banks become gatekeepers, for instance, blocking certain countries they don't want you to trade with.\n\n\nThe solution, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies:\n1. Eliminates centralization, which eliminates the place to be captured (therefore removing intermediaries)\n2. Eliminates obstacles between buyers and sellers (even if a country is blocked off, its citizens might find a way with cryptocurrencies)\n2. Offers an alternative to the national currency, which may be sinking\n3. Is easy to hide from abusive authoritarian governments\n4. Allows for peer-to-peer trust, instead of peer-to-corporation-to-corporation-to-corporation-to-peer. (i.e. me -> my bank -> PayPal -> your bank -> you)\n\nClosing:\nIf you want to stop a parasite, you have to stop feeding it. Don't feed the banks, because you are financing the erosion of democracy.\nStarve the cartel of money by exiting, and using peer-to-peer money.\n",
