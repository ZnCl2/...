Also i have created larger number of sites and offered ad/article space on them, but google then penalized it so sales went to zero. I think good is when person is skilled programmer, there are portals to offer the skills. Some money can be also made when one offer some unique and helpful service on the internet and advertise it on right on-topic places.",

All people are sinners, though what matter is i think reminding the love that was/is given to them, and then giving at least really small bits of that love to others. Staying close to the source of that love is essential, i am not doing that unfortunately. But it does not matter. What matter is that God is reliable power which will bring things to order and peace no matter what stupid people like me or politicians want.

Impact of porn is questionable, people have different opinion. Though i think that people should have the option not to see things that bother them (maybe demoralize them). So while porn lovers add porn in general (offtopic) sites without entitling it as a porn, there is my optional P0rnographyBl0cklist that may come handy for some. I wish zeronet add features which will allow better differentiate wanted/unwanted content on site like zerome and **@nofish: allow users to mute user only in particular site section (hide only from Everyone tab, but keep receiving notifications if user quote me or reply to mine followed post) or mute only on one site, not on whole zeronet (some users post good content on some sites and offending content on other)**",

On my non RPi4 server that is currently lagging and is in Tor:always mode, i am having like 90K file parts queued for download (i mean on ZeroHello site list it shows like it attempting download these). Also it is attempting to seed all optional files for the site that hosts hundreds of thousands file parts (500GB of small images). @Blurhy 👍 for others, the wiki article Criticism of ZN is [here](/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/?Page:criticism)\nPS: if anyone do not believe me what i am saying and is able to fix ZN (is developer), then i will spend time and let you know how to replicate this lag. But when you check the github issue i linked in the post and Blurhy's wiki article, i think you will get the idea.. My opinion is that ZN is not made to for a person with a regular or lower end computer to host 2000 zites, 500GB of optional fiels download queued and 1TB+ (hundreds of thousands files) already DLed. But nofish made some steps to speed up the ZN and i am grateful it not yet turned to be fully frozen and unusable. :P i am still there",
