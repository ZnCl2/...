The big man, who has more than 300 head subs ( equivalent to bar ) , posted on r\\/vaxxhappened claiming that the rumors were so abominable that Reddit administrators needed to take responsibility for cracking down on rumors and banning subs that spread them .\nBut some people also think that one is to follow the evil path of the Communist Party of China, betraying democratic freedom. There are even fears that the big man will use the outbreak to attack his dissidents.\nWhat do you think?",
