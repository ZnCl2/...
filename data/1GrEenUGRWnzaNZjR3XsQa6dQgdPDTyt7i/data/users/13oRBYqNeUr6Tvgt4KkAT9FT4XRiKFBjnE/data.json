Doesn't seem to be referenced in that doc\n\n> You have to either deal with people being dumb enough to install unverified plugins, or with lack of functions\n\nNo, that's not all options. Plugins could have been made safe (probably not with the kind of languages popular on 0net, but still). People can still install plugins, but at least it takes enough effort for them to realize what they're doing\n  \nOn the other hand, if site asks for permission to install \"PeerMessage plugin\", it would be so easy for people to click \"yes\"; while in reality it can be any malicious version of it",

			"body": "@Git Center: any crypto miner needs to connect to network, otherwise it can use all your cpu/gpu without any profit for its owner. Connecting to external internet should be a separate permission not to be granted lightly. Of course, it's still possible to send mining data (especially with peermessage or implementing same mechanism if we're talking about plugins) over 0net so that some node catches it and that would indeed be hard to distinguish from \"good\" PoW; perhaps tracking and limiting performance (for data sent over the net) might be the best here\n  \nBut what's more important, miners are neither damaging anything (unless your device can use more performance than its cooling system can handle), nor publishing your private info. If they are the only kind of unwanted software that can sneak past, i'd say it's good enough",

I do not think plugin system where plugins arbitrary enhance 0net experience is good in the first place. Code requiring core permissions should reside in core (and yes, i realize there's a problem of nofish or whoever else is/will be in charge may not merge it, but that's a separate problem), everything else should route data in safe manner (or, in exceptional cases, ask permission and have related code isolated and easily inspectable)",
