Otherwise, anyone could make a mess of your proxy.\n\nFor full access to zeronet it's easy to run your own node on Windows, Linux, Apple and Android. Then you can also run your own public or private proxy, and do whatever you want with it.\n\nI suggest we set up a **consortium of curated** zeronet public proxies to help **newbies** get started with zeronet. Zeronet is awesome..👍😀\n\n</pre>",

But maybe someone else can do it. No real coding. Just a matter of configuration.\n\nI run Zeronet on a laptop and through the Userland Android app. Through an ssh terminal session. In a Linux file system.\n\nThen all I have to do is 127.0.0.1:43110/\nIt works perfectly. Rock solid and robust. Minimal battery and resource usage. Try it if you're on Android. No root required. \n\nOf course root will give you more power. If you can handle it. \n\nI have some really Wild! ideas about how to integrate legacy centralized social media and federated social media through the Zeronet network..👹😆\n\n</pre>",

Then all you need is a clearnet search engine like DuckDuckGo. That's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI see no reason why you couldn't use Zeronet as a quasi DNS to centralized, free speech tolerant, legacy social media sites.\n\nThis would allow for a kind of zero-knowledge DNS. And resistance to take down. Then you could really kick some ass..🤭😆\n\n</pre>",
