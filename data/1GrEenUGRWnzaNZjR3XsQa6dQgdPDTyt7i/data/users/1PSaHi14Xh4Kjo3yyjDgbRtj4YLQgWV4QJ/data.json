For the people the incentives are such, that productivity is not rewarded and it thus leads to indifference and laziness. The current crisis showed also that a big part of the system in the West is socialist. For example the money. With the unlimited money printing, companies that were close to fail before the crisis receive big amounts of money. This debases the money for everybody. The common people who lose part of their wealth this way have no say in this process.",
