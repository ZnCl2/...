I am not sure if it is not too much work to create useful decentralized fulltext search for the Zeronet, but if it can be done to be returning search results quickly, then maybe create some simple front-end site where it return raw results, which user can filter entering must include, must exclude words to quickly narrow results, + - operators and full phrases wrapped by quotation marks.

			"body": "Communism to me feels just one of numerous ways the society \"wants\" to be managed. Communism failed in western countries (in some very miserably), that is why in these countries it sometimes target of bad publicity.\n\nPersonaly i think communism, autocracy is worse than democracy, because it gather too much power in the hands of leaders (who are inperfect people) and it is known that too much power in too low amount of people is not \"healthy\". In democracy there is some accountability because there is free press and free society. Politics know people will judge them and vote for others if they do bad or eventualy protest/rise to protect their freedoms. I do not like regimes that dictate one opinion and punish people for what they believe/Christians or just any people that point out about failures of the governing class.",

By the way I once read that the religion is not the primary cause of the terrorist attacks:\nhttps://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/what-motivates-suicide-bombers\nhttps://www.opendemocracy.net/arts/suicideterrorism_3836.jsp\nRegarding control of people mind by religion. Maybe partialy true, but it is absolute minority that there is some sect that really isolate and brainwash people to do crazy things. People are not stupid even if it look like that, the misuse of a religion for controlling people is known and happen, though that does not mean that for example the Christianity is bad. Pedo-afairs in religion does not mean Christianity is wrong/bad (i know you are not claiming that). ",

SOME religions only refuse research in small areas like \"opposition to research into embryonic stem cells\", and because of that saying something like \"religion prevents world progress\" is very unfair. Most countries leaders do not care about what some religious leaders want, religion can hardly prevent progress and it can be actualy beneficial (when people behave like it is taught in the Bible).",

Some to have influence and wealth, some to be educated, some to be a better person like Jesus Christ was. Each thing has its positive impact. I do not think it is a waste of my effort and time to be religious wanting to be better person according to Bible. Wrong, i think the religious people are not against scientific advantages and such. Being satisfied with what you have is important for your happiness and does not mean one resign on improving things further.",

I am not talking about miracles here, rather about feelings of extraordinary support or the help to be brave end endure tough things.
