<h2>Mother arrested for calling a trans person a man on Twitter</h2>

<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/02/10/uk-mother-arrested-in-front-of-children-for-calling-trans-person-a-man-on-twitter/">Direct link</a> - <a href="https://archive.fo/T7VeM">Archive link</a>

<blockquote>38-year-old Kate Scottow, of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, said she was “arrested in my home by three officers, with my autistic ten-year-old daughter and breastfed 20-month-old son present”</blockquote>

<blockquote>I was then detained for seven hours in a cell with no sanitary products (which I said I needed)</blockquote>

<p>So, according to the elites, posting some alleged insults on the Internet is worse than storming someone's house, kidnapping him in front of his children and throwing him into a cell unfit for an animal ("no sanitary products"). Imagine the stress on the chlidren, especially the breastfed one who's fully dependent on his mother after all. Not only that - she's had her <em>DNA and fingerprints taken</em>; say something the elites don't like? Prepare to go into their database and be "suspicious" forever! They also took away her laptop and mobile phone and didn't give it back after more than two months. But the most important thing is - as I spoke in <a href="../ghost/technological_slavery.html">technological slavery</a> - that this was <em>only allowed to happen</em> because that's the nature of the non-anonymous Internet. If this was said in real life, nothing could have happened to her. So the lesson is, <em>don't post anything attached to your real name</em> on the web. It might come back to bite you in the ass.</p>
