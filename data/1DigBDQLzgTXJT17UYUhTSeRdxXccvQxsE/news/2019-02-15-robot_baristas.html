<h2>Are robots better baristas? Berkeley's Bbox café thinks so</h2>

<a href="https://www.berkeleyside.com/2019/02/15/are-robots-better-baristas-berkeleys-bbox-cafe-thinks-so">Direct link</a> - <a href="https://archive.fo/LnDhn">Archive link</a>

<p>The replacement of people by robots continues (as I've <a href="../ghost/capitalism.html">written before</a>). The whole article goes to great lengths to deride us:</p>

<blockquote>That’s largely because Bbox has eliminated one of the most expensive elements of operating a business: labor.</blockquote>

<p>We're expensive and useless, see?</p>

<blockquote>But there is good news for those who prefer the familiarity of a first name basis with their favorite carbon-based baristas. The robots have names. “Jarvis” is the machine that positions orders for customer pickup</blockquote>

<p>But so you don't feel bad, we'll give the robots some humanity too.</p>

<blockquote>“It’s more efficient than having a normal barista do it by hand,” said Scelzi. “It knows how long it takes a cup to be filled. It knows where to place it.”</blockquote>

<p>And a person apparently doesn't know these things...</p>

<blockquote>While the company is in beta, visitors will likely interact with at least a few organic life forms at the registers. Just don’t call them baristas. </blockquote>

<p><q>Organic life forms</q> - how insulting. Why not just call us <em>people</em>?</p>

<p>Clearly, we are being conditioned to think we are inferior so that the robot revolution is accepted easier. What isn't mentioned is that the robot can <em>only execute a specific program</em> - don't expect anything responsive from them. But that is the way these cafes are supposed to be designed - you order "X" and get it, that's it - robbing you of the rich world of human communication. They also want to get into other markets:</p>

<blockquote>“We’d like to be able to do burgers and burritos and Chinese food,” he said. “Basically anything that there is like a QSR — a quick serve restaurant — or fast food restaurant that exists today, we would like to be able to do that as well.”</blockquote>

<p>And outcompete them:</p>

<blockquote>Becker hopes those eventual burrito and burger machines can serve a higher quality product than places like McDonald’s or Burger King, but for the same prices, or lower. </blockquote>

<p>So you can expect most food serving places to be mechanized soon. What does that entail? How about not being able to pay with cash:</p>

<blockquote>Customers place their order via Bbox’s mobile web app (an iOS app is in development) or via tablet outside the café. They create a customer profile, including phone number and payment information.</blockquote>

<p>We're being dehumanized and enslaved in the name of progress. How sad.</p>
