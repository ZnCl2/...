<h2>Uber used secret spyware to try to crush Australian start-up GoCatch</h2>

<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-18/uber-used-secret-spyware-to-try-and-crush-australian-start-up/10901120">Direct link</a> - <a href="https://archive.fo/QmHTX">Archive link</a>

<blockquote>GoCatch was a major competitor to Uber when the US company launched in Australia in 2012. At the time, both companies were offering a new way to book taxis and hire cars using a smartphone app.</blockquote>

<p>Two companies with competing products - just the free market at work.</p>

<blockquote>A former senior Uber employee has told Four Corners that the idea behind the use of the Surfcam spyware was to starve GoCatch of drivers.</blockquote>

<p>But one of them decided it will have none of it - there's space only for <em>one of them</em>!</p>

<blockquote>Surfcam allowed Uber Australia to see in real time all of the competitor cars online and to scrape data such as the driver's name, car registration, and so on.</blockquote>

<blockquote>GoCatch would lose customers due to poaching of its drivers draining their supply. With fewer and fewer drivers, GoCatch would eventually fold," the former Uber employee said.</blockquote>

<p>And so, they developed a program to steal the competing company's clients.</p>

<blockquote>The damage that that has done to GoCatch and other businesses is significant and frankly it should have been stopped.</blockquote>

So the government should have intervened in the <em>free market</em>? Heresy.

<blockquote>Surfcam was part of an aggressive strategy Uber pursued under co-founder Travis Kalanick to establish itself globally amid fierce opposition from authorities and the taxi industry.</blockquote>

<p>A company wanted to kill its opposition? Impossible.</p>

<blockquote>Mr Campbell believes local authorities failed to protect Australian companies with the existing laws when Uber entered the country.</blockquote>

<p>As is it supposed to happen under the free market, isn't it? The point is, <em>the anarcho-capitalist utopia cannot exist</em>! If companies are allowed to do whatever they want, they will use <em>every dirty trick available</em> to bury the competition. It's not the better product that wins under anarcho-capitalism (contrary to their claims), but the one that's <em>better able to impose itself onto the competition</em> - such as by aggressive / false advertising, <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/david-and-goliath-battle-prompted-predatory-pricing-probe-into-westjet-flair-ceo-1.4214887">predatory pricing</a> <a href="https://archive.fo/90q10">(archive)</a>, showrooming (<q>Amazon’s new smartphone, called Fire (apparently meant in the sense of “shoot to kill”), is specifically designed to make showrooming fast and easy. Amazon has even offered $5 rebates to shoppers who scan items at stores, then buy them from the online brute.</q>), <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/details-from-news-corps-latest-ad-hacking-scandal-alleges-execs-used-al-capone-as-a-role-model-2012-12">hacking</a> <a href="https://archive.fo/EqCcc">(archive)</a>, or simply <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3241707">buying them out</a> <a href="https://archive.fo/FLfHT">(archive)</a>. I've even heard of companies literally hiring random people off the street to throw trash or make noise around a rival's place - and these are <em>small, local</em> ones - the anarcho-capitalist's dream...Anyway, back to Uber:</p>

<blockquote>An Uber Australian spokeswoman said the company had conducted an audit of the use of Surfcam and it has been prohibited.</blockquote>

<p>So you've killed the competition and now are withdrawing the dirty tactics (since you don't need them anymore). Hooray for the free market!</p>

<blockquote>
"We are on record consistently welcoming competition; we have robust policies and guidelines which define acceptable and ethical practices across our global operations for the use of non-confidential, publicly available and commercially available information in compliance with relevant Australian and international law."
</blockquote>

<p>Yawn. PR-talk of which even Mozilla would be proud.</p>
