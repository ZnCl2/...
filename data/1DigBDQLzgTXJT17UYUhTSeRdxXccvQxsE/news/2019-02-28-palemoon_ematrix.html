<h2>Pale Moon gets an uMatrix fork</h2>

<a href="https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/ematrix/">Direct link (to the extension)</a>

<p>Let's have some positive news for a change. Up until now, only Chrome based and Firefox based browsers supported uMatrix. So you had to deal with big corpo bullshit if you wanted to use it, and since it's pretty much an <a href="../ghost/addons.html">essential addon</a>...But now Pale Moon also has it, and the <em>Google / Mozilla duopoly is officially broken</em>. Pale Moon is a fork of a very old FF version, but has diverged so far that it develops its own engine and so is independent of Mozilla. It also has many other advantages over Google's and Mozilla's browsers. I've got it somewhat wrong when I shat on it in my <a href="https://digdeeper.neocities.org/news/browsers.html">browser article</a>, and I will be modifying it soon. Regardless, rejoice!</p>
