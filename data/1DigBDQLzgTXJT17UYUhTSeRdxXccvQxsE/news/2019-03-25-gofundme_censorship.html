<h2>GoFundMe bans anti-vaxxer funding campaigns to curb misinformation</h2>

<p>Let's first look at how GoFundMe advertises itself on their website:</p>

<blockquote>Free fundraising for the people and causes you care about</blockquote>

<p>Unless it's causes you don't agree with, huh? Now from the news piece:</p>

<blockquote>Crowdfunding platform GoFundMe has banned campaigns that seek funds for spreading misinformation related to vaccines, the company has revealed</blockquote>

<p>Misinformation is a code word for <em>information we don't like and want to remove from existence.</em> Mozilla knows a lot about this stuff...</p>

<blockquote>An increasing number of tech companies have cracked down on anti-vaccination content, including Facebook and Pinterest, and now GoFundMe is among them. </blockquote>

<p>Yes, there is a massive censorship campaign not only against anti-vaccine material, but many other alternative theories. Unfortunately, even <em>regular people</em> - which claim to hate censorship - suddenly switch sides when presented with information they don't like. For those, let me share this poem:</p>

<blockquote>
    First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.

    Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a trade unionist.

    Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.

    Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
</blockquote>

<p>What people don't understand is that this issue isn't about vaccination at all, or even censorship altogether. The real point is: big online corpos can <em>pull the rug from under your feet</em>, and there's nothing whatsoever you can do since they own the platforms. That is the thing we should fight first, since it is the root of the problem - see <a href="https://digdeeper.neocities.org/news/botnet.html">Avoiding "The Botnet" - impossible?</a></p>
