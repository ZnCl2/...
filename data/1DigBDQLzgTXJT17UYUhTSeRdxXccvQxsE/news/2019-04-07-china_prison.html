<h2>How China Turned a City Into a Prison</h2>

<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/04/world/asia/xinjiang-china-surveillance-prison.html">Direct link</a>

<p>Wasn't supposed to do news for a while, but since a friend graciously did a great writeup, I will just link to it here: <a href="https://rainheaven.neocities.org/news/2019.04.07-china-surveillance-prison.html">https://rainheaven.neocities.org/news/2019.04.07-china-surveillance-prison.html</a>. No archive link since the news piece is in video format, so it would do nothing. All I will add is that a lot of this stuff I've predicted in <a href="https://digdeeper.neocities.org/news/technological_slavery.html">Technological slavery</a> (but this time humans had their hand in it directly as well). More of this and worse is coming to your country soon.</p>
