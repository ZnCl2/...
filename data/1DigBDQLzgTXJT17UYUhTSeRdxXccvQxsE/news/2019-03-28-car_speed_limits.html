<h2>Road safety: UK set to adopt vehicle speed limiters</h2>

<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47715415">Direct link</a> - <a href="https://archive.fo/bOyzr">Archive link</a>

<p>Just another assault on our freedom and a march towards complete <a href="../ghost/technological_slavery.html">Technological slavery</a>.</p>

<blockquote>EU Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska said: "Every year, 25,000 people lose their lives on our roads. The vast majority of these accidents are caused by human error.</blockquote>

<p>Well guess what - <q>A recent Johns Hopkins study claims more than 250,000 people in the U.S. die every year from medical errors. Other reports claim the numbers to be as high as 440,000.</q> Where are the "EU Commisioners" calling for the ban on doctors? The 250,000 figure is from the US, while the 25,000 is from the whole EU. Taking size into account, the medical deaths still score way higher than the road ones - so since it is not about our safety, then what?</p>

<blockquote>Under the new rules, cars will also be fitted with compulsory data recorders, or "black boxes". </blockquote>

<p><em>That</em>. Simply, everything you do inside your car is supposed to be recorded, and safety is just an excuse. There's something else still:</p>

<blockquote> You can force people to slow down, you can watch what they're doing, you can help them with emergency braking - but you can't get rid of basic bad driving. Unless, of course, you have self-driving cars.</blockquote>

<p>Last sentence is the key - this is just another step to get people used to having less control over their vehicles. And ultimately, it will end with <em>a total lack of control</em> over your self-driving car. Boiling frog strategy - the same one that <a href="../ghost/mozilla.html">Mozilla</a> has used to control their users' browsing.</p>
