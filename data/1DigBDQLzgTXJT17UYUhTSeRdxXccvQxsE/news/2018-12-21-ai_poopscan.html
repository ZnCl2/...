<blockquote>Imagine smart toilets in the future that will be analyzing human waste in real time every day. You don't need to be going to visit a physician every six months. If any sign of disease starts showing up, you'll be able to catch it much faster because of urine analysis and stool analysis.</blockquote>

<p>Again, more <a href="../ghost/technological_slavery.html">technological slavery</a>. Will this actually help people? I can imagine it being used to scare you into thinking you've got some imaginary disease and need an expensive drug. Even if it is not intented to be used this way, it will be easier to worry about some disease you allegedly have if you are reminded about something being wrong every time you take a shit. And stress is the biggest killer, as they say.</p>
