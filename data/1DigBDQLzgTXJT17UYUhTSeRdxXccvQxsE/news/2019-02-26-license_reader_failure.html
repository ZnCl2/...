<h2>Privacy advocate held at gunpoint after license plate reader database mistake, lawsuit alleges</h2>

<blockquote>Bay Area police pulled over a California privacy advocate and held him at gunpoint after a database error caused a a license plate reader to flag a car as stolen</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hofer alleges that an officer had a gun drawn and told him and his brother to exit the rental car, and that a deputy injured his brother by throwing him to the ground.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The suit alleges the officers then searched the car without consent</blockquote>

<p>So, a person was threatened with a gun, got his car searched and brother injured - all because an automatic plate reader fucked up. Shows the folly of relying on technology to detect "crime". You can expect these types of incidents to increase massively after the intelligent camera system I've described in <a href="../ghost/technological_slavery.html">Technological slavery</a> becomes commonplace.</p>
