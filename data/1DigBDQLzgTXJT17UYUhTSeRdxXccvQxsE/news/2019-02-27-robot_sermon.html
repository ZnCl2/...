<p>The conditioning of humans to bow down to their robot overlords continues! The transhumanist cult has tried for a really long time to get people to accept the idea of merging with the machine. That's why they didn't even bother putting skin on the android, so you can see all his electronic stuff sticking out. Anyway, let's look at some of the quotes:
</p>

<blockquote>The android, dubbed Kannon, is based on the traditional Buddhist deity of mercy and is designed to attract young people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Managers at the ancient venue approached Professor Ishiguro in a bid to connect with Japan's youth. </blockquote>

<p>So, the point is to use religion to indoctrinate young impressionable people with transhumanism. But let's also think about the deeper implications. The robot knows two languages and can conceivably know more (maybe even all the world's languages?). Recall the holograms from the video game Deus Ex Invisible War? One of them had a singer who you were able to talk to...and the hologram was put in many places in the world <em>in order to collect information for the government.</em> It's easy to imagine the same thing happening in the real world with these robots to spread propaganda, for example. And the novelty of it will surely claim some victims at first, while later it will simply be accepted as an everyday thing like regular advertisements. Mind-control and transhumanism...can you say two birds with one stone?</p>
