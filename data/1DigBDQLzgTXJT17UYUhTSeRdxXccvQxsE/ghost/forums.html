<h2>Forum Classification Project</h2>

<p>Hey, we're already rating browsers, mail providers, addons...so why not forums? After all, since most of the discussion has moved to giant corpo platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, it is particularly important to find a way to separate yourself from those. The most important criteria will be <em>what is required to register and post</em>. Why is recaptcha so penalized? Simply, <em>it is heavily exploitative</em> - pretty much making you into a dog performing tricks for its master ("Hey Spike, show me the fire hydrants! Good boy...now the crosswalks!"). And if you screw up, it's back to the drawing board, you bad doggie you. You have no idea when the reward (being allowed to register) is coming either - maybe your master will be forgiving and force you to perform only three tricks this time? <font color="orange">Low tier</font> is the best rating a forum with recaptcha can get.</p>

<p>Why is blocking anonymizers penalized even more? Because it makes connecting everything you do on the forum to your real identity that much easier. You know, these days <a href="../news/2019-02-10-mother_arrested.html">people even get arrested</a> for comments that the rulers didn't like - and with a VPN, they could have avoided it. Therefore, if the admins include that "feature", it pretty much means they're supporting this <a href="technological_slavery.html">Technological slavery</a> system. Any forum that has forced deanonymization will not get a rating higher than <font color="darkorange">Very low</font> - leaving space for Shit if it has other flaws.</p>

<p>Other criteria taken into account are the privacy (aside from the anonymizer issue - such as asking for your real name), quality of moderation (penalizing arbitrary censorship / micromanagement of your posts), amount of activity, quality of discussion, JavaScript dependence, and anything else that comes to mind. But even if a forum scores well in the above categories, it won't reach <font color="yellow">Mid tier</font> as long as it exploits people with anonymizer blocking or recaptcha. Anonymization was tested with SigaVPN or RiseUp - more popular VPN and / or Tor might still be blocked; if you encounter that - e-mail me so I can modify the ratings. If you have any additional data for any forum listed here (or a new one), e-mail me as well so I can add it.</p>

<h3>General forums</h3>

<h4>8chan</h4>

<p>This used to be a great imageboard I've loved posting on. Unfortunately, they recently <em>have been framed</em> into allegedly having a killer post on their boards (when in reality he posted his manifesto on Instagram and it was simply reposted by someone else). Their CDN (the evil <a href="https://codeberg.org/crimeflare/cloudflare-tor">CloudFlare</a>) then took it down because of an alleged harm caused by 8chan (despite hosting <a href="http://www.crimeflare.org:82/carders.html">actual criminals</a>). I wanted to wait this whole situation out, thinking they will just get a new CDN within a few days (the admin posted an encouraging message on his twitter <q>We are using the downtime now to scale 8chan's servers, networking, and software to be stronger for when we come back online.</q>) but it hasn't happened and likely won't - and that's because <q>8chan is voluntarily down until Jim attends a congressional hearing. The date is September 5th.</q> He wil have to explain the situation with the alleged shooters posting on 8chan and probably be probed with a million other questions. This used to be a <em style="color:lime">top tier board</em> that will now likely die (or become government-controlled) because the elites <em>hated actual free speech</em> and decided to bury it. The users have scattered around in many different places that are <em>not quite the same</em>. We're losing the internet, and fast.</p>

<h4>4chan</h4>

<p>Same format as 8chan (but introduced <em>persistent IDs</em> five years ago, nullifying the anonymous aspect at least on the /pol/ board). Recaptcha for <em>every fucking post</em> - can a forum be any more exploitative? Paying for a 4chan pass can avoid Recaptcha and give you an access to a premium board (yawn). Blocks Tor, VPN and proxies. <a href="https://archive.fo/LAKnE">Used to include malware</a>. Cannot do much without JavaScript enabled - not even view the catalog. Uses Google Analytics. The only saving grace of this forum is the huge activity. <font color="red">Shit tier</font>.</p>

<h4>Reddit</h4>

<p>Recaptcha required to register. Absolutely terrible <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy-may-25-2018">privacy policy</a> - pretty much a datamining operation, like <a href="mozilla.html">Mozilla Firefox</a>. For the first few days you will have random delays preventing you from posting at all. Reddit <a href="https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/quarantined-subreddits">censors subreddits with alternative information</a> <a href="http://archive.fo/To42K">(archive)</a>, such as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/9jgft8/911truth_has_been_quarantined/">9/11 truth subreddit</a> <a href="http://archive.fo/moHf9">(archive)</a>. Also has literal bots moderating the boards (for example, deleting posts with the word "VPN" in them and threatening their posters). New UI is shit but can be changed; with the old UI, you can at least read the site with JavaScript disabled, but still cannot post. However, Reddit - unlike 4chan - <em>allows posting through VPN</em>. Downvote system makes it easy to bury posts that buckle the trend, creating a culture of conformity. Huge activity saves this one too. <font color="darkorange">Very low tier</font>.</p>

<h4>Raddle.me</h4>

<p>Reddit alternative. Registration requires only an username and a password (plus solving a simple text captcha). E-mail is optional if you want the option to reset your password. Absolute zero third party requests. IP is stored for 7 days but you can use a VPN and they provide an onion as well. Decently high activity but can't compare to Reddit of course. Has downvote system as well but unlike at Reddit, the posts are not automatically hidden. Warning: <em>HEAVILY LEFTIST</em> and of the bad (SJW) type - it has a section with a description of <q>Death to whiteness</q>, for crying out loud. Despite alleging to dislike <q>accusing others of malicious acts</q>, they will jump on you like rabid dogs for posting an opinion they don't like (though often in a roundabout way, since they are too weak to confront you directly). They criticize reddit for banning leftist subs for "no reason", but do the same to the users on their forum. If you're used to independent thought, forget about it - Raddle is a total echo chamber. Logic is scarce in any topic relating to feminism, sexism, homosexuality and all their other favorite victimhood issues. They even have a bot going around <a href="https://raddle.me/f/Ability/55653/languagebot-list-of-ableist-words">censoring certain words</a> <a href="http://archive.fo/jRZAR">(archive)</a>, which include <q>stupid</q>, <q>lame</q> and <q>dumb</q> - but they themselves have no issue with calling someone a piece of shit or telling him to fuck himself. I could go on...this might be Raddle's only real flaw, but it's massive. That flaw, though, also allows you to discuss stuff you rarely can elsewhere, like shoplifting or anti-capitalism. But you can get most of the same in 8chan's leftypol board, with way saner people. I way misjugded these guys at the beginning - this is a disgusting, hypocritical, hateful bunch. In the end, I can't with good conscience give Raddle anything higher than <font color="orange">Low tier</font>.</p>

<h4>Slashdot</h4>

<p>Recaptcha and real name - no thanks. Also does not allow the deletion of your account. Can be decent for reading though. <font color="orange">Low tier</font></p>

<h4>Hacker News</h4>

<p>JS-free registration and posting with not even an E-mail requirement. No third party requests. Comments appear immediately. <em>Gigantic</em> activity - a thread almost every minute (which can make it hard to find the interesting ones, though there's an upvote system). Might bump this up to Top when I post more and am able to ascertain their moderation, the general attitude (is it an echo chamber?), Update: no, it's staying at High. Simply because, despite HN's alleged focus on "quality posting", 90+% of the threads are big corpo tier trash. <font color="greenyellow">High tier</font></p>

<h4>Voat.co</h4>

<p>Another reddit alternative alleging itself to be user-respecting - and then it throws a recaptcha in your face. Not researching this crap anymore. Even though it might actually be worse than that, I'll just dump it into <font color="orange">Low tier</font>.</p>

<h3>Linux forums</h3>

<h4>SalixOS</h4>

<p>Oh, how the mighty have fallen. From the most user respecting to the least - recaptcha AND mod approval for a forum with almost zero activity (lol). What can I say? It still allows posting through the VPN? Decent privacy policy...whatever, I'm so disappointed since the distro is so good. But nothing with a recaptcha will get even a Mid rating. <font color="orange">Low tier</font>.</p>

<h4>Ubuntu Forums</h4>

<p>Asks for your real name, recaptcha AFTER you've already bothered to activate your e-mail, runs a datamining operation. Don't be fooled - this is a big corpo forum with big corpo policies (slave-like code of conduct). <font color="red">Shit tier</font>.</p>

<h4>Fedora Forum</h4>

<p>No captcha, VPN allowed for registration and posting. No mod approval - immediate creation of posts and threads even for a new user. Fully usable without JavaScript. Privacy policy is OK but pretty lacking (doesn't state the duration for which your data is stored) - though at least there's no litany of third-parties that will get your stuff, which I guess they would mention otherwise. There's no personal data asked for either except maybe the country which you can fake. Sounds great, right? Well check this out: </p>

<blockquote>when you post a message, upload a file, or otherwise provide us with material for display on the website, you are granting FedoraForum.org a royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to:

1. Use, copy, sublicense, adapt, transmit, publicly perform or display any such communication.
2. Sublicense to third parties the unrestricted right to exercise any of the foregoing rights granted with respect to the communication.
</blockquote>

<p>And the cat's out of the bag! You give up ownership of anything you share on the forum at all. And that, despite everything else, sends Fedora Forum to <font color="yellow">Mid tier</font>.</p>

<h4>Arch Linux Forum</h4>

<p>Captcha requires usage of Linux command line (lol). VPN allowed for registration and posting. No mod approval for accounts or the first post. No JS required. No third party requests. OK privacy policy. High activity. Elitist as fuck culture with a very restrictive "code of conduct" (for example - politics, religion, sports, rant threads are BANNED). As well as a bunch of other ways to micromanage the way you post - covering everything from bumping old threads and how to properly answer questions to image sizes and grammar. They even "discourage" recommendation threads, lol. I have no idea, though, how all that is enforced in practice. Check <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewforum.php?id=36">here</a> to see the kinds of threads that get deleted. Wanted to give High at the beginning since the technical stuff is so good, but the people side (actual reason we come to a forum anyway) leaves a lot to be desired. <font color="yellow">Mid tier</font>.</p>

<h4>Linux Questions; Linux.org; Linux Mint; Kali Linux; KDE forum</h4>

<p>Recaptcha. Didn't research further so could have other issues. <font color="orange">Low tier</font>.</p>

<h3>Other software / tech forums</h3>

<h4>Pale Moon forum</h4>

<p>Cloudflared. Solving simple (first-party) captcha required for registration; VPN allowed. Does not accept disposable e-mail or cock.li. First post has to be approved by the moderator. Decent privacy policy, but - <q>In principle we store data only for as long as is reasonably necessary/commonly practiced to operate our sites and services.</q> And this can mean anything. At least it doesn't share your data with third parties. The regulars suffer from attitude problems, and threads critizing them or their browser are <a href="https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=21514&start=20">randomly closed</a> <a href="https://archive.fo/k47MR">(archive)</a> despite not being inflammatory. <font color="yellow">Mid tier</font>.</p>

<h4>Bitcointalk; Torminatorr</h4>

<p>Recaptcha; didn't research further - <font color="orange">Low tier</font>.</p>

<h4>Cracking Paradox</h4>

<P>Does not allow registration through VPN. Don't know anything more about it. <font color="darkorange">Very low tier</font>.</P>

<h3>Other forums</h3>

<h4>MensTennisForums</h4>

<p>Good forum not only about tennis. Allows VPN, has good moderation... Who cares though - it has recaptcha (don't think it had one when I registered) and a shitload of google and other trackers. Would really like to give it at least Mid, since the community is truly great - but I can't support exploitation. <font color="orange">Low tier</font></p>

<h4>Disroot forum</h4>

<p>Registration requires a written justification, but that's much better than a recaptcha. Unfortunately requires JavaScript for any kind of interaction. Very low activity, and what's there consists mostly of reporting problems with the Disroot services. Allows VPN and has a great privacy policy; doesn't make a single third-party request either. Still, with activity so low as to be almost dead, I can only put it in <font color="yellow">Mid tier</font>.</p>

<h4>Final Fantasy Shrine</h4>

<p>Video game music forum (mostly). Registration through a text-captcha; VPN posting allowed, no mod approval or other hassle. Lots and lots of VGM to download. Doesn't seem to do much censorship. Kind of low activity aside from the download sections obviously. Otherwise, as far as I can see - <font color="greenyellow">High tier</font>.</p>

<h4>Sportsbookreview; David Icke; Psience Quest</h4>

<p>Recaptcha; didn't research further - <font color="orange">Low tier</font>.</p>

<h4>Prison Planet</h4>

<p>Admin account approval. Haven't been approved in a few days, assuming either the VPN or the riseup e-mail was the cause. <font color="darkorange">Very low tier</font>.</p>

<h4>Ray Peat Forum</h4>

<p>Community is good, but cannot register through VPN - <font color="darkorange">Very low tier</font>.</p>

<h4>SMW Central</h4>

<p>Enforces a Cloudflare browser check that needs JavaScript and cookies to pass. ReCaptcha required to sign up. <font color="darkorange">Very low tier</font></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The only one I really recommend from the above list is 8chan, HN and perhaps FFshrine - it has seemingly no flaws but the not-too-high activity and narrow focus. Sad to say it seems forums are dead - try to find interesting people to talk with directly (like through XMPP).</p>
