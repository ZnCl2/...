<h2>Site Update Log</h2>

<h3>Dead</h3>

<h4>13 / 03 / 2019</h4>

<p>Made the News section into a much more readable format (one news entry for one html file) and hooked them up to the Atom feed. Now you will be notified of any new news I shit out. Try it! I recommend the Liferea RSS client.</p>

<h4>12 / 03 / 2019</h4>

<p>I've finally added an Atom feed for the site! This will be a much more convenient way to notify you of updates. Anytime an article gets updated, you will receive a notification in your RSS client if you are subscribed (as in, the article will show up as unread again). And I can just add a snippet of info during every update which will tell you what has changed in that particular article. Much better than just throwing it all in a massive update log. And with that, the update log will probably be deprecated soon - when I manage to hook up the news section to the Atom feed as well.</p>

<h4>08 / 03 / 2019</h4>

<p>Image and text sharing sections added to the Ninja guide.</p>

<h4>07 / 03 / 2019</h4>

<p>In a sudden burst of motivation I started writing the <a href="ninja.html">Ninja's guide to the Internet</a>. This is meant to be a condensed version of everything relevant to Internet privacy (browsers, addons, E-mail, etc...). Since I thought such a guide doesn't really exist, there it is. It's not finished, so watch out for changes.</p>

<h4>02 / 03 / 2019</h4>

<p>Put up tables of contents in the browser and <a href="addons.html">addon</a> articles. The addon article also had lots of Pale Moon-specific information added in (and will have to include even more later, since it has extensions specifically made for it).</p>

<h4>01 / 03 / 2019</h4>

<p>HUGE update to the <a href="browsers.html">browser article</a>! Completely reconsidered my process and the resulting choices. Also way expanded my reviews and added Librefox.</p>

<h4>24 / 02 / 2019</h4>

<p>Cleaned up the index page. Made separate pages for stuff that was clogging up the view. Made the link font smaller since the big one was quite an unnecessary eye-rape. Not much motivation for a bigger article right now so I will be sticking to news. But I do have lots of stuff I want to write about still - all I need is that one spark which should come soon enough...</p>

<h4>09 / 02 / 2019</h4>

<p>I'm starting the News section! Instead of modifying my older articles all the time, I will comment on anything I encounter that interests me in this section. This will also allow me to update more frequently, since I won't always have to create another huge article just for a piece of news. Then, if it supports the stuff I've said in some of my articles, I will mention that as well. Starting with <q>Kenyan government mandates DNA linked national ID</q> and also dumped some old but relevant AI news there (that were in the AI article before).</p>

<h4>07 / 02 / 2019</h4>

<p>Paranoid.email added to the E-mail report.</p>

<h4>04 / 02 / 2019</h4>

<p>Added a review of Virtua Tennis 4 for the PS Vita.</p>

<h4>19 / 01 / 2019</h4>

<h4>17 / 01 / 2019</h4>

<p>The promised <a href="capitalismcancer.html">Capitalism - The Cancer that eats everything</a> article is up - though only two sections are available right now.</p>

<h4>13 / 01 / 2019</h4>

<p>In the meantime, Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies has been added to <a href="shortgamereviews.html">Short video game reviews</a>.</p>

<h4>09 / 01 / 2019</h4>

<p>Milux has kindly translated "How to choose a browser for everyday use?" into Polish! <a href="browserspl.html">Check it out here</a>. BTW, I'm writing a new article about capitalism, but not putting it up yet.</p>

<h4>05 / 01 / 2019</h4>

<h4>23 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>And now all of them.</p>

<h4>22 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>Archived some of the links that weren't yet.</p>

<p>Wrote subsection <q>Second head of Google</q></p>

<h4>17 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>Started writing Mozilla's Endgame</p>

<h4>16 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>Wrote the <q>What would Mozilla do</q> section; now only the Endgame remains!</p>

<h4>15 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>Wrote the <q>Mozilla's doublespeak</q> section.</p>

<h4>14 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>Refuted Principles 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Mozilla manifesto - which means the whole thing is now covered.</p>

<h4>13 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>Refuted Principle 5 of the Mozilla manifesto.</p>

<h4>12 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>Refuted Principle 4 of the Mozilla manifesto.</p>

<p>Archived the links in that section and fixed some HTML mistakes.</p>

<p>Started writing "Refuting the manifesto" section in Mozilla - Devil Incarnate.</p>

<h4>09 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>And archived the links in there</p>

<h4>08 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>Added subsection "Long time volunteer DISRESPECTED AND BANNED".</p>

<h4>07 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>Cleaned up and added some information to that section.</p>

<h4>06 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>Added a section "Shitty developer attitude" to the Mozilla article.</p>

<h4>05 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>Modified the other themes as well. Re-add them to Stylus if you use them to see the changes.</p>

<h4>04 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>Cleaned up the HTML and CSS. Now using header tags instead of classes. The reading space has been narrowed since some people said it's hard to read. Some colors have been changed, like the link color. Just the main theme has been modified so far.</p>

<h4>03 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<p>Heavily improved the Shady marketing section - now it focuses more on specifying the marketing tactics used and how they affect you. Archived the links as well.</p>

<h4>02 / 12 / 2018 </h4>

<p>Wrote the "Shady marketing" section.</p>

<h4>01 / 12 / 2018</h4>

<h4>27 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Finished the <q>Freedom is slavery</q> section of <a href = "mozilla.html">Mozilla - Devil Incarnate</a>. It is long and, in my opinion, <em>very</em> damning to Mozilla indeed!</p>

<h4>26 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>FastMail added to the <a href="email.html">E-mail report</a>.</p>

<h4>25 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<h4>24 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>WebRTC Control added to the list of <a href="addons.html">recommended addons</a>. It is really important to use it with a VPN or Tor; so it is listed right there after uMatrix.</p>

<h4>23 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>I've been meaning to write this one for a long time - but put it off for some reason. Actually, I just knew it would be a gargantuan task - but I simply couldn't take Mozilla's abuse anymore (despite not using their software), so there it is: <a href = "mozilla.html">Mozilla - Devil Incarnate</a>. Just one section is finished for now, but the others will soon be coming.</p>

<h4>22 / 11/ 2018</h4>

<p>The providers in the <a href="email.html">E-mail report</a> have been arranged roughly from worst to best; a navigation panel was also added at the top.</p>

<h4>21 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Autistici's section has been written. Shortened the summary since most of that information really shouldn't have been there - it was only relevant to RiseUp and Autistici, respectively.</p>

<h4>20 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>RiseUp has been split from Autistici and thoroughly reviewed. Yet to finish Autistici.</p>

<h4>19 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Disroot section got the treatment it deserves (positively!)</p>

<h4>18 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Same as below + added a small summary at the end of Dismail's section.</p>

<h4>17 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Updated Dismail section in the <a href="email.html">E-mail report</a>. Also slightly modified some other sections.</p>

<h4>16 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>An <em>Additional AI developments</em> section added to <a href="ai.html">The dangers of artificial intelligence</a> article. There I will include recent news about AI that happened after I wrote the article, to further support the conclusion made in it. I will be adding them as soon as I come across interesting ones, so check the article for updates often. 3 pretty worrying examples for a start.</p>

<h4>15 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Teknik now has actual analysis of its privacy policy, and it's knocked down a peg.</p>

<h4>14 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>StartMail's section updated. Posteo described as the best paid service; earlier I thought it was StartMail, but after carefully considering everything, Posteo is slightly better.</p>

<h4>13 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Cock has been enlarged (dumb joke for the day...). I was way too harsh on it; might be the best choice aside from the three community-run e-mail providers.</p>

<h4>12 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Scryptmail's section expanded.</p>

<h4>11 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>ProtonMail's turn today!</p>

<h4>10 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Tutanota's section heavily enhanced.</p>

<h4>09 / 11/ 2018</h4>

<P>Hushmail added to the <a href="email.html">E-mail report</a>.</P>

<h4>08 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Removed spaces from links that weren't supposed to be there.</p>

<h4>07 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Huge update today! The <a href="email.html">E-mail report</a> has had its VFEmail and Safe-Mail.nl sections heavily updated; another provider - Posteo - has been thoroughly reviewed as well. Changed the "rice" pictures in <a href="linux.html">Linux Essentials</a> to prettier ones (that's really how my system looks right now); information about torsocks has also been added. Removed the "add new panel for clock" thing because it isn't really useful; instead, replaced it with a generic panel section. All the styles have had the max-width parameter set for images - this means a big one won't stretch the screen (forcing you to scroll) anymore.</p>

<h4>06 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Mailfence section heavily expanded in the <a href="email.html">E-mail report</a>.</p>

<h4>05 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>A <em>feature creep</em> section added to <a href="design.html">Principles of bad software design</a>.</p>

<h4>04 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Mentioned the EFAIL attack in the <a href="email.html">E-mail report</a>.</p>

<h4>03 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>Claws Mail added to <a href="software.html">software recommendations</a>.</p>

<h4>02 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>No content updates. Changed the title of  <a href="fake_initiatives.html">fake initiatives article</a> to the new one. Fixed wrongly formatted archive links where the space was part of the link (I really couldn't let that shit slide...). Deleted the old, unused files.</p>

<h4>01 / 11 / 2018</h4>

<p>The <a href="fake_initiatives.html">fake initiatives article</a> has had a section on external link filters added.</p>

<h4>31 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>The <a href="email.html">E-mail report</a> now has a proper introduction; also, a section on encryption got added at the end.</p>

<h4>30 / 10  2018</h4>

<p><a href="sidmeierspirates.html">Sid Meier's Pirates</a> article got another lift - I clarified some of the minigames, and elaborated on just WHY is this game so good instead of simply listing what you can do in it. However I've also noticed a flaw that I had to mention if I'm aiming to be a honest reviewer. Added a small snippet to the Claire section in the <a href="addons.html">addon guide</a>. The <a href="email.html">E-mail report</a> had its Disroot section updated. Grammar has been fixed in some of the articles.</p>

<h4>29 / 10  2018</h4>

<p>Expanded the game review.</p>

<h4>28 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Welcome to the new and hopefully mainstay video game section! First up - <a href="sidmeierspirates.html">Sid Meier's Pirates!</a></p>

<h4>27 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>I have made the names of the addons into links in the <a href="addons.html">addon guide</a> - at least the recommended ones.</p>

<h4>26 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>A section has been added to <a href="design.html">Principles of bad software design</a>. The program names in <a href="software.html">Useful Linux software you might not know about</a> are now links to the websites of the program in question.</p>

<h4>25 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Stylus added to the list of <a href="addons.html">recommended addons</a>.</p>

<h4>24 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>No content updates - but a new theme! Check it out, it might look familiar...</p>

<h4>23 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>As promised - dumped the sand and ice themes; you can download them as styles for use in the Stylus extension, though. Added a section to the <a href="fake_initiatives.html">fake initiatives article</a> - "Hidden or forced updates". <a href="capitalism.html">Capitalism</a> and <a href="ai.html">AI</a> articles now have subtitles breaking them up; should be easier to read.</p>

<h4>22 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Cleaned up the index pages. Every article has been put in one of three categories instead of crammed together; though many of them could fit into two or even three, I assigned them to the one they fit the most. Forgot Neomailbox link in the <a href="email.html">E-mail report</a> - it is now in; as well as some grammar improvements. Note: I will most likely <em>be removing the sand and ice themes</em> from the site. Updating and uploading stuff three times is simply too much pain in the ass (style switching <em>really</em> needs CGI, I guess...). Ghost theme looks the best of these - the others will be released as styles for use in the Stylus extension, so they won't completely die; I will also be able to make more styles that way someday.</p>

<h4>21 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Mailfence and Neomailbox added to the <a href="email.html">E-mail report</a>. New article is up! <a href="fake_initiatives.html">Fake privacy (or other) initiatives</a>. I think the name says it all...enjoy reading!</p>

<h4>20 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Not much motivation today. Only archived the links in the <a href="email.html">E-mail report</a>.</p>

<h4>19 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>HUGE update to the <a href="email.html">E-mail report</a>. Most sections heavily expanded upon. Every provider name can also now be clicked on to send you to their website. And yet more improvements will be coming. </p>

<h4>18 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Improved the sand theme - no more <em>puke green</em>. Why was it there in the first place? Well, I designed the theme under redshift, and it looked fine there - not so with regular blue light though.</p>

<h4>17 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Added sections on safe-mail.net and safe-mail.nl to <a href="email.html">E-mail providers - which one to choose?</a> Further modifications coming soon...</p>

<h4>16 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Archived links in <a href="ai.html">The dangers of artificial intelligence</a>. Centered the lists since the CSS default is 40px to the right, and that's fucking ugly. Fixed a background style mistake (two different colors) in the sand theme. Now I can go back to actual creative work...hopefully.</p>

<h4>15 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Added archive links to <a href="capitalism.html">Capitalism will die - but will it take us with it?</a></p>

<h4>14 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Added archive links to <a href="botnet.html">Avoiding "The Botnet" - impossible?</a>. Next three articles had no useful links to archive, so only the last two remain (plus the E-mail one which I missed because I will be modifying it soon anyway, so might as well do it all in one swing).</p>

<h4>13 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Archived links in articles <a href = "salix.html">Salix OS - a hidden gem among Linux distributions</a> and <a href = "freetardism.html">Refuting Freetardism</a>. Added actual links to the articles that are mentioned in the update log, instead of just their titles.</p>

<h4>12 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Archived links in articles <em>Essential privacy (or other) addons</em> as well as <a href = "browsers.html">How to choose a browser for your daily use?</a>. <a href = "liftingtheveil.html">Lifting the veil - how to test browsers for spyware</a>  had no links that would be useful to archive. Added information about certain addons breaking some websites. Fixed a few typos. And, of course, created the Site Update Log! Hopefully, it will motivate me to do more stuff here...</p>

<h4>11 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Archived all links in the article <a href = "technological_slavery.html">Technological slavery</a>.</p>

<h4>10 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Added articles <a href = "capitalism.html">Capitalism will die - but will it take us with it?</a> and <a href = "ai.html">The dangers of artificial intelligence</a>.</p>

<h4>9 / 10 / 2018</h4>

<p>Added article <a href = "technological_slavery.html">Technological slavery</a>.</p>
