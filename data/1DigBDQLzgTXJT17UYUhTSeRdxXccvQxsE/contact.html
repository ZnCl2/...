<h3>Come to our group chat on XMPP! Room - digdeeper; server conference.riseup.net. Best way to contact me and some other like-minded people!</h3>

  <p>There's also an XMPP room you can join for groupchat! The name is <em>digdeeper</em> on server <em>conference.riseup.net</em>. We use OMEMO encryption there so try enabling that if you want to join. You will need an OMEMO compatible client (Pidgin, Gajim, Conversations...) and server (<a href="https://compliance.conversations.im/test/xep0384/">https://compliance.conversations.im/test/xep0384/</a> - but it doesn't seem to be fully reliable, for example Riseup DOES SUPPORT OMEMO, while <em>Disroot does not</em> seem to - so don't use it). For Pidgin, OMEMO works through the <a href="https://github.com/gkdr/lurch/">lurch plugin</a>, so install it and enable through Tools > Plugins. Then, you will have to add all the conversation participants to your buddy list - else the ones you didn't add won't be able to see your messages. Type the command "/lurch enable" (without the quotes) and you can start chatting! For Gajim, you need <a href="https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim-plugins/wikis/OmemoGajimPlugin">OmemoGajimPlugin</a>. If you have a problem, message me and I will try to help. <em>There is no client for Android which supports OMEMO in group chats.</em> Conversations has an admitted <q>arbitrary requirement imposed by Conversations</q> that prevents OMEMO from working; aTalk, Profanity, Pix-Art Messenger and converse.js have also failed our tests. Therefore you should use a desktop / laptop for the group chat.</p>
