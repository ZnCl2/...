I remember reading that it was uploaded to Nexus but it was almost instantly shutdown.\nIt was basically a mod that completely replaced Skyrim music with soundtracks from the Merlin BBC series.\nI keep seeing it listed on torrent sites like ThePirateBay or 1337x but I can't get the download to start, go past 0%, always has 1 or 0 seeders.",
