			"body": "Hello. Really would appreciate help here.\nFirst one, been searching for about a year now, can't find this amazing quest mod anywhere anymore.\nSecond is obvioulsy a recent thing. I know that Frontier started to get censored under the public pressure starting from hotfix 3.8. Therefore, searching for one that is earlier than that, ideally one that came straight before it. \n\nThanks in advance for any help!",
