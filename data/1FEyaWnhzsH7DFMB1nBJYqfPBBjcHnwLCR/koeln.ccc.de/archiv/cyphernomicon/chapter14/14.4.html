<PRE>
   14.4.1. fraud, is-a-person, forging identies, increased "number"
            trends
   14.4.2. costs also high
   14.4.3. Chaum
   14.4.4. voting isomorphic to digital money
           - where account transfers are the thing being voted on, and
              the "eligible voters" are oneself...unless this sort of
              thing is outlawed, which would create other problems, then
              this makes a form of anonymous transfer possible (more or
              less)
