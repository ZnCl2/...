  14.10.1. This was an early proposed use (my comments on it go back to
            1988 at least), and resulted in the creation of
            alt.whisteblowers.
           - So far, nothing too earth-shattering
  14.10.2. outing the secret agents of a country, by posting them
            anonymously to a world-wide Net distribution....that ought to
            shake things up
