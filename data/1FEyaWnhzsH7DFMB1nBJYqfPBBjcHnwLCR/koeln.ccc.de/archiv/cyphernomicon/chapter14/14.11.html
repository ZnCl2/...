  14.11.1. religious confessionals and consultations mediated by digital
            links...very hard for U.S. government to gain access
  14.11.2. ditto for attorney-client conversations, for sessions with
            psychiatrists and doctors, etc.
  14.11.3. (this does not meen these meetings are exempt from the
            law...witness Feds going after tainted legal fees, and
            bugging offices of attorneys suspected of being in the drug
            business)
