   14.7.1. (Another one of the topics that gets a lot of posts)
   14.7.2. Hiding messages in other messages
           - "Kevin Brown makes some interesting points about
              steganography and steganalysis.  The issue of recognizing
              whether a message has or mighthave a hidden message has two
              sides.  One is for the desired recipient to be clued that
              he should try desteganizing and decrypting the message, and
              the other is for a possible attacker to discover illegal
              uses of cryptography.
              
              "Steganography should be used with a "stealthy"
              cryptosystem (secret key or public key), one in which the
              cyphertext is indistinguishable from a random bit string.
              You would not want it to have any headers which could be
              used to confirm that a desteganized message was other than
              random noise." [Hal Finney, 1993-05-25]
   14.7.3. Peter Wayner's "Mimic"
           - "They encode a secret message inside a harmless looking
              ASCII text file.  This is one of the very few times
              the UNIX tools "lex" and "yacc" have been used in
              cryptography, as far as I know.   Peter Wayner, "Mimic
              Functions", CRYPTOLOGIA Volume 16, Number 3, pp. 193-214,
              July 1992.[Michael Johnson, sci.crypt, 1994-09-05]
   14.7.4. I described it in 1988 or 89 and many times since
           - Several years ago I posted to sci.crypt my "novel" idea for
              packing bits into the essentially inaudible "least
              significant bits" (LSBs) of digital recordings, such as
              DATs and CDs. Ditto for the LSBs in an 8-bit image or 24-
              bit color image. I've since seen this idea reinvented
              _several_ times on sci.crypt and elsewhere...and I'm
              willing to bet I wasn't the first, either (so I don't claim
              any credit).
              
              A 2-hour DAT contains about 10 Gbits (2 hours x 3600 sec/hr
              x 2 channels x 16 bits/sample x 44K samples/sec), or about
              1.2 Gbytes. A CD contains about half this, i.e., about 700
              Mbytes. The LSB of a DAT is 1/16th of the 1.2 Gbytes, or 80
              Mbytes. This is a _lot_ of storage!
              
              A home-recorded DAT--and I use a Sony D-3 DAT Walkman to
              make tapes--has so much noise down at the LSB level--noise
              from the A/D and D/A converters, noise from the microphones
              (if any), etc.--that the bits are essentially random at
              this level. (This is a subtle, but important, point: a
              factory recorded DAT or CD will have predetermined bits at
              all levels, i.e., the authorities could in principle spot
              any modifications. But home-recorded, or dubbed, DATs will
              of course not be subject to this kind of analysis.) Some
              care might be taken to ensure that the statistical
              properties of the signal bits resemble what would be
              expected with "noise" bits, but this will be a minor
              hurdle.
              
              Adobe Photoshop can be used to easily place message bits in
              the "noise" that dominates things down at the LSB level.
              The resulting GIF can then be posted to UseNet or e-mailed.
              Ditto for sound samples, using the ideas I just described
              (but typically requiring sound sampling boards, etc.). I've
              done some experiments along these lines.
              
              This doesn't mean our problems are solved, of course.
              Exchanging tapes is cumbersome and vulnerable to stings.
              But it does help to point out the utter futility of trying
              to stop the flow of bits.
   14.7.5. Stego, other versions
           - Romana Machado's Macintosh stego program is located in the
              compression files, /cmp, in the sumex-aim@stanford.edu info-
              mac archives.
           - "Stego is a tool that enables you to embed data in, and
              retrieve data from, Macintosh PICT format files, without
              changing the appearance of the PICT file.  Though its
              effect is visually undetectable, do not expect
              cryptographic security from Stego.  Be aware that anyone
              with a copy of Stego can retrieve your data from your PICT
              file.  Stego  can  be used as an "envelope" to hide a
              _previously encrypted_ data file in a PICT file, making it
              much less likely to be detected." [Romana Machado, 1993-11-
              23]
   14.7.6. WNSTORM, Arsen Ray Arachelian
   14.7.7. talk about it being used to "watermark" images
   14.7.8. Crypto and steganography used to plant false and misleading
            nuclear information
           - "Under a sub-sub-sub-contract I once worked on some phony
              CAD drawings for the nuclear weapons production process,
              plotting false info that still appears in popular books,
              some of which has been posted here....The docs were then
              encrypted and stegonagraphied for authenticity.  We were
              told that they were turned loose on the market for this
              product in other countries." [John Young, 1994-08-25]
           - Well...
   14.7.9. Postscript steganography
           - where info is embedded in spacings, font characteristics
              (angles, arcs)
           - ftp://research.att.com/dist/brassil/infocom94.ps
           - the essential point: just another haystack to hide a needle
