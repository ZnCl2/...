<PRE>
  16.11.1. "How do you square these ideas with democracy?"
           - I don't; democracy has run amok, fulfilling de
              Tocqueville's prediction that American democracy would last
              only until Americans discovered they could pick the pockets
              of their neighbors at the ballot box
           - little chance of changing public opinion, of educating them
           - crypto anarchy is a movement of individual opting out, not
              of mass change and political action
  16.11.2. "Is there a moral responsibility to ensure that the overall
            effects of crypto anarchy are more favorable than unfavorable
            before promoting it?"
           - I don't think so, any more than Thomas Jefferson should
              have analyzed the future implications of freedom before
              pushing it so strongly.
           - All decisions have implications. Some even cost lives. By
              not becoming a doctor working in Sub-Saharan Africa, have I
              "killed thousands"? Certainly I might have saved the lives
              of thousands of villagers. But I did not kill them just
              because I chose not to be a doctor. Likewise, by giving
              money to starving peasants in Bangladesh, lives could
              undeniably be "saved." But not giving the money does not
              murder them.
           - But such actions of omission are not the same, in my mind,
              as acts of comission. My freedom, via crypto anarchy, is
              not an act of force in and of itself.
           - Developing an idea is not the same as aggression.
           - Crypto anarchy is about personal withdrawal from the
              system, the "technologies of disconnection," in Kevin
              Kelly's words.
  16.11.3. "Should individuals have the power to decide what they will
            reveal to others, and to authorities?"
           - For many or even most of us, this has an easy answer, and
              is axiomatically true. But others have doubts, and more
              people may have doubts as some easily anticipated
              develpoments occur.
           - (For example, pedophiles using the much-feared "fortress
              crypto," terrorists communicating in unbreakable codes, tza
              evaders, etc. Lots of examples.)
           - But because some people use crypto to do putatively evil
              things, should basic rights be given up? Closed doors can
              hide criminal acts, but we don't ban closed doors.
  16.11.4. "Aren't there some dangers and risks to letting people pick
            and choose their moralities?"
           - (Related to questions about group consensus, actions of the
              state vs. actions of the individual, and the "herd.)
           - Indeed, there are dangers and risks. In the privacy of his
              home, my neighbor might be operating a torture dungeon for
              young children he captures. But absent real evidence of
              this, most nations have not sanctioned the random searches
              of private dwellings (not even in the U.S.S.R., so far as I
              know).
  16.11.5. "As a member of a hated minority (crypto anarchists) I'd
            rather take my chances on an open market than risk official
            discrimination by the state.....Mercifully, the technology we
            are developing will allow everyone who cares to to decline to
            participate in this coercive allocation of power." [Duncan
            Frissell, 1994-09-08]
  16.11.6. "Are there technologies which should be "stopped" even before
            they are deployed?"
           - Pandora's Box, "things Man was not meant to know," etc.
           - It used to be that my answer was mostly a clear "No," with
              nuclear and biological weapons as the only clear exception.
              But recent events involving key escrow have caused me to
              rethink things.
           - Imagine a company that's developing home surveillance
              cameras...perhaps for burglar prevention, child safety,
              etc. Parents can monitor Junior on ceiling-mounted cameras
              that can't easily be tampered with or disconnected, without
              sending out alarms. All well and good.
           - Now imagine that hooks are put into these camera systems to
              send the captured images to a central office. Again, not
              necessarily a bad idea--vacationers may want their security
              company to monitor their houses, etc.
           - The danger is that a repressive government could make the
              process mandatory....how else to catch sexual deviates,
              child molestors, marijuana growers, counterfeiters, and the
              like?
           - Sound implausible, unacceptable, right? Well, key escrow is
              a form of this.
           - The Danger. That OS vendors will put these SKE systems in
              place without adequate protections against key escrow being
              made mandatory at some future date.
  16.11.7. "Won't crypto anarchy allow some people to do bad things?"
           - Sure, so what else is new? Private rooms allows plotters to
              plot their plots. Etc.
           - Not to sound too glib, but most of the things we think of
              as basic rights allow various illegal, distasteful, or
              crummy things to go on. Part of the bargain we make.
           - "Of course you could prevent contract killings by requiring
              everyone to carry government "escrowed" tape recordings to
              record all their conversations and requiring them to keep a
              diary at all times alibing their all their activities.
              This would also make it much easier to stamp out child
              pornography, plutonium smuggling, and social discrimination
              against the politically correct." [James Donald, 1994-09-
              09]
