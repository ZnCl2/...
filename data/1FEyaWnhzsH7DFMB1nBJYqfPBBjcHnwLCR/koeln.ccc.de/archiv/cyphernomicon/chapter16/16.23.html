  16.23.1. "Is it legal to advocate the overthrow of governments or the
            breaking of laws?"
           - Although many Cypherpunks are not radicals, many others of
              us are, and we often advocate "collapse of governments" and
              other such things as money laundering schemes, tax evasion,
              new methods for espionage, information markets, data
              havens, etc. This rasises obvious concerns about legality.
           - First off, I have to speak mainly of U.S. issues...the laws
              of Russia or Japan or whatever may be completely different.
              Sorry for the U.S.-centric focus of this FAQ, but that's
              the way it is. The Net started here, and still is
              dominantly here, and the laws of the U.S. are being
              propagated around the world as part of the New World Order
              and the collapse of the other superpower.
           - Is it legal to advocate the replacement of a government? In
              the U.S., it's the basic political process (though cynics
              might argue that both parties represent the same governing
              philosophy). Advocating the *violent overthrow* of the U.S.
              government is apparently illegal, though I lack a cite on
              this.
           + Is it legal to advocate illegal acts in general? Certainly
              much of free speech is precisely this: arguing for drug
              use, for boycotts, etc.
             + The EFF gopher site has this on "Advocating Lawbreaking,
                Brandenburg v. Ohio. ":
               - "In the 1969 case of Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme
                  Court struck down the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan
                  member under a criminal syndicalism law and established
                  a new standard: Speech may not be suppressed or
                  punished unless it is intended to produce 'imminent
                  lawless action' and it is 'likely to produce such
                  action.' Otherwise, the First Amendment protects even
                  speech that advocates violence. The Brandenburg test is
                  the law today. "
  16.23.2. Espionage and Subversion of Governments Will be
            Revolutionized by Strong Crypto
           - (I think they see what we see, too, and this is a
              motivation for the attempts to limit the use of strong
              crypto. Besides some of the more conventional reasons.)
           + Digital dead drops will revolutionize espionage
             + spies and their controllers can communicate securely,
                relatively quickly, without fear of being watched, their
                drops compromised, etc.
               - no more nooks of trees, no more chalk marks on
                  mailboxes to signal a drop to be made
             + this must be freaking out the intelligence community!
               - more insights into why the opposition to crypto is so
                  strong
           + Cell-Based Systems and Conventional Protection Systems
             + Cells are a standard way to limit the damage of exposure
               - the standard is the 3-person cell so common in the
                  early days of Soviet espionage in the U.S.
               - but computer systems may allow new kinds of cells, with
                  more complicated protocols and more security
             + Keeping files for protection is another standard
                protection method
               + and with strong crypto, these files can be kept
                  encrypted and in locations not apparent (e.g., posted
                  on bulletin boards or other such places, with only the
                  key needed at a later time to open them)
                 - a la the "binary files" idea, wherein encrypted files
                    are widely available for some time before the key is
                    distributed (thus making it very hard for governments
                    to halt the distribution of the raw files)
  16.23.3. "Xth Column" (X = encrypted)
           - The possible need to use strong cryptography as a tool to
              fight the state.
           + helping to undermine the state by using whistleblowers and
              anonymous information markets to leak information
             - the 63,451 people given false identities in the WitSec
                program...leak their names, watch them be zapped by
                vengeful enemies, and watch the government squirm
             - auction off the details of the 1967 Inspector General's
                report on CIA assassinations
  16.23.4. use of clandestine, cell-based systems may allow a small
            group to use "termite" methods to undermine a society, to
            destroy a state that has become too repressive (sounds like
            the U.S. to me)
           - encrypted systems, anonymous pools, etc., allow truly
              secure cell-based systems (this is, by the way, one of the
              concerns many countries have about "allowing" cryptography
              to be used...and they're right abou the danger!)
           - subversion of fascist or socialist governments, undermining
              the so-called democratic governments
  16.23.5. "Why won't government simply ban  such encryption methods?"
           + This has always been the Number One Issue!
             - raised by Stiegler, Drexler, Salin, and several others
                (and in fact raised by some as an objection to my even
                discussing these issues, namely, that action may then be
                taken to head off the world I describe)
           + Types of Bans on Encryption and Secrecy
             - Ban on Private Use of Encryption
             - Ban on Store-and-Forward Nodes
             - Ban on Tokens and ZKIPS Authentication
             - Requirement for public disclosure of all transactions
             + Recent news (3-6-92, same day as Michaelangelo and
                Lawnmower Man) that government is proposing a surcharge
                on telcos and long distance services to pay for new
                equipment needed to tap phones!
               - S.266 and related bills
               - this was argued in terms of stopping drug dealers and
                  other criminals
               - but how does the government intend to deal with the
                  various forms fo end-user encryption or "confusion"
                  (the confusion that will come from compression,
                  packetizing, simple file encryption, etc.)
           + Types of Arguments Against Such Bans
             - The "Constitutional Rights" Arguments
             + The "It's Too Late" Arguments
               - PCs are already widely scattered, running dozens of
                  compression and encryption programs...it is far too
                  late to insist on "in the clear" broadcasts, whatever
                  those may be (is program code distinguishable from
                  encrypted messages? No.)
               - encrypted faxes, modem scramblers (albeit with some
                  restrictions)
               - wireless LANs, packets, radio, IR, compressed text and
                  images, etc....all will defeat any efforts short of
                  police state intervention (which may still happen)
             + The "Feud Within the NSA" Arguments
               - COMSEC vs. PROD
             + Will affect the privacy rights of corporations
               - and there is much evidence that corporations are in
                  fact being spied upon, by foreign governments, by the
                  NSA, etc.
           + They Will Try to Ban Such Encryption Techniques
             + Stings (perhaps using viruses and logic bombs)
               - or "barium," to trace the code
             + Legal liability for companies that allow employees to use
                such methods
               - perhaps even in their own time, via the assumption that
                  employees who use illegal software methods in their own
                  time are perhaps couriers or agents for their
                  corporations (a tenuous point)
  16.23.6. "How will the masses be converted?"
           - Probably they won't. Things will just happen, just as the
              masses were not converted on issues of world financial
              markets, derivative instruments, and a lot of similar
              things.
           - Crypto anarchy is largely a personal approach of
              withdrawal, of avoidance. Mass consensus is not needed
              (unless the police state option is tried).
           - Don't think in terms of selling crypto anarchy to Joe
              Average. Just use it.
  16.23.7. As things seem to be getting worse, vis-a-vis the creation of
            a police state in the U.S.--it may be a good thing that
            anonymous assassination markets will be  possible. It may
            help to level the playing field, as the Feds have had their
            hit teams for many years (along with their safe houses,
            forged credentials, accommodation addresses, cut-outs, and
            other accouterments of the intelligence state).
           - (I won't get into conspiracies here, but the following
              terms may trigger some memories: Gehlen Org, Wackenhut,
              McKee Team, Danny Casolaro, Cabazon Indians, Gander crash,
              Iraq arms deals, Pan Am 103, Bridegrooms of Death, French
              Connection, Fascist Third Position, Phoenix Program, Bebe
              Rebozo, Marex, Otto Skorzeny, Nixon, P-2, Klaus Barbie,
              etc.)
           - Plenty of evidence of misbehavior on a massive scales by
              the intelligence agencies, the police forces, and states in
              general. Absolute power has corrupted absolutely.
           - I'm certainly not advocating the killing of Congressrodents
              and other bureaucrats, just noting that this cloud may have
              a silver lining.
