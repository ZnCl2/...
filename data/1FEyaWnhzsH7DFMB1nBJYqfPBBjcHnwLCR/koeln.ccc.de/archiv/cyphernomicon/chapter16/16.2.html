<HR>
<PRE>
   16.2.1. Main Points
           - "...when you want to smash the State, everything looks like
              a hammer."
           - strong crypto as the "building material" for cyberspace
              (making the walls, the support beams, the locks)
   16.2.2. Connections to Other Sections
           - this section ties all the other sections together
   16.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information
           - again, almost nothing written on this
           - Vinge, Friedman, Rand, etc.
   16.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments
           - a very long section, possibly confusing to many
