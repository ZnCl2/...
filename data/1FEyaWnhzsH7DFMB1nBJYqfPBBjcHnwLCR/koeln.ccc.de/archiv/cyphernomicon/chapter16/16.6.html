   16.6.1. "What freedom of speech is becoming."
           + An increased willingness to limit speech, by attaching
              restrictions based on it being "commercial" or "hate
              speech."
             + advertising laws being the obvious example: smoking,
                alcohol, etc.
               - doctors, lawyers, etc.
               - sex, nudity
               - even laws that say billboards can't show guns
           - A chilling but all too common sentiment on the Net is shown
              by this quote: "Is it freedom of speech to spew racism ,
              and steriotypes, just because you lack the intellectual
              capacity to comprehend that , perhaps, somewhere, there is
              a different way of life, which is not congruent with your
              pre-conceived notions?" [Andrew Beckwith, soc.culture.usa]
   16.6.2. We don't really have free speech
           - election laws
           - advertising laws
           + "slander" and "libel"
             - thankfully, anonymous systems will make this moot
           + permission needed...licensing, approval, certification
             - "qualifications"
             - granted, Supremes have made it clear that political
                comments cannot be restricted, but many other areas have
             - often the distinction involves 'for pay"
           - Perhaps you are thinking that these are not really examples
              of government censorship, just of _other crimes_  and
              _other rights_ taking precedence. Thus, advertisers can't
              make false or misleading claims, and can't advertise
              dangerous or otherwise unapproved items. And I can't make
              medical diagnoses, or give structural and geological
              advice, and so on...a dozen good examples. But these
              restrictions emasculate free speech, leaving only banal
              expression of appropriately-hedged "personal opinions" as
              the free speech that is allowed...and even that is ofen
              subject to crazy lawsuits and threats of legal action.
