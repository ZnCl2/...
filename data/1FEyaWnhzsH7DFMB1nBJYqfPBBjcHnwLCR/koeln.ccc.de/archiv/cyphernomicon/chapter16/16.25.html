  16.25.1. "How do we know that crypto anarchy will 'work,' that the
            right institutions will emerge, that wrongs will be righted,
            etc.?"
           - We don't know. Few things are certain. Only time will tell.
              These are emergent situations, where evolution will
              determine the outcome. As in other areas, the forms of
              solutions will take time to evolve.
           - (The Founders could not have predicted the form corporate
              law would take, as but one example.)
  16.25.2. My thinking on crypto anarchy is not so much _prediction_ as
            examination of trends and the implications of certain things.
            Just as steel girders mean certain things for the design of
            buildings, so too does unbreakable crypto mean certain things
            for the design of social and economic systems.
  16.25.3. Several technologies are involved:
           - Unbreakable crypto
           - Untraceable communication
           - Unforgeable signatures
  16.25.4. (Note: Yes, it's sometimes dangerous to say "unbreakable,"
            "untraceable," and "unforgeable." Purists eschew such terms.
            All crypto is economics, even information-theoretically
            secure crypto (e.g., bribe someone to give you the key, break
            in and steal it, etc.). And computationally-secure crypto--
            such as RSA, IDEA, etc.--can in *principle* be brute-forced.
            In reality,  the costs may well be exhorbitantly
            high...perhaps more energy than is available in the entire
            universe would be needed. Essentially, these things are about
            as unbreakable, untraceable, and unforgeable as one can
            imagine.)
  16.25.5. "Strong building materials" implies certain things. Highways,
            bridges, jet engines, etc. Likewise for strong crypto, though
            the exact form of the things that get built is still unknown.
            But pretty clearly some amazing new structures will be built
            this way.
  16.25.6. Cyberspace, walls, bricks and mortar...
  16.25.7. "Will strong crypto have the main effect of securing current
            freedoms, or will it create new freedoms and new situations?"
           - There's a camp that believe mainly that strong crypto will
              ensure that current freedoms are preserved, but that this
              will not change things materially, Communications can be
              private, diaries can be secured, computer security will be
              enhanced, etc.
           - Another camp--of which I am a vocal spokesman--believes
              that qualitatively different types of transactions will be
              made possible. In addition, of course, to the securing of
              liberties that the first camp things is the main effect.
           + These effects are specultative, but probably include:
             - increased hiding of assets through untraceable banking
                systems
             - markets in illegal services
             - increased espionage
             - data havens
  16.25.8. "Will all crypto-anarchic transactions be anonymous?"
           - No, various parties will negotiate different arrangements.
              All a matter of economics, of enforcement of terms, etc.
              Some will, some won't. The key thing is that the decision
              to reveal identity will be just another mutually negotiated
              matter. (Think of spending cash in a store. The store owner
              may _want_ to know who his customers are, but he'll still
              take cash and remain ignorant in most cases. Unless a
              government steps in and distorts the market by requiring
              approvals for purchases and records of identities--think of
              guns here.)
           - For example, the local Mob may not lend me money if I am
              anonymous to them, but they have a "hook" in me if they
              know who I am. (Aspects of anonymity may still be used,
              such as systems that leave no paper or computer trail
              pointing to them or to me, to avoid stings.)
           - "Enforcement" in underground markets, for which the
              conventional legal remedies are impossible, is often by
              means of physical force: breaking legs and even killing
              welshers.
           - (Personally, I have no problems with this. The Mob cannot
              turn to the local police, so it has to enforce deals its
              own way. If you can't pay, don't play.)
