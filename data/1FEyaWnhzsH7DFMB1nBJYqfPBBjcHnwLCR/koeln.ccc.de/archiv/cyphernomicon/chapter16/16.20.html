  16.20.1. what it is
  16.20.2. parallels to Oceania, Galt's Gulch
  16.20.3. Privacy in communications alters the nature of connectivity
           - virtual communities, invisible to outsiders
           - truly a crypto cabal
           - this is what frightens the lawmakers the most...people can
              opt out of the mainstream governmental system, at least
              partly (and probably increasingly)
