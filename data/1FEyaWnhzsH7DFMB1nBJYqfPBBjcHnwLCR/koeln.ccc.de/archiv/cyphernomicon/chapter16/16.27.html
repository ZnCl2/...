  16.27.1. Bypassing restrictions on commercial encryption packages by
            not making them "commercial"
           - public domain
           - freely distributed
           - after all, the basic algorithms are simple and don't really
              deserve patent protection: money will not be made by the
              originators of the code, but by the actual providers of
              services (for transmission and storage of packets)
  16.27.2. Noise and signals are often indistinguishable
           - as with the LSB audio signal approach...unless the
              government outlaws live recordings or dubs on digital
              systems...
  16.27.3. Timed-release files (using encryption) will be used to hide
            files, to ensure that governments cannot remove material they
            don't like
           - easier said than done
  16.27.4. Legal approaches will also be taken: fundamental
            constitutional issues
           - privacy, free speech, free association
  16.27.5. The Master Plan to Fight Restrictions on Encryption
           + "Genie out of the bottle" strategy: deploy crypto widely
             - intertwined with religions, games, whistleblower groups,
                and other uses that cannot easily just be shut down
             - scattered in amongst many other activities
           - Media attention: get media to report on value of
              encryption, privacy, etc.
           + Diffusion, confusion, and refusion
             - Diffuse the use by scattering it around
             - Confuse the issue by fake religions, games, other uses
             - Refuse to cooperate with the government
           - Free speech arguments: calling the discussions free speech
              and forcing the government to prove that the free speech is
              actually an economic transaction
           + links with religions, corporations, etc.
             - private meetings protected
             - voting systems
