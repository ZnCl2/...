   7.15.1. Security measures on login, passwords, etc.
           - Avoid entering passwords over the Net (such as in rlogins
              or telnets). If someone or some agent asks for your
              password, be paranoid.
           - Can use encrypted telnet, or something like Kerberos, to
              avoid sending passwords in the clear between machines. Lots
              of approaches, almost none of them commonly used (at least
              I never see them).
