    7.2.1. Main Points
           - PGP is the most important crypto tool there is, having
              single-handedly spread public key methods around the world
           - many other tools are being built on top of it
    7.2.2. Connections to Other Sections
           - ironically, almost no understanding of how PGP works in
              detail is needed; there are plenty of experts who
              specialize in that
    7.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information
           - newsgroups carry up to date comments; just read them for a
              few weeks and many things will float by
           - various FAQs on PGP
           + even an entire book, by Simpson Garfinkel:
             -   PGP: Pretty Good Privacy
                   by Simson Garfinkel
                   1st Edition November 1994 (est.)

    7.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments
           - a vast number of ftp sites, URLs, etc., and these change
           - this document can't possibly stay current on these--see the
              pointers in the newsgroups for the most current sites
