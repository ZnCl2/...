           - SecureDevice
           + SecureDrive
             - "Secdrv13d is the latest version.  There was an unupdated
                .exe file in the package that had to be fixed.  From the
                readme file: If you found this file inside FPART13D.ZIP,
                this is an update and bug fix for the FPART utility of

           + SFS
             - "A MS-DOS-based package for hard disk encryption. It is
                implemented as a device driver and encrypts a whole
                partition (i.e., not a file or a directory). It uses the
                MDC/SHA cipher. ... It is available from Grabo
                (garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/crypt/sfs110.zip, I think), and also

             - Compared to SecureDrive, users report it to be faster,
                better-featured, has a Windows interface, is a device
                driver, and is robust. The disadvantages are that it
                currently does not ship with source code and uses a more
                obscure cipher.
             - "SFS (Secure FileSystem) is a set of programs which
                create and manage a number of encrypted disk volumes, and
                runs under both DOS and Windows.  Each volume appears as
                a normal DOS drive, but all data stored on it is encryped
                at the individual-sector level....SFS 1.1 is a
                maintenance release which fixes a few minor problems in
                1.0, and adds a number of features suggested by users.
                More details on changes are given in in the README file."

             - "WinCrypt is pretty good IF you keep your encrypted text
                to less than the length of your password, AND IF you
                generate your password randomly, AND IF you only use each

                There are still a number of outstanding bugs that need to
                be
                fixed, but the hope is to make a bugfix release in the

                &gt;PGP 2.6 is distributed from MIT and is legally available
                to US and Canadian
                &gt;residents. It uses the RSAREF library. It has code that
                will prevent
                &gt;interoperation with earlier versions of PGP.
                &gt;
                &gt;PGP 2.6ui is a modified version of PGP 2.3a which
                functions almost
                &gt;identically to MIT PGP 2.6, without the "cripple code"
                of MIT PGP 2.6. It
                &gt;is legally available outside the US and Canada only.
                
                This is false.  PGP 2.6ui is available to US and Canadian
                residents.
                It is definitely legal for such people to download PGP
                2.6ui and study
                it.
                
                However, RSADSI claim that *using* PGP 2.6ui in the US
                and Canada
                violates their patents on the RSA algorithm and on public
                key
                cryptography in general.  Other people (like myself)
                believe that
                these patents wouldn't stand up if tested in court, and
                that in any
                case the damages recoverable would be zero.
                
                You might also like to know that the output formats
                generated by 2.6ui
                and MIT-2.6 are identical, so that if you choose to use
                2.6ui in North
                America noone will be able to tell the difference anyway.
                
                Unfortunately these patent problems have caused many
                North American
                FTP sites to stop carrying 2.3a and 2.6ui, for fear of
                committing
                contributory infringement.
                
                If you would like to examine PGP 2.3a or 2.6ui, they are
                available on
                many FTP sites.  Try

           + CurveEncrypt, for Mac
             - "Curve Encrypt 1.1, IDEA encryption for the Macintosh is
                now available.....Curve Encrypt is a freeware drag-and-
                drop encryption application for the Macintosh. It uses
                IDEA cipher-feedback mode with a 255 character pass
                phrase, encrypts both the data and resource forks of
                files, and will encrypt the contents of a folder or
                volume in a single operation. Source code is provided,
                natch. CE is System 7 only....(Note that this program has
                nothing whatsoever to do with elliptic curve
                encryption methods, just so nobody gets confused...)" [

           + RIPEM on Macintosh
             - Carl Ellison says "I've only used RIPEM on AOL -- but it
                should be the same....I run on a Mac, generating the
                armored file, and then use AOL's "paste from file" option
                in the File menu to include the encrypted file in the
                body of my message.....In the other direction, I have to
                use Select All and Copy to get it out of AOL mail, Paste
                to get it into an editor.  From there I can file it and
                give that file to PGP or RIPEM.....BBEDIT on the Mac has
                good support for RIPEM.  I wish I knew how to write
                BBEDIT extensions for Mac PGP as well." [C.E., 1994-07-
