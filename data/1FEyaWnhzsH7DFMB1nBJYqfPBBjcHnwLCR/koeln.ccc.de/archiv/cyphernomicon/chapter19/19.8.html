   19.8.1. I regret that I can't be complete in all versions, platforms
            supported, sites for obtaining, instructions,
            incompatibilities, etc. Frankly, I'm drowning in reports of
            new versions, questions about use, etc. Most of these
            versions I have no direct knowledge of, have no experience
            with, and no appreciation of subtle incompatibilites
            involved.
   19.8.2. There are others who have concentrated on providing up-to-
            date reports on what is available. Some of them are"
           - site
   19.8.3. Reading sci.crypt, alt.security.pgp, and related groups for a
            few weeks and looking for programs of interest to one's own
            situation should give the most recent and current results.
            Things are moving quickly, so if one is interested in
            "AmigaPGP," for example, then the right place to look for the
            latest versions is in the groups just mentioned, or in groups
            and ftp sites specific to the Amiga. (Be careful that
            sabotaged or spoofed versions are not used, as in all crypto.
            "Joe's AmigaPGP" might need a closer look.)
