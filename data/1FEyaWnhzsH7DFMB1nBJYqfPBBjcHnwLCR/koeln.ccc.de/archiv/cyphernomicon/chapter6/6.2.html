    6.2.1. Main Points
           - Strong crypto reclaims the power to decide for one's self,
              to deny the "Censor" the power to choose what one reads,
              watches, or listens to.
    6.2.2. Connections to Other Sections
    6.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information
    6.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments
           - this section is short, but is less focussed than other
              sections; it is essentially a "transition" chapter.
