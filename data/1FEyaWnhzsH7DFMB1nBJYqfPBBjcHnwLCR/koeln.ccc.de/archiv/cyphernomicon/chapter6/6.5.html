<PRE>
    6.5.1. for electronic forms of contracts
           - not yet tested in the courts, though this should come soon
              (perhaps by 1996)
    6.5.2. negotiations
    6.5.3. AMIX, Xanadu, etc.
    6.5.4. is the real protection against viruses (since all other
            scanning methods will increasingly fail)
           - software authors and distributors "sign" their work...no
              virus writer can possibly forge the digital signature
