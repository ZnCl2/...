   2.10.1. "Does the NSA monitor this list?"
           - Probably. We've been visible enough, and there are many
              avenues for monitoring or even subscribing to the List.
              Many aliases, many points of presence.
           - some concerns that Cypherpunks list has been infiltrated
              and is a "round up list"
           - There have even been anonymous messages purporting to name
              likely CIA, DIA, and NSA spooks. ("Be aware.")
           - Remember, the list of subscribers is _not_ a secret--it can
              be gotten by sending a "who cypherpunks" message to
              majordomo@toad.com. Anyone in the world can do this.
   2.10.2. "Is this list illegal?"
           - Depends on the country. In the U.S., there are very strong
              protections against "prior restraint" for published
              material, so the list is fairly well -protected....shutting
              it down would create a First Amendment case of major
              importance. Which is unlikely. Conspiracy and sedition laws
              are more complex to analyze; there are no indications that
              material here or on the list is illegal.
           - Advocacy of illegal acts (subversion of export laws,
              espionage, etc.) is generally legal. Even advocating the
              overthrow of the government.
           - The situation in other countries is different. Some
              countries ban unapproved encryption, so this list is
              suspect.
           - Practically speaking, anyone reading this list is probably
              in a place which either makes no attempt to control
              encryption or is unable to monitor what crosses its
              borders.
   2.10.3. "Can keystrokes really be monitored remotely? How likely is
            this?"
           - Yes. Van Eck, RF, monitors, easy (it is claimed) to build
              this
           - How likely? Depends on who you are. Ames, the KGB spy, was
              probably monitored near the end, but I doubt many of us
              are. The costs are simply too high...the vans outside, the
              personnel needed, etc.
           - the real hazards involve making it "easy" and "almost
              automatic" for such monitoring, such as with Clipper and
              EES. Then they essentially just flip a switch and the
              monitoring happens...no muss, no fuss.
   2.10.4. "Wouldn't some crimes be stopped if the government could
            monitor what it wanted to?"
           - Sure. This is an old story. Some criminals would be caught
              if their diaries could be examined. Television cameras in
              all homes would reduce crimes of .... (Are you listening,
              Winston?).
           - Orwell, fascism, surveillance states, what have you got to
              hide, etc.
