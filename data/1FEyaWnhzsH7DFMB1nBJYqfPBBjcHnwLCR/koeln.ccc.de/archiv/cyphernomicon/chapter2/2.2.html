    2.2.1. Main Points
           - These are the main questions that keep coming up. Not
              necessarily the most basic question, just the ones that get
              asked a lot. What most FAQs are.
    2.2.2. Connections to Other Sections
    2.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information
           - newcomers to crypto should buy Bruce Schneier's "Applied
              Cryptography"...it will save many hours worth of
              unnecessary questions and clueless remarks about
              cryptography.
           - the various FAQs publishe in the newsroups (like sci.crypt,
              alt.security.pgp) are very helpful. (also at rtfm.mit.edu)
    2.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments
           - I wasn't sure what to include here in the MFAQ--perhaps
              people can make suggestions of other things to include.
           - My advice is that if something interests you, use your
              editing/searching tools to find the same topic in the main
              section. Usually (but not always) there's more material in
              the main chapters than here in the MFAQ.
