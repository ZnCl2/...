  18.13.1. "Can fiber optical cables be tapped?"
           + Yes. Light can escape from the fiber in bends, and "near-
              field" tapping is theoretically possible, at least under
              lab conditions. Active measures for puncturing cable
              shields and tapping fibers are also possible.
             - "The Fed's want a cost effective F/O tap. My company was
                approached to develop such a system, can be done but not
                cheap like copper wire tapping." [
