   18.9.1. Limitations of the current net
           - interoperability
           + subsidized, not pay as you go
             - makes spamming inevitable, doesn't allocate resources to
                those who want them the most
             - this will require digicash in a better form than most
                users now have access to
           - sysadmins get worried
           - encryption sometimes banned
           - common carrier status not clear
           - general cruftiness of Net ("imminent death of Usenet
              predicted")
