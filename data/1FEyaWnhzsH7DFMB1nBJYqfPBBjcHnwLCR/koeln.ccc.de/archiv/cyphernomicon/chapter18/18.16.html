  18.16.1. TRMs--claims that "Picbuster" processor can be locally
            overwritten with focussed or directed UV (OTP)
  18.16.2. tamper-resistant modules have some downsides as well
           - cash registers for ensuring compliance with all relevant
              sales tax, value-added tax (VAT), and rationing rules; a
              tamper-resistant module cash register could be the
              enforcement mechanism for a national security state.
