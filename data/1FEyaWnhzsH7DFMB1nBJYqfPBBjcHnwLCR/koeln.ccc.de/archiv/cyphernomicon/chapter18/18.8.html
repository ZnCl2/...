   18.8.1. "How can I make money in crypto?"
           - crypto experts are hired by software companies
           + start up companies
             - a tough road
             - not clear that even Phil Zimmermann has made money
             - and even RSADSI is facing a challenge (hasn't gone
                public, not a cash cow, etc.)
           - There may be an explosive growth--the phase change I often
              talk about--and many opportunities will emerge. But, having
              said this, I still don't see obvious opportunities right
              now. And starting a company based on hope and ideology,
              rather than supplying a real market or pushing real
              technology (market pull vs. technology push argument) seem
              misguided.
