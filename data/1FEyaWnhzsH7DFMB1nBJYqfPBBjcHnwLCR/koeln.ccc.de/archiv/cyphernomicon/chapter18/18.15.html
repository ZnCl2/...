  18.15.1. too much noise on the list?
           - "Of all the lists I'm subscribed to, this is the only one
              that I read
              *every* article in.  Even the "noise" articles.  Humans
              being what
              they are, the noise is needed to help decide the direction
              of the
              group.  Besides, for those of us who are just starting on
              our journey
              through crypto-underworld need the noise to help
              familiarize
              ourselves with how crypto works.  I've learned more from
              the informal
              ramblings than I've gathered out of all the formal and/or
              mathematical
              postings to date." [Patrick E. Hykkonen, 5-25-93]
