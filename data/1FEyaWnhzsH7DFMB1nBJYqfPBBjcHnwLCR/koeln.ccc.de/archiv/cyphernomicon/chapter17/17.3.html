   17.3.1. "Why have most of the things Cypherpunks talk about *not*
            happened?"
           + Except for remailers and basic crypto, few of the main
              ideas talked about for so long have actually seen any kind
              of realization. There are many reasons:
            A. Difficult to achieve. Both Karl Kleinpaste and Eric
                Hughes implemented simple first-generation remailers in a
                matter of _days_, but "digital cash" and "aptical
                foddering," for example, are not quite so
                straightforward. (I am of course not taking anything away
                from Kleinpaste, Hughes, Helsingius, Finney, etc., just
                noting that redirecting mail messages--and even
                implementing PGP and things like delay, batching, etc.,
                into remailers--is a lot easier conceptually than DC-Nets
                and the like.
            B. Protocols are confusing, tough to implement. Only a tiny
                fraction of the "crypto primitives" discussed at Crypto
                Conferences, or in the various crypto books, have been
                realized as runnable code. Building blocks like "bit
                commitment" have not even--to my knowledge--been
                adequately realized as reusable code. (Certainly various
                groups, such as Chaum's, have cobbled-together things
                like bit commitment....I just don't think there's a
                consensus as to the form, and this has limited the
                ability of nonspecialists to use these "objects.")
            C. Semantic confusion as well. While it's fairly clear what
                "encrypting" or "remailing" means, just what is a
                "digital bank"? Or a "reputation server"?
            D. Interoperablity is problematic. Many platforms, many
                operating systems, many languages. Again, remailers and
                encryption work because there is a de facto lowest common
                denominator for them: the simple text block, used in e-
                mail, editors, input and output from programs, etc. That
                is, we all mostly know exactly what an ASCII text block
                is, and crypto programs are expected to know how to
                access and manipulate such blocks. This largely explains
                the success of PGP across many platforms--text blocks are
                the basic element. Ditto for Cypherpunks remialers, which
                operate on the text blocks found in most mail systems.
                The situation becomes much murkier for things like
                digital money, which are not standalone objects and are
                often multi-party protocols involving time delays,
                offline processing, etc.
            E. Lack of an economic motive. We on this list are not being
                paid to develop anything, are not assisted by anyone, and
                don't have the financial backing of corporations to
                assist us. Since much of today's "software development"
                is actually _deal-making_ and _standards negotiation_, we
                are left out of lots of things.
