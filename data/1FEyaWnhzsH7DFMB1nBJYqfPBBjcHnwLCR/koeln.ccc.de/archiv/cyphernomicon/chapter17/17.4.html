<PRE>
   17.4.1. "What are some future directions?"
   17.4.2. The Future of the List
           + "What can be done about these situations?"
             - That is, given that the Cypherpunks list often contains
                sensitive material (see above), and given that the
                current membership list can be accessed by..... what can
                be done?
             - Move central server to non-U.S. locale
             - Or to "cyberspace" (distributed network, with no central
                server...like FidoNet)
             - subscribers can use pseudonyms, cutouts, remailers
   17.4.3. What if encryption is outlawed?
           - can uuencode (and similar), to at least slow down the
              filter programs a bit (this is barely security through
              obscurity, but....)
           - underground movements?
           - will Cypherpunks be rounded up?
   17.4.4. "Should Cypherpunks be more organized, more like the CPSR,
            EFF, and EPIC?"
           - Those groups largely are lobbying groups, with a staff in
              Washington supported by the membership donations of
              thousands or tens of thousands of dues-paying members. They
              perform a valuable service, of course.
           - But that is not our model, nor can it plausibly be. We were
              formed as an ad hoc group to explore crypto, were dubbed
              "Cypherpunks," and have since acted as a techno-grasssroots
              anarchy. No staff, no dues, no elections, no official rules
              and regulations, and no leadership beyond what is provided
              by the power of speech (and a slight amount of "final say"
              provided by the list maintainer Eric Hughes and the machine
              owner, John Gilmore, with support from Hugh Daniel).
           - If folks want a lobbying group, with lawyers in Washington,
              they should join the EFF and/or CPSR.
           - And we fill a niche they don't try to fill.
   17.4.5. Difficult to Set Directions
           - an anarchy...no centralized control
           - emergent interests
           - everyone has some axe to grind, some temporary set of
              priorities
           - little economic motivation (and most have other jobs)
   17.4.6. The Heart and Soul of Cypherpunks?
           + Competing Goals:
             + Personal Privacy
               - PGP, integration with mailers
               - education
             + Reducing the Power of Institutions
               - whistelblowers group
               -
             - Crypto Anarchy
           + Common Purposes
             + Spreading strong crypto tools and knowledge
               - PGP
             + Fighting government restrictions and regulations
               - Clipper/Skipjack fight was a unifying experience
             + Exploring new directions in cryptology
               - digital mixes, digital cash, voting
   17.4.7. Possible Directions
           + Crypto Tools...make them ubiquitous "enough" so that the
              genie cannot be put back in the bottle
             - can worry about the politics later (socialists vs.
                anarchocapitalists, etc.) (Although socialists would do
                well to carefully think about the implications of
                untraceable communications, digital cash, and world-wide
                networks of consultants and workers--and what this does
                to tax collection and social spending programs--before
                they work with the libertarians and anarchocapitalists to
                bring on the Crypto Millenium.)
           + Education
             - educating the masses about crypto
             - public forums
             - this was picked by the Cambridge/MIT group as their
                special interest
           + Lobbying
             - talking to Congressional aides and committee staffers,
                attending hearings, submitting briefs on proposed
                legislation
             - coordinating with EFF, CPSR, ACLU, etc.
             - this was picked by the Washington group as their special
                interest, which is compellingly appropriate (Calif. group
                is simply too far away)
           - Legal Challenges
           + mixture of legal and illegal
             - use legal tools, and illegal tools
             - fallback positions
             - enlist illegal users as customers...help it spread in
                these channels (shown to be almost uncontrollable)
   17.4.8. Goals (as I see them)
           + Get strong crypto deployed in such a way as to be
              unstoppable, unrecallable
             - "fire and forget" crypto
             - genie out of the bottle
             - Note that this does _not_ necessarily that crypto be
                _widely_ deployed, though that's generally a good idea.
                It may mean seeding key sites outside the U.S. with
                strong crypto tools, with remailers, and with the other
                acouterments.
           + Monkeywrench threats to crypto freedom.
             - economic sabotage of those who use statist contracts to
                thwart freedom (e.g., parts of AT&T)
             + direct sabotage
               - someday, viruses, HERF, etc.
   17.4.9. A Vision of the Future
           - encrypted, secure, untraceable communications
           - hundreds of remailers, in many countries
           - interwoven with ordinary traffic, ensuring that any attempt
              to quash crypto would also have a dramatic effect on
              business
           - data havens, credit, renters, etc.
           - information markets
           - ability to fight wars is hindered
           - U.S. is frantic, as its grip on the world loosens...Pax
              Americana dies
  17.4.10. Key concepts are the way to handle the complexity of crypto
           - The morass of protocols, systems, and results is best
              analyzed, I think, by not losing sight of the basic
              "primitives," the things about identity, security,
              authentication, etc. that make crypto systems work the way
              they do.
           + Axiom systems, with theorems and lemmas derivable from the
              axioms
             - with alternate axioms giving the equivalent of "non-
                Euclidean geometries" (in a sense, removing the physical
                identity postulate and replacing it with the "the key is
                the identity" postulate gives a new landscape of
                interactions, implications, and structures).
           - (Markets, local references, voluntary transactions, etc.)
           - (ecologies, predators, defenders, etc.)
           - (game theory, economics, etc..)
