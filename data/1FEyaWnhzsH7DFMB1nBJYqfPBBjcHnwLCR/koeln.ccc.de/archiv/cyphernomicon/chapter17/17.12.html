  17.12.1. Despite the occasionally gloomy predictions, things look
            pretty good.No guarantees, of course, but trends that are
            favorable. No reason for us to rest, though.
  17.12.2. Duncan Frissell puts it this way:
           - "Trade is way up.  Wealth is way up.  International travel
              is way up. Migration is way up.  Resource prices are the
              lowest in human history.  Communications costs are way
              down.  Electronics costs are way down.  We are in a zero or
              negative inflation environment.  The quantity and quality
              of  goods and services offered on the markets is at an all-
              time high.  The percentage of the world's countries headed
              by dictators is the lowest it's ever been.
              
              "What all this means is that political philosophies that
              depend on force of arms to push people into line,  will
              increasingly fail to work.  Rich people with choices will,
              when  coerced, tend to change their investments and
              business affairs into a friendlier form or to move to a
              friendlier  environment.  Choice is real.  If choices
              exist, they will be made.  An ever higher proportion of the
              world's people will be "rich" in wealth and choice as the
              years go on.
              
              "Only a political philosophy that depends on the uncoerced
              cooperation of very  different people has a chance of
              functioning in  the future." [Duncan Frissell, 1994-09-09]
