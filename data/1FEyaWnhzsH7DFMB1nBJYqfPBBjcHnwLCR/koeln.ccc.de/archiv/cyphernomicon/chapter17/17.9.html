   17.9.1. The importance of standards
           - a critical role
           + Part of standards is validation, test suites, etc.
             - validating the features and security of a remailer,
                through pings, tests, performance tests, reliability,
                etc.
             - thus imposing a negative hit on those who fail
             + There are many ways to do this standards testing
               - market reports (as with commercial chips, software)
               - "seals of approval" (especially convenient with digital
                  sigs)
