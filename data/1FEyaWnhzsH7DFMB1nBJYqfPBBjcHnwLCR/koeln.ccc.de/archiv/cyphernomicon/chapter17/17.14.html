  17.14.1. firewalls, virtual perimeters, swIPe-type encrypted tunnels,
            an end to break-ins,
  17.14.2. "What kind of encryption will be used with ATM?"
           - (ATM = Asynchronous Transfer Mode, not Automated Teller
              Machine)
           - some reports that NSA is developing standards for ATM
  17.14.3. Shapes of things to come, maybe....(laws of other countries)
           + India has a fee schedule for BBS operators, e.g., they have
              to pay $50,000 a year to operate a bulletin board! (This
              sounds like the urban legend about the FCC planning a modem
              tax, but maybe it's true.)
             - "The Forum for Rights to Electronic Expression (FREE) has
                been formed in India as a body dedicated to extending
                fundamental rights to the electronic domain....FREE owes
                its creation to an attack on Indian datacom by the Indian
                government, in the form of exorbitant licence fees (a
                minimum Rs. 1.5 million = US$50,000 each year for a BBS,
                much higher for e-mail)." [amehta@doe.ernet.in (Dr. Arun
                Mehta), forwarded by Phil Agre, comp.org.cpsr.talk, 1994-
                08-31]
             - for more info: ftp.eff.org
                /pub/EFF/Policy/World/India/FREE
  17.14.4. Cyberspace will need better protection
           - to ensure spoofing and counterfeiting is reduced (recall
              Habitat's problems with people figuring out the loopholes)
