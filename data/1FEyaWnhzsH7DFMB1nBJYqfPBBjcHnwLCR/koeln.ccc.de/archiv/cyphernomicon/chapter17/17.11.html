  17.11.1. "Will there be a "Waco in cyberspace"?"
           - while some of us are very vocal here, and are probably
              known to the authorities, this is not generally the case.
              Many of the users of strong crypto will be discreet and
              will not give outward appearances of being code-using
              crypto anarchist cultists.
  17.11.2. Attacks to come
           - "You'll see these folks attacking anonymous remailers,
              cryptography, psuedonymous accounts, and other tools  of
              coercion-free expression and information  interchange on
              the net, ironically often in the name of promoting
              "commerce".  You'll hear them rant and rave about
              "criminals" and "terrorists", as if they even had a good
              clue about the laws of the thousands  of jurisdictions
              criss-crossed by the Internet, and as if their own attempts
              to enable coercion bear no resemblance to the practice of
              terrorism.  The scary thing is, they  really think they
              have a good idea about what all those laws should be, and
              they're perfectly willing to shove it down our throats,
              regardless of the vast diversity of culture, intellectual,
              political, and legal opinion on the planet."

           + why I'm not sanguine about Feds
             - killing Randy Weaver's wife and son from a distance,
                after trumped-up weapons charges
             - burning alive the Koresh compound, on trumped-up charges
                of Satanism, child abuse, and wife-insulting
             - seizures of boats, cars, etc., on "suspicion" of
                involvement with drugs
