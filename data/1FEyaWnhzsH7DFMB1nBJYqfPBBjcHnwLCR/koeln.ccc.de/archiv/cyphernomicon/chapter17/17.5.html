   17.5.1. "What role, if any, will MUDs, MOOs, and Virtual Realities
            play?"
           - "True Names," "Snow Crash," "Shockwave Rider"
           - Habitat, online services
           + the interaction is far beyond just the canonical "text
              messages" that systems like Digital Telephony are designed
              to cope with
             - where is the nexus of the message?
             - what about conferences scattered around the world, in
                multiple jurisdictions?
           - crypto = glue, mortar, building blocks
           - "rooms" = private places; issues of access control
           - Unless cops are put into these various "rooms," via a
              technology we can barely imagine today (agents?), it will
              be essentially impossible to control what happens in these
              rooms and places. Too many degrees of freedom, too many
              avenues for exchange.
           - cyberspaces, MUDs, virtual communities, private law,
              untouchable by physical governments
   17.5.2. keyword-based
           - can be spoofed by including dictionaries
   17.5.3. dig sig based (reputation-based)
   17.5.4. pools and anonymous areas may be explicitly supported
   17.5.5. better newsreaders, screens, filters
   17.5.6. Switches
           - "switching fabrics"
           - ATM
           - Intel's flexible mesh interconnects, iWARP, etc.
           - all of these will make for an exponential increase in
              degrees of freedom for remailer networks (labyrinths). On-
              chip remailing is esentially what is needed for Chaum's
              mixes. ATM quanta (packets) are the next likely target for
              remailers.
   17.5.7. "What limits on the Net are being proposed?"
           - NII
           + Holding carriers liable for content
             - e.g., suing Compuserve or Netcom
             - often done with bulletin boards
           - "We have to do something!"
           + Newspapers are complaining about the Four Horsemen of the
              Infocalypse:
             - terrorists, pedophiles, drug dealers, and money
                launderers
             + The "L.A. Times" opines:
               - "Designers of the new Information Age were inspired by
                  noble dreams of free-flowing data as a global
                  liberating force, a true democratizing agent.  Sadly,
                  the crooks and creeps have also climbed aboard.  The
                  time has come for much tighter computer security.
                  After all, banks learned to put locks on their vaults."
