    4.6.1. (more needed here....)
    4.6.2. As Sandy Sandfort notes, "The real point of Cypherpunks is
            that it's better to use strong crypto than weak crypto or no
            crypto at all.  Our use of crypto doesn't have to be totally
            bullet proof to be of value.  Let *them* worry about the
            technicalities while we make sure they have to work harder
            and pay more for our encrypted info than they would if it
            were in plaintext." [S.S. 1994-07-01]
