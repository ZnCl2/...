    4.2.1. Main Points
    4.2.2. Connections to Other Sections
           - Crypto Anarchy is the logical outgrowth of strong crypto.
    4.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information
           - Vernor Vinge's "True Names"
           - David Friedman's "Machinery of Freedom"
    4.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments
           - Most of the list members are libertarians, or leaning in
              that direction, so the bias toward this is apparent.
           - (If there's a coherent _non_-libertarian ideology, that's
              also consistent with supporting strong crypto, I'm not sure
              it's been presented.)
