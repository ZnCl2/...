    4.3.1. This is perhaps a controversial area. So why include it? The
            main reason is to provide some grounding for the later
            comments on many issues.
    4.3.2. People should not expect a uniform ideology on this list.
            Some of us are anarcho-capitalist radicals (or "crypto
            anarchists"), others of us are staid Republicans, and still
            others are Wobblies and other assored leftists.
