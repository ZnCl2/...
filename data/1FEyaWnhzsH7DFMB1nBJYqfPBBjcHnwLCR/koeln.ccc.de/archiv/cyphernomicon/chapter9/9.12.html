   9.12.1. "Did the Administration really back off on Clipper? I heard
            that Al Gore wrote a letter to Rep. Cantwell, backing off."
           - No, though Clipper has lost steam (corporations weren't
              interested in buying Clipper phones, and AT&T was very late
              in getting "Surety" phones out).
           - The Gore announcement may actually indicate a shift in
              emphasis to "software key escrow" (my best guess).
           - Our own Michael Froomkin, a lawyer, writes:  "The letter is
              a nullity.  It almost quotes from testimony given a year
              earlier by NIST to Congress.  Get a copy of Senator Leahy's
              reaction off the eff www  server.  He saw it for the empty
              thing it is....Nothing has changed except Cantwell dropped
              her bill for nothing." [A.Michael Froomkin,
              alt.privacy.clipper, 1994-09-05]
