   9.15.1. (This section needs a lot more)
   9.15.2. things are happening fast....
   9.15.3. TIS, Carl Ellison, Karlsruhe
   9.15.4. objections to key escrow
           - "Holding deposits in real estate transactions is a classic
              example. Built-in wiretaps are *not* escrow, unless the
              government is a party to your contract.  As somebody on the
              list once said, just because the Mafia call themselves
              "businessmen" doesn't make them legitimate; calling
              extorted wiretaps "escrow" doesn't make them a service.
              
              "The government has no business making me get their
              permission to talk to anybody about anything in any
              language I choose, and they have no business insisting I
              buy "communication protection service" from some of their
              friends to do it, any more than the aforenamed
              "businessmen" have any business insisting I buy "fire
              insurance" from *them*." [Bill Stewart, 1994-07-24]
   9.15.5. Micali's "Fair Escrow"
           - various efforts underway
           - need section here
           - Note: participants at Karlsruhe Conference report that a
              German group may have published on software key escrow
              years before Micali filed his patent (reports that NSA
              officials were "happy")
