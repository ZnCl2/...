    9.6.1. "Has crypto been restricted in countries other than the
            U.S.?"
           - Many countries have restrictions on civilian/private use of
              crypto. Some even insist that corporations either send all
              transmissions in the clear, or that keys be provided to the
              government. The Phillipines, for example. And certainly
              regimes in the Communists Bloc, or what's left of it, will
              likely have various laws restricting crypto. Possibly
              draconian laws....in many cultures, use of crypto is
              tantamount to espionage.
