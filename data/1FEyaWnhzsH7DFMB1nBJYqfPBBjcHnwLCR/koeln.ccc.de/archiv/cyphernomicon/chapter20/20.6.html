   20.6.1. This FAQ, or whatever one calls it, is more than just a
            simple listing of frequently asked questions and the lowest-
            common-denominator answers. This should be clear just by the
            size alone. I make no apologies for writing the document I
            wanted to write. Others are free to write the FAQ they would
            prefer to read. You're getting what you paid for.
   20.6.2. My views are rather strong in some areas. I've tried to
            present some dissenting arguments in cases where I think
            Cypherpunks are really somewhat divided, such as in remailer
            strategies and the like. In cases where I think there's no
            credible dissent, such as in the wisdom of Clipper, I've made
            no attempt to be fair. My libertarian, even anarchist, views
            surely come through. Either deal with it, or don't read the
            document. I have to be honest about this.
