   20.3.1. It may seem illogical for a Cypherpunk to assert some kind of
            copyright. Perhaps. But my main concern is the ease with
            which people can relabel documents as their own, sometimes
            after only adding a few words here and there.
   20.3.2. Yes, I used the words of others in places, to make points
            better than I felt my own words would, to save time, and to
            give readers a different voice speaking on issues. I have
            credited quotes with a "[Joe Foobar, place, date]
            attribution, usually at the end of the quote. If a place is
            not listed, it is the Cypherpunks list itself. The author and
            date should be sufficient to (someday) retrieve the source
            text. By the way, I used quotes as they seemed appropriate,
            and make no claims that the quoted points are necessarily
            original to the author--who may have remembered them from
            somewhere else--or that the date listed is the origination
            date for the point. I have something like 80 megabytes of
            Cypherpunks posts, so I couldn't do an archaeological dig for
            the earliest mention of an idea.
   20.3.3. People can quote this FAQ under the "fair use" provisions,
            e.g., a paragraph or two, with credits. Anything more than a
            few paragraphs constitutes copyright infringement, as I
            understand it.
   20.3.4. Should I give up the maintaining of this FAQ and/or should
            others get involved, then the normal co-authorship and
            inheritance arrangements will be possible.
   20.3.5. The Web. WWW and Mosaic offer amazing new opportunities for
            on-line documents. It is in fact likely that this FAQ will be
            available as a Web document. My concern, however, is that the
            integrity and authorship be maintained. Thus, splitting the
            document in a hundred or more little pieces, with no
            authorship attached, would not be cool. Also, I intend to
            maintain this document with my powerful outlining tools
            (Symantec's "MORE," on a Macintosh) and thus anyone who
            "freezes" the document and uses it as a base for links,
            pointers, etc., will be left behind as mods are made.
