   20.5.1. This FAQ is very long, which makes finding specific questions
            problematic. Such is life--shorter FAQ are of course easier
            to navigate, but may not address important issues.
   20.5.2. A full version of this FAQ is available, as well as chapter-
            by-chapter versions (to reduce the downloading efforts for
            some people). Search tools within text editors are one way to
            find topics. Future versions of this FAQ may be paginated and
            then indexed (but maybe not).
   20.5.3. I advise using search tools in editors and word processors to
            find sections of interest. This is likely faster anyway than
            consulting an index generated by me (which I haven't
            generated, and probably never will).
