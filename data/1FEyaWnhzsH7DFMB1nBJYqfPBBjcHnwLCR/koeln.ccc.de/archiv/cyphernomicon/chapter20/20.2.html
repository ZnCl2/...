   20.2.1. Copyright Timothy C. May. All rights reserved. For what it's
            worth.
   20.2.2. Apologies in advance for the mix of styles (outline, bullet,
            text, essays), for fragments and incomplete sections. This
            FAQ is already much too long and detailed, and writing
            suitable connective material, introductions, summaries, etc.
            is not in the cards anytime soon. Go with the flow, use your
            text searching tools, and deal with it.
   20.2.3. Substantive corrections welcome, quibbles less welcome, and
            ideological debate even less welcome. Corrections to outdated
            information, especially on pointers to information, will be
            most appreciated.
