<PRE>
   20.7.1. This detailed disclaimer is probably not good in most courts
            in the U.S., contracts having been thrown out if favor of
            nominalism, but here it is anyway. At least nobody can claim
            they were misled into thinking I was giving them warranteed,
            guaranteed advice.
   20.7.2. Timothy C. May hereby disclaims all warranties relating to
            this document, whether express or implied, including without
            limitation any implied warranties of merchantability or
            fitness for a particular purpose. Tim May will not be liable
            for any special, incidental, consequential, indirect or
            similar damages due to loss of business, indictment for any
            crime, imprisonment, torture, or any other reason, even if
            Tim May or an agent of his has been advised of the
            possibility of such damages.  In no event shall Tim May be
            liable for any damages, regardless of the form of the claim.
            The person reading or using the document bears all risk as to
            the quality and suitability of the document. Legality of
            reading or possessing this document in a jurisdiction is not
            the responsibility of Tim May.
   20.7.3. The points expressed may or may not represent the views of
            Tim May, and certainly may not represent the views of other
            Cypherpunks. Certain ideas are explored which, if
            implemented, would be illegal to various extents in most
            countries in the world. Think of these explorations of ideas
            as just that.
