<PRE>
  10.17.1. Censorship comes in many forms. Tort law, threats of grant or
            contract removal, all are limiting speech. (More reasons for
            anonymous speech, of course.)
  10.17.2. Discussions of cryptography could be targets of future
            crackdowns. Sedition laws, conspiracy laws, RICO, etc. How
            long before speaking on these matters earns a warning letter
            from your university or your company? (It's the "big stick"
            of ultimate government action that spurs these university and
            company policies. Apple fears being shut down for having
            "involvement" with a terrorist plot, Emory University fears
            being sued for millions of dollars for "conspiring" to
            degrade wimmin of color, etc.)
            
            How long before "rec.guns" is no longer carried at many
            sites, as they fear having their universities or companies
            linked to discussions of "assault weapons" and "cop-killer
            bullets"? Prediction: Many companies and universities, under
            pressure from the Feds, will block groups in which encrypted
            files are posted. After all, if one encrypts, one must have
            something to hide, and that could expose the university to
            legal action from some group that feels aggrieved.
  10.17.3. Free speech is under assault across the country. The tort
            system is being abused to stifle dissenting views (and lest
            you think I am only a capitalist, only a free marketeer, the
            use of "SLAPP suits"--"Strategic Lawsuits Against Public
            Participation"--by corporations or real estate developers to
            threaten those who dare to publicly speak against their
            projects is a travesty, a travesty that the courts have only
            recently begun to correct).
            
            We are becoming a nation of sheep, fearing the midnight raid,
            the knock on the door. We fear that if we tell a joke,
            someone will glare at us and threaten to sue us _and_ our
            company! And so companies are adopting "speech codes" and
            other such baggage of the Orwell's totalitarian state.
            Political correctness is extending its tendrils into nearly
            every aspect of life in America.
