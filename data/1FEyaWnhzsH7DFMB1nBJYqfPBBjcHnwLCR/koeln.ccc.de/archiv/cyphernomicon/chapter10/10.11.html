  10.11.1. Jurisdictions with more favorable laws will see claimants
            going there.
  10.11.2. Similar to "capital flight" and "people voting with their
            feet."
  10.11.3. Is the flip side of "jurisdiction shopping." wherein
            prosecutors shop around for a jurisdiction that will be
            likelier to convict. (As with the Amateur Action BBS case,
            tried in Memphis, Tennessee, not in California.)
