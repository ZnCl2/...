   7.12.1. "What is RSA Data Security Inc.'s position on PGP?"
           - They were strongly opposed to early versions
           + Objections
             - infringes on PKP patents (claimed infringements, not
                tested in court, though)
             - breaks the tight control previously seen
             - brings unwanted attention to public key approaches (I
                think PGP also helped RSA and RSADSI)
             - bad blood between Zimmermann and Bidzos
           + Objections
             - infringes on PKP patents (claimed infringements, not
                tested in court, though)
             - breaks the tight control previously seen
             - brings unwanted attention to public key approaches (I
                think PGP also helped RSA and RSADSI)
             - bad blood between Zimmermann and Bidzos
           - Talk of lawsuits, actions, etc.
           - The 2.6 MIT accomodation may have lessened the tension;
              purely speculative
   7.12.2. "Is PGP legal or illegal"?
   7.12.3. "Is there still a conflict between RSADSI and PRZ?"
           - Apparently not. The MIT 2.6 negotiations seem to have
              buried all such rancor. At least officially. I hear there's
              still animosity, but it's no longer at the surface. (And
              RSADSI is now facing lawsuits and patent suits.)
