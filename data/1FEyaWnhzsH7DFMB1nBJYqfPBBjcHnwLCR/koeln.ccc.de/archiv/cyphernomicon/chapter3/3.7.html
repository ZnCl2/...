    3.7.1. "What kind of press coverage have the Cypherpunks gotten?"
           - " I concur with those who suggest that the solution to the
              ignorance manifested in many of the articles concerning the
              Net is education.  The coverage of the Cypherpunks of late
              (at least in the Times) shows me that reasonable accuracy
              is possible." [Chris Walsh,  news.admin.policy, 1994-07-04]
