<PRE>
    3.8.1. On extending the scope of Cypherpunks to other countres
           - a kind of crypto underground, to spread crypto tools, to
              help sow discord, to undermine corrupt governments (to my
              mind, all governments now on the planet are intrinsically
              corrupt and need to be undermined)
           - links to the criminal underworlds of these countries is one
              gutsy thing to consider....fraught with dangers, but
              ultimately destabilizing of governments
