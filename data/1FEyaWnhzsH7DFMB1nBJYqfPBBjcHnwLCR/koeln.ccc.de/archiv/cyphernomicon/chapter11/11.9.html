   11.9.1. "The dossier never forgets"
           + any transgressions of any law in any country can be stored
              indefinitely, exposing the transgressor to arrest and
              detention anytime he enters a country with such a record on
              him
             - (This came up with regard to the British having quaint
                ideas about computer security, hacking, and data privacy;
                it is quite possible that an American passing through
                London could be detained for some obscure violation years
                in the past.)
           - this is especially worrisome in a society in which legal
              codes fill entire rooms and in which nearly every day
              produces some violation of some law
   11.9.2. "What about the privacy issues with home shopping, set-top
            boxes, advertisers, and the NII?"
           - Do we want our preferences in toothpaste fed into databases
              so that advertisers can target us? Or that our food
              purchases be correlated and analyzed by the government to
              spot violations of the Dietary Health Act?
           - First, laws which tell people what records they are
              "allowed" to keep are wrong-headed, and lead to police
              state inspections of disk drives, etc. The so-called "Data
              Privacy" laws of several European nations are a nightmare.
              Strong crypto makes them moot.
           - Second, it is mostly up to people to protect what they want
              protected, not to pass laws demanding that others protect
              it for them.
           - In practice, this means either use cash or make
              arrangements with banks and credit card companies that will
              protect privacy. Determining if they have or not is another
              issue, but various ideas suggest themselves (John Gilmore
              says he often joins groups under variants of his name, to
              see who is selling his name to mailing lists.)
           - Absent any laws which forbid them, privacy-preserving
              credit card companies will likely spring up if there's a
              market demand. Digital cash is an example. Other variants
              abound. Cypherpunks should not allow such alternatives to
              be banned, and should of course work on their own such
              systems.
   11.9.3. credit agencies
           - TRW Credit, Transunion, Equifax
           - links to WitSec
   11.9.4. selling of data bases, linking of records...
           - several states have admitted to selling their driver's
              license data bases
