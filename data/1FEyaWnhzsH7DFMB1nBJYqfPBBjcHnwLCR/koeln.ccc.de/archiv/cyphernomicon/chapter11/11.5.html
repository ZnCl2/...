   11.5.1. Partly this overlaps on the earlier discussion of crypto laws
            in other countries.
   11.5.2. Major Non-U.S. Surveillance Organizations
           + BnD -- Bundesnachrichtendienst
             - German security service
             - BND is seeking constitutional amendment, buy may not need
                it, as the mere call for it told everyone what is already
                existing
             - "vacuum cleaner in the ether"
             - Gehlen...Eastern Front Intelligence
             - Pullach, outside Munchen
             - they have always tried to get the approval to do domestic
                spying...a key to power
           + Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) -- W. German FBI
             - HQ is at Wiesbaden
             - bomb blew up there when being examined, killing an
                officer (related to Pan Am/Lockerbie/PFLP-GC)
             - sign has double black eagles (back to back)
           - BVD -- Binnenlandse Veiligheids Dienst, Dutch Internal
              Security Service
           + SDECE
             - French intelligence (foreign intelligence), linked to
                Greepeace ship bombing in New Zealand?
             - SDECE had links to the October Surprise, as some French
                agents were in on the negotiations, the arms shipments
                out of Marseilles and Toulon, and in meetings with
                Russbacher and the others
           - DST, Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire,
              counterespionage arm of France (parallel to FBI)
           + DSGE, Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extériere
             - provides draft deferments for those who deliver stolen
                information
           + Sweden, Forsvarets Radioanstalt ("Radio Agency of the
              Defense")
             - cracked German communications between occupied Norway and
                occupied Denmark
             - Beurling, with paper and pencil only
           + Mossad, LAKAM, Israel
             + HQ in Tel Aviv, near HQ of AMAN, military intelligence
               - doesn't HQ move around a lot?
             - LAKAM (sp?),  a supersecret Israeli intelligence
                agency...was shown the PROMIS software in 1983
             + learned of the Pakistani success in building an atom bomb
                and took action against the Pakistani leadership:
                destruction of the plane carrying the President (Zia?)
                and some U.S. experts
               - Mossad knew of DIA and CIA involvement in BCCI
                  financing of Pakistani atom bomb efforts (and links to
                  other arms dealers that allowed triggers and the like
                  to reach Pakistan)
             - revelations by Vanunu were designed to scare the Arab and
                Muslim world-and to send a signal that the killing of
                President Zia was to be the fate of any Pakistani leader
                who continued the program
   11.5.3. They are very active, though they get less publicity than do
            the American CIA, NSA, FBI, etc.
