  11.13.1. Insurance and National Health Care will Produce the "National
            ID" that will be Nearly Unescapable
           - hospitals and doctors will have to have the card...cash
              payments will  evoke suspicion and may not even be feasible
  11.13.2. I'm less worried that a pharmacist will add me to some
            database he keeps than that my doctor will be instructed to
            compile a dossier to government standards and then zip it off
            over the Infobahn to the authorities.
  11.13.3. Dangers and issues of National Health Care Plan
           - tracking, national ID card
           - "If you think the BATF is bad, wait until the BHCRCE goes
              into action. "What is the BHCRCE?" you ask. Why, it the
              Burea of Health Care Reform Compliance Enforcement - the
              BATF, FBI, FDA, CIA and IRS all rolled into one."  [Dave
              Feustel, talk.politics.guns, 1994-08-19]
           - Bill Stewart has pointed out the dangers of children having
              social security numbers, of tracking systems in schools and
              hospitals, etc.
