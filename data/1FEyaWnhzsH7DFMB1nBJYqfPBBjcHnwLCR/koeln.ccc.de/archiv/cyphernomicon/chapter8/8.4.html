    8.4.1. (Thre are so many reasons, and this is asked so often, that
            I've collected these various reasons here. More can be added,
            of course.)
    8.4.2. Privacy in general
    8.4.3. Physical Threats
           + "corporate terrrorism" is not a myth: drug dealers and
              other "marginal" businessmen face this every day
             - extortion, threats, kidnappings
           + and many businesses of the future may well be less
              "gentlemanly" than the conventional view has it
             - witness the bad blood between Intel and AMD, and then
                imagine it getting ten times worse
             - and national rivalries, even in ostensibly legal
                businesses (think of arms dealers), may cause more use of
                violence
             + Mafia and other organized crime groups may try to extort
                payments or concessions from market participants, causing
                them to seek the relative protection of anonymous systems
               - with reputations
             + Note that calls for the threatened to turn to the police
                for protection has several problems
               - the activities may be illegal or marginally illegal
                  (this is the reason the Mafia can often get involved
                  and why it may even sometimes have a positive effect,
                  acting as the cop for illegal activities)
               - the police are often too busy to get involved, what
                  with so much physical crime clogging the courts
           - extortion and kidnappings can be done using these very
              techniques of cryptoanarchy, thus causing a kind of arms
              race
           + battered and abused women and families may need the
              equivalent of a "witness protection program"
             + because of the ease of tracing credit card purchases,
                with the right bribes and/or court orders (or even
                hacking), battered wives may seek credit cards under
                pseudonyms
               - and some card companies may oblige, as a kind of
                  politically correct social gesture
               + or groups like NOW and Women Against Rape may even
                  offer their own cards
                 - perhaps backed up by some kind of escrow fund
                 - could be debit cards
           + people who participate in cyberspace businesses may fear
              retaliation or extortion in the real world
             - threats by their governments (for all of the usual
                reasons, plus kickbacks, threats to close them down,
                etcl)
             - ripoffs by those who covet their success...
    8.4.4. Voting
           - We take it for granted in Western societies that voting
              should be "anonymous"--untraceable, unlinkable
           - we don't ask people "What have you got to hide?" or tell
              them "If you're doing something anonymously, it must be
              illegal."
           - Same lesson ought to apply to a lot of things for which the
              government is increasingly demanding proof of identity for
           + Anonymous Voting in Clubs, Organizations, Churches, etc.
             + a major avenue for spreading CA methods: "electronic
                blackballing," weighted voting (as with number of shares)
               + e.g., a corporation issues "voting tokens," which can
                  be used to vote anonymously
                 - or even sold to others (like selling shares, except
                    selling only the voting right for a specific election
                    is cheaper, and many people don't much care about
                    elections)
               + a way to protect against deep pockets lawsuits in, say,
                  race discrimination cases
                 - wherein a director is sued for some action the
                    company takes-anonymity will give him some legal
                    protection, some "plausible deniability"
               + is possible to set up systems (cf. Salomaa) in which
                  some "supervotes" have blackball power, but the use of
                  these vetos is indistinguishable from a standard
                  majority rules vote
                 - i.e., nobody, except the blackballer(s), will know
                    whether the blackball was used!
                 + will the government seek to limit this kind of
                    protocol?
                   - claiming discrimination potential or abuse of
                      voting rights?
             + will Justice Department (or SEC) seek to overturn
                anonymous voting?
               - as part of the potential move to a "full disclosure"
                  society?
               - related to antidiscrimination laws, accountability,
                  etc.
             + Anonymous Voting in Reputation-Based Systems (Journals,
                Markets)
               + customers can vote on products, on quality of service,
                  on the various deals they've been involved in
                 - not clear how the voting rights would get distributed
                 - the idea is to avoid lawsuits, sanctions by vendors,
                    etc. (as with the Bose suit)
               + Journals
                 - a canonical example, and one which I must include, as
                    it combines anonymous refereeing (already standard,
                    in primitive forms), hypertext (links to reviews),
                    and basic freedom of speech issues
                 - this will likely be an early area of use
               - this whole area of consumer reviews may be a way to get
                  CA bandwidth up and running (lots of PK-encrypted
                  traffic sloshing around the various nets)
    8.4.5. Maintenance of free speech
           - protection of speech
           + avoiding retaliation for controversial speech
             - this speech may be controversial, insulting, horrific,
                politically incorrect, racist, sexist, speciesist, and
                other horrible...but remailers and anonymity make it all
                impossible to stop
           - whistleblowing
           + political speech
             - KKK, Aryan Resistance League, Black National Front,
                whatever
             - cf. the "debate" between "Locke" and "Demosthenes" in
                Orson Scott Card's novel, "Ender's Game."
           - (Many of these reasons are also why 'data havens' will
              eventually be set up...indeed, they already exist...homolka
              trial, etc.)
    8.4.6. Adopt different personnas, pseudonyms
    8.4.7. Choice of reading material, viewing habits, etc.
           - to prevent dossiers on this being formed, anonymous
              purchases are needed (cash works for small items, not for
              video rentals, etc.)
           + video rentals
             - (Note: There are "laws" making such releases illegal,
                but...)
           - cable t.v. viewing habits
           + mail-order purchases
             - yes, they need your address to ship to, but there may be
                cutouts that delink (e.g., FedEx might feature such a
                service, someday
    8.4.8. Anonymity in Requesting Information, Services, Goods
           + a la the controversy over Caller ID and 900 numbers: people
              don't want their telephone numbers (and hence identities)
              fed into huge consumer-preference data banks
             - of the things they buy, the videos they rent, the books
                they read. etc. (various laws protect some of these
                areas, like library books, video rentals)
             - subscription lists are already a booming resale
                market...this will get faster and more finely "tuned"
                with electronic subscriptions: hence the desire to
                subscribe anonymously
           + some examples of "sensitive" services that anonymity may be
              desired in (especially related to computers, modems, BBSes)
             + reading unusual or sensitive groups: alt.sex.bondage,
                etc.
               - or posting to these groups!
               - recent controversy over NAMBLA may make such
                  protections more desirable to some (and parallel calls
                  for restrictions!)
             - posting to such groups, especially given that records are
                perpetual and that government agencies read and file
                postings (an utterly trivial thing to do)
             - requesting help on personal issues (equivalent to the
                "Name Witheld" seen so often)
             + discussing controversial political issues (and who knows
                what will be controversial 20 years later when the poster
                is seeking a political office, for example?)
               - given that some groups have already (1991) posted the
                  past postings of people they are trying to smear!
             + Note: the difference between posting to a BBS group or
                chat line and writing a letter to an editor is
                significant
               - partly technological: it is vastly easier to compile
                  records of postings than it is to cut clippings of
                  letters to editors (though this will change rapidly as
                  scanners make this easy)
               - partly sociological: people who write letters know the
                  letters will be with the back issues in perpetuity,
                  that bound issues will preserve their words for many
                  decades to come (and could conceivably come back to
                  haunt them), but people who post to BBSes probably
                  think their words are temporary
               + and there are some other factors
                 - no editing
                 - no time delays (and no chance to call an editor and
                    retract a letter written in haste or anger)
                 + and letters can, and often are, written with the
                    "Name Witheld" signature-this is currently next to
                    impossible to do on networks
                   - though some "forwarding" services have informally
                      sprung up
           + Businesses may wish to protect themselves from lawsuits
              over comments by their employees
             + the usual "The opinions expressed here are not those of
                my employer" may not be enough to protect an employer
                from lawsuits
               - imagine racist or sexist comments leading to lawsuits
                  (or at least being brought up as evidence of the type
                  of "attitude" fostered by the company, e.g., "I've
                  worked for Intel for 12 years and can tell you that
                  blacks make very poor engineers.")
             + employees may make comments that damage the reputations
                of their companies
               - Note: this differs from the current situation, where
                  free speech takes priority over company concerns,
                  because the postings to a BBS are carried widely, may
                  be searched electronically (e.g., AMD lawyers search
                  the UseNet postings of 1988-91 for any postings by
                  Intel employees besmirching the quality or whatever of
                  AMD chips),
             - and so employees of corporations may protect themselves,
                and their employers, by adopting pseudonyms
           + Businesses may seek information without wanting to alert
              their competitors
             - this is currently done with agents, "executive search
                firms," and lawyers
             - but how will it evolve to handle electronic searches?
             + there are some analogies with filings of "Freedom of
                Information Act" requests, and of patents, etc.
               + these "fishing expeditions" will increase with time, as
                  it becomes profitable for companies to search though
                  mountains of electronically-filed materials
                 - environmental impact studies, health and safety
                    disclosures, etc.
                 - could be something that some companies specialize in
           + Anonymous Consultation Services, Anonymous Stringers or
              Reporters
             + imagine an information broker, perhaps on an AMIX-like
                service, with a network of stringers
               + think of the arms deal newsletter writer in Hallahan's
                  The Trade, with his network of stringers feeding him
                  tips and inside information
                 - instead of meeting in secretive locations, a very
                    expensive proposition (in time and travel), a secure
                    network can be used
                 - with reputations, digital pseudonyms, etc.
             + they may not wish their actual identities known
               - threats from employers, former employers, government
                  agencies
               + harassment via the various criminal practices that will
                  become more common (e.g., the ease with which
                  assailants and even assassins can be contracted for)
                 - part of the overall move toward anonymity
               - fears of lawsuits, licensing requirements, etc.
             + Candidates for Such Anonymous Consultation Services
               + An arms deals newsletter
                 - an excellent reputation for accuracy and timely
                    information
                 + sort of like an electronic form of Jane's
                   - with scandals and government concern
                 - but nobody knows where it comes from
                 + a site that distributes it to subscribers gets it
                    with another larger batch of forwarded material
                   - NSA, FBI, Fincen, etc. try to track it down
               + "Technology Insider" reports on all kinds of new
                  technologies
                 - patterned after Hoffler's Microelectronics News, the
                    Valley's leading tip sheet for two decades
                 - the editor pays for tips, with payments made in two
                    parts: immediate, and time-dependent, so that the
                    accuracy of a tip, and its ultimate importance (in
                    the judgment of the editor) can be proportionately
                    rewarded
                 + PK systems, with contributors able to encrypt and
                    then publicly post (using their own means of
                    diffusion)
                   - with their messages containing further material,
                      such as authentications, where to send the
                      payments, etc.
               + Lundberg's Oil Industry Survey (or similar)
                 - i.e., a fairly conventional newsletter with publicly
                    known authors
                 - in this case, the author is known, but the identities
                    of contributors is well-protected
               + A Conspiracy Newsletter
                 - reporting on all of the latest theories of
                    misbehavior (as in the "Conspiracies" section of this
                    outline)
                 + a wrinkle: a vast hypertext web, with contributors
                    able to add links and nodes
                   + naturally, their real name-if they don't care about
                      real-world repercussions-or one of their digital
                      pseudonyms (may as well use cryptonyms) is attached
                     + various algorithms for reputations
                       - sum total of everything ever written, somehow
                          measured by other comments made, by "voting,"
                          etc.
                       - a kind of moving average, allowing for the fact
                          that learning will occur, just as a researcher
                          probably gets better with time, and that as
                          reputation-based systems become better
                          understood, people come to appreciate the
                          importance of writing carefully
               + and one of the most controversial of all: Yardley's
                  Intelligence Daily
                 - though it may come out more than daily!
                 + an ex-agent set this up in the mid-90s, soliciting
                    contributions via an anonymous packet-switching sysem
                   - refined over the next couple of years
                   - combination of methods
                 - government has been trying hard to identify the
                    editor, "Yardley"
                 - he offers a payback based on value of the
                    information, and even has a "Requests" section, and a
                    Classifed Ad section
                 - a hypertext web, similar to the Conspiracy Newsletter
                    above
                 + Will Government Try to Discredit the Newsletter With
                    False Information?
                   - of course, the standard ploy in reputation-based
                      systems
                   + but Yardley has developed several kinds of filters
                      for this
                     - digital pseudonyms which gradually build up
                        reputations
                     - cross-checking of his own sort
                     - he even uses language filters to analyze the text
                   + and so what?
                     - the world is filled with disinformation, rumors,
                        lies, half-truths, and somehow things go on....
               + Other AMIX-like Anonymous Services
                 + Drug Prices and Tips
                   - tips on the quality of various drugs (e.g.,
                      "Several reliable sources have told us that the
                      latest Maui Wowie is very intense, numbers
                      below...")
                   + synthesis of drugs (possibly a separate
                      subscription)
                     - designer drugs
                     - home labs
                     - avoiding detection
                 + The Hackers Daily
                   - tips on hacking and cracking
                   - anonymous systems themselves (more tips)
                 - Product evaluations (anonymity needed to allow honest
                    comments with more protection against lawsuits)
             + Newspapers Are Becoming Cocerned with the Trend Toward
                Paying for News Tips
               - by the independent consultation services
               - but what can they do?
               + lawsuits are tried, to prevent anonymous tips when
                  payments are involved
                 - their lawyers cite the tax evasion and national
                    security aspects
           + Private Data Bases
             + any organization offering access to data bases must be
                concerned that somebody-a disgruntled customer, a
                whistleblower, the government, whoever-will call for an
                opening of the files
               - under various "Data Privacy" laws
               - or just in general (tort law, lawsuits, "discovery")
             + thus, steps will be taken to isolate the actual data from
                actual users, perhaps via cutouts
               + e.g., a data service sells access, but subcontracts out
                  the searches to other services via paths that are
                  untraceable
                 + this probably can't be outlawed in general-though any
                    specific transaction might later be declared illegal,
                    etc., at which time the link is cut and a new one is
                    established-as this would outlaw all subcontracting
                    arrangements!
                   - i.e., if Joe's Data Service charges $1000 for a
                      search on widgets and then uses another possibly
                      transitory (meaning a cutout) data service, the
                      most a lawsuit can do is to force Joe to stop using
                      this untraceble service
                   - levels of indirection (and firewalls that stop the
                      propagation of investigations)
           + Medical Polls (a la AIDS surveys, sexual practices surveys,
              etc.)
             + recall the method in which a participant tosses a coin to
                answer a question...the analyst can still recover the
                important ensemble information, but the "phase" is lost
               - i.e., an individual answering "Yes" to the question
                  "Have you ever had xyz sex?" may have really answered
                  "No" but had his answer flipped by a coin toss
             + researchers may even adopt sophisticated methods in which
                explicit diaries are kept, but which are then transmitted
                under an anonymous mailing system to the researchers
               - obvious dangers of authentication, validity, etc.
           + Medical testing: many reasons for people to seek anonymity
             - AIDS testing is the preeminent example
             - but also testing for conditions that might affect
                insurablity or employment (e.g.,  people may go to
                medical havens in Mexico or wherever for tests that might
                lead to uninsurability should insurance companies learn
                of the "precondition")
             + except in AIDS and STDs, it is probably both illegal and
                against medical ethics to offer anonymous consultations
               - perhaps people will travel to other countries
    8.4.9. Anonymity in Belonging to Certain Clubs, Churches, or
            Organizations
           + people fear retaliation or embarassment should their
              membership be discovered, now or later
             - e.g., a church member who belongs to controversial groups
                or clubs
           - mainly, or wholly, those in which physical contact or other
              personal contact is not needed (a limited set)
           - similar to the cell-based systems described elsewhere
           + Candidates for anonymous clubs or organizations
             - Earth First!, Act Up, Animal Liberation Front, etc.
             - NAMBLA and similar controversial groups
           - all of these kinds of groups have very vocal, very visible
              members, visible even to the point of seeking out
              television coverage
           - but there are probably many more who would join these
              groups if there identities could be shielded from public
              group, for the sake of their careers, their families, etc.
           + ironically, the corporate crackdown on outside activities
              considered hostile to the corporation (or exposing them to
              secondary lawsuits, claims, etc.) may cause greater use of
              anonymous systems
             - cell-based membership in groups
           - the growth of anonymous membership in groups (using
              pseudonyms) has a benefit in increasing membership by
              people otherwise afraid to join, for example, a radical
              environmental group
   8.4.10. Anonymity in Giving Advice or Pointers to Information
           - suppose someone says who is selling some illegal or
              contraband product...is this also illegal?
           - hypertext systems will make this inevitable
   8.4.11. Reviews, Criticisms, Feedback
           - "I am teaching sections for a class this term, and tomorrow
              I am going to: 1) tell my students how to use a remailer,
              and 2) solicit anonymous feedback on my teaching.
              
              "I figure it will make them less apprehensive about making
              honest suggestions and comments (assuming any of them
              bother, of course)." [Patrick J. LoPresti
              patl@lcs.mit.edu, alt.privacy.anon-server, 1994-09-08]
   8.4.12. Protection against lawsuits, "deep pockets" laws
           + by not allowing the wealth of an entity to be associated
              with actions
             - this also works by hiding assets, but the IRS frowns on
                that, so unlinking the posting or mailing name with
                actual entity is usually easier
           + "deep pockets"
             - it will be in the interest of some to hide their
                identities so as to head off these kinds of lawsuits
                (filed for whatever reasons, rightly or wrongly)
             - postings and comments may expose the authors to lawsuits
                for libel, misrepresentation, unfair competition, and so
                on (so much for free speech in these beknighted states)
             + employers may also be exposed to the same suits,
                regardless of where their employees posted from
               - on the tenuous grounds that an employee was acting on
                  his employer's behalf, e.g., in defending an Intel
                  product on Usenet
             - this, BTW, is another reason for people to seek ways to
                hide some of their assets-to prevent confiscation in deep
                pockets lawsuits (or family illnesses, in which  various
                agencies try to seize assets of anybody they can)
             - and the same computers that allow these transactions will
                also allow more rapid determination of who has the
                deepest pockets!
           + by insulating the entity from repercussions of "sexist" or
              "racist" comments that might provoke lawsuits, etc.
             - (Don't laugh--many companies are getting worried that
                what their employees write on Usenet may trigger lawsuits
                against the companies.)
           + many transactions may be deemed illegal in some
              jursidictions
             + even in some that the service or goods provider has no
                control over
               - example: gun makers being held liable for firearms
                  deaths in the District of Columbia (though this was
                  recently cancelled)
             - the maze of laws may cause some to seek anonymity to
                protect themselves against this maze
           + Scenario: Anonymous organ donor banks
             + e.g., a way to "market" rare blood types, or whatever,
                without exposing one's self to forced donation or other
                sanctions
               - "forced donation" involves the lawsuits filed by the
                  potential recipient
               - at the time of offer, at least...what happens when the
                  deal is consummated is another domain
             - and a way to avoid the growing number of government
                stings
   8.4.13. Journalism and Writing
           + writers have had a long tradtion of adopting pseudonyms,
              for a variety of reasons
             - because they couldn't get published under their True
                Names, because they didn't _want_ their true names
                published, for the fun of it, etc.
             - George Elliot, Lewis Carroll, Saki, Mark Twain, etc.
           - reporters
           + radio disc jockeys
             - a Cypherpunk who works for a technology company uses the
                "on air personna" of "Arthur Dent" ("Hitchhiker's Guide")
                for his part-time radio broadcasting job...a common
                situation, he tells me
           + whistleblowers
             - this was an early use
           + politically sensitive persons
             - "
             + I subsequently got myself an account on anon.penet.fi as
                the "Lt.
               - Starbuck" entity, and all later FAQ updates were from
                  that account.
               - For reasons that seemed important at the time, I took
                  it upon myself to
               - become the moderator/editor of the FAQ."
               - &lt;an54835@anon.penet.fi, 4-3-94, alt.fan.karla-homolka&gt;
           + Example: Remailers were used to skirt the publishing ban on
              the Karla Homolka case
             - various pseudonymous authors issued regular updates
             - much consternation in Canada!
           + avoidance of prosecution or damage claims for writing,
              editing, distributing, or selling "damaging" materials is
              yet another reason for anonymous systems to emerge: those
              involved in the process will seek to immunize themselves
              from the various tort claims that are clogging the courts
             - producers, distributors, directors, writers, and even
                actors of x-rated or otherwise "unacceptable" material
                may have to have the protection of anonymous systems
             - imagine fiber optics and the proliferation of videos and
                talk shows....bluenoses and prosecutors will use "forum
                shopping" to block access, to prosecute the producers,
                etc.
   8.4.14. Academic, Scientific, or Professional
           - protect other reputations (professional, authorial,
              personal, etc.)
           - wider range of actions and behaviors (authors can take
              chances)
           - floating ideas out under pseudonyms
           - later linking of these pseudonyms to one's own identity, if
              needed (a case of credential transfer)
           -  floating unusual points of view
           - Peter Wayner writes: "I would think that many people who
              hang out on technical newsgroups would be very familiar
              with the anonymous review procedures practiced by academic
              journals. There is some value when a reviewer can speak
              their mind about a paper without worry of revenge. Of
              course everyone assures me that the system is never really
              anonymous because there are alwys only three or four people
              qualified to review each paper. :-) ....Perhaps we should
              go out of our way to make anonymous, technical comments
              about papers and ideas in the newsgroups to fascilitate the
              development of an anonymous commenting culture in
              cypberspace." [Peter Wayner, 1993-02-09]
   8.4.15. Medical Testing and Treatment
           - anonymous medical tests, a la AIDS testing
   8.4.16. Abuse, Recovery
           + personal problem discussions
             - incest, rape, emotional, Dear Abby, etc.
   8.4.17. Bypassing of export laws
           - Anonymous remailers have been useful for bypassing the
              ITARs...this is how PGP 2.6 spread rapidly, and (we hope!)
              untraceably from MIT and U.S. sites to offshore locations.
   8.4.18. Sex groups, discussions of controversial topics
           - the various alt.sex groups
           - People may feel embarrassed, may fear repercussions from
              their employers, may not wish their family and friends to
              see their posts, or may simply be aware that Usenet is
              archived in many, many places, and is even available on CD-
              ROM and will be trivially searchable in the coming decades
           + the 100% traceability of public postings to UseNet and
              other bulletin boards is very stifling to free expression
              and becomes one of the main justifications for the use of
              anonymous (or pseudononymous) boards and nets
             - there may be calls for laws against such compilation, as
                with the British data laws, but basically there is little
                that can be done when postings go to tens of thousands of
                machines and are archived in perpetuity by many of these
                nodes and by thousands of readers
             - readers who may incorporate the material into their own
                postings, etc. (hence the absurdity of the British law)
   8.4.19. Avoiding political espionage
           + TLAs in many countries monitor nearly all international
              communications (and a lot of domestic communications, too)
             - companies and individuals may wish to avoid reprisals,
                sanctions, etc.
             - PGP is reported to be in use by several dissident groups,
                and several Cypherpunks are involved in assisting them.
             - "...one legitimate application is to allow international
                political groups or companies to exchange authenticated
                messages without being subjected to the risk of
                espionage/compromise by a three letter US agency, foreign
                intelligence agency, or third party." [Sean M. Dougherty,
                alt.privacy.anon-server, 1994-09-07]
   8.4.20. Controversial political discussion, or membership in
            political groups, mailing lists, etc.
           + Recall House UnAmerican Activities Committee
             - and it's modern variant: "Are you now, or have you ever
                been, a Cypherpunk?"
   8.4.21. Preventing Stalking and Harassment
           - avoid physical tracing (harassment, "wannafucks," stalkers,
              etc.)
           - women and others are often sent "wannafuck?" messages from
              the males that outnumber them 20-to-1 in many newsgroups--
              pseudonyms help.
           - given the ease with which net I.D.s can be converted to
              physical location information, many women may be worried.
           + males can be concerned as well, given the death threats
              issued by, for example, S. Boxx/Detweiler.
             - as it happens, S. Boxx threatened me, and I make my home
                phone number and location readily known...but then I'm
                armed and ready.
   8.4.22. pressure relief valve: knowing one can flee or head for the
            frontier and not be burdened with a past
           - perhaps high rate of recidivism is correlated with this
              inability to escape...once a con, marked for life
              (certainly denied access to high-paying jobs)
   8.4.23. preclude lawsuits, subpoenas, entanglement in the legal
            machinery
   8.4.24. Business Reasons
           + Corporations can order supplies, information, without
              tipping their hand
             - the Disney purchase of land, via anonymous cutouts (to
                avoid driving the price way up)
             - secret ingredients (apocryphally, Coca Cola)
           - avoiding the "deep pockets" syndrome mentioned above
           - to beat zoning and licensing requirements (e.g., a certain
              type of business may not be "permitted" in a home office,
              so the homeowner will have to use cutouts to hide from
              enforcers)
           - protection from (and to) employers
           + employees of corporations may have to do more than just
              claim their view are not those of their employer
             - e.g., a racist post could expose IBM to sanctions,
                charges
             + thus, many employees may have to further insulate their
                identities
               - blanc@microsoft.com is now
                  blanc@pylon.com...coincidence?
           + moonlighting employees (the original concern over Black Net
              and AMIX)
             - employers may have all kinds of concerns, hence the need
                for employees to hide their identities
             - note that this interects with the licensing and zoning
                aspects
           - publishers, service-prividers
           + Needed for Certain Kinds of Reputation-Based Systems
             + a respected scientist may wish to float a speculative
                idea
               - and be able to later prove it was in fact his idea
   8.4.25. Protection against retaliation
           - whistleblowing
           + organizing boycotts
             - (in an era of laws regulating free speech, and "SLAPP"
                lawsuits)
           + the visa folks (Cantwell and Siegel) threatening those who
              comment with suits
             - the law firm that posted to 5,000 groups....also raises
                the issue again of why the Net should be subsidized
           - participating in public forums
           + as one person threatened with a lawsuit over his Usenet
              comments put it:
             - "And now they are threatening me. Merely because I openly
                expressed my views on their extremely irresponsible
                behaviour. Anyways, I have already cancelled the article
                from my site and I publicly appologize for posting it in
                the first place. I am scared :) I take all my words back.
                Will use the anonymous service next time :)"
   8.4.26. Preventing Tracking, Surveillance, Dossier Society
           + avoiding dossiers in general
             - too many dossiers being kept; anonymity allows people to
                at least hold back the tide a bit
           + headhunting, job searching, where revealing one's identity
              is not always a good idea
             - some headhunters are working for one's current employer!
             - dossiers
   8.4.27. Some Examples from the Cypherpunks List
           + S, Boxx, aka Sue D. Nym, Pablo Escobar, The Executioner,
              and an12070
             - but Lawrence Detweiler by any other name
             + he let slip his pseudonym-true name links in several ways
               - stylistic cues
               - mention of things only the "other" was likely to have
                  heard
               + sysops acknowledged certain linkings
                 - *not* Julf, though Julf presumably knew the identity
                    of "an12070"
           + Pr0duct Cypher
             - Jason Burrell points out: "Take Pr0duct Cypher, for
                example. Many believe that what (s)he's doing(*) is a
                Good Thing, and I've seen him/her using the Cypherpunk
                remailers to conceal his/her identity....* If you don't
                know, (s)he's the person who wrote PGPTOOLS, and a hack
                for PGP 2.3a to decrypt messages written with 2.6. I
                assume (s)he's doing it anonymously due to ITAR
                regulations." [J.B., 1994-09-05]
           + Black Unicorn
             - Is the pseudonym of a Washington, D.C. lawyer (I think),
                who has business ties to conservative bankers and
                businessmen in Europe, especially Liechtenstein and
                Switzerland. His involvement with the Cypherpunks group
                caused him to adopt this pseudonym.
             - Ironically, he got into a battle with S. Boxx/Detweiler
                and threated legal action. This cause a rather
                instructive debate to occur.
