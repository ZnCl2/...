   13.6.1. "How can Cypherpunks publicize crypto and PGP?"
           - articles, editorials, radio shows, talking with friends
           - The Net itself is probably the best place to publicize the
              problems with Clipper and key escrow. The Net played a
              major role--perhaps the dominant role--in generating scorn
              for Clipper. In many way the themes debated here on the Net
              have tremendous influence on media reaction, on editorials,
              on organizational reactions, and of course on the opinion
              of technical folks. News spreads quickly, zillions of
              theories are aired and debated, and consensus tends to
              emerge quickly.
           - raves, Draper
           - Libertarian Party, anarchists...
           + conferences and trade shows
             - Arsen Ray Arachelian passed out diskettes at PC Expo
   13.6.2. "What are the Stumbling Blocks to Greater Use of Encryption
            (Cultural, Legal, Ethical)?"
           + "It's too hard to use"
             - multiple protocols (just consider how hard it is to
                actually send encrypted messages between people today)
             - the need to remember a password or passphrase
           + "It's too much trouble"
             - the argument being that people will not bother to use
                passwords
             - partly because they don't think anything will happen to
                them
           + "What have you got to hide?"
             - e.g.,, imagine some comments I'd have gotten at Intel had
                I encrypted everything
             - and governments tend to view encryption as ipso facto
                proof that illegalities are being committed: drugs, money
                laundering, tax evasion
             - recall the "forfeiture" controversy
           - BTW, anonymous systems are essentially the ultimate merit
              system (in the obvious sense) and so fly in the face of the
              "hiring by the numbers" de facto quota systems now
              creeeping in to so many areas of life....there may be rules
              requiring all business dealings to keep track of the sex,
              race, and "ability group" (I'm kidding, I hope) of their
              employees and their consultants
           + Courts Are Falling Behind, Are Overcrowded, and Can't Deal
              Adequately with New Issues-Such as Encryption and Cryonics
             - which raises the issue of the "Science Court" again
             - and migration to private adjudication
             - scenario: any trials that are being decided in 1998-9
                will have to have been started in 1996 and based on
                technology and decisions of around 1994
           + Government is taking various steps to limit the use of
              encryption and secure communication
             - some attempts have failed (S.266), some have been
                shelved, and almost none have yet been tested in the
                courts
             - see the other sections...
   13.6.3. Practical Issues
           - Education
           - Proliferation
           - Bypassing Laws
   13.6.4. "How should projects and progress best be achieved?"
           - This is a tough one, one we've been grappling with for a
              couple of years now. Lots of approaches.
           - Writing code
           - Organizational
           - Lobbying
           - I have to say that there's one syndrome we can probably do
              w,the Frustrated Cyperpunks Syndrome. Manifested by someone
              flaming the list for not jumping in to join them on their
              (usually) half-baked scheme to build a digital bank, or
              write a book, or whatever. "You guys just don't care!" is
              the usual cry. Often these flamers end up leaving the list.
           - Geography may play a role, as folks in otherwise-isolated
              areas seem to get more attached to their ideas and then get
              angry when the list as a whole does not adopt them (this is
              my impression, at least).
   13.6.5. Crypto faces the complexity barrier that all technologies
            face
           - Life has gotten more complicated in some ways, simpler in
              other ways (we don't have to think about cooking, about
              shoeing the horses, about the weather, etc.). Crypto is
              currently fairly complicated, especially if multiple
              paradigms are used (encryption, signing, money, etc.).
           - As a personal note, I'm practically drowning in a.c.
              adaptors and power cords for computers, laser printers,
              VCRs, camcorders, portable stereos, laptop computers,
              guitars, etc. Everything with a rechargeable battery has to
              be charged, but not overcharged, and not allowed to run-
              down...I forgot to plug in my old Powerbook 100 for a
              couple of months, and the lead-acid batteries went out on
              me. Personally, I'm drowning in this crap.
           - I mention this only because I sense a backlash
              coming...people will say "screw it" to new technology that
              actually complicates their lives more than it simplifies
              their lives. "Crypto tweaks" who like to fool around with
              "creating a client" in order to play with digital cash will
              continue to do so, but 99% of the sought-after users won't.
              (A nation that can't--or won't--set its VCR clock will
              hardly embrace the complexities of digital cash. Unless
              things change, and use becomes as easy as using an ATM.)
   13.6.6. "How can we get more people to worry about security in
            general and encryption in particular?"
           - Fact is, most people never think about real security. Safe
              manufacturers have said that improvements in safes were
              driven by insurance rates. A direct incentive to spend more
              money to improve security (cost of better safe &lt; cost of
              higher insurance rate).
              
              Right now there is almost no economic incentive for people
              to worry about PIN security, about protecting their files,
              etc. (Banks eat the costs and pass them on...any bank which
              tried to save a few bucks in losses by requiring 10-digit
              PINs--which people would *write down* anyway!--would lose
              customers. Holograms and pictures on bank cards are
              happening because the costs have dropped enough.)
              
              Personally, my main interests is in ensuring the Feds don't
              tell me I can't have as much security as I want to buy. I
              don't share the concern quoted above that we have to find
              ways to give other people security.
           - Others disagree with my nonchalance, pointing out that
              getting lots of other people to use crypto makes it easier
              for those who already protect themselves. I agree, I just
              don't focus on missionary work.
           - For those so inclined, point out to people how vulnerable
              their files are, how the NSA can monitor the Net, and so
              on. All the usual scare stories.
