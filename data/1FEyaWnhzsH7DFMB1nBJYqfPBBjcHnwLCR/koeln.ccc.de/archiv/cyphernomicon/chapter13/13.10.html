  13.10.1. The backroom deals in Washington are flying...apparently the
            Administration got burned by the Clipper fiasco (which they
            could partly write-off as being a leftover from the Bush era)
            and is now trying to "work the issues" behind the scenes
            before unveiling new and wide-reaching programs. (Though at
            this writing, the Health Bill is looking mighty amateurish
            and seems ulikely to pass.)
  13.10.2. We are not hearing about these "deals" in a timely way. I
            first heard that a brand new, and "in the bag," deal was
            cooking when I was talking to a noted journalist. He told me
            that a new deal, cut between Congress, the telecom industry,
            and the EFF-type lobbying groups, was already a done deal and
            would be unveiled so. Sure enough, the New and Improved
            Digital Telephony II Bill appears a few weeks later and is
            said by EFF representatives to be unstoppable. [comments by
            S. McLandisht and others, comp.org.eff.talk, 1994-08]
  13.10.3. Well, excuse me for reminding everyone that this country is
            allegedly still a democracy. I know politics is done behinde
            closed doors, as I'm no naif, but deal-cutting like this
            deserves to be exposed and  derided.
  13.10.4.  I've announced that I won't be renewing my EFF membership. I
            don't expect them to fight all battles, to win all wars, but
            I sure as hell won't help *pay* for their backrooms deals
            with the telcos.
  13.10.5. This may me in trouble with my remaining friends at the EFF,
            but it's as if a lobbying groups in Germany saw the
            handwriting on the wall about the Final Solution, deemed it
            essentially unstoppable, and so sent their leaders to
            Berchtesgaden/Camp David to make sure that the death of the
            Jews was made as painless as possible. A kind of joint
            Administration/Telco/SS/IG Farben "compromise." While I don't
            equate Mitch, Jerry, Mike, Stanton, and others with Hitler's
            minions, I certainly do think the inside-the-Beltway
            dealmaking is truly disgusting.
  13.10.6. Our freedoms are being sold out.
