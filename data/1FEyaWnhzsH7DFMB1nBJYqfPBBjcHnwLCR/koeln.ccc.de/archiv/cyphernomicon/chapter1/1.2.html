         - The Cypherpunks have existed since September, 1992. In that
            time, a vast amount has been written on cryptography, key
            escrow, Clipper, the Net, the Information Superhighway, cyber
            terrorists, and crypto anarchy. We have found ourselves (or
            _placed_ ourselves) at the center of the storm.
         - This FAQ may help to fill in some gaps about what we're
            about, what motivates us, and where we're going. And maybe
            some useful knowledge on crypto, remailers, anonymity,
            digital cash, and other interesting things.
         + The Basic Issues
           + Great Divide: privacy vs. compliance with laws
             + free speech and privacy, even if means some criminals
                cannot be caught (a stand the U.S. Constitution was
                strongly in favor of, at one time)
               - a man's home is his castle...the essence of the Magna
                  Carta systems...rights of the individual to be secure
                  from random searches
             + or invasive tactics to catch criminals, regulate
                behavior, and control the population
               - the legitimate needs to enforce laws, to respond to
                  situations
             + this parallels the issue of self-protection vs.
                protection by law and police
               - as seen in the gun debate
               - crypto = guns in the sense of being an individual's
                  preemptive protection
             - past the point of no return
           - Strong crypto as building material for a new age
           + Transnationalism and Increased Degrees of Freedom
             - governments can't hope to control movements and
                communications of citizens; borders are transparent
         + Not all list members share all views
           - This is not "the Official Cypherpunks FAQ." No such thing
              can exist. This is the FAQ I wanted written. Views
              expressed are my own, with as much input from others, as
              much consensus, as I can manage. If you want a radically
              different FAQ, write it yourself.  If you don't like this
              FAQ, don't read it. And tell your friends not to read it.
              But don't bog down my mailbox, or the 500 others on the
              list, with messages about how you would have worded Section
              12.4.7.2 slightly differently, or how Section 6.9.12 does
              not fully reflect your views. For obvious reasons.
           - All FAQs are the products of a primary author, sometimes of
              a committee. For this FAQ, I am the sole author. At least
              of the version you are reading now. Future versions may
              have more input from others, though this makes me nervous
              (I favor new authors writing their own stuff, or using
              hypertext links, rather than taking my basic writing and
              attaching their name to it--it is true that I include the
              quotes of many folks here, but I do so by explicitly
              quoting them in the chunk they wrote....it will be tough
              for later authors to clearly mark what Tim May wrote
              without excessively cluttering the text. The revisionist's
              dilemma.
           - The list has a lot of radical libertarians, some anarcho-
              capitalists, and even a few socialists
           - Mostly computer-related folks, as might be expected. (There
              are some political scientists, classical scholars, etc.
              Even a few current or ex-lawyers.)
           + Do I Speak for Others?
             - As I said, no. But sometimes I make claims about what
                "most" list members believe, what "many" believe, or what
                "some" believe.
             - "Most" is my best judgment of what the majority believe,
                at least the vocal majority in Cypherpunks discussions
                (at the physical meetings, parties, etc.) and on the
                List. "Many" means fewer, and "some" fewer still. "A few"
                will mean a distinct minority. Note that this is from the
                last 18 months of activity (so don't send in
                clarifications now to try to "sway the vote").
             - In particular, some members may be quite uncomfortable
                being described as anarchists, crypto anarchists, money
                launderers, etc.
         +  My comments won't please everyone
           - on nearly every point ever presented, some have disagreed
           - feuds, battles, flames, idee fixes
           - on issues ranging from gun control to Dolphin Encrypt to
              various pet theories held dearly
           - Someone once made a mundane joke about pseudonyms being
              like multiple personality disorder--and a flame came back
              saying: "That's not funny. I am MPD and my SO is MPD.
              Please stop immediately!"
           - can't be helped....can't present all sides to all arguments
         + Focus of this FAQ is U.S.-centric, for various reasons
           - most on list are in U.S., and I am in U.S.
           - NSA and crypto community is largely centered in the U.S.,
              with some strong European activities
           - U.S. law is likely to influence overseas law
         + We are at a fork in the road,  a Great Divide
           - Surveillance vs. Freedom
           - nothing in the middle...either strong crypto and privacy is
              strongly limited, or the things I describe here will be
              done by some people....hence the "tipping factor" applies
              (point of no return, horses out of the barn)
         + I make no claim to speaking "for the group." If you're
            offended, write your own FAQ. My focus on things loosely
            called "crypto anarchy" is just that: my _focus_. This focus
            naturally percolates over into something like this FAQ, just
            as someone primarily interested in the mechanics of PGP would
            devote more space to PGP issues than I have.
           - Gary Jeffers, for example, devotes most of his "CEB" to
              issues surrounding PGP.
         + Will leave out some of the highly detailed items...
           - Clipper, LEAF, escrow, Denning, etc.
           - a myriad of encryption programs, bulk  ciphers, variants on
              PGP, etc. Some of these I've listed...others I've had to
              throw my hands over and just ignore. (Keeping track of
              zillions of versions for dozens of platforms...)
           - easy to get lost in the details, buried in the bullshit
