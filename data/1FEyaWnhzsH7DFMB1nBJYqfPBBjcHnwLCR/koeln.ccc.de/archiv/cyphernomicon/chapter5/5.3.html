    5.3.1. Why a section on crypto when so many other sources exist?
           - A good question. I'll be keeping this section brief, as
              many textbooks can afford to do a much better job here than
              I can.
           - not just for those who read number theory books with one
              hand
    5.3.2. NOTE: This section may remain disorganized, at least as
            compared to some of the later sections. Many excellent
            sources on crypto exist, including readily available FAQs
            (sci.crypt, RSADSI FAQ) and books. Schneier's books is
            especially recommended, and should be on _every_ Cypherpunk's
            bookshelf.
