   5.10.1. on the design of DES
           - Biham and Shamir showed how "differential cryptanalyis"
              could make the attack easier than brute-force search of the
              2^56 keyspace. Wiener did a thought experiment design of a
              "DES buster" machine (who ya gonna call?) that could break
              a DES key in a matter of days. (Similar to the Diffie and
              Hellman analysis of the mid-70s, updated to current
              technology.)
           + The IBM designers knew about differential cryptanalyis, it
              is now clear, and took steps to optimize DES. After Shamir
              and Biham published, Don Coppersmith acknowledged this.
              He's written a review paper:
             - Coppersmith, D.,  "The Data Encryption Standard (DES) and
                its strength against attacks."  IBM Journal of Research
                and Development.  38(3): 243-250. (May 1994)
