    5.6.1. PGP, of course
           - it's own section, needless to say
    5.6.2. "What about hardware chips for encryption?"
           - Speed can be gotten, for sure, but at the expense of
              limiting the market dramatically. Good for military uses,
              not so good for civilian uses (especially as most civilians
              don't have a need for high speeds, all other things being
              equal).
    5.6.3. Carl Ellison's "tran" and mixing various ciphers in chains
           - "tran.shar is available at ftp.std.com:/pub/cme
           -      des | tran | des | tran | des
           - to make the job of the attacker much harder, and to make
              differential cryptanalyis harder
           - "it's in response to Eli's paper that I advocated prngxor,
              as in:
                       des | prngxor | tran | des | tran | des
              with the DES instances in ECB mode (in acknowledgement of
              Eli's attack). The prngxor destroys any patterns from the
              input, which was the purpose of CBC, without using the
              feedback path which Eli exploited."[ Carl Ellison, 1994-07-
              15]
    5.6.4. The Blum-Blum-Shub RNG
           - about the strongest algorithmic RNG we know of, albeit slow
              (if they can predict the next bit of BBS, they can break
              RSA, so....
           - ripem.msu.edu:/pub/crypt/other/blum-blum-shub-strong-
              randgen.shar
    5.6.5. the Blowfish cipher
           + BLOWFISH.ZIP, written by Bruce Schneier,1994. subject of an
              article in Dr. Dobb's Journal:
             - ftp.dsi.unimi.it:/pub/security/crypt/code/schneier-
                blowfish.c.gz
