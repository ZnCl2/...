I have a bunch of books I can upload.\n\nZeroNet doesn't seem to have a good way to transfer specific files.  I've been trying to distribute http://127.0.0.1:43110/1KuwNEQXaF7SmAibxLs2wgJQJjGYTDMErc/ but so far there haven't been enough connections for anyone to know whether the site is functioning.  Reaching the minimum number of peers to share content.json is troublesome.  If it gains more peers, that site could be cloned to serve different files very simply.",

I also have [Algebraic Curves in Cryptography](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EmfJvSsZWtikUqWnHbhMQ9yV5ATUBEooc/).\n\n> Wouldn't it be better to have one digital library Zite where users can upload books as optional files?Maybe 0chan can be modified easily to be a good digital library platform on ZeroNet... \n> Even if every book will have it's own Zite cloned from this one,  I think we need a library Zite collecting the links to the Zites of the books. This case a clone of ZeroWiki could be used as the main platform for the ZeroNet library.\n\nI've been thinking about that.  A hybrid of 0list and ZeroTorrent would be nice.  I'd like some organization by categories and a place to display metadata.  [ZeroMe](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:10_1KdnTJVBGzEZrJppFZtzfG9chukuMv8xSb/ZeroMe) might have some helpful features.",
