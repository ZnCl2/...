It comes with all the tools you need pre-installed and with more on their repos.\n\nParrot Security is meant for daily use as well with pentesting tools also pre-installed along with some other tools for privacy and security. They also have plenty of tools in their repos.\n\nBackbox is similar to Parrot in the way that it is meant to be used however I like it more for it's design (although that doesn't really matter)",
