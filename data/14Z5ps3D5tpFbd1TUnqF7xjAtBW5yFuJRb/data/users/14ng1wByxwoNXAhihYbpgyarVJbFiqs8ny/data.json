I've been trying to distribute http://127.0.0.1:43110/1KuwNEQXaF7SmAibxLs2wgJQJjGYTDMErc/ but so far there haven't been enough connections for anyone to know whether the site is functioning.  Reaching the minimum number of peers to share content.json is troublesome.  If it gains more peers, that site could be cloned to serve different files very simply.\n\nUse a Virtual Machine (I'm using a Ubuntu VM but use whatever you want), put Zeronet on it and optionally enable Tor. If you can load the site in the VM you know everything is golden.",
