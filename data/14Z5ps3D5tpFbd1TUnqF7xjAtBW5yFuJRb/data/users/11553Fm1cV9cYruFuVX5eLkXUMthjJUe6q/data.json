			"body": "doing a pentest on a CTF website and trying to hack Redis. I know Im supposed to upload my SSH public key to login in as a known user, but I keep getting stuck. One well written article about it even put that certain key features were changed to keep skiddies out of blowing up real Redis boxes that were unsecured, as apparently its a real problem with people leaving there Redis services open and unsecured. Any thoughts?",
