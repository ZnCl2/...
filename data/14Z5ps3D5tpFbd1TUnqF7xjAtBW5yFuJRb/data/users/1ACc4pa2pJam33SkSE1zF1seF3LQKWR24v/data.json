Additionally, many of the settings of those distros are insecure by default, because the tools need those permissions to run (think wireshark with capturing packets, or aircrack running network / hardware processes)",

They are claiming that they are going to be using rust for the underlying implementation because it's memory safe, but the base level of the os is the standard linux kernel... Seem like another option, but I'm wondering if this isn't being done as a 'Built in France' venture vs really adding additional security.  Not an expert in this space but if I'm missing I would be interested to hear someone elses thoughts on this.",
