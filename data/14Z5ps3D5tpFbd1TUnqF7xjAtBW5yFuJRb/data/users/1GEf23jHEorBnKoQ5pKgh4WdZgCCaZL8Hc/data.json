Apparently after recieving bomb threats originating from a PIA IP, law enforcement was contacted and soon ended up speaking with PIA. PIA refused to disclose any information for the sake of the privacy and security of their users. Another story from PIA comes to mind; I recall there was an instance of the (german?) government seizing one of their datacenters, they found no identifiable information because PIA is very careful with limited logging and or no logging. They then responded by pulling out of (germany?) entirely. Heres a url for you. (Warning: Clear Net https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/ )\n\nPIA is the VPN company that exposed all info on LulzSec and was lying about not logging",
