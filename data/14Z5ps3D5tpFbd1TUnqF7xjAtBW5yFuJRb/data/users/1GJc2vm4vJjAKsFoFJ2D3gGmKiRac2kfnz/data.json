Use veracrypt.\n\nA very low-level rumor floating around the internet is that the FBI went to Truecrypt and insisited that they put in a back door.  Instead of giving into the demand, the Truecrypt developers decided to dissolve the company after Truecrypt version 7.1a.  Then Veracrypt took over from there.  There have been a couple of independent audits of Truecrypt, and the auditors  have not found any significant vulnerabilities.  So, there is no reason to believe that Truecrypt version 7.1a is insecure.",
