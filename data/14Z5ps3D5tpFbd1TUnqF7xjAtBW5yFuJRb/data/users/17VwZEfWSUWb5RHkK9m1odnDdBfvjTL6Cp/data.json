I've been trying to distribute http://127.0.0.1:43110/1KuwNEQXaF7SmAibxLs2wgJQJjGYTDMErc/ but so far there haven't been enough connections for anyone to know whether the site is functioning.  Reaching the minimum number of peers to share content.json is troublesome.  If it gains more peers, that site could be cloned to serve different files very simply.\n\nIt works perfectly here (I see 19 peers, 1 connected). \n\nWouldn't it be better to have one digital library Zite where users can upload books as [optional files](http://127.0.0.1:43110/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/?Page:optional-files)? \nMaybe [0chan](http://127.0.0.1:43110/0chan.bit/) can be modified easily to be a good digital library platform on ZeroNet... \n\nEven if every book will have it's own Zite cloned from [this one](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1KuwNEQXaF7SmAibxLs2wgJQJjGYTDMErc/),  I think we need a library Zite collecting the links to the Zites of the books. This case a clone of [ZeroWiki](http://127.0.0.1:43110/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/?Page:home) could be used as the main platform for the ZeroNet library.",
