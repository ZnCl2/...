That is strange as i do not believe this can work and accessed computer (via apache) can execute such a command unless apache and php script is set the way to run system commands like /bin/sh ? It also does not look like an exploit URL. The URL is just a domain's index (GET / )\nIt rather looks to me that the visitor faked the UserAgent and used system commands in it, but not sure for what purpose as UA is not executed right?\n\nThanks for the feedback in advance, i think it is interesting log entry",

How to discover maximum number of connections i can establish during an DoS at a time not to get banned?\nExample my server limit is 190 connections and then IP gets banned in firewall for some time. Which linux commands do you recommend to discover best connection count to establish to a remote server (which firewall configuration is unknown)? Or any estimate you can advise per port?\n\n2. Which port is usually most vulnerable and least restricted by firewall rules when it comes to a web servers? And which kind of attack is recommended to have highest impact when the attacker has only 1-3 low bandwidth servers (1-3 IPs only). Which connections frequency do you advise?\n\n3. How would you compare effectiveness of the ICMP vs TCP vs UDP kind of attack?\n\n4. Is it still effective to attack the way that you send large packets, which highest size is reasonable and what is the Linux command to discover if size is not too large for a remote server?\n\n5. Which kind/s of DoS attack/s is/are hardest to be detected/discovered cause while this attack still having substantial impact on the destination web server\n\n6. What is the best way to prepare and launch DNS reflection attack using list of open resolvers?\n\nThank you",

You can then create new zite and move these files into it if the mirror works properly. Offcourse there will no longer be any content management system, your wordpress would become a static site that you would have to edit manually by editing files directly.\nUnsure if there will be any tools in future that would allow simple migration from Wordpress into other ZeroNet compatible content management system equipped with database.",
