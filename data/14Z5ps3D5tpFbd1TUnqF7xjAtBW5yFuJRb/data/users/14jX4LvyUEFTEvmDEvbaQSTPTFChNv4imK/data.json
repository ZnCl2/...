It is difficult to make it secure if you are going to use it as your daily driver. It comes with all the tools you need pre-installed and with more on their repos.\n> Parrot Security is meant for daily use as well with pentesting tools also pre-installed along with some other tools for privacy and security. They also have plenty of tools in their repos.\n> Backbox is similar to Parrot in the way that it is meant to be used however I like it more for it's design (although that doesn't really matter)\n\nNever use a pentesting distro as your daily OS.",
