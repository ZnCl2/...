			"body": "The first question everyone asks once they have decided to try Zcash mining is “What hardware is best to mine with?” This question is not easily answered because there are many improvements in hardware and software happening on almost a weekly basis. To start, mining falls into one of two general categories\nCPU mining – using your computers Processor (CPU) to mine\nGPU mining – building a computer with one or several Graphics Cards (GPU) to mine\nAt the beginning you could effectively mine Zcash with just a CPU, but due to advancements in software GPU’s have a huge advantage over CPU’s. You can still use a CPU to mine but your return will be very low, so all of the serious miners use GPU rigs. GPU miners will often fall into one of two camps:\n\nAMD- American Micro Devices brand GPU’s\nNvidia – Nvidia Brand GPU’s\nBoth brands of GPU can be good at mining Zcash depending on the model. It will take some research to find what the Cost/Performance/Electricity consumption trade-offs are...\n\nmore at: https://www.zcashcommunity.com/mining/zcash-mining-hardware/"

The Zcash software provided by Zcash company is a complete package that will let you run a full Node, Mine with your CPU, and also has a built in Wallet for sending and receiving Zcash.\n\nImportant: You will need to already have Zcash installed before you can start using the more specialized software below! If you want a beginners step-by-step guide to installing and using the software for you can find one here and I have embedded the official install video below.\n\nThe biggest limitation of the official Zcash software is that it only takes advantage of your CPU to mine. If you have decided to build a dedicated GPU rig for mining the basic software will not be enough, you will need to decide on software that has been optimized to take advantage of your GPU’s.\n\nThis is a list of the most popular Zcash Mining software for each platform, some of this software contains a built-in developers fee. I try to keep this list up to date as I can, if there is a broken link or missing software please drop me an email.\n\n\nCPU\n\nZcash Official Software – https://github.com/zcash/zcash/wiki/1.0-User-Guide\nGateless Gate – (also works with some GPU’s) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1716584.0\nZcash-Proxy – (CPU+GPU stratum for zcashd, make a private pool) https://github.com/sammy007/zcash-proxy\n\n\nAMD GPUs\n\nOptiminer –  https://forum.z.cash/t/miner-optiminer-zcash-gpu-miner-v1-5-0/8109\nClaymore –  https://forum.z.cash/t/miner-claymores-zcash-miner/7114\nGenesis SGminer – https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1612329.0\n\n\nNvidia GPUs\n\nEWBF Cuda –  https://forum.z.cash/t/ewbfs-nvidia-cuda-zcash-miner-1060-170-h-s-gtx-1070-250-h-s/12523\nNicehash EQM – (only works with nicehash) https://forum.z.cash/t/nicehash-eqm-zcash-nvidia-optimized-miner-maxwell-pascal-win-linux-cpu-mining-v1-0-4c-400-sol-s-gtx-1070-stock/8188\nNEHQ – https://forum.z.cash/t/nheqminer-open-source-free-cuda-zec-gtx-1070-400-sol-s-miner-by-nicehash/13542"
