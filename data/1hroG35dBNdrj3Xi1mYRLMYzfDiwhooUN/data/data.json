Introduction*\nThere are sure-fire plans to kill yourself, but they don't always factor\nin the character and feelings of the person carrying them out. This is\nwhy I have put some emphasis on contemplation and reflection in the\nalt.suicide.methods Reference File that I'm compiling: I think it is\nvery important that the person him-/herself is taken into consideration,\nbecause any \"sure-fire\" plan can be disrupted by fear, uncertainty, or\njust plain self-deception.\n\nWe need to devise scenarios for the typical experiences people are\nhaving when they are suicidal, like those who?\n\n    * ?are sick and dying anyway and want an easy way out that doesn't\n      involve a lot of mobility\n    * ?are depressed and can't find the motivation to go great distances\n      (as to procure barbiturates like the ones /Final Exit/ recommended\n      such as Phenobarbital);\n    * ?are disgusted with life and want a way out that isn't too\n      painful, messy or likely to fail;\n    * ?want to die for any reason and are afraid of being discovered,\n      seen as a coward, or judged as evil by those one loves and is\n      obsessed with;\n    * ?want to go out in a blaze of glory, making a strong statement\n      against all one's enemies;\n    * ?want revenge on some society, group or person, and want to use\n      their suicide as a means of achieving this;\n    * ?want to become an enigma or a media sensation, challenging the\n      boundaries of narcissus.\n\nI think that elaborate plans could be constructed for all of these\nconditions and desires, but certain combinations may be quite difficult\nto achieve (such as one who is depressed and lacking in energy and yet\nwants to go out in a way that would take some work).\n\n*B. Making an Informed Decision*\n From: asm Ref File editor <mailto:asm.ref.editor@gmail.com>\n Date: Wed, 1 Mar 2000 13:21:59 -0800 (PST)\n\nIf you believe that you have a psychological imbalance that is causing\nyour suicidal ideations, then I recommend that you seek medical help for\nthis imbalance rather than merely reacting to it by taking an action you\nmay regret. Certainly, before the age of 23 it is often quite difficult\nto obtain a coherent perspective on the world from which to make the\nimportant decision to end one's life.\n\nWhile I may counsel people about means to terminate life and even inform\nthem of the most efficient means of achieving this, I am strongly\nopposed to preying on the weak-minded or disabled who haven't a grasp on\ntheir personal will sufficient to make an informed and mature decision\non their own. Euthanasia (good death) is not coercive, nor is it merely\nconcerned with the termination in question, providing also for the\nfeasting on our kindred and the making kindred of the feast.\n\n > I continuously want to kill myself. I have tried but have\n > never been successful. I do not know what to do?\n\nMost medical (physical and psychological) conditions have been addressed\nwith at least symptomatically-ameliorative, if not remedying, treatment\nplans that will likely contain a combination of physical, dietary, and\nmedicinal prescriptions.\n\nIf you do not feel that your needs are being met on the particular\nschedule you have been recommended, get additional opinions (consult\nwhatever authorities you think are trustworthy) and experiment with\nalternatives. Research what is known about your condition, supplement\nyour knowledge base so as to become more independent and able to make\ndecisions without the need of people whom you may not know well. The\ninternet is a valuable resource (with search engines, for example) to\naccomodate your needs in this regard. You can also seek out local\nreference librarians, as they will be of inestimable service.\n\nIt is important to evaluate the following criteria:\n\n   1\\. How capable are you of making an informed decision that will\n      affect the quality of your life?\n   2\\. How reliable is your emotional resolve?\n   3\\. Are you being /driven/ to certain actions, or are you definitely\n      /choosing/ them with careful deliberation and resolved composure?\n   4\\. How much deliberation time is reasonable for you?\n\n*C. The Elements of Suicide*\nFrom: asm Ref File editor <mailto:asm.ref.editor@gmail.com>\nSubject: Methods and Preparations\nDate: June 19, 1999\n\n > ?it's pretty easy to kill yourself, if you truly want to.\n\nTechnically, yes.\n\n > I don't see what the big deal about methods is unless you are\n > trying to make it look like an accident in order to allow\n > relatives to get insurance money or to spare them some shame or\n > guilt.\n\nThe main elements are:\n\n    * *Access*?how easy it is to obtain the conditions and/or equipment;\n    * *Efficacy*?how effectively it works;\n    * *Speed*?how quickly the method is carried out;\n    * *Painlessness*?so we don't have to suffer too much.\n\n_Access_ can be problematic for those with physical problems.\n_Effectiveness_ can be difficult to determine if we haven't yet\nseparated fact from fiction.\n_Quickness_ intensifies the ramifications of the next element.\n_Painlessness_ is important to quite a few people and is sometimes\nexpanded to include the retainment of the integrity of one's body for\nloved ones or in order to affect as few people as possible or represent\nan easier action to take?many of us are conditioned to self-preservation.\n\n > ?I am terminally ill,\n > and was at a bad spot and thinking I might have to do\n > myself in because of the pain. But I am on an upswing\n > currently, and also have better pain medication, so I am\n > (hopefully) not ready to go just yet.\n\n_Access_?doctors prescribe medication(s);\n_Efficacy_?you can request more powerful drugs because they know you're\ngoing to be dying soon anyway and don't have to worry about the\npossibility of lawsuits;\n_Painlessness_?meds suited to reduce pain may be acquired.\n_Speed_ might be a factor, as would _dosage_?\n\nThe other important area of suicide discussion is *proper preparation.*\nToo often this is neglected, when in fact things like cardboard coffins\nare available for those who want to go green or low-cost, and good plans\nare in the process of being developed for those who know they are going\nto die (tying up loose ends, et cetera).\n\n*D. The Empowerment of Accepting Death*\nWe can be caught between knowing that we want to die, taking steps to\naccomplish it, and really just wanting life to be different, trying to\nfind some way to escape or hide from it. Attempting suicide can be a way\nof shuffling the deck. No matter how much we may decry the control\nexercised over us once we've failed an attempt, we are the ones who got\nus there. It is a means of changing the life we are leading (abandoning\ncontrol, which a lot of us want to do but for which are afraid of the\nrepercussions). This is in part why some people commit crimes?to return\nto a controlled environment where they won't have to face the stress of\ndecision-making.\n\nKnowing that we can at any point terminate our lives can be a powerful\nincentive. \"Okay, now I can do anything. If the heat gets to be too\nmuch, I can push 'eject, game over,' and I don't have to worry about the\nconditions I've created for myself.\" To many this is considered \"weak,\navoidance, cheating, sinful,\" etc., but that is just a human judgment\nintent on keeping us as their pawns, playing by /their/ rules, condemned\nby /their/ bogey gods, afraid to take the Final Power into their own\nhands and projecting this onto us as some sort of cosmic sin. After all,\nif they have to suffer in this shit-hole we're making of the world, we\nshould be required to suffer it too, right? They'll say that we're a\n\"sore loser\" or a \"spoiled-sport\" (their game was ruined) if we don't\nremain inside their pitiful, finite game (cf. Carse, Watts) and submit\nto our position.\n\nThey are condemned to Hell in a life they deserve, and one's power to\nend one's own life is like a \"secret weapon.\" Remember those spy movies\nand stories? (We may pretend we're a spy.) There's always the \"cyanide\npill\" if we're captured or enter into a situation which may compromise\nour values and goals. If we condition ourselves to ingest it (something\nthat these stories /never/ talk about, but the spies have to endure it\nto break anti-suicidal conditioning)?that is, to terminate our\nlives?then we're better equipped to attain anything we want, or to die\nafter feeling that our efforts were thwarted. It is arguable that this\nis one of the strengths of certain Asian martial codes, such as\n/bushido,/ which focus so intently on the death of the participant.\n\nIf we're */really/* creative, we may rig up a type of death which serves\nto accomplish something long in our wake, as is said of Jesus and Socrates.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*II. Preparations*\n\n*A. Introduction*\nWhen one is dedicated to the task, suicide will not be difficult to\nachieve at all. The major problem is internal, not external. Some degree\nof self-analysis, preparation for death, the reaction one will not\nwitness but apparently cause, etc., is important since we are\nconditioned to regulate our behavior based on imagining the reaction\nothers will feel in response to our choices.\n\nOther than deciding on the method of self-termination, the practical\npreparation for suicide includes accepting one's demise, how it will be\neffected, and one's role in the social world prior to that event.\n\nDeciding (or leaving undecided) the metaphysical issues inherent to the\nnotion of suicide (such as how the cosmos may be structured, whether\nthere are moral authorities who have forbidden the taking of your life,\nwhat happens to people when they die, whether it matters if someone has\nkilled themselves as to the quality of any post-mortem experiences,\netc.) is an important part of accepting the idea of effecting one's own\ndeath.\n\nContemplating the likely responses to the type of suicide one has\nplanned and the future development of the society in which one lives\n(i.e. how family and friends will react to the news of your choice to\nend your life, what, if any, repercussions there may be to the message\nyour death may symbolize, etc.) is essential in the construction of a\nsatisfactory suicide method and context.\n\nDiscerning one's social role prior to suicide is immensely helpful in\nthe precise delineation of the pre-termination itinerary. Whether this\nmay include lying to one's friends and family (so as to avoid being\nbereft of autonomy and freedom in a misguided attempt to provide\n'help'), the resolution of administrative details (like arranging for\npayment of regular bills and any funerary expenses that will likely be\nincurred by your survivors, etc.), or a fierce and fiery 'Shooting Star'\ntermination in which a huge mess is left to those whom you despise or\nhave learned to disregard, knowing how to approach the world will put\nthose destined for death one step ahead of those who may wish to see\nthat a self-termination fails.\n\n*B. Contemplating Death*\nFear of pain is an important reason to hesitate when contemplating\nself-termination. We don't want to become centers of pain?we want to\nterminate the pain (often psychological) that we may be feeling. The\nsurity factor of practical methods is an important part of our\nconsideration (which is why so much detail is included in the posts\nbelow evaluating methods, probably obvious to any who have seriously\nconsidered suicide before).\n\nBut what is it about pain that we fear? To some extent this fear is\nentirely groundless and irrational. Are we sure we don't want to feel\n/any/ pain at all, even for a moment when the grenade we've placed next\nto our head goes off? Flying through the air on the way to the ground,\ndo we want to imagine the impact at high speed and the very short\nstimulus of every one of our nerves? Driving onward with our heads\nflying backwards after being lopped off by piano wire attached to the\naxle of a parked truck or the trunk of a large tree, do we want to feel\nthe \"awkwardness\" of seeing the world suddenly go topsy-turvy, feeling\nan imaginary body and wondering where \"we\" are then?\n\nThis is why experimenting with pain-play and getting over a dread fear\nof it can be valuable. We begin to understand that it is a *temporary*\nresponse to intense change (whether this be the change of decaying and\ndying as we age, or due to some possibly desired \"catastrophe\").\nEventually it stops being the obstacle it was and we can decide on\nsuicide with a clear will.\n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: \"just another onionhead <mailto:stop-picking@that.rightnow>\"\n Date: Tue, 16 Dec 1997 02:36:58 GMT\n\n?the thing that kept me from doing it was not that I wanted to live but\nthat I was just too fucking scared of dying. And it wasn't /being/ dead\nthat frightened me, it was the /dying/ part. The trip from Here to\nThere. It makes me shiver right now, thinking about that night. I'm just\na coward, basically?this makes me wish I were dead, but at the same time\nit keeps me alive. Same old stuff. :(\n\nMaybe it was the method I chose that made it so difficult for me\n(hanging can be pretty gruesome if you don't do it right), but I can see\nwhere it might be the same with a shotgun. I suppose that when your\nconscious mind is aware that you're about to hit the Full Stop button,\nit's gonna fight pretty God-damned hard to keep you from doing so. The\nactual reasons are probably different for each individual.\n\n >I have often thought that the reason people commit\n >suicide is that they care too much about what\n >other people think.\n\nActually, that's one of the things that /keeps/ me from doing it.\n\n To: Some Yahoo Group <http://groups.yahoo.com/>\n From: *asm.ref.editor@gmail.com* <mailto:asm.ref.editor@gmail.com>\n Date: 11/24/98\n\n?Most of us don't have the first inkling about what death includes, what\nit will be like, and a great number of humans hope to mystically\ncircumvent this extinction-phase of our lives (\"termination\"). So we\nbecome members of cults which dream about afterlives and pretend that\nwe're never going to die. the culture in which I live [US:CA] is\npro-youth and anti-death.\n\nI prefer to learn from works of art like /Logan's Run/ (though I don't\nlike the fact that the society there was dominated and death wasn't\noptional /prior/ to \"degeneration\") or /Zardoz/ (which, while a\nlow-budget cult film, has wonderful things to say about how fucked up\npeople can get when we try to avoid natural processes and instead try to\navoid the beauty of death and its results).\n\n To: private email list\n From: *asm.ref.editor@gmail.com* <mailto:asm.ref.editor@gmail.com>\n Date: 1998/01/31\n\n > As significant as the fact that the means are easy and\n > painless is the fact that there is no stigma or shame\n > attached to suicide, since it is accepted (generally\n > speaking, even if someone would not want to lose a\n > particular individual to suicide).\n\nThis is an important premise to get across. Yet more than this should be\nthe consideration of how death could be made */pleasurable!/* What if\ndeath could be the ultimate experience a human being could engage? Pay a\nfew thousand dollars and suddenly a whole circus of possibility opens\nup. Death during sex, at the height of euphoria; death while engaging\nall the nastiest (or alluring), most forbidden (or desired) pleasures of\nthe world.\n\nIf there is no future which may be ruined, why not engage that which\nwould otherwise harm or destroy us simultaneously? All the most exciting\nthings which we'd avoid due to their risk and deleterious future\nrepercussions would become options!\n\nRecommended by a friend: cf. the book /Cause of Death,/ which evaluates\nthe exact processes of death without /faux/ sensationalism.\n\n To: alt.suicide.methods <news:alt.suicide.methods>\n From: \"hmd1\"\n Subject: Re: How to overcome the fear of death?\n Date: Sun, 25 Jul 1999 23:45:32 GMT\n\nJoseph T. Adams wrote:\n> How does one go about overcoming, or at least\n> temporarily \"tuning out,\" the natural fear of\n> death, of the afterlife, etc.?\n\nI don't have a good answer but here are some ideas that worked for me:\n\n   1\\. Drugs, at least some of them;\n   2\\. Wait till you can't handle the pain of being alive anymore and I'm\n      sure you won't be asking yourself such questions;\n   3\\. Some music;\n   4\\. Making oneself deeply depressed.\n\nIt took me several months to push myself over the edge (i.e. to feel\nlike item 2) by using items 1, 3, and 4\\. I also isolated myself more or\nless completely from the outside world so I would have no one to think\nabout when I was to do it. At some point i started thinking in circles\nand it wasn't long before I wasn't scared anymore about death itself. I\ndidn't succeed in killing myself but at least now I'm not afraid to die\nanymore.\n\nThis won't help getting rid of the fear of the afterlife but since I\ndon't have such a problem I can't help there.\n\n*Reading* about suicide and methods can in fact make one become\nacclimatized to the rationality and realism of self-termination.

I think lovers,\nchildren, sex, and wilderness are the most common attachments that keep\npeople from ending their lives.\n\nLovers will become increasingly difficult to obtain in an era of\ncontinued compartmentalization and disease-fear.

Make sure to leave no paper trail. Don't make airline\nreservations.

Given\nthe depression which sometimes accompanies suicidal tendencies, it is\nhelpful at times to have comrades in word and deed to bolster one's\nspirit and encourage the Final Act.\n\nEnthusiasm can be an important element in a successful suicide. Apathy\nor depression can lead to oversight, error, and accidental self-betrayal\n(e.g., a particular remark might give relatives the idea you won't be\naround for future family events and they might start to grill you about\nwhy this is the case). With group incentive, not only is there an\naddition of _duty_ and _loyalty_ to the equation, in that others are\ncounting on you to help make their exit from life coincident with their\ndesires, but the pooled resources of the group can overcome the\nlimitations of any single individual (e.g., someone good with guns\nshoots everyone else properly before turning the gun on himself; someone\nwithout a lot of money can be given pharmaceuticals that all in a group\nare taking).\n\nOne of the most important detriments of a pact as compared to solitary\nsuicide is that the more people involved with it the more possible it\nwill be that someone will betray the group and inform authorities of the\npact and its details. For this reason sophisticated methods must\nsometimes be devised so as to preserve ambiguity of details and preserve\nthe integrity of those involved until the date and location of the\nsuicide party are determined and revealed.\n\n*Pacts and Physical Methods*\nPacts can assist in any method by virtue of their participatory\ncharacter. It is easier to do challenging things in a group than it is\nto do them alone. Knowing that one is not utterly alone at death can be\na comfort.\n\nWith regard to particular methods, again, those which require particular\nskill, such as a familiarity with weapons, chemicals (e.g.,\npharmaceuticals), injection devices, constructed suicide devices, or the\nlike, can be assisted by the pact in that coverage by at least one\nindividual who is a part of it makes the method possible to all.\n\nA pact can also assist in circumstances where the context must be\narranged (such as a large weight tied to the ankles) and this context\nmay be frightening for the person themself to coordinate. Arranged (and\nconsensual) killing of another may be easier to handle than\nself-termination. A single individual with the courage, for example,\ncould bind, gag, and blindfold all others present, and set a shotgun\npointed at the proper angle before each, triggered to shoot all pact\nmembers simultaneously and end their lives. Perhaps the triggering\nperson would choose to die via the Death-By-Police <#III.C.7.b.iii>\nmethod after calling 911, or be killed by the same triggering device\n(e.g. a bomb).\n\nGas and poison deaths can be facilitated by pact-making. A \"monitor\" can\nbe appointed by the group to make sure that everyone dies comfortably,\ns/he being the last to go.\n\nOne of the detriments of pact-making methods is that they are not\nfoolproof. Deception, for example, is a real possibility, from the\nscenario where a participant is actually a spy trying to thwart the\ngroup plan to the thief and murderer who wishes to kill the individuals\nso that s/he can plunder their unguarded estate.\n\nOne method to prevent against such problems is to recruit pact members\nonly from within attuned societal organizations. Groups like Heaven's\nGate, the (former) Church of Euthanasia, or the Voluntary Human\nExtinction Movement would be the most likely to be trustworthy. Having\nvalues and/or beliefs in common is a good indicator of reliability.\n\n*Other Aspects*\nIt has been suggested that a pact group might be valuable as a kind of\ntherapeutic resource. I recommend against this strongly, since as long\nas there are contrasting opinions which pertain to the subject of\nsuicide this is likely to undermine the determination of the\nparticipants in ending their lives, and the /purpose/ of the pact is to\nsee this to its desired end. For this reason, it is probably best to\nlimit pact group interaction to the preparation for, and execution of,\nthe intended group suicide.\n\n [I don't know how serious the following message's poster was?]\n\n To: alt.suicide.methods <news:alt.suicide.methods>\n From: \"Barry Norris <mailto:ebiro@dialstart.net>\"\n Subject: Murder for Suicides\n Date: Fri, 21 Jan 2000 04:17:53 -0000\n\nMy name is Barry Norris.

This method is far more interesting than that boring\nself-poisoning crap, or car-exhaust shit.\n\n*Making it Look Like an Accident*\nMaking one's self-termination look like an accident in order to preserve\ninsurance awards or maintain an image to family or others can be a\ntricky business. One's lifestyle and geographical location can\ncontribute considerably to the options which are available. Add to this\none's condition and the limits to one's ability and willingness to\ndeceive one's loved ones, and the complexities can seem insurmountable.\n\nThe most important element to foster is a proven record of intentional\nsurvival. \"Accidents\" can happen even to those who may have previously\nbeen \"merely crying out for help\" in their self-destructive or risky\nbehaviors. Do not eliminate the condition of surprise should you wish\nyour motivations to be above suspicion.\n\nResponsible and thorough suicides who want to make it look like an\naccident will study the symptoms of suicidal or depressed individuals.\nIntroductory files such as those for helping and encouraging\nself-destructive behavior can prove invaluable (an example of the latter\nmay be found here <http://www.faqs.org/faqs/suicide/yes/>, but it is by\nno means a complete study) in the identification and elimination of\nevidence to support your true motives. Familiarity with reputable\nmystery writers, and their works in prose or film (e.g., /Double\nIndemnity,/ et al), can be helpful supplementary research, as can a\nsmall foray into 'zines or more substantial publications which cater to\nthe more abstruse technical details of mysteries or true crime dramas\n(for example, check out the newsgroups rec.arts.mystery\n<news:rec.arts.mystery>, alt.crime <news:alt.crime>, alt.true.crime\n<news:alt.true.crime> or alt.true-crime <news:alt.true-crime>, to name a\nfew, and look for \"murder (of oneself) that is intended to look like an\naccident in order to avoid detection\").\n\nCertainly classic indications include a change in ordinary social\nbehaviors, giving away one's possessions, a fascination with the event\nor philosophic relevance of death or suicide, and a sudden increase in\nrisk-taking behaviors.\n\nThe technical aspects of the accident are all the more important.\nIntentionality should somehow be ruled out through sabotage or\nisolation. Sabotage should be either unable to be traced or unlikely to\nbe investigated, whereas isolation (e.g., being buried in an avalanche\nwhile skiing) should not be considered \"out-of-the'ordinary behavior\"\nfor the the person committing suicide, lest it draw unnecessary and\nunwanted attention.\n\nPre-planning is always helpful, but not always possible if the reason\nfor suicide is impending terminal illness or some incredible physical or\npsychic pain. Even quite peculiar deaths can be arranged, given a\nplanned transition to interest in sports or events that take place in\nrisky areas in which an accident is more likely.\n\nCatastrophic damage is usually a better means of self-termination than\nsome kind of overdose or poison, but certain physical conditions and\ntheir prescriptions can lend themselves to \"accidental\nover-consumption.\" The problem with this latter method is the range of\nphysical conditions which may result if the substances or dosages are\ninsufficient to do the job properly [see *below* <#LD-50MLD>]. Damage\ncan be a more reliable termination if one has the courage and\nintelligence to pull it off.\n\nA specific method valuable to consider would be a fall from a great\nheight, especially when surrounded by hunks of steel, massive\nprojectiles, and moving at high speed. If flying an airplane is a hobby,\nfor example, then diving into the side of a mountain in a storm could be\nan easy out. Many people drive automobiles, and these can easily be\naimed off of very high precipices in canyonlands and mountainous regions\ninto gorges of such impact as to render survival unimaginable.\n\nAn examination of \"accident statistics\" in a reference section of a\nlibrary would surely yield other possible options. Of less reliable?but\nlikely unsurvivable?value would be \"slipping\" and falling in front of\nsome large moving vehicle such as a truck or train, though one may wish\nto consider the drivers of such vehicles, and one's impact upon their\nlives.\n\nOther types of \"accidental\" death would be the contraction of a fatal\ndisease. Taking up the hobby of world travel (especially to backwaters\nand some of the few tropical regions) could quite possibly net the\nadventurer some virus, bacteria, or parasite that will do the job.\n\nDeveloping personal hobbies such as explosives (like making and testing\npyrotechnics, the collection of warfare equipment, such as grenades, or\nchemicals, such as nitroglycerine, or fulminate of mercury) can make\none's exit a quick and relatively painless experience, while\nsimultaneously, if fostered over the course of several years, including\na convincing cover for one's self-destructive intentions.\n\nAbove all, do /not/ leave any incriminating evidence behind.\nCommunications or documents relating to suicide, or the best methods of\nself-termination, such as this posting, are good examples of items which\nshould be purged before any sincere attempt to achieve an \"accidental\ndeath\" can begin. Think ahead and consider the aftermath of whatever\ndecision you may select in the context of a police and/or insurance\nsettlement investigation. Coming to understand the operational standards\nand legal parameters of these fields would also be of import if one\nintends to deceive their agents.\n\n Subject: \"Accidental\" Suicide\n From: asm.ref.editor <mailto:asm.ref.editor@gmail.com>\n Date: February 21, 2000\n\n > I read the article on suicide, but I didn't see anything on\n > how to make it look like an accident. Got anything on that?\n\nThe desire to end life without one's relatives or friends suspecting\nthat we'd had that in mind is probably most common amongst those whose\nfamily and acquaintances are emotionally-insecure and interdependent.\nOthers may have moral qualms about suicide and post-mortem destinies of\nthe \"soul,\" which they suppose will survive the bodily disintegration\nand, in order to \"spare them\" from this, or from feelings of guilt (\"If\nonly I'd known I could have /done/ something!\" they may say), we may\nwish to conceal many things, inclusive of the nature of our final act.\nOther reasons to try making it look like an accident include trying to\nleave insurance for one's family. The number of films on this subject\nshould supply very good ideas as a supplemental source.\n\nThe usual methods of concealment include making it look like an\naccident, and disappearance. The first method has attendant\ncomplications, since some of the suicide methods that will appear to be\nan accident could impinge upon the lives of others who may not wish to\ndie (as when someone drives head-on into an oncoming train).\n\nThe usual way to fake an accident is to look carefully at the\ninternational news and consider the ways in which people tend to die.\nThere are a great number of vehicular accidents, for example, and this\nis easy to fake but hard to be sure that it will be successful without\ncareful planning and avoidance of chance survival. Plunging from a great\nheight, or into a body of water, with the windows rolled up in an\nautomobile, is likely to be considered \"accidental.\" Smashing into\nobjects at high speeds?especially without a safety-belt?is moderately\nlikely to result in your demise; in such a case it would be best to aim\nat very dense materials like steel and stone. Compare this with\nindustrial accidents in which one falls into the wrong place \"by accident.\"\n\nRisk-taking sports tend to result in their share of casualties which\nwill be considered accidents, though survival becomes easier when one is\nparticipating in some common sport where others are likely to be present\nand may interfere by \"coming to the rescue.\" Elemental exposure and\ndisregard can be seen as an \"accident of negligence,\" such as when one\nflies during a storm, skis during a blizzard, or hikes through\nsub-freezing temperature zones (in which one might crash or freeze\nrespectively).\n\nElectrocution and poisoning are less likely to be believed as accidents,\nbut if ignorance or absent-mindedness are common perceptions of the\nindividual considering suicide, this may be an option. The problem with\nthese are that they can be prone to painful results, sometimes even\nfailure. Research into the precise voltage, grounding?or, in the case of\npoison, dosage?for body type and likely effects are important\nsupplemental homework.\n\nOne of the most important parts of making one's death appear to be an\naccident, aside from actually carrying it through to termination, is the\ncover-up of one's personal life. Text such as that in which this advice\nappears, for example, is likely to be incriminating evidence, so to\nspeak, as would any correspondence or expression indicating depression,\nfocus on death, or euthanasia. Radical changes in one's life, friends,\nor general behavior can lend reason to suspect \"foul play\" or a\n\"personal problem.\" Suicide-prevention literature typically contains\nlists of signs that one can watch so as not to evidence them in one's\nlife or leavings. Especially important as to the promotion of one's end\nas an accident is the recent initiation of lengthy projects and the\ncontinuation of one's ongoing affairs. This gives the impression that\none had intended to be around for a while.\n\n*The Possibility of Failure*\n From: asm Ref File editor <mailto:asm.ref.editor@gmail.com>\n Date: June 14, 1999 e.v.\n Subject: Suicide Closure (Preparedness, Note)\n\n >> Isn't it the case that most botched suicides are as a\n >> result of attempted overdose which fails?\n >\n > Actually, it does hold the largest percentage, but people are\n > impulsive, and a *lot* of them are actually people trying to\n > get attention; spurned lovers, that sort of thing.

Take a small glass of cold tap water; do not use\n                  mineral water, nor any kind of juice or soda water,\n                  due to the acidity of such liquids.\n               2\\.

After about five minutes?this \"waiting period\" is\n                  important, as a chemical reaction needs to take\n                  place?the KCN will be dissolved and ready to drink\n                  (because it has turned into HCN).

Once the concoction is drunk, consciousness will be\n                  lost within a minute. There will be just time to rinse\n                  out the glass (to ensure that no one else accidentally\n                  drinks from it?however, one could just as easily put a\n                  big \"Warning\" label onto the glass, or throw it into a\n                  corner or a fireplace, if one doesn't want to take the\n                  time) and lie down.

He has a whole chapter on cyanide of various\n        types and it is worthwhile reading.\n\n        No, his recommendation is directed toward those who have a\n        terminal illness (who may be in a weakened condition and who may\n        have built up a tolerance to one or more pain- killers). Without\n        the assistance of a doctor, he recommends ingestion of Seconal\n        (secobarbital) and/or Nembutal (pentobarbital) combined with a\n        plastic bag over the head to ensure suffocation while comatose.\n\n        Humphry's focus on the digestive process is admirable, and he\n        goes into some great detail about what should and should not be\n        done prior to killing oneself via this method (Ibid., p. 110+).\n\n        Of particularly great importance when engaging in the overdose\n        method (he says that alcohol increases the lethality of such\n        substances by 50% and provides a good chart in the back which\n        gives lethal doses of many pharmaceuticals) is the /prior/\n        ingestion (an hour beforehand) of Dramamine to prevent nausea\n        and vomitting of the pills. He notes also that one of the other\n        problem of oral administration is that people will sometimes go\n        to sleep prior to completing a lethal dose, and so suggests that\n        one use alcohol to wash down a number of pills, or just a few\n        while gobbling the rest very quickly in a pre-prepared pudding.\n\n        His recommendations about having a _suicide note_, _Living\n        Will_, and _Last Will and Testament_ are invaluable for those\n        serious about ending their lives with grace.\n\n Newsgroups: talk.euthanasia <news:talk.euthanasia>, alt.suicide.holiday\n<news:alt.suicide.holiday>, alt.suicide.finals\n<news:alt.suicide.finals>, alt.suicide.methods <news:alt.suicide.methods>\n Subject: Easy Suicide Methods for Those with Limited Resources (was\n\"Help\")\n From: asm.ref.editor <mailto:asm.ref.editor@gmail.com>\n Date: Mon, 28 Feb 2000 06:28:29 GMT\n\n > Can somebody suggest me a way to kill myself?\n > I am disabled, cannot walk, can lift my arms just a little,\n > and have no firearms. I am so tired.\n\nThe disabled and terminally-ill are the most prone to have serious\ndesires to end their lives, based on their quality of life for the\nremainder of their days. They are /also/ the most likely to receive help\nfrom unexpected quarters (especially the terminally ill) when attempting\nto secure reliable methods. Witness the repeated help of individuals\nlike Saint Kevorkian and his compassionate response to those who wish to\ndie with the assistance of a doctor. Today there are even opportunities\nfor the terminally ill such as state-supported physician-assistance if\none chooses to live in the proper area of the world (as of this writing,\nat least in Oregon, U.S., if not in Denmark?or was that latter Australia?).\n\nProbably the most rational methods for the terminally ill which may\napply to the disabled also have been covered by authors such as Geo\nStone and Derek Humphry <mailto:dhumphry@efn.org>. The typical\nrecommendation is some combination of prescription medicine?or relaxing\nsubstance like barbiturates?and alcohol, or suffocation. Obviously,\ndisabilities will affect one's access to this method, since overdosing\nrequires an ability to administer the substance, but if one has some\nsmall use of one's limbs then there is a good chance that this method is\navailable to the disabled as well.\n\nThe usual method of obtaining the barbiturates is to approach one's\ndoctor and ask for sleep medication. Accepting this, a return visit at a\nlater time is necessary to complain that the lower-power medicine which\nis usually prescribed for first-use is insufficient to facilitate one's\nslumbers. The second or third visit, if the doctor does not prescribe\nsome kind of barbiturate, the recommendation is that one nonchalantly\nmention that a friend said she was greatly assisted by some kind of\nbarbiturate, and that you think this may be what you need also. If the\ndoctor does not cooperate, you may need to get a referral to see another\ndoctor who will.\n\nOnce you have obtained the proper prescription, stockpile these\nsubstances until you have acquired what you can determine is a lethal\ndosage (see *below* <#LD-50MLD> or consult a more reliable source).\n\nThe sources mentioned above indicate that some type of anti-nausea\npreliminary are an important part of the overdose, as is eating very\nlightly previous to the ingestion. Another important facet of overdosing\nis timing: choosing a place and a time when one is unlikely to be found\nunconscious (like in a locked apartment's closet which one occasionally\nleaves, on a Friday) is imperative to success. If one is under\nprescription for any similar types of medication, then these should be\ndiscontinued for three or four days in advance so as to minimize the\nrisk of tolerance resistance (with terminal illness this period may be\nreduced based on one's debilitated condition).\n\nGroups like the Hemlock Society <http://www.hemlock.org/> do not trust\nthe overdose method completely, and with good reason: quantities of\nsubstances as compared to personal resistance, due to body type,\ngenetics, and overall bodily health, make ingestion of prescription\nmedicines a variable which can have unforeseen consequences\n(particularly failure, and winding up in worse circumstances than one\nalready faces). Pharmaceuticals provide information that is at times\nconfusing to the /intentionally suicidal,/ and this can lead to a\nbotched job where it had seemed a sure thing.\n\nFor this reason, the Hemlock Society <http://www.hemlock.org/>\nrecommends to its (terminally-ill) audience the *addition* of a plastic\nbag to place over the head in conjunction with the overdose. In his\nbook, Derek Humphry <mailto:dhumphry@efn.org>, the founder of the\nHemlock Society <http://www.hemlock.org/>, describes using a rubber band\nwith the bag, like a kind of headband or necklace, placing the bag and\nband together in one smooth motion. Since this book was published the\nHemlock Society <http://www.hemlock.org/> has begun recommending that\nthe bag be loosely fitted over the head with a light-but-effective\nweight, such as a pillow, over the flap of the bag on the chest.

Choosing a Method or Combination of Methods*\n\n To: suicidemethods Yahoogroup\n<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/suicidemethods/>\n From: asm Ref File editor <mailto:asm.ref.editor@gmail.com>\n Subject: Duration and Quality of Suicide (was \"Death, Not Pain\")\n Date: Thu, 13 May 1999 10:56:45 -0700 (PDT)\n\n > What's the least painful way to commit suicide?\n\nThere are two factors of importance in considering the experience of the\nsuicide (ignoring collateral considerations like how the suicide will\naffect others): first, the *_duration_* before death (whether we would\nwish it extended or shortened; conventionally considered \"short\" and\n\"long\"), and the *_quality_* of the subjective experience over the\n*course* of that duration (often painful, pleasurable, or of a neutral\nquality).\n\nThe question of \"the least painful way to intentionally end one's life\"\nonly takes into consideration the qualitative element of this\nexperience. It is *affected* by the duration if disintegration/death\noccurs prior to the experience of pain (achieving a \"neutral\" quality at\nbest).\n\nTherefore my response falls into two categorical types of intentional\ndeath: _concussion_ and _intoxication_. _Concussion_ involves the\nincapacitation of nervous system receptors prior to their activation (as\nin being at the detonation point of a large bomb). _Intoxication_\nincludes the administration of gaseous or liquid substances such that\npain is ameliorated by virtue of unconsciousness or absent by virtue of\nlife-threatening developments which do not impact the nervous system.\n\nIn considering intentionally ending one's life I will focus on means of\nsuicide that /should/ be commonly available to the individual citizen in\nan enlightened culture (projectile weapons, certain intoxicants), and I\nmay omit possibilities available to the privileged and/or technically\nadept (e.g. nuclear weaponry).\n\n*Concussion*\n    The easiest method of quickly incapacitating the nervous system is\n    through a debilitating impact to the brain stem. This can be\n    administered with a projectile weapon of sufficient caliber (such as\n    a shotgun) aimed at the proper angle so as to disintegrate the head\n    and end life immediately. It does require that one overcome one's\n    own feelings of self-preservation or fear of self-inflicted pain in\n    order to aim and correctly fire the weapon. Adequately preparing for\n    recoil can also be important. \n\n*Intoxication*\n    A self-administered dosage (by a \"Mercitron-like\" mechanism) of the\n    substance used in killing unwanted pets, unwanted or damaged work\n    animals, or those humans who have either been sentenced to die as a\n    punishment for their heinous behavior (murder, torture, etc.) or who\n    have requested assistance in dying (e.g. like those who have\n    terminal illnesses and have sought succor in the assistance of\n    Doctor Death, A.K.A. Saint Kevorkian) is a very valuable way to\n    avoid pain at the time of death.\n\n    If more attention is paid to the *quality* of the duration, rather\n    than merely avoidance of pain, then there may be more pleasant ways\n    of terminating one's life.\n\n    These include the self-administration of substances like nitrous\n    oxide (which displaces oxygen and produces euphoria), or some more\n    common recreational substance such as heroin, which, in sufficient\n    quantity and composition, can cause a depressive reaction that will\n    kill while including the euphoria that recreational users desire.\n\n    The best methods I've seen described so far are somewhat messy. Yet\n    they /can/ be taken to remote locations (e.g., shotgun to the brain\n    stem in the wilderness) and even protected with \"Suicide Scene\n    Ahead, Beware\" signs for the truly insufferable empath. The\n    drive-yourself-hanging (probably resulting in a decapitation and an\n    auto crash) seems pretty easy, physically, to arrange, and might\n    lead to some interesting sensations.\n\n    The classic desire is for a chemical that will \"put one to sleep\"\n    (which is what we do to pets when they become inconvenient). I'm\n    unaware of any substance legally obtained which will achieve this.\n    Barbiturates (as are suggested by authors like Derek Humphry\n    <mailto:dhumphry@efn.org>) work in combination with a bag if done\n    right, but even these may have problems, as the Hemlock Society\n    <http://www.hemlock.org/> has made clear by its postscript\n    advocation of pillows on the front flaps of the bags.\n\n    Guns and falls appear to be the most certain violent means. Get a\n    shotgun and aim at the brain stem?even with a botched attempt, if\n    you're far enough from civilized assistance you'll die from blood\n    loss. Get atop a communications tower (higher than most buildings\n    and far from pedestrians) and jump, and you're unlikely to survive\n    it, especially if you rig piano wire to lop off your head at the\n    outset. \n\n*Ideals*\n    There are more risky and potentially pleasant means of ending one's\n    life that could also require study and a careful preparation, if not\n    participation, from others whose specialty is desirable.\n\n    Many find the ecstasy of orgasm is attractive as a last experience\n    in their life. This could be combined with a pill or injection of\n    some kind to be self-administered at a pre-determined moment so as\n    to bring about cardiac arrest or collapse into unconsciousness at\n    the end of an erotic fantasy funeral culminating in rapture and death.\n\n    It is this latter kind of intentional suicide (by whatever standards\n    of the individual)?the kind which is exceedingly pleasing and\n    enjoyable to the person who has chosen to die?rather than one which\n    merely minimizes pain, that I am most interested in making possible.\n\n*Ratings Format Idea*\n[to be integrated into each suggestion below and rated] Method \twhat the\nmethod is called\nAvailability/Access \thow easy said method is to achieve\nExperience/Symptoms \thow said method will feel\n(ability to induce loss of consciousness and death without causing pain,\ndistress, anxiety, or apprehension)\nDurations \thow long it will take to die by said method\n(time required to induce unconsciousness)\nEfficacy \thow sure one can be that said method will work\nCollateral Damage \tother damage that might be done\nDosage/Equipment \titems that are needed\nSkills/Expertise \thow to efficiently carry out said method\nMyths/Inaccuracies \tfalse information about said method\n\n*A. Ingestion/Injection/Inhalation*\nSuicides through ingestion, injection, and inhalation all depend on\nsimilar factors as regards efficiency:\n\n*Person Effecting the Method*\n    Body weight, age, physical condition, and skill in assessment of the\n    necessary dosage *(see \"LD-50/MLD\" below)* <#III.A.2.a>?or substance\n    to achieve the desired result?can vary tremendously. Heavier people\n    may require greater quantities of lethal substances to bring them\n    down. The elderly may be more prone to the snuff than the young and\n    vibrant body. Ignorant and/or clumsy individuals may administer the\n    wrong dosage, use the wrong delivery equipment or substance, and may\n    generally botch the job. The sickly and terminally ill or\n    immunologically-challenged may be more amenable to depressive and/or\n    toxic termination. \n\n*Method of Delivery*\n    Pills are one of the more simple methods available, though they are\n    tightly controlled in some countries by government agencies. Raw\n    herbs or roots may be readily available, though many of these will\n    not bring the type of painless suicide so many seek out. Chemical\n    injections can be quite effective, though again as with pills the\n    chemicals may have to be manufactured oneself or procured through a\n    black market source, and some degree of familiarity with needles and\n    the cardiovascular system is an asset in this type of delivery.\n    Possible sources of assistance where injections are concerned would\n    be organizations or services which assist diabetics or homecare\n    nursing. Inhalants which displace breathable oxygen have qualities\n    such as pressure and temperature which cannot be overlooked, nor can\n    their availability and quality. \n\n*Agent of Demise*\n    Besides knowing /what/ substance one is dealing with, or the proper\n    dosage, an entire range of opportunity for error is raised when\n    considering the probable effects, whether they will lead to death,\n    and in what manner of experience. Substances well-known for suicide\n    such as alcohol, or pills (such as valium), in /conjunction/ with\n    alcohol, are manufactured in varying strengths, often provided with\n    numbers to indicate this strength. Pills are often prescribed by\n    doctors who may not even know the actual lethal dosage, even in\n    combination with other ingestables. Sometimes the dangers are\n    _exaggerated_ intentionally so as to make fewer suicide attempts\n    actually result in success. Digestion can become disrupted by some\n    substances and combinations, so that vomiting may prevent the\n    demise, or may become the primary cause of death (choking on vomit\n    incapable of being expelled due to a depression of bodily systems).\n    Substances introduced can lead to serious debilitation without\n    death, and the pain of some substances, even while leading to death,\n    can become an inhibiting factor. \n\n*Suicide Disruption*\n    Because some of these methods are time-dependent and may take awhile\n    to come to fruition, there is also the chance of interruption by\n    well-meaning but intrusive individuals who call in authorities who\n    take life-saving actions, discontinue the administration of the\n    agent in question, or otherwise end the termination process without\n    the permission of the person who had intended suicide. Choosing a\n    place and time conducive to privacy and uninterrupted suicide\n    becomes integral to success, as does proper preparation in the face\n    of equipment failure, the loss of potency of agents, and other\n    unforeseen complications. \n\n*A. Poisons*\n\n*a. Antifreeze*\nIngestion of antifreeze has been discussed in alt.suicide.methods\n<news:alt.suicide.methods>. Based on the following (from\nhttp://embbs.com/cr/alc/alc7.html, it appears that death by this method\ncould be very unpleasant.\n\n    *Ethylene Glycol*\n\n    *General*\n        Ethylene glycol is a clear, colorless, odorless, viscous liquid\n        with a sweet taste, that can produce dramatic toxicity. It is\n        commonly found in homes and industry. It is found most commonly\n        in antifreeze, automotive cooling systems, and hydraulic brake\n        fluids. In an industrial setting it is used as a solvent or as\n        the raw material for a variety of processes. Many cases of\n        ethylene glycol poisoning results from accidental ingestion by\n        children who can take in large amounts since the substance\n        tastes good. Alcoholics may also ingest this substance as an\n        ethanol substitute. \n\n    *Pharmacology*\n        Ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed once it is ingested and is\n        then widely distributed into body tissues. Peak blood levels are\n        generally seen in one to four hours. Exposure to the skin and\n        lungs may cause irritation but does not cause the systemic\n        toxicity in the way that methanol does. Lethal quantities in\n        adults are considered to be 100 ml, but in children much less\n        may cause serious cardiac, renal, and CNS toxicity.\n\n        Ethylene glycol itself is relatively nontoxic. After absorption\n        the unchanged compound undergoes glomerular filtration and\n        passive reabsorption. It is then broken down into metabolites\n        that are highly toxic and cause the associated findings of\n        ethylene glycol toxicity. Ethylene glycol is converted to\n        glycoaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. This is the rate\n        limiting step of a reaction in the liver that continues to\n        breakdown the glycoaldehyde into glycolate, glyoxylate, and\n        oxylate?\n\n        These metabolites inhibit oxidative phosphorylation,\n        sulfhydrl-containing enzymes, and protein synthesis. Glycolic\n        acid is the major cause of the metabolic acidosis that is seen\n        in ethylene glycol toxicity, although glyoxylic acid also may\n        contribute. Toxicity from ethylene glycol is produced from the\n        above metabolites and the fact that they cause a severe\n        acidosis, as well as from the fact that oxalate precipitates\n        with calcium to produce widespread tissue injury in the kidney,\n        brain, liver, blood vessels, and pericardium. Hypocalcemia may\n        also result.\n\n    *Clinical Presentation*\n        The clinical presentation of ethylene glycol toxicity is\n        generally divided into three fairly well-defined phases:\n\n           1\\. *CNS Depression Phase*\n              The first phase occurs within 30 minutes to 12 hours. At\n              this phase, the patient may appear intoxicated with\n              nausea, vomiting, ataxia, absent reflexes, nystagmus, and\n              myoclonic jerks but has no smell of alcohol. Coma and\n              seizures (focal or generalized) may occur or there may be\n              tetany if hypocalcemia is present. CNS depression may be\n              from the ethylene glycol itself or from the metabolites.\n              Abdominal pain, myalgias, and hematemesis may be present.\n              Dilated pupils with loss of the light reflexes,\n              papilledema, and blurred optic discs have been reported\n              with ethylene glycol intoxication, but are much more\n              common in methanol poisoning.\n           2\\. *Cardiopulmonary Toxicity Phase*\n              This phase usually begins at 12-72 hours after ingestion.\n              At this point mild hypertension, tachycardia, and\n              tachypnea may be seen. If toxicity is severe this may\n              progress to congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and\n              pneumonitis. This phase is thought to be the result of\n              calcium oxylate crystals within the vascular tree, lung\n              parenchyma, and the myocardium.\n           3\\. *Renal Toxicity Phase*\n              This phase occurs 24-72 hours after ingestion and consists\n              of flank and abdominal pain with evidence of acute tubular\n              necrosis that is manifest as oliguric renal failure.\n\n        While some patients may clearly manifest these classic phases of\n        poisoning many people will not have such clear progression. Some\n        patients will develop mild hypothermia with bradycardia and\n        hypertension. Coma with cerebral edema, renal failure, and\n        pancytopenia have also been described. In cases of ethylene\n        glycol from child abuse the presenting signs were unexplained\n        recurrent metabolic acidosis with severe vomiting. This\n        diagnosis should be considered in children with a metabolic\n        acidosis.\n\n        ? \n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: bill lippencott@omserver2.cv.hp.com (bill)\n Date: 30 Sep 1997 06:01:02 GMT\n\nIn article 19970930045700.AAA23984@ladder01.news.aol.com\n<news:19970930045700.AAA23984@ladder01.news.aol.com>, TWright603\n<mailto:twright603@aol.com> says:\n >/60 Minutes/ ran a story about antifreeze being mixed in\n >with some children's cough medicine, and killing them.

Stir 1g (or 1.5g, at most) of potassium cyanide (KCN) into the\n          water; using more than recommended will likely cause burning\n          of the throat due to the acidity.\n       3\\. After about five minutes?this \"waiting period\" is important,\n          as a chemical reaction needs to take place?the KCN will be\n          dissolved and ready to drink (because it has turned into HCN).\n          It remains drinkable for a period of several hours, but not\n          much more than that.\n       4\\. Once the concoction is drunk, consciousness will be lost\n          within a minute. There will be just time to rinse out the\n          glass (to ensure that no one else accidentally drinks from\n          it?however, one could just as easily put a big \"Warning\" label\n          onto the glass, or throw it into a corner or a fireplace, if\n          one doesn't want to take the time) and lie down. But beware?a\n          person extremely weakened by illness might lose consciousness\n          within twenty seconds.\n       5\\. While in the coma, death will follow in fifteen to forty-five\n          minutes, depending on the physical strength of the person and\n          whether the stomach is full or empty (an empty stomach\n          promotes faster death).\n       6\\. During the coma period, the dying person will breathe heavily\n          or snore, similarly to people who have taken a lethal dose of\n          barbiturates.\n\n    [Hans] Atrott notes that with a person who is seriously terminally\n    ill, death is so peaceful that often doctors do not detect suicide,\n    and sign the death certificate as being from natural causes.\n\n?/Final Exit,/ by Derek Humphry <mailto:dhumphry@efn.org>, The Hemlock\nSociety <http://www.hemlock.org/>, 1991, pp. 44-5.\n\nThis is also the German Society for Humane Dying's recommended suicide\nmethod, as related by Derek Humphry <mailto:dhumphry@efn.org>. If anyone\nelse has information we can add to it, please let me know as a followup\nto this post.\n\nHowever, this is not the method which Humphry finally recommends,\nbecause he is concerned that cyanide might not be fast and painless\nenough, having heard a multitude of stories about its effects. He has a\nwhole chapter on cyanide of various types and it is worthwhile reading.\n\nNo, his recommendation is directed toward those who have a terminal\nillness (who may be in a weakened condition and who may have built up a\ntolerance to one or more pain- killers). Without the assistance of a\ndoctor, he recommends ingestion of Seconal (secobarbital) and/or\nNembutal (pentobarbital) combined with a plastic bag over the head to\nensure suffocation while comatose.\n\nHumphry's focus on the digestive process is admirable, and he goes into\nsome great detail about what should and should not be done prior to\nkilling oneself via this method (Ibid., p. 110+).\n\nOf particularly great importance when engaging in the overdose method\n(he says that alcohol increases the lethality of such substances by 50%\nand provides a good chart in the back which gives lethal doses of many\npharmaceuticals) is the /prior/ ingestion (an hour beforehand) of\nDramamine to prevent nausea and vomitting of the pills. He notes also\nthat one of the other problem of oral administration is that people will\nsometimes go to sleep prior to completing a lethal dose, and so suggests\nthat one use alcohol to wash down a number of pills, or just a few while\ngobbling the rest very quickly in a pre-prepared pudding.\n\nHis recommendations about having a _suicide note_, _Living Will_, and\n_Last Will and Testament_ are invaluable for those serious about ending\ntheir lives with grace.\n\n From: anonymous\n\nI've mentioned before that the cyanide constituent in kernels of\nalmonds, peaches, apples, cherries, and apricots is not free\nhydrogen-cyanide, which is a gas; rather, the compound is amygdalin. It\nis cyanide bound safely to benzaldehyde and glued shut with a couple of\nsugars. (For a picture, look in the Merck Index, or visit\nhttp://www.gov.sg/moh/mohiss/poison/pgamygdl.html.)\n\nAs long as the molecule remains intact, it is harmless. Strong acid\nshould decompose the compound to release free HCN, but I was wondering\nwhether stomach acid is strong enough. Turns out, it isn't. The neat\nthing about these plant seeds is that the compound is packaged within\nthem separately from three enzymes that rapidly decompose amygdalin. So\nwhen the seed is thoroughly crushed under moist conditions, that is when\nHCN is released?an effective defense against insect predators. A\nbiologist is studying how the enzymes are manufactured separately from\namygdalin and compartmentalized into different tissues within black\ncherries?\n\nHumans have bacteria in our gut that manufacture beta-glucosidase, and\nto a degree this enzyme can act to release HCN as well, but there are\nother enzymes and processes that can act to transform HCN to the\nharmless thiocyanate nearly as fast.\n\nAmygdalin was given as a quack, heavily-promoted cancer treatment in the\nseventies. It was variously known as Laetrile, and even passed off as\nVitamin B17, which ostensibly was a nutrient that would prevent one from\ngetting cancer. Now, this was purified amygdalin, without the enzymes\nthat would cause it to spontaneously break down, so people could ingest\ngram amounts daily without tremendous side-effects. (The theory was that\ncancer cells would possess more b-glucosidase than normal cells, so\ncyanide would selectively kill them over normal cells; but these ideas\nabout the disparity or even presence of these enzymes was shown to be\nsimply not true. And there were rigorous, double-blind studies that\ndemonstrated no benefit to laetrile in the treatment of cancer.)\n\nLethal or near-lethal cyanide poisoning using laetrile would usually\ninvolve ingestion of gram amounts of the purified 'drug' along with a\nsource of the hydrolyzing enzymes. In one case, a man ate a lot of\nbitter almonds one day. In another, a woman ate freshly crushed apricot\npits with her laetrile pills.\n\nMost of the poisonings (except in children) were nonlethal, and\nside-effects were severe and damage occasionally permament. Laetrile is\nstill available in Mexico, and in fact I found a place on the web where\none could apparently order some, but they have a screening process of\nsorts and depending on your location may not be able to deliver.\n\nanonymous wrote:\n > but then if what you say is true, if we crush the seeds\n > and eat them, the enzymes within the seeds themselves\n > should activate to release the cyanic acid group.\n\nYep. In fact, if you eat the seeds, you will be releasing some HCN. I\nlike eating apple seeds because the benzaldehyde that is released along\nwith the HCN has a pleasing almondy taste. ([name omitted] suggested it\nis rather like Dr. Pepper, and I think that's so.)\n\nAnyway, you'd want the seeds to be thoroughly crushed _and moist_, and\nwould want to ingest them immediately. (Alternatively, you could find\nsome way to harvest the gas.)\n\nThe issue here is _quantity_. How much would you have to cram into your\nstomach to get several grams of amygdalin? And it's possible, too, that\nthe enzymes won't work as well once they're in the mildly acidic\nenvironment of the stomach. About that I'm not sure. But if it simply\nslowed=down hydrolysis, the poisoning would be time-released:\nexcruciating, prolonged, and not necessarily effective.\n\nSo yes, certainly a /possible/ method. But it would not be my choice,\nthough; I wouldn't even consider it.\n\nanonymous wrote:\n > Anyway, you'd want the seeds to be thoroughly crushed *and\n > moist,* and would want to ingest them immediately. (Alternatively,\nyou could find some\n > way to harvest the gas.)\n\nOn that point, I imagine a contraption: an industrial-sized, airtight\ncrushing device, where peach pits are compressed and mixed in a small\namount of water, and maybe heated somewhat above room temperature. This\nis connected to tubing that bubbles through a solution of potassium\nhydroxide. When the pH of the solution becomes neutral, there are the\nsame number of molecules KCN as there were KOH.\n\n To: talk.euthanasia <news:talk.euthanasia>, alt.suicide.holiday\n<news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: *asm.ref.editor@gmail.com* <mailto:asm.ref.editor@gmail.com>\n Date: 13 Sep 1997 13:25:40 -0700\n\nI was reading /The Big Book of Death/ this morning (which I recommend),\nfrom Factoid Books, 1995, and in the chapter on Capital Punishment\n(\"Capital Punishment, It's a Gas\") a comic panel read:\n\n    Deadly gas is released when cyanide pellets are dropped into shallow\n    pans of sulfuric acid mixed with water. \n\n?and it goes on to describe the symptoms of cyanide poisoning as\nincluding gasping, wheezing, thrashing, screaming, crying, one's face\nturning purple, tongues sticking out, drooling, and that this does /not/\nhappen \"particularly fast.\"\n\nAll in all, I'd suggest it may not be a very effective method of suicide\n(in the sense of \"painless,\" at least).

My response to Kryptonite7:\n\n Potassium chloride (KCl) is very similar to\n sodium chloride (NaCl) or common table salt.\n KCl looks, smells and tastes like table\n salt and is, in fact, used as a salt substitute.\n\nIf you've ever gotten salt in a skin wound (a\n cut or scrape) you know it stings like crazy.\n You exposed your vein (in effect, an open\n wound) to a /lot/ of salt.\n\n As to lethal doses, well, 117mg/kg can,\n without question, be a lethal dose. But, under\n proper circumstances, as little as 18 mg/kg\n can be instantly lethal to a 75 kg (165 lb.) adult.\n The key is getting it into the bloodstream\n through a large vein (for instance, the one in\n your neck, chest or groin) very rapidly, without\n destroying that vein (the one in your arm\n just isn't big enough). This is something\n most people are not equipped to do at home.\n\n The injection of potassium chloride, while it may\n sound inviting (clean, quick), is just /not/\n a very good method for unassisted suicide.\n\n From: anonymous\n Subject: Re: Experience Regarding Suicide Attempts\n\nClomipramine/Potassium Chloride (KCl) overdose This would have certainly\nsucceeded, had I not been found ten hours after the overdose.\n\nI took 60 tablets of clomipramine 75mg each (a classic tricyclic\nantidepressant) and 50 tablets of Slow-K 600mg (potassium chloride). By\nthe time they found me I was comatose hypothermic, in cardiac arrest but\nunfortunately they revived me. If you try this in an environment where\nyou won't be found, it is a very pleasant way to go. The reason I had\nKCl was because I am bulemic and because of all the vomiting your blood\npotassium level will decrease. If you are not blessed with this eating\ndisorder there is another way to get your potassium down. Start taking\nlaxatives. You need to do this for a while and in the beginning it may\nbe somewhat uncomfortable. Then go see your doctor and ask for a blood\ncheck up. If your K levels are below 3.2 he will prescribe potassium\nsupplements. But you probably need the Clomipramine to go with it, so\nyou should try acting depressed also. Since the docs know I overdosed on\nit they no longer give me harmful antidepressants, and thus it is no\nlonger an option for me. My next try will be a heroin overdose.\nHopefully I won't be able to tell you about it.\n\n*2\\.

There is a post from 1996 [*below*\n<#LD-50MLD>] that you have with a so-called \"minimum lethal dose;\" first\nof all, people are seizing on this MLD as an accurate dose to use when\nit's likely a dose that killed someone who either was already chemically\ncompromised in some way, or else was allergic; secondly, of course,\npeople waking up on gurneys just isn't what I think ASM is aimed at. =>\n\nThe focus in alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday> is on trying\nto figure out the dosage that is likely to kill just about /anyone./ The\nLD-50 is what is believed will kill 50% of people who take it (it's only\ntested on rats or mice, usually).\n\nSo, if the focus of this group was poison control, we'd probably refer\nto the LD-50 as a \"deadly dose,\" because, to be on the safe side from\nthe poison control point of view, someone who had taken the LD-50 should\nbe brought to the emergency room *immediately.*\n\nBut, the focus *here* is on being /sure/ of dying, and 50% is damn low\nodds considering the cost of failure. Thus, dosages quoted here are\noften several times the LD-50 (as toxicity often does not follow a\nstraight line for that last 20% or so). Remember, these are dosages for\npeople to die with, not the maximum \"safe\" dose to self-medicate with.\n\nWhen I post LD-50 information, I add the following:\n\n    P.S.: \"LD-50\" means the amount of drug it took to kill 50% of the\n    subject group, usually mice or rats. Doubling the dosage does not\n    necessarily make it 100%. mg/kg means that for each kg that you\n    weigh (Americans: 1 kg = 2.2 lb) you need that dose in mg; for\n    example if it were 2mg/kg and you weighed 70kg you'd need 140 mg for\n    the LD-50\\. Note too that doubling that amount does not ensure death.\n    People vary. People take six times the lethal dose of something and\n    manage somehow to survive because bodies differ.\n\n    Although LD-50 is the best measure available, it does not\n    necessarily equate exactly to humans. Unfortunately, human data is\n    not available because the FDA won't let drug companies take a pool\n    of 1200 or so humans and feed them a drug until 600 are dead.\n\nIn the other direction of focus, however, LD-50 is a damn risky dose to\ntake if you're /not/ trying to die?\n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: jbentley\n Date: 29 JAN 1996 05:52:27 -0500\n\nI grabbed this out of a book called /The Prediction of Suicide,/ by some\nlame psychiatrists, but I thought this list was informative?\n\n*Toxicity Chart: 30 Toxic Drugs Frequently Used in Suicide Attempts*\n*Key:* 1000 milligrams (mg.) = 15 grains (gr.) = 1 gram (gm.)\n*MLD* = Minimum Lethal Dose -- *IMPORTANT* see *qualifications of \"MLD\"\nabove* <#III.A.2.a>\n*Notes:*\n\n   1\\.

Absorption is fast, and, as you\npoint out, vomiting is not an effective recourse. Be careful in\nexperimentation: start with something like one-sixth of what you would\ntake via mouth, and try another dose only in a seperate session after\nfully recovering from a previous dose (at least twelve hours). Same for\nother drugs administered rectally that would normally be taken orally,\nsuch as caffeine, etc.\n\nI gather that the short-term lethal effect of alcohol overdose is caused\nby oxygen deprivation as the body overworks trying to oxidize the\nalcohol. Likely to be quite uncomfortable, even given the slight\nanæsthetic effect. Also, hard alcohol would create an agonizing burning\nsensation in the lower intestine, which, along with the cramping, would\nobviously make one quite miserable while waiting for the effects.

Carbon Monoxide (CO) Inhalation*\n\nFrom http://www.csia.org/home/cohazard.htm:\n\n    *What is Carbon Monoxide?*\n        ?carbon monoxide is a very dangerous, colorless, odorless gas? \n    *What Carbon Monoxide Does to You*\n        Too much carbon monoxide in your blood will kill you. ?Low-level\n        exposure to this gas also endangers your health. \n        ?Given a choice between carbon monoxide and oxygen, the protein\n        hemoglobin in our blood will always latch on to carbon monoxide\n        and ignore the life-giving oxygen. Because of this natural\n        chemical affinity, our bodies?in effect?replace oxygen with\n        carbon monoxide in our bloodstream, causing greater or lesser\n        levels of cell suffocation depending on the intensity and\n        duration of exposure. \n        The side-effects that can result from this low-level exposure\n        include permanent organ and brain damage. Infants and the\n        elderly are more susceptible than healthy adults, as are those\n        with anemia or heart disease. \n\nFrom http://netvet.wustl.edu/org/awic/bib/avmaeuth.htm:\n\n    *Carbon Monoxide*\n\n    Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that is\n    nonflammable and nonexplosive until concentrations exceed 10%. It\n    combines with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin and blocks the\n    uptake of oxygen by erythrocytes, leading to fatal hypoxemia.\n\n    In people, the most common symptoms of early CO toxicosis are\n    headache, dizziness, and weakness. As concentrations of\n    carboxyhemoglobin increase, these signs may be followed by decreased\n    visual acuity, tinnitus, nausea, progressive depression, confusion,\n    and collapse. Because CO stimulates motor centers in the brain,\n    unconsciousness may be accompanied by convulsions and muscular spasms.\n\n    Carbon monoxide is a cumulative poison. Distinct signs of CO\n    toxicosis are not evident until the concentration is 0.05% in air,\n    and acute signs do not develop until the concentration is\n    approximately 0.2%. In human beings, exposure to 0.32% CO and 0.45%\n    CO for one hour will induce unconsciousness and death, respectively?\n\n    In the past, mass euthanasia has been accomplished by using three\n    methods for generating CO: (1) chemical interaction of sodium\n    formate and sulfuric acid; (2) exhaust fumes from idling gasoline\n    internal combustion engines; and (3) commercially compressed CO in\n    cylinders. The first two techniques are associated with a number of\n    problems, such as production of other gases, inadequate\n    concentrations of carbon monoxide achieved, inadequate cooling of\n    the gas, and maintenance of the equipment; therefore, the only\n    recommended source is compressed CO in cylinders.\n\n    Carbon monoxide induces unconsciousness without pain and with\n    minimal discernible discomfort. Hypoxemia induced by CO is\n    insidious, so that the animal appears to be unaware. (3) Death\n    occurs rapidly if concentrations of 4-6% are used.\n\n    Any electrical equipment exposed to CO (eg, lights and fans) must be\n    explosion proof.\n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: David Richards <mailto:dr@ripco.com>\n Date: 6 Jul 1997 08:36:38 GMT\n\n >  Hi, on the night of July 3rd, I attempted to kill\n > myself by carbon monoxide poisoning.

Adding formic acid to hot, concentrated sulfuric acid.\n   2\\. Heating a mixture of calcium carbonate and zinc.\n\n*Method 1*\n    The sulfuric acid removes H_2 O from the formic acid, leaving CO-gas. \n\n        HCOOH -> H_2 O + CO \n\n    To create one mole of CO-gas, you need 46g of formic acid (assuming\n    complete reaction) and at least 100g of concentrated sulfuric acid.\n    As the sulfuric acid is dilluted by the water created by the\n    reaction, you need more than 100g of sulfuric acid, so the reaction\n    doesn't stop. The formic acid and sulfuric acid should be\n    concentrated to speed up the reaction. \n*Method 2*\n    The calcium carbonate reacts with the zinc, giving calcium oxide,\n    zinc oxide, and CO gas. \n\n        CaCO3 + Zn -> CaO + ZnO + CO \n\n    To create one mole of CO-gas, you need 100g CaCO3 and 65.3g Zn\n    (assuming complete reaction). The zinc and calcium carbonate should\n    be finely powdered and well-mixed to speed up the reaction. \n    One mole of gas fills up 22.4 cubic decimeters (22.4 liters). You\n    you should have a concentration of at least 1% CO in the air to kill\n    yourself. It's probably a good idea to collect the CO in a bag.

After my many adamant\nstatements that catalytic converters do /nothing/ to reduce emissions of\ncarbon monoxide, I have found two sources that contradict that assertion.\n\nCatalytic converters became mandatory on US cars begining with the 1975\nmodel year and UK cars with the 1993 model year.\n\nThe first source is from the US Environmental Protection Administration.\nOn the link (below) they explain the goal of reducing CO emissions from\nautos by catalytic converters. They state that \"Today's passenger cars\nare capable of emitting 90 percent less carbon monoxide over their\nlifetimes than their uncontrolled counterparts of the 1960's.\" Sounds\nlike they're doing something there, huh? Let me explain. Over the\nprojected life of a modern car the total CO produced may be a little\nmore than half the total CO produced a 1960's car.\n\nWhat does this have to do with catalytic converters? First check the EPA\nsite, then I'll direct you to a more specific and detailed site.\n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/OMSWWW/03-co.htm\n\nWayne State University School of Medicine has a site called the Carbon\nMonoxide Headquarters. It's a very informative site, here's the address\nfor the home page:\n\nhttp://www.phymac.med.wayne.edu/FacultyProfile/penney/COHQ/co1.htm\n\nFollowing the links from the home page will give you information such\nas, US vehicles with catalytic converters produce about the same amount\nof CO exhaust before a tune up as vehicles without catalytic converters\nproduce after a tune up.\n\nThis link shows just how long it takes to develop lethal levels of CO in\nvehicles with catalytic converters. Depending upon the efficiency of the\ncombustion it takes up to 16 minutes.

You can speed it up by making the mixture richer and by\ndefeating the oxygen sensor.\n\nAn easy way to test things is by buying a $30 carbon monoxide detector\nand reading the documentation to see what concentration it alerts at.\nTest your system, wait for the alert, then do the math to figure how\nlong it would take you to get to the desired level.\n\nHere are some links you can use to compute lethal levels, the bottom\nline is that a concentration of 6400 parts per million will kill in 25\nminutes.

Round 2.\n Date: Wed, 19 May 1999 21:51:20 -0400\n\nThe subject of physiological effects of inert gases has come up.\nAccidents in the industry that I have read about suggest that breathing\npure nitrogen leads to extremely rapid unconsciousness. One or two\nbreaths effectively purge all the oxygen out of the lungs, and the\nvictim doesn't have time to react. There are probably no warning\nsymptoms, as nitrogen has no physiological effects of its own.\n\nOne story is that a man entered a large nitrogen tank to clean it, not\nknowing that it had not been purged with air. He collapsed immediately,\nand his brother (a fellow worker) attempted to rescue him. Both were\nfound dead of anoxia.\n\nI would think that death from nitrogen inhalation would be quick (5-10\nmin.), painless, and uneventful. (No convulsions, no gasping for air,\netc). Obviously, I haven't tried it, so I can't say for sure. Helium and\nargon would be expected to have very similar effects.\n\nFrom http://netvet.wustl.edu/org/awic/bib/avmaeuth.htm:\n\n    Nitrogen (N_2 ) [is a] colorless, odorless [gas] that [is] inert,\n    nonflammable, and nonexplosive. Nitrogen comprises 78% of\n    atmospheric air?\n\n    Euthanasia is induced by placing the animal in a closed container\n    into which N_2 ? is rapidly introduced or prefilled at atmospheric\n    pressure. Nitrogen? displaces oxygen in the container, thus inducing\n    death by hypoxemia.\n\n    With N_2 flowing at a rate of 39% of chamber volume per minute, rats\n    collapsed in approximately 3 minutes and stopped breathing in 5 to 6\n    minutes. Regardless of flow rate, signs of panic and distress were\n    evident before the rats collapsed and died. ?Quine? addressed the\n    issue of distress associated with exposure to N_2 by removing cats\n    and dogs from the chamber following unconsciousness and allowing\n    them to recover. When these animals were put back into the chamber,\n    they did not appear afraid or apprehensive.\n\n    Nitrogen [is] readily available as [a] compressed [gas].\n    Unconsciousness is preceded by hypoxemia and ventilatory\n    stimulation, which may be distressing?\n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: Randy\n Date: Sun, 14 Sep 1997 12:37:00 -0500\n\n > What exactly is the nitrogen tent method?\n\nYou fill an enclosed space with nitrogen and just sit there.

Ring some of them up and ask how to obtain helium for\n        filling balloons. Most shops will apologise and say something\n        along the lines of, \"Sorry we don't supply it, but you could try\n        to PartySmells shop on such-and-such a road?\" \n        Ringing up is preferable to a personal visit because?\n\n            * If you are a nervous sort of person like me, then a phone\n              is much better tham a personal call (from a \"nobody knows\n              who I am\" point-of-view).\n            * You will find that most party shops don't supply helium,\n              so it's a good idea to ring around.\n\n        When you find a shop that can supply the helium, they'll ask if\n        you want a helium canister for about twenty balloons, or a\n        helium tank for about two-hundred. Naturally, you'll want to\n        plump for the latter.\n\n        The gas itself will cost about #45, and you must also place a\n        deposit on the cylinder; the deposit will need to be cash (i.e.,\n        not switch card or credit card), and it'll probably be around\n        #50\\. Fortunately, I'm well off, so money is not a problem here.\n\n        Note that, the party shops will not usually have any helium to\n        buy \"off the shelf,\" and they may ask you to wait from one to\n        ten days for some to be delivered. If time is a constraint, then\n        this could be a problem.\n\n        The gas appears to be \"balloon-grade\" and exceeds 99% purity.\n        The remaining fraction is probably nitrogen, though I've no idea\n        really.\n\n        *Caution:* The gas tank is actually quite heavy (about the same\n        as two or three car batteries), so if you are in any way\n        disabled, you may have trouble with it.\n\n            Neighbour: \"So what on Earth do you want all this gas for?\"\n            You: \"Oh, I'm going to gas myself. Would you mind just\n            helping me get it up the stairs, please?\" \n\n    *Making a Gas Mask*\n        Your first stop should be a trip to the local \"auto spares\"\n        shop, or \"Boots,\" where you can get a siphoning tube, or any\n        other suitable flexible tubing. I would recommend a longer piece\n        rather than a shorter one because\n\n            * The gas is quite cold when it comes out of the tank, and a\n              long tube will give it a chance to warm up by a couple of\n              degrees.\n            * If you use a very long tube, there's a slight chance you\n              may get tangled up in it, and accidently trip over and\n              choke yourself to death on it.\n            * You can always make a long piece shorter if you're not\n              happy with it.\n\n        About three metres should be plenty, and will cost under #1 per\n        metre.\n\n        Next stop: the supermarket. Buy a tub of \"I Can't Believe It's\n        Not Butter.\" Not the very small-sized tub, but the next size up.\n        If you remember when you were a kid, you might have stuck a\n        glass over your mouth, and sucked, and the suction would have\n        held the glass to your face, airtight. We will use the same\n        principle with the butter tub. Hence you want to get one which\n        will fit under your chin, over your mouth and up to the bridge\n        of your nose.\n\n        Any container of about this size will do, however I would\n        recommend the use of \"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter,\" \"Utterly\n        Butterly,\" or \"Clover,\" as they come in quite strong plastic\n        tubs, unlike \"Flora\" or \"Happy Shopper's Own Brand Marga-Muck,\"\n        which have thin plastic, which could crack or split when being cut.\n\n        Treat yourself to a slap-up meal of toast and butter, and then\n        give the margarine-tub a good cleaning, unless you are a girl,\n        in which case you probably like having oily slimy stuff all over\n        your face (margarine contains active lipobuttersomes?in\n        scientific tests eight out of ten phlegm weevils got younger\n        when they used it, etc., etc.).\n\n            NB: I don't want anyone else to use an \"I Can't Believe It's\n            Not Butter\" tub, as I want to be the first person to kill\n            myself using one. That would be an achievment worthy of some\n            praise. \n\n        Fit the tub over your mouth, you'll find that your nose gets in\n        the way, and prevents an airtight fit. Use a sharp\n        knife?preferably an X-Acto or carpet/utility knife?to cut a\n        small indentation where your nose will go. Make lots of small\n        cuts, rather than one big one, because you're less likely to\n        make a serious bodge. When the tub fits snugly over your mouth,\n        you should be able to hold it there by sucking in. It doesn't\n        matter if it isn't a perfect airtight fit, because the helium\n        gas will fill the mask easily, and as long as the %Oxygen is\n        kept low, then a little air getting in won't matter. If the\n        helium pressure is sufficiently strong, it'll force out any air\n        anyway.\n\n        Next, get some long elastic bands. Find a sharp object about the\n        size and shape of a knitting needle, and puncture a hole in the\n        sides of the tub on each side, about in line with where your\n        ears are. I found that heating a knitting needle and punching a\n        small hole made a clean edge. Chain two or three long elastic\n        bands together, and push one end through the hole. Once it's\n        through, pull enough through the hole to let you tie a large\n        knot in the elastic band, and then pull the band back through.\n        The elastic band should now be held firmly to the tub. Repeat\n        this procedure on the other side. And you can now place the tub\n        over your mouth, and put the elastic bands around the head.\n        Adjust the tightness (by tieing knots in the elastic band, or\n        pulling more throuth the tub holes), so that it fits snugly and\n        comfortably. If you've got the placement just right, the elastic\n        bands can be placed around the ears, and the mask will hold in\n        place very comfortably and easily and will not fall off.\n\n        After that, take the tubing, and note how wide it is. On the\n        front of the mask, about in line with the nose or mouth, using\n        the sharp knife, make two incisions about the same diameter as\n        the tubing. Don't cut a hole, just make a cross shaped cut. Now\n        push the tubing through from the inside of the mask, and the cut\n        pieces of plastic will open out and form a flange around the\n        tubing. Pull the tubing through until a small piece is left\n        protruding into the mask, (not too far). Now tape the flanges of\n        plastic to the tubing, and liberally wind more tape around the\n        join until the tubing is firmly held and the seal is airtight.\n\n        Finally, tape the free end of the tube to the gas outlet of the\n        helium tank. This may be a problem because the gas tanks that\n        are supplied for filling balloons have an unusual outlet. It\n        consists of a spring-loaded nozzle, which when bent, opens a\n        valve to allow the gas out. Imagine holding a balloon onto a\n        nozzle and then twisting your wrist upwards, this forces a\n        plunger backwards and releases gas into the balloon, the gas\n        comes out rather quickly, filling the balloon in a matter of\n        seconds. When the nozzle is released, the spring forces the\n        nozzle back to the horizontal position, and the metal plunger\n        slides back against a stop, cutting off the gas flow. There is a\n        master valve on the top of the cylinder too, but it doesn't\n        allow for much flow regulation.\n\n        This odd nozzle arrangement can act for and against us. I ought\n        to point out, that I have managed to get (through work), a\n        proper gas regulator valve, so I've replaced the one on my\n        cylinder, but I did some experimentation with the spring loaded\n        nozzle version first. If you tape the tubing to the nozzle, and\n        then connect some more elastic bands between the nozzle end and\n        a sturdy object (like the cylinder handle), you can make a nice\n        \"dead mans handle:\" when you let go of the nozzle, the elastic\n        band pulls the nozzle upwards, and releases gas. This means that\n        you can hold the nozzle in a position which just lets enough gas\n        out, into the mask, and causes you to lose conciousness, when\n        you pass out, your hand will release the nozzle, and the elastic\n        band will open it up even more, thus increasing the gas flow,\n        and ensuring that you don't get any air. Experimentation has\n        shown this to be quite a good little system.\n\n            NB: Don't be tempted to remove the nozzle, and then open the\n            master valve, as the gas comes out at a tremendous speed; it\n            will make the most amazing noise, and make you jump right\n            out of your skin (it will also blow any papers anywhere in\n            the room all over). Only open the master valve, when you\n            have a suitable regulator or nozzle in place (hey! you might\n            even get yourself killed!). \n\n    *Gassing Yourself*\n        The fact that I'm writing this is evidence enough that I'm a\n        chicken and haven't succeeded in killing myself yet. I've no\n        particular reason to die, just bored with life, so there is no\n        urgency on my part, and one day I'll go through with it. However\n        I can tell you what you will feel using the inert gas method,\n        and I can reassure you that it is not painful.\n\n        The bag-over-the-head method causes a build-up of CO_2 , and the\n        body will react with gasping, rapid pulse, and general panic\n        (I've tried it); the inert gas method simply replaces the air\n        with an inert atmosphere, denuded of oxygen, and the body has no\n        \"learned\" response to this.\n\n        Once you have the mask in place and the gas flowing (I'd advise\n        tunring the gas on first, arranging your valve regulation, and\n        then putting on the mask, because the first gush of gas can be a\n        bit violent, and might feel unpleasant), all you have to do is\n        breathe normally. When you breathe the gas in pure, you'll\n        notice that it is?\n\n            * ?quite cold, but not too unpleasant (a longer tube may help);\n            * ?essentially odourless, though it smells different; from\n              room air;\n            * ?makes your voice squeaky?try singing as you die!\n\n        After maybe three long slow breaths, you may notice a slight\n        increase in your heart rate. I can only speculate about this,\n        but it's almost certainly due to one or more of the following:\n\n            * perhaps it's one's body's way of saying, \"More oxygen,\n              please.\"\n            * anxiety?after all, you /are/ trying to kill yourself!\n            * some trace material in the gas (though this is unlikely);\n            * /[Insert better reason here.]/\n\n        I found that the momentary racing heart passed quickly, and I\n        conclude that it was caused by anxiety (on successive\n        experiments, I've found the effect to be less pronounced).\n\n        After about thirty seconds you will start to feel pressure in\n        your head. Not really, but if you have stood up quickly, and\n        feel dizzy, you'll know that there's this stange feeling\n        \"inside\" your head. This has been explained to me by a\n        colleague, as probably being caused by the blood vessels in the\n        head expanding to increase the blood flow and try to keep oxygen\n        levels up.\n\n        After a few more seconds, you'll start to feel yourself black\n        out. I was unable to verify exactly what you \"see\" because my\n        gas mask, comes just up to my eyes, so I keep them shut whilst\n        doing this. However on previous experiments, just breathing\n        directly from the tube, I've found that my vision started to go\n        black around the edges, and that is entirely consistent with\n        symptoms caused by low oxygen.\n\n        At this point on all attempts, I have removed the mask, and\n        prayed that an aircraft would crash land on my house and spare\n        me having to do this any more.\n\n    *Conclusions*\n        Keeping the mask on for a few more seconds would almost\n        certainly have resulted in unconsciousness; having the gas mask\n        in place would have meant a continued period without oxygen (and\n        thus death, after a few minutes), under these circumstances.\n\n        The entire process seems to be essentially painless. You will\n        feel yourself blacking out, and this causes me some panic, and\n        hence that abortion of the operation, but I beleive persons with\n        a stronger will should have no difficulty in carrying the plan\n        through to terminus. (The person who initially suggested the use\n        of helium to me, has not contacted me for some time, and since I\n        have only an email address, I cannot ascertain why, but is quite\n        possibly dead from this method).\n\n            *Side effects:* To date I have nearly succeeded on several\n            attempts, and have suffered no (known) long term effects. \n\n        Since people can black out from standing up too quickly?the air\n        force g-tests pilots by whirling them around in centrifuges,\n        drawing the blood away from the head until they black out?and\n        blackouts can be caused by numerous other means. I beleive that\n        if oxygen is restored quickly, then any \"aborted operations\"\n        should be fairly safe.\n\n        *Pros of this Method:* It appears to be painless, and can be\n        carried out in the comfort of your own home, at your own pace,\n        allowing the opportunity to get comfortable, have a last drink,\n        put your favorite record on, etc., etc.\n\n        Definitely a nice way to go.\n\n        *Cons of this Method:* If you jump off a tall building, then you\n        just need to make that decision once. Once your feet have left\n        the ledge, you're history, and there's no turning back (assuming\n        a good landing anyway). With the gassing method, you have about\n        a minute to sit there trying to convince yourself that you want\n        to live really, and it's very hard to quiet those demons.\n\n        I would dearly love to get my hands on some nitrous oxide, as\n        this would have an anæsthetizing effect, whilst acheiving\n        asphyxiation.\n\n From: anonymous\n Subject: Re: Experience Regarding Suicide Attempts\n\nIt was indeed easy to obtain a large tank from a party shop.

Mainly, I wonder about gas build-up: you\nopen the valve on your gas cylinder, hold the end of the hose from the\ntank up by your face, pull the garbage bag over your head, and snap the\nrubber bands in place around your neck (all while sedated and/or drunk,\nto suppress any panic reaction).\n\nAssuming you get a nice, tight fit with the rubber bands over the\nbunched-up plastic band at your neck, the bag inflates quickly with the\ninert gas and you rapidly pass out. Then what? The gas keeps pouring\ninto the bag, with no way out; is the bag eventually going to rupture at\na seam, or snap rubber bands? Will that happen (in a worst case\nscenario) /after/ brain damage has occured, but /before/ death?\n\nI can think of ways to stop the gas flow, or vent the gas, but they're\ncomplicated (and that increases the risk of failure). I think the\nnitrogen tent method deals with these problems, and it's also, imho, a\nmore comfortable exit. I pieced together my tent with heavy (4 mil.)\nplastic sheeting, taped over a box, but I have worked out a simpler method:\n\n    Buy a heavy-duty trash bin liner, the kind intended for 50-55 galln\n    drums, used as trash cans at parks, sporting arenas, etc. These are\n    larger than usual garbage bags, are usually transparent, and are\n    made out of a stronger plastic (similar to that used for plastic\n    grocery bags). They can be purchased at a good hardware store or\n    janitorial supply store.\n\n    Get a sturdy cardboard box, large enough to acomodate your head (and\n    maybe your shoulders ?to be comfortable), but not too large to fit\n    inside the trash bin liner. Place the box inside the bag (I'd place\n    a pillow inside the box, first). This is your \"tent.\"\n\n    Place the tent on a bed, with the open end of the bag (and box)\n    pointed toward the foot of the bed. Run a hose from the nitrogen or\n    helium gas cylinder up inside the bag, into the box.\n\n    Place a /heavy/ blanket or quilt over the open end of the bag,\n    overlapping the end by several inches. It's important that it be\n    heavy, because this is the seal?it will allow excess gas to vent\n    out, while preventing fresh air from seaping back in. Use duct tape\n    to tape the edge of the blanket to the bag.\n\n    The tent is ready to go. Open the valve on the gas cylinder's\n    pressure regulator, sending gas into the tent. Take a deep breath\n    and slide up from the foot of the bed, under the blanket and into\n    the tent, and lie with your head inside the box as the tent is\n    flooded with nitrogen or helium.\n\n    *Technical Details* (sort of):\n\n    The goal is to get the oxygen levels inside the tent below 6%, and\n    to keep it down long enough for brain death to occur.\n\n    /[ed. note: there are easily-procured analysis machines which would\n    indicate the oxygen level.]/\n\n    At atmospheric oxygen levels of 4-6%, coma ocurs in 40 seconds,\n    followed by convulsions, respiratory arrest and death, according to\n    Safety Bulletin SB-2 <http://www.cganet.com/pubs/free/sb-2.htm> from\n    the Compressed Gas Association <http://www.cganet.com/>.\n\nNitrogen is available from welding supply stores; common cylinder sizes\nare 75, 150, 250 cubic feet. The tanks and regulators can be purchased\nor rented (the cost is about the same either way).\n\nYou /will/ need a pressure regulator, to reliably control the rate of\nflow of gas into the tent.\n\nI was advised by a compressed gas expert (I won't mention him by name,\nbut thanks!) to use a flow rate of 10 cu. ft. per minute in my 4.5\ncu.ft. tent; I think a somewhat lower rate would be fine, and would give\nme a longer flow (that's not important with a 150 or 250 cu. ft. tank,\nbut might be with a smaller tank). In animal euthanasia tests, the flow\nrate was reported as approx. 40% of the volume of the compartment per\nminute?do the math for your own tent.\n\nIs it painful or unpleasant? Nitrogen asphyxiation has been recommended\nas the ultimate humane method for criminal executions?\"Killing With\nKindness,\" by Stuart A. Creque (/National Review,/ Sept. 11, 1995),\ndescribes a couple of accidental nitrogen asphyxiations, in which the\nvictims apperantly never realized what was happening. In animal\neuthanasia experiments, hyperventilation prior to loss of consciousness\nwas reported, which might be distressing, and muscular tremors,\nconvulsions and \"vocalizations\" after loss of consciousness.\n\nhttp://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/noawicpubs/avmaeuth.htm\n\nI have run a couple of tests with my tent:\n    Firstly, I have simply lain in the tent, just to see how long it\n    would take for CO_2 build-up to occur, assuming it would happen at\n    all. I was able to stay inside my 4.5 cu. ft. tent for up to 45\n    minutes, before my breathing became so labored that it was\n    uncomfortable (distracting, really). It also got rather warm inside\n    the tent, especially with a heavy quilt on it, and there was a\n    considerable build-up of moisture on the inside of the tent, from my\n    respiration. Not really bothersome, given the short time I'll be in\n    it (alive, anyway) when I use it.\n\n    I also tested the tent by placing two lit votive candles inside,\n    placing a small, low-pressure (7.5 cu.ft.) cannister of helium for\n    party balloons inside, and opening the valve. The candles dimmned\n    and went out in approximately 90 seconds.\n\n    I later vented the remainder of the small helium tank into the tent\n    while I was in it?enough to raise the pitch of my voice, but not to\n    even make me light-headed. One shortcoming of these tests was that I\n    had no way to accurately judge how much helium had actually been put\n    into the tent, and another is that I do not know whether the oxygen\n    levels necesary to support combustion by the candles is as low as\n    that necesary to remain alive.\n\n    I do not think the small canisters of helium sold for filling 25-30\n    party balloons are sufficient to \"safely\" carry out this method; the\n    larger tanks should be used.\n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: coffee\n Date: Mon, 10 May 1999 17:41:56 -0700\n\n > I have some problems with using helium or nitrogen with\n > about gas build-up?\n\nYou have slightly different ideas than I. I'd simply fill the garbage\nbag up with helium (while keeping it closed), and, once full, would the\ninflux of gas; then I'd put it over my head, and duct-tape it on\n(actually, before putting it over my head, I'd start the oxygen\ndeprivation with some nitrous oxide). This way, you don't have to worry\nabout pressures changing and whatnot. As helium rises nicely, one should\nbe able to not lose much helium while putting it over ones head, and\nwith a good exhale before putting it on, hopefully the CO_2 should not\nbe a problem.\n\n?I think that a couple of the smaller containers would be fine for the\nsolo garbage bag. However, your idea seems quite thought out and\nworkable, merely requiring a larger expenditure of effort and money. I\nthink that both are about as likely to work (I plan on sometime buying a\ngarbage bag and testing about how long that I can breath in it before\nCO_2 build up becomes a problem (altho I'm guessing it would take longer\nwithout a temporary source of O2, and thus continued respiration) tho\nI'd imagine that it would take at least 15 minutes for a decently sized\ngarbage bag).\n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: Hermotimus\n Subject: Re: ASH TALK ON GASES IN SUICIDE.

Any clues in the article here?\n\n*Re: tube tents.*\n/Mea culpa/?thought they were common knowledge; obviously I was wrong.\nAnyhow, these are cylindrical plastic bags, open at both ends, that are\nused as emergency tents by backpackers. They're flimsy (about like thick\ntrash bags), airtight, and thus not very good for keeping dry (due to\ncondensation), but they are light and cheap ($5-10). Since there is\ngenerally a rope running its length and keeping it from falling, and a\nperson on the bottom, the approximate shape (in use) is triangular.\n\nIf the tube tent is 8 feet [244 cm] long and has a diameter of 4 feet\n[122 cm] the triangular volume is about 55 cubic feet [1.5 cubic meters]\nor about 400 gallons.\n\nHermotimus made the valid point that you want to vent surplus gas\nwithout tearing the bag/tent and that a rug over the tent was a\nreasonable way to achieve this. The problem is that since the standard\ntube tent is only 8 feet long, there may not be sufficient room for a\nperson to stretch out and still have enough bag at either end to fold\nover with a rug flap. A couple of possible work-arounds are (1) two tube\ntents (end-to-end) attached by duct tape; (2) cut a hole near the top of\none side of the tube tent, and make a weighted flap that vents excess\ngas and then falls back in place. Gravity should work fine, but I\nhaven't tried this and you may want to experiment with petroleum jelly\n(Vaseline) or velcro to make a better seal.\n\n*Re: deaths due to nitrogen on airplanes (and elsewhere).*\nThe point has nothing to do with airplanes per se, or the circumstances\nunder which nitrogen was mistakenly used. The point (consistent with\nother accidental human deaths, as well as intentional animal deaths) is\nthat nitrogen asphyxia seems to be a very low-trauma way to go.\n\n*c. Carbon Dioxide (CO_2 )/Suffocation*\n From http://netvet.wustl.edu/org/awic/bib/avmaeuth.htm:\n\n    At concentrations of 30% to 40% CO_2 in oxygen, anæsthesia was\n    induced within 1 to 2 minutes, usually without struggling, retching,\n    or vomiting. ?In cats, inhalation of 60% CO_2 results in loss of\n    consciousness within 45 seconds, and respiratory arrest within 5\n    minutes.\n\n    Several investigators have suggested that inhalation of high\n    concentrations of CO_2 may be distressing to animals because of\n    mucosal irritation and ventilatory stimulation. However, the degree\n    of distress appears to be mild, and it is unlikely that it is any\n    more than inhalation of volatile anæsthetics?\n\n    Carbon dioxide is used for preslaughter anæsthesia of swine. The\n    undesirable side effect of CO_2 , as used in commercial\n    slaughterhouses, is that swine experience a stage of excitement with\n    vocalization for about 40 seconds before they lose consciousness.\n    For that reason, CO_2 preslaughter anæsthesia may appear less humane\n    than other techniques.\n\n    Carbon dioxide may be purchased? in solid state as \"dry ice,\"?\n    [which] is inexpensive, nonflammable, and nonexplosive? [and] does\n    not result in accumulation of tissue residues in food-producing\n    animals. ?does not distort cellular architecture.\n\n    Because CO_2 is heavier than air, incomplete filling of a chamber\n    may permit tall or climbing animals to avoid exposure and to\n    survive. This appears to be very distressful to the animals. Some\n    species may have extraordinary tolerance for CO_2 .\n\n    Compressed CO_2 gas in cylinders is preferable to dry ice because\n    the inflow to the chamber can be regulated precisely. If dry ice is\n    used, animal contact must be avoided to prevent freezing or\n    chilling. Carbon dioxide generated by other methods such as from a\n    fire extinguisher or from chemical means (eg, Alka-Seltzer) are\n    unacceptable. With an animal in the chamber, an optimal flow rate\n    should displace at least 20% of the chamber volume per minute.\n    Unconsciousness may be induced more rapidly by exposing animals to a\n    CO_2 concentration of 70% or more by prefilling the chamber. It is\n    important to verify that an animal is dead before removing it from\n    the chamber. If an animal is not dead, CO_2 narcosis must be\n    followed with another method of euthanasia. Larger animals, such as\n    rabbits, cats, and swine, appear to be more distressed by CO_2\n    euthanasia; therefore, other methods of euthanasia are preferable.\n\n*d. Nitrous Oxide (N_2 O)*\n From http://netvet.wustl.edu/org/awic/bib/avmaeuth.htm:\n\n    Nitrous oxide (N_2 O) may be used with the other inhalants to speed\n    the onset of anæsthesia, but it alone does not induce anæsthesia in\n    animals, even at 100% concentration. If N_2 O is used as a sole\n    euthanasia agent, hypoxemia develops before respiratory or cardiac\n    arrest, and animals may become distressed prior to unconsciousness.\n\n    Nitrous oxide will support combustion.\n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: \"Randy Meador <mailto:spam-blocker>hotmail.com>\"\n Date: Wed, 27 Aug 1997 14:44:05 -0500\n\n >?I would like to use pure nitrous oxide (dentist\n >stuff/laughing gas); where can a tank be obtained,\n >legally or not?\n\nIt's legal, but most companies won't sell tanks of it to residential\naddresses unless there's a /damned/ good excuse given.

Nitrous oxide, administered alone (that is without\nsupplemental oxygen) can cause asphyxiation, due to oxygen deprivation.\nThis is because the body cannot utilize the oxygen molecule in N_2 O to\nsupply oxygen to the tissues. This lack of oxygen leads to cell death.\n\nAs to lethal doses of nitrous oxide? Since it is administered as a gas,\nI'm not sure how one knows that 20mg is actually \"solved\" into the\nblood. The same applies to the stated \"lethal dose\" of 60mg. Nitrous\noxide is administered based on effect in the medical setting.\nAnæsthesiologists do not \"dial in\" a dose.

The chemical change in your blood is a dilutional state\nwith a low sodium level (hyponatremia). In order to lower your sodium\nlevels critically you must make a massve effort and a poor kidney\nresponse. The sodium gradient between the brain and blood is such that\nseizures and confusion occurs.

The context sounds like we're talking about very small bodies of\nwater such as a tub. While people do drown in tubs it's usually because\nthey are unconscious first (not drunk). If one is serious about\ndrowning, though, one should probably choose a much larger water source\nsuch as a lake or ocean. (Though as Hermotimus has pointed out on\nA.S.H., salt water drowning is more painful.) Then you can either swim\nout (and don't stop?a tough one) until you are so exhausted that you can\nno longer hold your head out of the water. Or bring weights (Virgina\nWoolf put rocks in her pockets) that you can swim with for a while but\nthat would sink you if you stopped swimming. Another variation is to\nchose a water source that has a current that will carry you out past the\npoint you can return (Pacific Ocean being the prime example out here).\n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: Barry Bermingham\n Subject: Re: Suicide suggestion??

I suspect that a\n    motorcycle at very high velocity would be the best method of\n    achieving the Motivsplat. \nTouching the \"Third Rail\"\n    Electrocution is uncertain, and could result in some neurological\n    problems if we don't succeed in death. I suspect that taking further\n    steps, such as anti-insulation, something to do with water, maybe\n    carrying big hunks of metal, maybe even transistors or something\n    would assist the Jolt. Research into the success of suicidals or\n    accidents appears valuable. \nLying down on Train Tracks\n    Stupidity factors here. Advanced timing of the train, which parts of\n    the body are cut off (people have become parapalegics but not died\n    in such circumstances), whether the suicide is seen (a tunnel would\n    seem excellent, or just 'round a bend in the wilderness), who may be\n    nearby, whether assistance can really be achieved soon afterward,\n    and whether the /head/ is lopped off, would all appear to be factors\n    in the Trainslice. \nDiving off a Tall Structure\n    Apparently people have survived, upon occasion, very long plummets.\n    sometimes these have been cushioned by foliage or air currents. The\n    higher the structure and the more expert the dive (hitting\n    head-first can be successful from low-altitudes) are the factors\n    here. Others may also be if something is below that might cushion\n    the fall, like trees, children, water, etc. Water can be like\n    hitting a wall, at times. \n\nFrom http://netvet.wustl.edu/org/awic/bib/avmaeuth.htm:\n\n    Physical methods of euthanasia include captive bolt, gunshot,\n    cervical dislocation, decapitation, electrocution,? exsanguination,\n    stunning, or pithing. However, some of these procedures, namely\n    exsanguination, stunning, and pithing, are not recommended as a sole\n    means of euthanasia, but are adjuncts when used in association with\n    other agents or methods. Some consider physical methods of\n    euthanasia aesthetically displeasing. However, some of these methods\n    cause less fear and anxiety, and may be more rapid, painless,\n    humane, and practical than other forms of euthanasia when properly\n    used by skilled personnel with well-maintained equipment.\n\n    If the method is not accomplished correctly, animals may be injured\n    and may have varying degrees of consciousness, resulting in pain and\n    distress.\n\n    In general, physical methods are recommended for use only after\n    other acceptable means have been excluded; in sedated or unconscious\n    animals when practical; and when scientifically or clinically\n    justified. Consequently, the panel considers all physical methods,\n    except microwave irradiation, conditionally acceptable.\n\n*1\\.

The American's used the hangman's knot to do the same thing:\nit was a heavy bulky knot which helped throw the condemned's head back.\nAdditionally, it was a high friction knot, so the hangman could tighten\nit and go about the remainder of his business without worrying about the\nnoose loostening and coming off. This knot is NOT good for effective\nstrangulation precisely for that reason. If the neck is not broken, the\nhangman's knot can actually prolong strangulation because it does not\ntighten very effectively.\n\nEnding up with the knot behind the head throws the head forward and\nvirtually guarantees the spine will not be broken unless the drop used\nis extremely long. The knot to the side is a little better.\n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: anonymous\n Date: Thu, 11 Sep 1997 19:56:16 -0400\n\nI found this bit?I hope it helps.\n\n    A Guide To Hanging Yourself\n    Stones \tPounds \tDrop\n    14 stone \t196 lbs. \t8 ft. 0 in.\n    13.5 stone \t189 lbs. \t8 ft. 2 in.\n    13 stone \t182 lbs. \t8 ft. 4 in.\n    12.5 stone \t175 lbs. \t8 ft. 6 in.\n    12 stone \t168 lbs. \t8 ft. 8 in.\n    11.5 stone \t161 lbs. \t8 ft. 10 in.\n    11 stone \t154 lbs. \t9 ft. 0 in.\n    10.5 stone \t147 lbs. \t9 ft. 2 in.\n    10 stone \t140 lbs. \t9 ft. 4 in.\n    9.5 stone \t133 lbs. \t9 ft. 6 in.\n    9 stone \t126 lbs. \t9 ft. 8 in.\n    8.5 stone \t119 lbs. \t9 ft. 10 in.\n    8 stone \t112 lbs. \t10 ft. 0 in.\n\n    The above table shows weight and recommended drop.\n\n    This is actually a quite important list.

To die by hypotermia your body must lose heat at a higher speed\nthan he can generate it. Cooling is a heat flux from a warmer system to\nother with a lesser level of heat. When we are talking about hypotermia,\nthe warm system is your body, and the cool one is the environ. Three\nmain factors determinate the speed of the transference (translating\ndirectly from the Spanish terms; sorry if they're not exact):\n\n    * Heat gradient?The higher the difference in temperature, the faster\n      the transference of heat. /(\"Gradiente de calor.\")/\n    * Heat capacity?Each system can accept a different heat amount. The\n      speed at which a system accepts heat depends, as to say, in the\n      \"full\" or \"empty\" of heat it is. The greater the heat capacity of\n      the receptor, the faster the transference. /(\"Capacidad\n      calorífica.\")/\n    * Interchange surface: The greater the exposed surface, the faster\n      the heat transference. /(\"Superficie de intercambio.\")/\n\nThus, any circumstance which increases any those factors will accelerate\nthe cooling; for instance:\n\n    * Windchill?The air hasn't a great heat capacity, but the layer in\n      contact with the skin (the interchange surface) is being\n      constantly renewed. The faster this is freshening, the greater the\n      apparent heat capacity; thus, the faster the cooling.\n    * Ambient temperature: The lower the temperature, the greater the\n      heat gradient; thus, the faster the cooling.\n    * Coolant?Water has far a bigger heat capacity than air, the heat\n      flux \"body->water,\" or \"body->water->air,\" is much faster than\n      \"body->air.\"\n    * Clothing?It works stopping the wind. Since the air layer in\n      contact with the skin is not renewed, it gets warm fast, and the\n      heat lost goes low (there is still heat transference by\n      diffussion, but it is very slow).\n\nI really don't know how low your temperature must come for you to die. I\nthink I heard once something under 32°C (normal body temperature is\n36.5° to 37°C), but I'm not sure. Anyway, how is the mechanism? Heart\nattack? No oxygen in your brain? It is said that if one falls in the\nwater in the Arctic ocean, one will die within only a few minutes.\n\nIf I were you, I would go with little clothing to a lake in a very cold\nplace. Have a bath (dressed) for around two or three minutes to let the\nhypothermia proccess start, and then come out the water and sit in an\nexposed windy place to wait.

First, you have to make\nlong and deep cuts; /not/ \"across\" your wrists, but /up your arm/?opens\nmore of the vein and makes clotting harder. Second, It's best to sit and\nsoak in a hot tub of water, or a running shower. The heat and hot water\nwill keep your blood flowing and will relax you, but will also race your\nheart, as your body's natural reaction is to pump blood faster, to speed\nyour body functions up, to cool your body off. Lastly, a little alcohol\nin your system can't hurt as it also prevents clotting of the blood, may\nstop any anxiety attacks you may have, and may even limit the pain.\nLastly, elevate your legs while sitting in the tub or shower?this will\nbring the blood from your lower regions back into your body's center,\nwhere it can get pumped faster, and you may not get as light-headed\nafter your bleeding.\n\nResults of a successful wrist-slashing are this: you can expect to get\ncold and feel chilled all over; you will feel groggy soon after losing a\nlot of blood; and you will feel tired. You may feel light-headed, and\nwill get sleepy. You will feel your heartbeat throughout your body, and\na cold, eerie feeling of \"pulsation\" in your arms and legs, as the hours\npass and your bloodpressure drops off. Average time to die on a\nwrist-slitting depends on your height, weight, and how large and deep\nthe wounds are. Remember: slice /up your arm/ to cut open that vein.\nAverage time is at least two to four hours. Maybe longer, if you weigh\nmore and have more body mass. Put in a CD, light a candle, drink some\nbooze and take some sleep meds. Sit in a hot tub or shower and let it\nall wash away. Hope that answers your questions.\n\n Newsgroups: alt.suicide.methods <news:alt.suicide.methods>\n Subject: Re: Cutting your Wrists\n From: dataplex17@my-deja.com <mailto:dataplex17@my-deja.com>\n Date: Fri, 14 Jan 2000 22:34:03 GMT\n\nMy mom is an EMT. I asked her about wrist cutting, and she said that\ncutting across the wrist in /not/ going to do it. If you want the wound\nto stay open, you're much more likely to succeed by cutting pretty much\nalong the artery, starting from your elbow and working down to the\nwrist. Another place that is tried a lot is the leg?there is an artery\non the inside of the leg that is bigger than the one in the arms, and\nprobably gets more blood due to the greater mass down there.

I did that a couple of months\nago, without sucsess. I thought, in my innocence, that if you only reach\nan artery, you're sure to be dead.\n\nI'm also new here, but still I might be able to explain a bit: Wrong, I\ncut of my arteries on both wrists (spash of blood and then blood flowing\nout in rythm with my pulse), but your body protects itself by stopping\nthe blood flow after a while. Did it again?and again?till I finally\nreached the conclusion that its a louse way to try to take your life; it\ndoes not work, and I was too weak anyway to be able to do it again. So\nhere I am, still alive? First let me mention that I work for a rescue\nservice in my free time? didn't try it myself but saw people who tried\nthat kind of thing. In reality, it is pretty hard to slash your wrists\nand actually hit an artery. Most people just hit the vein, see a splash\nof blood and think they've hit the artery, and it's done. Wrong. First\nof all, the artery hides /below/ the vein, which pulses also?though not\nas much, so you'd have to keep cutting while the blood's gushing?or\nslash real hard. Second, the artery has to sustain quite a high\npressure, so it's somewhat more sturdy than a vein. Not too easy to cut\nthrough. By the time you'd actually get to it, you're probably out from\nloss of blood already. And veins, as you've experienced, have the\ntendency to close off. Even if they didn't, there's always a second way\nof the body protecting itself. It's called centralisation. When this\nhappens, the body cuts off nearly all circulation in the arms and legs,\nall the better to provide the vital organs with blood.\n\nSo, cutting your wrists is /definitively/ a bad idea. Plus, it takes\nquite some time for you to die, too. Chances are, you'll be rescued\nbefore there's even a life-threatening situation. And it doesn't take\nmuch to stop the flow, too, just the touch of a finger? All that'll be\nleft is gonna be a long stretch in rehab and very likely some\npsychiatric treatment also? plus a /really/ messy carpet?or wherever you\nplan to do it?to clean up.\n\nIt sure is not as easy to kill one self as it is shown in movies.\n\nRight on? most people fail.

Always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction.\n       2\\. Always keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot.\n       3\\. Always keep the gun unloaded until ready to use.\n\n    When Using Or Storing A Gun, Always Follow These NRA Rules:\n\n        * Know your target and what is beyond. Be absolutely sure you\n          have identified your target beyond any doubt. Equally\n          important, be aware of the area beyond your target. This means\n          observing your prospective area of fire before you shoot.\n          Never fire in a direction in which there are people or any\n          other potential for mishap. Think first. Shoot second.\n        * Be sure the gun is safe to operate. Just like other tools,\n          guns need regular maintenance to remain operable. Regular\n          cleaning and proper storage are a part of the gun's general\n          upkeep. If there is any question concerning a gun's ability to\n          function, a knowledgeable gunsmith should look at it.\n        * Know how to use the gun safely. Before handling a gun, learn\n          how it operates. Know its basic parts, how to safely open and\n          close the action and remove any ammunition from the gun or\n          magazine. Remember, a gun's mechanical safety device is never\n          foolproof. Nothing can ever replace safe gun handling.\n        * Use only the correct ammunition for your gun. Only BBs,\n          pellets, cartridges or shells designed for a particular gun\n          can be fired safely in that gun. Most guns have the ammunition\n          type stamped on the barrel. Ammunition can be identified by\n          information printed on the box and sometimes stamped on the\n          cartridge. Do not shoot the gun unless you know you have the\n          proper ammunition.\n        * Wear eye and ear protection as appropriate. Guns are loud and\n          the noise can cause hearing damage. They can also emit debris\n          and hot gas that could cause eye injury. For these reasons,\n          shooting glasses and hearing protectors should be worn by\n          shooters and spectators.\n        * Never use alcohol or drugs before or while shooting. Alcohol,\n          as well as any other substance likely to impair normal mental\n          or physical bodily functions, must not be used before or while\n          handling or shooting guns.\n        * Be aware that certain types of guns and many shooting\n          activities require additional safety precautions.\n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: David Richards <mailto:dr@ripco.com>\n Date: 9 Sep 1997 02:43:01 GMT\n\nThe only way to position a _handgun_ to ensure death is to point it\ndirectly at a large group of police officers, preferably of a different\nskin color than yours.\n\nOtherwise, trade it in on a single or double barrel 12-gauge shotgun,\nand spend the extra cash you get from the trade to buy a box of\ndouble-ought buckshot shells and a cheap hacksaw.\n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: anonymous\n Date: Wed, 24 Sep 1997 07:50:08 -0400\n\nThe target is your brain stem and not your brain necessarily.

Enough swelling in the\nbrain (cerebral edema) will have the same effect (death). The latter 2\nprocesses (bleeding and swelling) take time and are potentially\nreversible. The first process namely destruction of the brain stem is\nhopeless or successfull depending upon your perspective.\n\nNow it becomes a simple matter of neuroanatomy to select your spot and\nweapon. I will also base this on being a bad shot as well. If you can\nnot control the weapon or pull away or something a grazing injury or\nworse is possible.\n\nThis is often seen when the gun is placed in the mouth. Shotgun or not\n(and I believe bullets exist which perform like a shotgun shell), if you\nangle too high into the roof of your mouth you can blast through your\nsinuses and eyes or frontal lobe and survive but virtually destroying\nyour face, vision or affect respectively. This is a horrid survival and\nnot uncommon. Now if you aim too low, perhaps deep throating the barrel\nyou will likely miss the brain altogether and if in the midline transect\nyour spinal cord (which could be fatal without intervention) or if to\nthe side various airway soft tissue damage.\n\nTo sucessfully use your mouth as the entrance wound you must aim up\ntoward the brain stem and hopefully blow the back of your skull off.\nThis would be 100%. Once again given enough time and inattention any of\nthese wounds would be fatal from bleeding, swelling, compression or\nsubsequent infection. I vote no for the mouth myself.\n\nThe classic temple shot, that is in the mid-skull at eye level is\nstupid. The most damaging brain structures you will hit are the frontal\nlobes. This is tantamount to a frontal lobotomy, but once again given\nenough time? I have heard of shots missing the brain altogether and\ntaking out both eyes as well. I vote no for the temple.\n\nHow about right in the middle of your forehead to between your eyes.\nThis is better if you can hit the midline stuctures such as the midbrain\nand brain stem. I recalled a homeless person firing a nail gun in\nbetween his eyes with not effect. The nail missed everything and lodged\nin the middle of the brain, so midline brain could be ineffective. I\nvote probable no here too.\n\nSo where? My first choice is behind or directly into one ear aiming\nacross to the other. With a sure hand the vital brain stem will shread.\nYou would not even hear the shot or have time to feel a thing. Likewise\nthe barrel directed into either eye socket and aimed down will\naccomplish the task. The neuroanatomical idea is that these sites follow\nthe respective cranial nerves (optic, auditory) into vital midline\nstructures. I vote yes for this approach.\n\nYou can, of course, miss, or pull away, or just be lucky or unlucky once\nagain, depending on your perspective. A hand grenade in the mouth would\nbe infalllible. One might also consider exploding bullets, etc. (I\nprofess a meager knowledge of guns and ammo.)\n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: Powdered TOAST Man <mailto:s3036712@mpce.mq.edu.au>\n Date: 25 Sep 1997 04:21:55 GMT\n\nFor a shotgun, basically anywhere near your head should do the trick.\nI'd suggest in your open mouth, aiming to go out the top of your head.\nWe've all heard the stories of dudes with revolvers shooting into their\nmouths and ending up piercing their neck, with comparitively little damage.\n\nFor a shotgun, I'd suggest placing the \"butt\" of it on the ground,\nagainst a wall, then sit/kneel in front of it with the barrel in your\nmouth.

I've handled\n.38 semi-automatics with just a four-inch barrel and have gone all over\nthe place on a bullseye because the recoil was so intense. And, in the\nextreme case, there was a terrible incident that happened here in my\ntown about six months ago, where a woman who was training at a firing\nrange experienced a recoil so powerful that she killed somebody by\nactually having her hands with the gun whip over and behind her head.\n\nHowever, I will concede that putting the barrel of the gun in the mouth\nwould palliate the problems of recoil but I was envisioning a\nsingle-handed shot with the muzzle placed at the side of the head.

OTC's is simply not strong enough and fast enough.\nI can not fell asleep for two reasons: the uncomfortableness caused by\nputting the bag on me, and the urge to vomit.\n\nIt is not only when I rip the bag open and waited for the feeling of\nthrowing up to go away did I fell asleep. I could have taken more dosage\nand drink more alchohol but I doubt I can hold it down all in my stomach\nthat way.

OTC's don't work well with the bag because even though they\nare sedatives they aren't strong enough to suppress your response to\nCO_2 build-up in the bag. Even benzodiazepines like halcion, restoril,\nvalium etc don't really work well with the bag for the same reason?\nunless you take a massive dose accompanied by lots of booze. Benzos(and\nalcohol of course) also have a tendency to produce nausea in overdose.\nThe meds that work best with the bag are the barbiturates (secobarbital,\npentobarbital, phenobarbital, etc) because they do directly suppress\nyour brain's response to CO_2 . They are also less likely to induce\nnausea/vomiting.\n\n To: alt.suicide.holiday <news:alt.suicide.holiday>\n From: \"Uncletom\"\n Date: 18 Jul 1997 14:47:19 GMT\n\nPreferably to be carried out on a long, wide stretch of dirt road, with\nplenty of *big* trees in the area.\n\n*Supplies*\n\n        * 500 feet of 3/4\" rope;\n        * Car, with at least a 286-HP 6-banger, with good tires.

If you house has tanks, it is LP Gas. If\n    there is no tank anywhere outside, it is most likely natural gas.\n\n        *Inhalation:* Asphyxiant in high concentrations due to dillution\n        of available oxygen. At excessive vapor concentrations, this\n        product has anæsthetic, asphyxiating properties and may cause\n        sleepiness. At levels above 100,000 ppm, propane is mildly\n        irritating to the respiratory tract and may result in dizziness,\n        headache, drowsiness, nausea, shortness of breath, muscular\n        incoordination, excessive salivation, disorientation, vomiting,\n        and excitation. In extreme cases, convulsions, unconsciousness\n        and death may occur as a result of asphyxiation. \n\n    Most home LP gas stoves have a gas regulator that will not open the\n    gas valve unless the pilot light is lit. If the pilot is lit and gas\n    begins flowing it automatically ignites. If the pilot is not lit,\n    gas won't flow out. It is a safety catch-22 that reduces the\n    possibility for a house filling with gas if the knob is turned on.\n\n    Propane (LP gas) freezes when it is allowed to escape quickly and\n    become a vapor (released from its tank). If you tried to re-route\n    the gas line into yourself, you would be horribly burned by\n    super-cold temperatures. Gas regulators allow it to escape slowly\n    enough under a few pounds of pressure so that the jet doesn't ice up.\n\n    At least this is my rudimentary knowledge and experience with it.\n\n    I recommend abandoning that idea.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*IV.
