The gif part of the website works just fine! However, the audio part does not. The idea is to have looping background music that autoplays alongside the gif, but no matter what I do, I just can't seem to get that working! It's not a problem with my HTML coding skills, as the audio does work when I try publishing the website on the clearnet (I used a free geocities account to testrun that), however when I try to submit the website here on zeronet, you can't hear the audio!Here's the link to the zite I'm trying to create btw: http://127.0.0.1:43110/1GCGN6wcGCqyGRVtAZxcEJ2oge9bCziAKo/If anyone can help me, please let me know!\n\nIt works fine for me. The problem maybe with your browser. I'm on Waterfox.",

ZeroNet is the closest thing I was looking for. Only if this place had more users.\n\nWelp. Could as well just contribute by creating a shitty website while I wait and see what is going to happen next.",
