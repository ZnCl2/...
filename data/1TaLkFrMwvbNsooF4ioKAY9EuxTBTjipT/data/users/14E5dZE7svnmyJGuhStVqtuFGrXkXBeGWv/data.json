Other survey-based studies covering different time-spans find 461,000 total deaths (over 60% of them violent) as of June 2011 (per PLOS Medicine 2013), and 655,000 total deaths (over 90% of them violent) as of June 2006 (per the 2006 Lancet study). Body counts counted at least 110,600 violent deaths as of April 2009 (Associated Press). The Iraq Body Count project documents 185,000–208,000 violent civilian deaths through February 2020 in their table.

Moreover, it emerged that some miscarriages and stillbirths had been wrongly classified as child deaths in 1995.\"[12][40] A 1999 UNICEF report found that 500,000 children died as a result of sanctions,[41] but comprehensive surveys after 2003 failed to find such child mortality rates.[12] A 2017 study in the British Medical Journal described \"the rigging of the 1999 Unicef survey\" as \"an especially masterful fraud\".[12] The three comprehensive surveys conducted since 2003 all found that the child mortality rate in the period 1995-2000 was approximately 40 per 1000, which means that there was no major rise in child mortality in Iraq after sanctions were implemented.[12] \n\nso you will see your children die... yes alex... then you will be feeded them... and on air... again... your stomach full... trash sub trash\n\nand those his little sec team, the buffoon... when it will have to done, you better move, 1, done (warning).",

So you can get I have a serious problem with some jews... sadly, they are just part of something, I have a serious problem with (pedos, nwo, uno take over, plant food war, plants of the creation war, etc).\n\nHowever Rest assured that I fully support the idea and reality of a jewish ethnostate on the land of a defensible Eretz Israel. I know, many hate me for this, I don't care. I love this idea of jews ruling themselves, on their historic (and religious based) land ! \n\nThat's something that make me laugh, because it's sound so incredible to want to achieve, so beyond the ordinary, so full of Will. The will of against all odds to conquer back and rule this land, and it's a nice piece land that you have got there ! And backed by an history confirmed by the phiraos of egypt... I mean ! This tradition must keep on.\n\nSo of course some days, I get very angry with those above enemies (add the bolshevicks neo trans fascists tax horders and public pursue looters...).\n\nNow that it's out of the way...\n\nI think (the wall of worry) : \n\n1. Iron dome worked perfectly against the lost syrian missile... I mean it calculated the destination, no worry, let it pass :), it could have been a nuke however... hard call again :). that's so bad this warfare.\n\n2. the internal intifada (or regime change attempt by biden admin, see below)... as said an ethnostate... so I have an idea... (you see the trouble making already)... it's to expell all muslims from israel, and then, once out, offer a conditional return right... I mean those recent incidents are a clear illustration of the coming demographic struggles. To answer the basic question, who rules this land. I saw for example the rabbi and his assisstant attacked, the mobbing in public transport... it reminded me of France :). my point is that it has to be solved. It's useless to enter this cat and mouse running game. One camp has to be purged, I would say you in medina, without any hesitation, and there, I say them. GO AWAY or die. It's blunt, but look at france trend, or germany, or spain, or italy (more african) but you get the idea... there are no problems of such sort in Japan... \n\n3. Do you oppose the Papal doctrine of Papal supreamcy over all nations of earth, aka where ever the sun shines? I do too !!! I hope you do ! Who the fuck are those people to believe to hold the truth in their decisions and or edicts? For me it's clear, the romans failed miserably like the americans (greed, corruptions, immunities for the corrupt, decay of family values, aka goat fuckers etc) and were smashed by their own wizards having joined the hordes to remove from the face of the earth this civilization having become abomination.\n\n4. the vaxxnazi / vaxxausweiss tyranny... so can you go to the coffee shop to buy thc products without being subjected to those experimental biological procedures? No, my point, I am in the strong camp of natural immunity, some call it the will of God, others natures way, or the creation. Just curious... I still dream to see one day the beach of tel aviv and eat it's famous meat grills while sipping some light alcoholic beverage while enjoying the full spectrum of the plants of the creation of God.\n\n5. another little question, are you taxnazis? I understand the upkeep of conquest and constant warfare is draining on any state finance, but at least it's not a lie, like in many places, will you reduce IDF capabilities to fight plant food? \n\ngood luck and god speed to eretz !\n\ngreat post ! very happy ! (I guess I would be ideologically closer to the so called \"far right\"...\n\nahhh yeah... isn't those protests the begining of regime change by the biden regime? I mean it's a classical problem, they have build a yuge public worker force of regime change agents, they fear to lose their hypergamist whores, as such need income, to get income they need \"public mission\", regime changing israel would be very profitable for them, as creating an eternal war :) (and that's my whole point why muslims should surrender this coast, fully and wholly). It's not worth it to fight a people who for 2000 years sought to return... not worth it, even for Islam :). Lost cause (to oppose).\n\nwhat's funniest in this post? is that the pious, won't be able to read it for a while.... \n\nfrankly this part of your story is tragic... this conquest back is hard, this covid...

I believe that you, specially in the security forces, are able to overcome this plight, by one for some using the same tactics (just not killing jews) but I mean all the social aspect of \"statehood\" while the real extremists, those who have left the yeshivas to join the front lines, I hope, can realize the hope and promise of israel... by this I mean, rememberance of the actual genocide, but more importantly to not let drawn by it, but on the contrary to MIGA ! \n\nwhat I mean is that some jews in the west you could make them live under nazi germany, with a new flag and new costumes, and as long as jews aren't hunted down, they won't be able to recognize it as they can't get past the trauma of the holocaust which they never lived, I mean just the story has already destroyed their weak, and faithweak beings...
