Clean yourself up, get into shape, dress well, and put good vibes out there. Everyone is attracted to someone with a positive trajectory - embody that.\n\nSpot on! You can call it output, confidence or even intention, all of these define the way others perceive you. It's not about faking a personality, it's about natural confidence of action. Do it your way as they say, behave the way you would behave.",
