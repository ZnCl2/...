				"body": "Hello quatum, I'm Dr pijarov:\n I'm glad that you could solve your insomnia without the sleeping pills, those bastards are expensive and generate dependence. I thoroughly recommend you to pracise exercie 6-8hs before going to sleep, for excercise secretes lots of catecolamins that are basically anti-sleep Neurotransmitters(Imagine running in the jungle, escaping from a lion, even though you might be sleepy because the lion woke you up, your body interpretes that signal as a \"WE HAVE TO KEEP ON RUNNING, LIFE DEPENDS ON IT\". Good job on the meditating, everyone should meditate at least some minutes a day. Last, but not least: It is reccomended to not use cellphones or electronic devices for at least an hour before going to sleep(YEAHRIGHT, LIKE IM GOING TO FUCKING DO THAT SHIT). \n\n And congratulations again for not taking the sleeping pills anymore!",
