			"body": "I have played with I2P, Tor and a few others. I like ZeroNet because of it's simplicity. I have tried to give ZeroNet a bit of publicity before 80 people on a LinkedIn profile. \n\nI2P and Tor have a downside in that you have to run a web server to host your files and your computer must always be on. Tor has a large user base.\n\nI hope ZeroNet gets a major boost in the number of those using it. \n\nHow do those who use it give it publicity? Anyone dared to talk about it on Gab or Fascist Book?",
