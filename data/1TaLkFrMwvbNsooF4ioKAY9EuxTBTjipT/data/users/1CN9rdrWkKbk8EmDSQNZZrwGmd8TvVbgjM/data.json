				"body": "> [fondulac](#comment_3_17FTEKfnFVM6XGctStcwZLue3N8BxHbrmz): Notes on config: Don't modify the Whonix gateway. For the fileserver_ip use 10.152.152.11. Enable Tor  always and use Syncronite http://127.0.0.1:43110/15CEFKBRHFfAP9rmL6hhLmHoXrrgmw4B5o/ for your tracker sync. I user Tor as the tracker proxy and have 32/61 trackers connected. In terminal when starting Zeronet use --force_encryption, --download_option auto, --db_mode security, --fix_float_decimals True, --msgpack_purepython True, --stream_downloads True, --use_tempfiles True, --force_encryption, --filesever_ip 10.152.152.11. If it bogs your system down back away from decimals, msgpack, stream, and tempfiles and try again. The form generally is ./ZeroNet-py3/zeronet.py --options --options --options. I wrote this because there is a gap between developers and users. Developers understand the cli so well that they don't explain simple formatting that users generally don't know how to do. Ask questions if you have them and I will try to answer them. Good luck!\n\nA. What does  --fix_float_decimals {True,False} \"Fix content.json modification date float precision on verification (default: False)\" do exactly (for non-coders) ? \nB. What does --db_mode security do ?\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of these options ?",

ISPs also have the ability to see which IP you connect to (which a VPN or TOR can help protect against). The usual stuff basically.  [...]\n\nThanks for all your explanations.",
