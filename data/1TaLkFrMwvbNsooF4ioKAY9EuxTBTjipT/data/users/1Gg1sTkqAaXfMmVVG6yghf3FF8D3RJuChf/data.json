I am sure that happened too in far away roman province, when one proconsul refused or find excuses to not leave his post, most of the time due to income stream problems... \n\nthat's typically when the praetorian guard and those before them had to move the object. It was always fun when the sec team of this forward operator (the proconsul) where faced with those tasked by ROME to remove him, and them if they opposed, which they most of the time didn't...\n\nthey knew, they would killed, traded, or used as actors in some entertainment form :).\n\nand yes I saw the end of keane yesterady, poor man... you know dude, if trump is a pedo, which I highly believe (like 90% certitude), you could have ARRESTED and EXECUTED him, but if it was because this guy wasn't bowing to your authority, he was just following the constitution, and yes, I understand, lazy and greazy state operators may be surprised by the speed required to move in NYC building industry... \n\nDO.\n\nyou have a lot of inner soul searching and thinking to do, yes, you the pedogens who so proudly went on tv during the regime change operations... keane, mattis, the one with his mini suit case, at least odierno didn't fall that low... suckers.",

I mean by this that in the summer it the was the ground forces of obiden in action, you can see it by the level of professionalism and support they got, be it from the msn, or the violence deployed, with the goal of swamping the trump regime.\n\nHowever I have an initiative that could derail their projects... it's called the \"digital town hall project\". the goal is to have by county / city a .onion forum only accessible with torbrowser and a passcode send by mail (a new one each month) to all legal resident, so that they can log, anonymously, and express their opinions in a non censored format, with total free speech, even insult, threats etc, so that their opinions can be first understood, acted, and discussed.\n\nI know that it's the anathema to the projects of the Obiden regime, which only sees us as rocks with legs, that they will mold as serfs for their great utopia. However it's necessary, in the sense that live town halls are great, but due to the nature of oral speech, aren't the most conducive way to handle policies, be it from fear or the simple nature of speech... (one can't speak over the others).\n\nmy 2 cents.\n\nand it would take 10 min to setup for a non moronic it team, there could even be a blueprint quickly made... aka an open source software which directly send even the passcodes... no need to recode 4000 times the same system, unless to create fake work (could use single key keyboard spaced by mile to even increase the head counts of the social staff).\n\nps each user of the same city / county has the same pass, no way to know who is who, the quick question is for them to secure a user name, maybe a second pass that they input themselves? details :)",

I liked particularly the japanese girl who went to Paris, hoping to see french men wearing small caps, carrying their bread sticks, and she ended up in a mix between bamako and marakech.\n\nWhat's the most dramatic is the upkeep that those invaders generate, in the sense that they consume now most of the state funds, and as such reduce the native population to tax cattle to sustain the exponential breeding rate of those invaders.\n\nWhat leads that VIOLENCE is the only way forward, is how they furthermore took FULL control of the justice system to achieve their population replacement and white genocide.\n\nAnd what angers me the most, is that I CAN NOT go to their countries... So they wanted their independence, in reference to the colonial past, very well with me, only the same, from my side.\n\nFundamentally there isn't much difference with Germany, they are just a little bit behind in the replacement / genocide / fiscal ruin... but they have tried the blueprint 1.0... so those who believe they will own and pawn germany forever, may better wake up, before ending in ashes...\n\nThen on the \"our country\", That's debatable, how much do you know YOUR ancestors, rather than the acts and pasts of people who despised, ruled and exploited, those who would have been YOUR ancestors? so you still have a nationalist idealism narrative to handle...\n\nFree speech... but I don't like you as an individual, you are a bad person, maybe like your ancestors...",
