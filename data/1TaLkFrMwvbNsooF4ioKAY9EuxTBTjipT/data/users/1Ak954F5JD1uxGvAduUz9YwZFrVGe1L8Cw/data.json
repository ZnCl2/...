Baal could be used sometimes to describe YHWH because Baal means \"The Lord\", which we use to refer to YHWH.Israelites first only worshiped YHWH, but they fell in Idolatry with Baal and Moloch in contact with Phoenicians (YHWH was added to the pantheon). YHWH is an envious god, so he showed the Israelites and Phoenicians his power, so they would abandon the Idolatry.But they are in no way the same entity, Baal and Moloch were only Demonic Idols.\n\nI agree",
