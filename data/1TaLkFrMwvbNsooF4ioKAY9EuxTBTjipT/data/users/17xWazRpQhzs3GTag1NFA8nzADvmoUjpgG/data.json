I'll just leave this here in case anyone else needs help:\nWhat you have to do is add the providers to the parameter of the certSelect calls in the script. So, change:\n```javascript\nPage.cmd(\"certSelect\", [[\"zeroid.bit\"]]);\n```\nto:\n```javascript\nPage.cmd(\"certSelect\", [[\"zeroid.bit\", \"zeroverse.bit\", \"cryptoid.bit\", \"kaffie.bit\", \"nanasi.bit\"]]);\n```\nThere's three of those calls in ZeroTalk's script.",
