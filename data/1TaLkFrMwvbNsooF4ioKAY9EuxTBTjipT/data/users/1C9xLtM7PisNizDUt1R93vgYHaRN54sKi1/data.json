			"body": "I got a grass trimmer recently that uses a lithium ion battery, but has no information about the capacity of the battery. It says it's 1.5 Amps & 20 Volts.\n\nAccording to https://energyusecalculator.com/watts_volts_amps_ohms.htm\n\n1.5 amps @ 20 volts is 30 watts?\n\nAny idea how to figure out the capacity in mAh using this info?\n\nThank you.",
