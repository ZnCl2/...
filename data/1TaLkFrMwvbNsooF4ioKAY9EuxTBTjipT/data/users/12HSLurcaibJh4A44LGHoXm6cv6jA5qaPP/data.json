I had my first experience with Basic being 11 year old, and started to learn C in 14. But I studied to program not regularly and often abandoned efforts. Last year obtained some XP with Python but not in the proficient level.",

				"body": "Nietzsche wrote about \"will to power\" which is inherent feature of every alive organism. Each biological specie fights for survival, for nutrients, space and reproduction. Tendency to expansion is a key property of biological life.\nSmall population of one specie would occupy the whole surface of this planet if there were not other competing biological species. As our human nature is being also animal and biological so we are driven the same desire of unlimited reproduction and expansion as wild animals. Biological meaning of life is about reproducing your genes and giving birth to healthy offsprings capable to continue your genetic line. We, humans, also tend to gain maxim amount of resources to secure our survival, reproduction and welfare of us and our progenies. \nSo the following motto of our life may be declared: \"Make as many children as you can and fight for resources and living space!\"\nWar is a conflict between nation-states. What nation-state is? It is a political formation made up of millions of human organisms governed by some small group of people called political elite. In some aspects a state is similar to organism: it also tends to expand its influence on the environment and to drain maximal amount of resources from neighborhood. That shouldn't surprise us as a state is built by living organisms so there is a similarity between them.\nAnd like living organisms states often fight for resources and reproduction. \nI may conclude that \"the will to power\" is the answer to your question.",
