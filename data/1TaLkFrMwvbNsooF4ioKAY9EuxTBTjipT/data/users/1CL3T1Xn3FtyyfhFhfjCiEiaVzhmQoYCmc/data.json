			"body": "Idea is to scan all hosted files with multiple anti mallware tools and put the ones found in a block list.\nI wish I could scan images for child abuse but only good service I found is PhotoDNA from Microsoft and you need to be an organisation to apply.\n\nIs it correct that I can only make a blocklist for users or zites? So no individual files? I will have to block depending on the zite being public/private then.\n\nThis is a side project while I'm learning Python so might take a while to implement.\nYou can post related projects/tips here.",
