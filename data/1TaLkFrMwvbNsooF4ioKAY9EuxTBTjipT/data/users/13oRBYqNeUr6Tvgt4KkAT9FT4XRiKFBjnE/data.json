And, of course, sanction everybody who sets up wi-fi access point without registering with children/anti-terrorist/copyright protection registry.\n\nOf course, it may seem to be hard to enforce.

But if capitalism is \"rule of capital\", then p2p is anti-capitalist in its nature (still can be used by capitalism, though).\n\nAs for \"piracy\", it mostly strengthens capitalism (even if it can sometimes ruin someone's business). Even if you are forever ideologically \"pirating\" and will never pay a penny, as long as you spread content and/or your opinion about content, you still help it.\n\nSo paradoxically the best way to oppose IP laws is to stop using and promoting all proprietary content and spread only free culture.\n\n>Sooner or later, however, we will have to accept that money will soon become meaningless, and post-scarcity, technological 'socialism' is inevitable.\n\nNot necessarily. Capitalism is good at enforcing scarcity and most people accept it happily.\n\n>The only reason why socialism has failed in the past is because of this scarcity barrier that still exists, but is slowly beginning to thin out.\n\nIt's not the only reason. If you really want to have one reason, it'd be human stupidity.

But to say \"shouldn't be forced to release for free\", you should first define what does that mean. Because it can be argued that the moment you give someone access to your precious bytes (for whatever price), they're free to do with it what they want.\n\n>Money is a form of voluntary exchange, its not some evil plot to enslave people into doing what someone wants.\n\nIf it is not some evil plot (which seems to be the case), it doesn't make it only a form of voluntary exchange. If you look at history of money, you will notice that apart from being a form of voluntary exchange, it is sometimes a form of involuntary exchange because you're forbidden to use other forms. Then it is used for tracking and taxation (which is in no way voluntary).\n\nBut lets for the sake of argument assume some ideal money, e.g. an ideal cryptocurrency that is considered to be absolutely safe, anonymous and decentralized. Now it seems that we finally have the voluntary exchange and nothing else, right? Again, not necessarily. It now depends on how do you define \"voluntary\".\n\nIf you have enough money, well, you spend them however you like (even if you're influenced by manipulative marketing, but that's another topic). But if you barely have any money to feed yourself and your family? Do you then voluntary spend your last penny on cheap macaroni or do you spend it because the other choice is starvation? Depends on definition.\n\nBut if you consider buying food out of fear to starve voluntary, then what about giving away your money out of fear to have your throat cut?\n\n>(always has been true with Radio, now with YouTube, where you can play as much music as you want, just not all songs ever recorded).\n\nI kinda doubt that's true. I haven't been checking UAs of all the services all the time, but usually you're only allowed to \"consume the content in private as long as it's available on the site\".",

You just win. Game over.\n\nAnd then the government politely asks you to stop using cryptography without a license and cuts you off the internet if you refuse (i'm just imagining some very polite gov; some might simply put you into jail for aiding terrorism, pedophiles and drug dealers).

I can easily imagine that most of currently popular crypto can eventually get broken due to increased computing power and anything beyond that is considered \"aiding terrorism\", because sure enough they'll find real terrorists who use it.\n\n>until you actually end up in a world where having a encrypted conversation with remote peers would be actually illegal\n\nPerhaps there will always be a way to chat with someone you know in encrypted way.

I won't be accusing you of lying, but this clearly shows you're ignorant of the situation in country you claim to be living in.\n\nIf you honestly think [this](https://newsland.com/user/4297807604/content/uchastnitsu-vstrechi-s-navalnym-zaderzhali-za-vozdushnyi-sharik/5993062), [this](https://meduza.io/news/2017/10/31/v-irkutske-biznesmenu-podbrosili-svinuyu-golovu-on-predostavil-ploschadku-dlya-mitinga-navalnogo), [this](http://www.yabloko.ru/regnews/Mosobl/2017/12/19) and [this](https://zona.media/article/2017/12/27/dmitriev) (which are really just random examples; if you're interested in truth, you'll find much more) is a western propaganda, then don't just talk on the forums, try to be opposition yourself and show everybody how easy it is.\n\n>the entire active opposition publicly adheres to the position \"Russia is a good country. But people in Russia are cattle. \"\n\nAgain, you're just citing propaganda. If you'd take a trouble to listen to what Yavlinsky (e.g. [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c_Ats2ifNE)), Sobchak or Navalny actually say, you'd notice these are just blatant lies.\n\n>Probably, we can not convince each other.\n\nAre you even open to be convinced?

When you don't listen to your opponents, it's constructive; when opponents don't agree with you, it's non-constructive. Is that what you call \"critical thinking\" and \"not succumbing to propaganda\"?\n\n>You operate with unsubstantiated slogans of Western propaganda\n\nIf you think that repeating this mantra will make it true, i have a bad news for you. I'm still waiting when you'll point out to me which western propaganda i read/watch/listen. I'm really curious.\n\nAnd, if you analyze your statements a bit deeper, you'll notice that i can say \"you operate with unsubstantiated slogans of kremlin propaganda\" and it will be as unsubstantiated as your claim about me. Which is why i don't say it. Sometimes you simply cite it, sometimes you use the same techniques, but that doesn't mean i should dismiss all your statements as false. Really, the only definite issue with you personally (and not your statements) is that you are overconfident and evade unpleasant statements.\n\n>If you are interested in something specific, as I wrote above, let's discuss.\n\nYou have not answered on any of my statements that are unpleasant to you. I gave you specific links to russian news sites and russian opposition statements and you are ignoring the latter and dismissing the former. I have repeatedly told you that your statements about russian population being more critical and 86% support putin are contradictory and you happily ignored it, instead arguing about whether 86% is actually true or not. You're trying to ignore the facts that you're citing (even if unintended) kremlin propaganda a few statements after you implied you're critical towards it.\n\n>You accuse me of the non-representativeness of the example. But you are doing the same. These are isolated cases that do not reflect the overall picture.\n\n*Any single case* is enough to refute your statement that \"in Russia no one actively suppresses the opposition\". And if you claim to be living in russia and can't be troubled to look up more cases, then you have a problem.\n\n>Moreover, such cases are not exceptional in general world practice. Do you recall the treatment of dissatisfied protesters in the US?\n\nYeah, time to follow the favourite move of kremlin propaganda. If you can't deny something bad about russia, say that everyone does the same. You know what? I don't fucking care. If you want to discuss political oppression in usa, open another thread, give the proofs and discuss it there. And then if you want, open another thread for comparison of russian and western oppression. I don't have unlimited time to go on tangents like this when you prefer to forget your old statements and make new and new claims.\n\n>Believe me, I do not see anywhere else in Russia anywhere else\n\nThat's your problem. You want people to believe you, but you don't want to believe anybody else. You think you're informational god and know the truth and should translate it to the ignorant masses. But that's absurd.\n\n>Can you refute this with concrete facts?\n\nI have no need to refute your perception of the world around you. You're making the claim about 86% and it's your obligation to prove it.\n\n>I communicate on the Internet - except for narrow resources, where the dissatisfied, the general tone of the attitude towards the authorities is about the same.\n\nThat's really laughable. Internet is filled with various troll groups and individuals who have nothing better to do than to post comments like \"putin is god\" or \"putin is shit\". Those masses make the general tone.\n\nOh, and i should probably mention it again. No single person can reasonably assume that by living in some country they know everything about it. If you assume that, you're deceiving yourself.\n\n>This statement is based on a false premise of Putin's unpopularity in Russia :) Therefore, regardless of its truth, according to formal logic, it is meaningless. The meaning of the general implication becomes a lie.\n\nThat's just bullshit. There's no premise about popularity in domitori's statement. The statement literally says \"**if** not enough votes\".\n\nWhat you're trying to do is create a stronger statement \"putin is unpopular in russia **and** he'll not get enough votes **and** votes will be faked\" and then fight with it.\n\nP.S.

However, i haven't seen any research on the real proportion of paid comments (and frankly i'm not sure it is realistically possible to measure it in a provable way), and without that you can't make much damage to that kind of propaganda by mentioning that, because this propaganda thrives on FUD.\n\n>From the western perspective, the Putin is actually a good thing, a nice, rational, actor, because if Putin were not the Czar, then the Czar would probably be Chechen president,\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Kadyrov is used as a threat to the west, but the probability is extremely low. If nothing else, FSB wouldn't let him.\n\n>Basically, the current Russian culture is that in Russia\n>NOBODY OWNS ANYTHING, except the Czar.\n\nThat's a comfortable cliche that can be used to explain everything, but there is also a counter-cliche that \"the czar is a myth\". The kind of myth (so the theory goes) that is beneficial to the government as a whole. Like, an almost literal message of inner propaganda says \"the tsar is good, it's the boyars who are bad\".\n\nWhile both theories can explain anything, it seems unreasonable to attach super-human qualities to a human. With everything taken into account, it seems more plausible that the government is based on \"elite\" consensus and inter-\"elite\" fights (that does not necessarily mean that the system can survive without Putin, but his role is limited to consolidating (not strictly ruling or owning) \"elite\" in this theory). But it is also nothing more than a model, possibly useful in some cases and useless in others.\n\nIt seems that almost everyone (of those who speak up, that is) has their perfect theory and believe in it because it is smarter than some alternative. But if one theory is wrong, it doesn't make the other automatically right. And when you don't understand something, it's better to admit it than simply assume that whatever you see as best available explanation is actually true.\n\n>There is no such thing as IQ.\n\nThere kinda is.

I really like the cited quote of Yours and the idea that the oligarchs need Putin as a jointly recognized judge to avoid killing each other. I also agree with the statement that if I self recognize that I do not understand X, then it's smarter of me to use the answer \"I do not know X\", \"X is unknown to me\", but I also believe that physicists, who were not aware of the Albert Einstein theory of relativity and only considered the Newtonian theory in their calculations, did nothing wrong by using the Newtonian theory everywhere. There has to be \"big enough\" of a difference between the experiment results and calculations to start thinking that may be there is something wrong with the calculations. I do not live in Russia, so from my perspective what I described fits and I see Your theories only as complementary, supporting, theories that can be totally true at the same time while my \"theory\" holds. [...]\n\nYeah, of course, no theory is perfect, but we still might consider them \"somewhat true\". It's just that we should remember that our knowledge is imperfect.\n\nAs for what they should or could do and how smart they are.. Well, to assess smartness by observable results you first need to know their goal hierarchy. If their goal would be building strong economy, then they are clearly doing a miserable job at that and thus can be considered stupid. But if their goal is personal riches and keeping power, then they are successful enough.\n\nAs far as i can see, it is not only a matter of utility smartness (some seem to be smart enough), but more of a world view issue of oligarchs, bureaucrats and siloviks. In short, they want total control and are afraid of risk to the absurd degree. Thus they are building \"the power vertical\" by hiring dumb loyal people and dumbing those subordinates that are not obedient enough (or throwing them out in various ways).\n\nWhich means that yes, the \"power vertical\" is very ineffective and dumb system. But as for the higher ups, i'm not sure how much are they stupid (well, some are certainly are) and how much do they simply have different goals.\n\n..Sorry, not really interested in going into more details.

For most typical 0net usecases, important data sent to network by js is user-inputted text and timestamps. I can't imagine fully reliable way to control that text written to 0net file is equal to user-inputted text (although it is possible to detect any non-printable characters and inject simple random changes in order to make it even harder to come up with working scheme), but checking timestamp mongering is relatively easy as last few digits can be safely rewritten in all non-rt tasks where only user actions lead to data being sent.\n\nOf course, even more protection can be implemented by checking data changes before signing them. There might be valid usecases which cannot be dealt with this way, but if you care about privacy you can stop using those web apps or at the very least sandbox them more strictly (depends on your reasons to stay anonymous).\n\nThis probably won't guarantee that no bits of fingerprinting ever slip past your radar. But it can lower transmission rate and depending on goals of surveillance and your goals, can make such leaks impractical to use (in other words, have very low success probability).\n\nAs for marking js source url, it serves two purposes. First, one can automatically check whether the script on page matches source code; then, one can analyze source code for hidden features and possible vulnerabilities.\n\nAbout tor DNS leaks: it seems that unfortunately tor devs do not make it especially easy to find relevant information, but there seems to be options to mitigate dns leaks: [transparent proxy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy), [socks proxy faq entry](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#WarningsAboutSOCKSandDNSInformationLeaks).",

As far as i understand it (and i encourage you not to take my word for it), \"capitalism\" is/was usually used to describe some existing social system. \"Communism\" on the other hand is/was usually used to describe a non-yet-existent ideal society.\n\nJust from that, we can see that saying \"We've seen the extreme of one or both\" is not a universally correct statement (it is correct with some substitutions, but incorrect with others, *no less valid* ones).\n\nNow lets consider words \"capitalis**t**\" and \"communis**t**\" (as noun-adjectives, referring to persons here; not just adjective describing certain aspects of a system), which seem to be usually implied when people talk about these -isms. First thing that you notice (which follows from aforementioned categorical distinction between \"capitalism\" and \"communism\" words) is that \"capitalist\" might mean \"a high-ranking rich individual in capitalistic system\" or \"a proponent of capitalistic ideology\", while \"communist\" usually refers only to proponents of ideology because there's no communist society and *there would be no high-ranking individuals if it would exist*.\n\nSelf-proclaimed proponents of certain ideology, however, might say completely different things and even go at war with one another, which is why at best a correct statement about \"communists\" might be something like \"*most self-proclaimed communists i've met are* scum or stupid\". Same goes for capitalism proponents. As for \"capitalists\" as high-ranking individuals, this is a bit more objective category, but even then all you can definitely say would be statistical. For example, \"capitalistic system tends to work in a way that scum gets privileged\" or \"capitalistic system tends to make people who succeed in it morally bad\", etc.\n\nI hope that's enough to make you consider that many -isms have way too much meanings and using them in some \"mainstream way\" leads to supporting such mainstream ideology and can be source of miscommunication, leading to useless arguments, holywars and even irl violence.",

What would you consider to be a group? One could say that humanity is threatened and oppressed (which is certainly not easy to deny) and start a war against oppressors. Then again, what exactly is \"threatened\" and \"oppressed\"?\n\n***\n\nI think that while it might be true that ultimately no war is justified (what is war, again?), we should still differentiate between more and less justified wars.\n\nFor example, no vengeance killing is ultimately justified. Consider the act of killing someone who just killed someone else. The only way to attach *absolute* moral value to it is to call it unacceptable. Which means that you also are unjustified in killing them. And if you attach *relative* moral value to the act and still kill them, then you should expect others being as *relatively* justified as you were.\n\nBasically, everyone who takes up arms should be prepared to die *by someone acting ethically in their understanding of situation*.\n\nDoes that mean that no one should take up arms? That's debatable. If you're being *directly* threatened to be killed and didn't kill anyone yet, the case for killing in self-defence seems to be quite strong.\n\nThe main point is of course that anything you do is your responsibility. Joining armed forces and making an oath is your responsibility. Following orders is your responsibility. Giving orders is your responsibility.\n\nAny authority system wants to make an illusion of taking away freedom and thus responsibility so that everyone obeys the orders and the system works.",

What do you think I should do about this? Should I just keep the word in English? I don't fluently speak any other languages besides English, so I want to get the translations as understandable and good as possible.\n\nThe global problem with localization (and especially special term translations) is that there are at least two categories of people using it: those who know or are learning english on one hand and those who do not and will not on the other. For those who communicate with the global community (or have to use some other unlocalized software) it is of course easier when the terms are minimally translated (transliterated or kept as is).\n\nI obviously can't speak for those who don't ;) But apparently some want to keep their language clear from anglicisms (and sometimes other influences as well..) and translate everything they can find a word for. And i have an impression that there's a bias in that these people are doing more translations.\n\nSo in the end, any translation decision can make some people unhappy.\n\nAs for specifically \"merger\", even when i try to ignore my \"non-translation\" bias, i still don't see much point in hurriedly localizing word that has no translation tradition. 0net dev community seems to be quite small and non-english dev communities even smaller if exist at all. Arguably, merger feature is something that non-developers should also be aware of, but localized word in the interface is not going to make that happen.\n\nIf i would be making decision for localization into a language i don't know, i would probably ask translators to give usage examples of their translations.

He later died in a car crash due to not wearing a seatbelt so all in all, not a guy I would suggest modeling your life or world views after even if he was a genius when it came to mathematics.\n\nRegardless of the truthfullness of conclusions/your initial statement, your argument is somewhat fallacious. It might be considered sound (though not necessarily true) that \"modeling your life or world views after\" \"certain person who died due to not wearing seatbelt\", but you also imply (without any sound proofs) that everybody who applies \"game theory to human interaction\" is following John Nash. While it may be vacuously true from historical point of view, it certainly isn't from the everyday logic (it may also be especially useless if someone would point to most likely existed person who did the similar (not necessarily called the same) thing before Nash). I'm pretty sure that most (but, in any case, at least some) people apply game theory to human interaction without any knowledge of who Nash is or what he thought and how his views developed.\n\nYour sentiment might be somewhat effective towards people who consider \"paranoid Schizophrenia Nash\" to be god for some reason; it can also be somewhat affecting people who consider Nash to be relevant to the point or just highly authoritative. But there are a lot of people (i wouldn't even start guessing how much at this point) who **don't care about ideas' so-called *initial authors* whatsoever**.\n\nIf anything, by providing a fallacious argument to an idea, you're at the same time providing an (also fallacious) counter-argument to it.: How ever stupid the idea of applying game theory to human interaction might be, denying it out only because \"some John Nash was suffering and died\" is no smarter, to say the least.",

If you're ready to be discussing ideas per se, you don't need additional context for the argument per se. Most people, however, hold some opinions without basing them on any reliable evidence or sound arguments. (This is especially prominent in political \"discussions\"). In these cases it might be better for a person to consider that if they disagree with someone on one point, they should look deeper into those points that they do agree (kinda cliche situation is when nationalists have friends from the \"wrong\" nationality, but are very reluctant to put their basic dogmas to doubt).\n\nSo, essentially, author's biography cannot be argument for or against generic idea, but it can be an argument to further investigate opposing opinion.\n\nIt should be also noted, though, that further investigation shouldn't be limited to idea at hand. Returning to initial game theory / John Nash example, it might be also useful to contemplate whether the aforementioned facts of his biography should even be considered as bad.\n\n>Newton got his theory of gravity wrong.\n\n>Neither an appeal to authority (in the case of Newton)\n\nI could be missing something, but didn't you just appeal to authority of modern science in order to show problems of Newton's authority?\n\nAlso, i'm not sure \"wrong\" is correct here anyway.

Not really? I'm not claiming any authority figure as my source, but rather the discoveries made regarding the validity of relativity since his time.

But what's the way forward? If nofish does not listen to you, it seems the only option is to fork (it doesn't have to be \"hard fork\", either). I think you're wasting too much energy on trying to convince people \"development should be decentralized\". If nofish is inattentive towards reasonable PRs, other developers who experience this would likely join you. As long as there's compatibility, users will be able to switch easily if they feel need. And then the plugins already make 0net not fully compatible across users, which means that another variation wouldn't even make much difference\n\nFinally, forking would allow fixing issues like \"default sites list\" which are unlikely to ever get approved even if nofish manages development better otherwise\n\n(Personally, i don't think much of current 0net code should be kept in the future. I would rewrite most (if not all) of it from scratch, maintaining compatibility via conversion mechanism rather than keeping all the mess internally; unfortunately, i don't have time/energy/motivation to do that alone, and it doesn't seem like there are any other developers interested in doing things the way i think is best.

It's ripe for abuse and being exploited in many ways as we speak.  Hate speech laws are redundant to existing laws and not worth the exploits.  If someone harasses or assaults another its already illegal. Creating special protected groups the government can then use this to \"goat\" the citizens against one another.  We have an abusive relationship with our government. They are like the worse parents ever. They starve us, punish us, make silly rules, and play favorites. Never give up free speech if you are so fortunate to have it.  Hate speech laws are a bad joke and not needed.\n\nAbusing of laws or even abusive laws doesn't have much with meaning of the words.
