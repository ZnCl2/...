Another important point to consider is that zeronet allow the creation of torrent communities that cannot be shut down, and because of this it will be very useful against DMCA takedowns of torrent sites on clearnet. When big torrent communities will arrive here also zeronet will grow! :) (piracy is more tollerated by people than pedos and racist...)",
