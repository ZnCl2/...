				"body": "I think the majority is waiting for anime waifus to become real via AI and holographic technology. That way, they can cycle through a playlist of waifus a few times a week in case their dick cannot wait for their waifu to finish updating. Though seriously, 100 years down the road and some lucky kid post-apocalypse who manages to pick up an old computer out of a swamp could read all this and wonder, what the hell went wrong with these people? They skirted the surface of their lives, chasing pleasantries, endless sex and and the next season of Game of Thrones. Feeling good is by far and away the most popular religion of America and damned be those who even try to heal their pain. But some of us are still out there, waiting. Love has an intelligence beyond our own puny minds. \n\nIf you're that kid, then know this: we are all hurt and in pain, deep down and most unable to risk getting hurt again. Unable to love, we skate on shallow ice looking for the next thrill ignoring the growing cracks. Without love, society falls apart into a spiral of hedonism that only becomes faster and more insane the closer it reaches the bottom. Live from your heart, and don't make the same mistakes we did.",

				"body": "Actually, physical world is an illusion as the senses measured by the brain were calibrated to a certain sensitivity which does not encompass everything nature has to offer. It doesn't mean that's all there is to smells or touch or sight. Dogs smell way better than we do and mantis shrimp see 5 more colors than us, whatever those colors are. Their biology is adjusted to receive and experience all of that. So every species experiences reality very differently. This is not even mentioning holographic universe theory...whoops\n\nWhy waste life being scared of death until, you know, death? \n\nWhen I sleep, I am glad to leave the dense physical world full of illusions behind for a time. Reality is way beyond that.",

				"body": "Except that consent can be withdrawn at any time unless he/she/entity agrees to be recorded at any time, which is unlikely. More and more treating sex like a business agreement, and soon you'll have to file papers just to get a blowjob: one to consent having pants removed, another to grant permission for exterior party to use genitals, another to consent.....aaaaand so on. And all of this is legal process in a court of law, so if he/she/entity withdraws consent to pull down the pants, the other party can sue them in court for failing to do so. \"Man sues woman from reneging on pants removal agreement.\" Those headlines would be everywhere, may as well make a small classifieds-like section and fine print the crap. \n\nYou know, love is not a commodity to be taken and counted and measured. It is not something that can be bought or sold. You can do that to human bodies and it happens all the time, but love is something that is made over time. And human instruments cannot measure something that it cannot yet understand. They are too stuck in their theorems, too proud to change old theories to match current observations of reality. Too stuck in the modicum of \"control everything outside of me absolutely.\" But I suppose if people are too scared of love, people won't try to measure it and instead fly back to some fake reality to indulge in. \n\nOh, and sexism is tongue and cheek for \"males aren't feminine enough.\"  Porn is a massive tool for social control and has worked extremely well for those people that have the first letter of K, though I don't know how well that flies on ZeroNet.",
