[...]\n\nFrom what I see they are several version of them cause cool dev let the code open. The last update I see come from 2018. Kopykate run fine in this state, the issue is they aren't content worse hosting and more people publish than host. U can seed video u find interesting, u can find a button for that before cooking on a video. \nFor me the official one is this one tell me if I'm wrong. \nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/big.kopykate.bit/\nU can also find missing feature that s maybe why it doesn't have a big traffic. But the basics works great and it s quite impressive. Delete it all and try this video. It s quite popular so u should have good speed to dl it. For me the whole is launch in 10sec and doesn't stop until the end. Just put the limit size at 100mb\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/big.kopykate.bit/?Video=1541884826_1J58Rie679DVSuKB1iDyFFTbzmaMaY2bt2",

Personally I find it stupid to have the power to discuss with somebody across the world and talk about politics where most things that make sense make sense for one country and not another and people seems desperate to have an intellectual win on the subject communism/facism bad. I would rather have a picture from their dog or garden than their political opinion. I will add that with zeronet u don't have to see what u don't like just add to your block list people where u can't have dialogue and you r good to go. That s maybe why they're not an orientation more than another. 90% of people aren't into politics and will just block everything that extreme on a side or another ",
