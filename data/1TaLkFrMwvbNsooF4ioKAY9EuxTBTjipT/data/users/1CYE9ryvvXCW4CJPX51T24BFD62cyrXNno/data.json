			"body": "I know some of you might have tried Aether in the past, around a year ago; however, there have been major improvements since then, making it noticeably faster and more stable. It's far more active nowadays, as well.\n\nIn summary, it is a reddit clone on top of a P2P flood network with ephemeral content (anything older than 6 months is removed).\n\nLink (clearnet): https://getaether.net.\n\nTo everyone who wants to try it out: see you there!",
