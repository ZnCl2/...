Export your Chrome bookmarks than purge that as well. Delete Facebook especially all the Facebook apps.

This is not ideal, but better than nothing.\n\nI use Outlook with https://www.gpg4win.org/ for PGP email signing and encrypting on my system.\n\nFor Thunderbird also check out TorBirdy: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy",

Mastodon is complicated and can turn shitty very quickly depending on the instance you've joined because a lot of SJW type people left twitter for Mastodon.
