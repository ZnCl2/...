The problem is how we distribute the resources. Giving that power to an algorithm sounds scary.\n\nBut I think our current situation is worse. There is a system making those decisions, but is a Dumb system! It is just mostly random and power concentration driven.\nMaybe a system that can take people needs into account will be an improvement.\n\nBesides this system would not be centralized (Venus project make clear that the picture of the main computer controlling everything is just a bad metaphor).\n\nI depict a distributed system, more efficient. Where small groups of people or even individuals can manage the basic needs of energy and food thanks to technology, without relying on any kind of grid.\n\nOn real world implementations I love this one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn",
