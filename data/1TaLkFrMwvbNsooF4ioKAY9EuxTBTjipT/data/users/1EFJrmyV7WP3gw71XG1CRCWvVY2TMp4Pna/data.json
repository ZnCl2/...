I propose that we start using the algorithms of these websites against them to redpill the unwashed masses. Here's how it works\n\nReddit:\n1.) Find posts that are gaining traction.\n2.) Write a comment that is popular with the narrative, ideally funny.\n3.) After becoming one of the top comments edit your post to reflect how you really feel.\n4.) Watch as other normies then agree with your real opinion simply because you have updoots.\n\nYoutube:\n1.) Find propaganda Channels: I.e Vox, CNN, Bloomberg.\n2.) Click the bell to be alerted of new videos.\n3.) On new videos write a comment that is popular with the narrative, ideally funny.\n4.) After becoming one of the top comments edit your post to reflect how you really feel.\n5.) Watch as other normies then agree with your real opinion simply because you have updoots.\n\nIdeally edit your post to contain facts to inform and shape peoples opinions instead of 'lul fuck niggers'.\n\nAlso before you say this won't work on reddit, reddit moderation watches new comments coming in on posts as opposed to edited meaning this will go under the radar.",

				"body": "People like OP think science is just some set in stone ideology that always agrees with them rather than the constantly changing process that it is. If science was always correct and we never questioned it, we would still believe in things like alchemy and turning silver into gold rather than building particle accelerators, going to the moon, inventing the internet and smartphones, etc. I think it's fair to say that the Atheist/skeptic movement of old has been hijacked by brainless SJW shitlibs who insist that you listen to their list of dogmas, rather than old school atheist skeptics like Richard Dawkins or Hitchens who insist that every authority should be questioned and held to account, and that societal dogmas must be broken by empiricism.\n\nlike Christopher Hitchens literally did an entire segment empirically proving why women are not funny and Dawkins has said many times that tranny surgeries and giving HRT to kids is unhealthy, that shit would NEVER fly with the modern day circlejerking reddit \"I FUCKING LOVE SCIENCE\" types like OP\n\nScience and academia are now starting to more closely resemble an ideology than the constantly evolving processes and institutions that they are meant to be, and that is EXTREMELY dangerous for fields who's main goal is supposed to be searching for the truth no matter the cost. It's no wonder why there is a massive replication crisis when major scientific journals are publishing pieces talking about radical ideological causes like the nature rights movement and prioritizing \"diversity of black trans midgets in wheelchairs in the academics\" over the search for the ultimate truth that their field is supposed to be engaged in.\n\nWhat's really ironic about people like OP is they will insist that you trust the science and say things like \"heh studies show that liberals and leftists are shown to have higher IQs!\" Then when you bring up racial IQ studies and the bell curve they will immediately flip to \"NOOOOOOOO THAT DOESNT COUNT IQ IS PSEUDO SCIENCE ITS RACIALLY BIASED TOWARDS MUH HECKIN POCS!!!!\"\n\nBTW just a friendly reminder that this is an experimetal vaccine technology unlike any other vaccine we have used in history and it has never been used before to cure diseases or viruses, you are willingly participating in one of the largest clinical trials in world history for a vaccine that hasn't even yet been approved by the FDA and doesn't even protect you from getting covid, let alone the fact that lots of CDC officials are refusing to take it. So much for \"muh science\" though amirite OP?",

You are not being inoculated with an inactivated virus which would allow your body to create a normal immune response. Instead, your cells get a recipe to create only one particular component of the virus, the spike protein. This applies to both the mRNA and virus vector shots. How long will your cells continue to churn out spike proteins? Who knows? Will it result in Antibody Enhanced Disease? For some people, it looks like it already has. Again, we're not being offered a vaccine here. We're being coerced to participate in a mammoth medical experiment. [...]\n\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BUT THIS IS PSEUDOSCIENCE SNOPES SAID SO!!!!!!!!!!!\"",
