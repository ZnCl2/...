From what I've read online, I need to add that header to the responding file..?  Some differences with the help online is that I think it is being treated as a local file, and also zeronet uses an iframe.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

I feel the basics are missing from it and I'm in the deep end.\nI've tried using an ajax key, CORS plugin, fileGet.  No success.  I'm not proficient enough with JavaScript  to work it out.\nAlso, I'm not sure what is meant by a gigabyte being too much...the site is less than 1MB..?  It will end up being a few hundred MB of required files, with a table of several millions entries if I can get this to work.",
