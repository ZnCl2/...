You can also make your own ZeroNet site (quickly & easily) without having to worry about finding (and paying) a host, because just by having ZeroNet turned on, we are all helping each other out with hosting and getting sites and files: we don't depend on companies doing it for us (for a price: either our money or our privacy).  [...]\n\nThat was a really nice and concise summary, thank you!",
