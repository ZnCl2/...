			"body": "We'd like to share our Proof-of-Concept #3 release of the NEW Zeronet Explorer mobile application.\n\nGrab it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/d14na/zeronet-explorer/releases\n\nGrab it on the Play Store\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zer0net\n\nScreenshots\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ug4rI3C\n\nFYI - Working on F-Droid and Torrent seeding the APK now\n----------\n\nPLEASE NOTE: \nWe are having an issue with serving local (downloaded) files on Android (almost certain its a React Native bug), so this app currently \"cheats\" by using one of our EU proxy servers. It works as expected on iOS (NO ZeroFrame support yet -- will be in the MVP release next month), and hopefully our recent submission gets approved (fingers crossed) by the Gods of Cupertino. \n\nWhile we address this Android issue, please send us your feedback (no matter how critical) and let us know what features you'd like to see in addition to just the zite browser. eg. Crypto (btc, eth) wallets are coming next and BitMessage support is on the way.\n\nMORE SOCIAL LINKS:\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeronetExplorer\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ZeronetExplorer\n\nCheers!\nD14na",

				"body": "> When i create zeroid thru your proxy, other users will be able to use it too?\n@ssdifnskdjfnsdjk yeah, so you were right, it looks like the ids are stored on the server in users.json, so its probably not a good idea to signin to the proxy. \n\nperhaps we'll figure out a way to deal with that. moving the key client-side would seem the most obvious solution, but I'm sure there were reasons for storing it on the server.",

Our issue is bandwidth and DDoS protection. Once we solve the DDoS issue with our new host, then we'll scale to also support the necessary bandwidth.\n\nAs mentioned early, we are developing a project now to handle filtering of illegal content. As long as its NOT illegal we will happily seed it. Keep in mind some content is illegal in certain jurisdictions (think GFW), in which case our Geo-Filters will ONLY apply when Zeronet Explorer is used WITHIN those jurisdictions.",

I won't get into the technical details right here, but its absolutely a WIN-WIN for everyone. All that's missing are the right TOOLS to help them make the migration. With the new \"quality\" content that DApps can bring to the Zeronet, I'm very confident you'll see a significant boost in overall users/seeders.",

There is currently NO ETA, as we have a few other priorities that need to happen first. As soon as we have a final roadmap to launch, I'll post an update.",
