LOL. Most I know want less government control and a fair playing field for all businesses. They want big corporations control and monopolies in the field of business gone. Hence letting the free market decide things. We as consumers have to be diligent enough to help in this by using our dollars as voting mechanisms. We vote the bad actors out buy not buying their products. This takes effort and I'm afraid it's more effort than the average person is willing to expend IMHO.",
