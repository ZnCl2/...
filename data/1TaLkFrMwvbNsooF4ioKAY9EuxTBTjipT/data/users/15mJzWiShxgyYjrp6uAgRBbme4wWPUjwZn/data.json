And those roots destroyed many countries years ago. America has a leader with a spine and big dick under him. Putin and Trump by far best leaders in the 21st century - Nationalist. They understand each other. Liberals and left wing democrats fail to realize - Republicans are willing to go to war and kill others for their political views and to protect their ways of life. The ways of life established by forefathers.",
