They're usually both on the same module and all you have to do is pry off the frame of your screen and unplug the wires. Blocking the camera alone isn't enough when you can still be listened on.\n\nNowaday lot's of hardware chip are designed with DRM and silly stuff , making sure you can get appropriated hardwares , disabling what is possible in your bios, appropriate operating system and setting always help",
