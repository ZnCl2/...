Like any respectable end of the year, it is again time for evaluations. End of the year balances are mostly political rather than financial for us, although we cannot deny that we will, as always, ask you to support us economically.\n\nTwenty years ago nobody did what we do. And even today nobody does it the way we do it. This is important to remember because 20 years of work to keep our project alive and functional, relying\nEXCLUSIVELY on the efforts of the volunteers involved and the spontaneous donations from our users deserve special attention.\n\nToday is very easy to obtain an e-mail address or the space to host a website for free, and we know that mailing lists are mostly replaced by the millions of group chats provided by the various instant\nmessaging platforms. But we think that today it is much more difficult to find a free space where is possible to organize alternatives to the existing.\n\n# Without alternative places there are no alternative thoughts, without spaces where it is possible to practice other ways of living, organize and imagine different worlds, it is not possible to change the existing one.\n\nhttps://cavallette.noblogs.org/2020/12/9646",

Some stumbled to the ground. People on the scene were being stepped on due to the chaos. The police separated the firefighters and first-aid personnel from the protesters as firefighters and first-aid workers were providing assistance. They also refused the press access to the scene. Police officers arrested individuals who attempted to rescue and provided assistance to the protesters. However, they did not provide aid to the injured protesters. Police officers attacked reporters with pepper spray, hindering and preventing reporters from filming.\n\nKong Wing Cheung, Senior Superintendent of the Police Public Relations Branch, said at a press conference this afternoon that he had not received any reports of \"human stampede\" in the dispersal operation in Yau Ma Tei yesterday. The police's arguments obviously deviate from the truth. In fact, the situation last night was a #stampede and 31 people were injured and hospitalized in the process where 16 of them were classified as serious cases. Whether frontline police officers lied or the Police Public Relations Branch lied is irrelevant. Either way, the intention is to dilute the situation in order to escape responsibility. This act is shameful and the public cannot and should not accept this.\n\nhttps://t.me/guardiansofhongkong/11898\n\nSource: USP United Social Press",

Ever since early June this year millions of Hong Kongers have used various peaceful and non-violent means, including but not limited to marches and demonstrations, to convey to the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the world our firm and reasoned commitment to safeguard our freedom. \n\nSome protesters have even risked everything, including their personal safety, to occupy the Legislative Council Building. Within roughly one month, a few brothers and sisters have sacrificed their own lives, hoping to give a much-needed wake-up call to the conscience of those in power and arouse the compassion of their fellow citizens. Sadly, all these sacrifices have only met with the government’s cruel disregard and the Chief Executive’s repeated refusal to retract the widely opposed Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill.\n\nWhat is even more unforgivable is the government’s tactic of sustaining their disregard, which is to let the police abuse protesters in every march and demonstration with unjustifiable excessive force, resulting in injuries of many. Meanwhile, the Chief Executive, high-ranking government officers and pro-establishment lawmakers have all refused to address the people’s demands, imagining that political problems can be solved by assaulting citizens and viewing the people as their enemies.\n\nToday, we reiterate our five demands to the Hong Kong SAR government. We demand [them] to:\n \n1. Withdraw without any ambiguity the Fugitive Offenders (Amendment) Bill, in order to officially terminate the legislative procedure of the Bill;\n \n2. Withdraw the characterisation of the June 12th conflict as a riot;\n \n3. Dismiss all charges already made against all citizens who protested [against] the Fugitive Offenders (Amendment) Bill, and guarantee that no further charges will be made against protesters because of these incidents;\n \n4. Set up an independent commission of inquiry to conduct an impartial investigation into the police’s abuses of power; and\n \n5. Dissolve the Legislative Council with an executive order, and immediately implement genuine universal suffrage with direct elections for both the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council.\n \nWe love Hong Kong dearly, and we do not wish to see another drop of blood shed [while] protecting our homeland, let alone another precious life lost. Yet, and let us stress this, there are no violent protesters or rioters, there is only tyranny. We will protect our homeland by any means. We urge the government to stop leading Hong Kong towards the brink of destruction and work together with the people to bring our city back to the path of a united, democratic, free and just society.\n\nhttps://t.me/guardiansofhongkong/244",
