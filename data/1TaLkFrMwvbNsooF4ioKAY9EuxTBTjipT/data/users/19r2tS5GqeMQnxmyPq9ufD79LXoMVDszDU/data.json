Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future, similar in its appearance to the Ancient Egyptians, will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals. [...] \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_von_Coudenhove-Kalergi#Views_on_race_and_religion\n\nHe was himself mixed-race which might explain his hatred for the European people while (almost) worshiping the Jewish people.",

And Article 13 and 11 will be passed into law this month by the European Union and will shutdown many, many platforms, they will of course leave some platforms which distract and please the masses with their entertainment and porn but the truthful information and any opposition to the EU will be shutdown immediately, under the guise of Copyright protection.\n\nSo yeah, people will likely look for alternative methods of communications that are less likely to be censored, though ZeroNet has many flaws unfortunately that have been left unaddressed for far too long.",
