				"body": "God is quite a big topic, there are many forms and interpretations of \"god\"  many things in this question really depends or your beliefs and biases, god i believe is an abstract concept, one of which as been molded and reshaped to fit whatever one may call this word for. fro example for the ones who believe in any form of a higher power god may come in the for of being a transcendent being, or a panentheistic entity, or a poses (there are many many more) however for me i do not believe in such and i am grounded to material sciences and believe the term \"god\" to be a placeholder tern for a currently(whenever that may be at the time eg. 3000 years ago or now) inexplicable event, for now it is impossible to trace our origins back to the very beginning and answer the questions like what led to us and this universe to existing ect. so i personally use the term \"god\" to fill in those inexpiable questions for otherwise leading to an infallible argument in a vicious cycle. however when it comes to a spicific question on weather i am religions, i am simply and agnostic atheist as i do not have any form of evidence but yet i still belive that a higher power does not exist.",
