				"body": "Android IS Linux. If you want to remove commercial/spyware android, then you have two options:\n\n1- Ubuntu. Such as Ubuntu Touch.\nYou can buy phones with Ubuntu Touch already installed on them:https://ubports.com/devices/promoted-devices\n\n2- ASOP (Android Open Source Project). Such as LineageOS, Resurrection Remix.\n2.1- LineageOS: https://lineageos.org/\n2.2: Resurrection Remix: https://resurrectionremix.com/\n\nYou can install these OS yourself on some specific models. My favorite is Ubuntu Touch, because it is a real Ubuntu, just on a phone. It doesn't even feel like a phone anymore. I've used plenty of ASOP. Such as Resurrection Remix, which is excellent. No more Google bloatware.\n\n3- If you want a secure phone out of the box, there are plenty of options, and by definition none of them will run anything Google.\n3.1- Bittium: https://toughmobile2.bittium.com/c/\t\n3.2- Librem 5: https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/\n3.3- Blackphone: https://www.blackphone.co.uk/\n3.4- XOR: https://xorinc.uk/app/pages/home\n3.5- ClearPhone: https://www.clearcellular.org/clearphone",

				"body": "> [flyingtotoro](#comment_8_1CL3T1Xn3FtyyfhFhfjCiEiaVzhmQoYCmc): I am using the Fairphone and I love it! Easy to repair, long life and gives you a lot of options for what OS you want to run.I am slowly going from 'Google Android' to 'LineageOS Android' (with some Google apps) to hopefully Ubuntu Touch soon when I found alternatives for some convenient everyday apps. [...]\n\nIf Ubuntu Touch can make Snap work, then any Ubuntu app can work on Ubuntu Touch. It would become the world's largest app store. It's a shame app developers don't port their apps onto Ubuntu Touch, this would help a great deal people adopt this OS, which is by far the best when it comes to privacy, if you put aside the specialised devices that are sold at over $1000.",
