But Nekololi's right, the centralized nature of the site made it pozzed by design.\n\nDecentralized social media can't be cucked the way gab was. \n\nMaybe some form of social media could use a form of bridge between ZeroMe and activitypub, That'd be cool. Or even activitypub on ZeroNet. \n\nPoint is, there are ways to make decentralized social media. Let's make it happen.",
