			"title": "I honestly believe a ZeroNet site like Start.me with maybe some enhancements would be awesome.",
			"body": "I've talked about a need for a site like this in the past. Startpages somewhat resemble the Start menu, quick launchers, homescreens, desktops, docks, etc. It's why I've used shortcut creators. This is the second best option or possibly even better.\n\nThe familiarity of them is very pleasant. A great amount of functionality in one place is very convenient.\n\nHere's my public startpage. I can add notes, newsfeeds and widgets too. The site is pretty easy to use and has many options, but it doesn't mean it can't be improved in some way, such as more widgets, fewer or no clicks to make some changes and including side swiping. https://start.me/p/OmDJn6/public-startpage\n\nBeing able to share and import widgets, newsfeeds, categories and shortcuts to/from other users or adding your own allows better exposure of sites and applications just because the interface is favorable to use for quite a few people. It's a very comfortable, welcoming place to start.\n\nA notification panel would be icing on the cake.\n\nThe only problem would be if a ZeroNet clone of the site has fewer features than ZeroHello. We wouldn't call an alternative interface home if it's lacking in features.\n\nThe idea might not make sense to you, but there's a reason why most operating systems, desktop environments and launchers have some familiarity in appearance and function to others.\n\nI hope it's easy if you try accomplishing this. A little change in user experience can go a long way.\n\nImagine if you could add widgets for popular ZeroNet sites, \nhaving everything right there. Music, videos, making new posts and quickly replying, chatting, sharing files, writing notes, making reminders, planning routes and testing web code, none of that opening and switching tabs unless you really have to.\n\nI think you'll find a lot of people liking whatever becomes of your ZeroNet alternative to Start.me.",

			"title": "Not all Trans People Want to Imprison you for Misgendering Them",
			"body": "I think it's absolutely absurd and plays perfectly into the idea that we're all insane: A BuzzFeed video of people identifying by genders other than what they're assigned at birth saying at one moment \"You can't see my gender\" and the next moment saying \"Misgendering should be illegal.\" 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️\n\n*Yeah. Right. Let's Imprison people who make honest mistakes or aren't used to calling someone by their preferred pronouns yet.* See how well that goes. You'd be sending countless kind people to prison. 300 million people are fair game, huh?\n\nNot ridiculous enough? Consider that there is a growing list of abstract, conditional, subjective, fictionally-based, poorly defined and even redundant \"genders.\" And look, I won't say how many there really are that actually make sense (I'm not here to say how many), but it's looking like the idea is there's an unlimited number. Let's brainstorm what that would mean. If you're plotting your gender on a line, a 2D shape or a 3D shape (Fuck. Let's go with 11 dimensions [M-theory FTW, right?]), there are too many to expect anyone to know (How many fucking axis or combinations would there be? Do any of these SJWs know combination theory, that thing that says there are several quintillion arrangements of a Rubik's cube?), and on top of that, it's looking like people are defining themselves entirely by gender (not character traits nor throwing normativities/stereotypes to the wind).\n\nMost LGBTQ (not LMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ alpha beta centaur dragon elf fairy gargoyle whatever) and their allies agree with me. We actually agree with the meme \"DID YOU JUST ASSUME MY GENDER\" being a worthy ridicule of the insanity and not transphobic, but a trans woman going by Heather who looks like a guy is becoming very famous in gaming journalism and disagrees, says it's transphobic, completely misses the point. People look at Heather as the authority on the topic. If other LGBTQ so much as make a reasonable objection, a fucking category 5 shitcane hits shore.\n\nI don't pass either. Miss me with that phobia shit.\n\nThe self contradiction by SJWs is only deepening hatred of the LGBTQ and intersex (hermaphrodite). Just imagine being born intersex and being placed dead center of this bullshit.\n\nAnyway, if ever I see a bill trying to make misgendering illegal, I will do everything I can to stop it and will call upon my friends to follow. The aposematic drama queens will not have their day ever.\n\nI'm not happy either that everyone's afraid of offending me. If you're going to feel like shit for making an honest mistake, something is very wrong with SJWs, not you. They've bullied you. Do you not see that?",

			"body": "This is an API that accesses the WiFi controller of a **supporting** device to automatically mesh with other devices **also supporting it** and running the same application (the applications need to use the API). Energy is saved by synchronizing all of these devices to seek one another during the same second(s) of every minute. The finer details I don't remember.\n\nWould an Android developer please add [this code](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/wifi-aware) to ZeroNet-Kivy? https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-kivy\n\nYou need a device that supports the feature at the hardware level and running Android 8.0+, so don't expect everyone to benefit. If you're a known Android developer and need two supporting devices to test this on, maybe we can fund you to cover the cost.\n\nLocal Peer Discovery I believe will allow ZeroNet to work with this API once the API is implemented in ZeroNet-Kivy (again, with two or more devices that support WiFi Aware). LPD works with tethering, so that's why I think this will extend to WiFi Aware.",

			"title": "Authoritarianism in Discourse",
			"body": "You've probably thought of me as an authority on transgender or US political issues, but that's problematic.\n\nThe reason I say this is simple. If you're making someone an authority on any issues, you're turning off your critical thinking skills and leaving the reasoning up to a few. Perfectly logical thinkers are hard to come by. Consistency is hard to come by. The absence of these needs to be called out.\n\nSure, I may be right on a few things, but if I'm not called out and corrected where I'm wrong, I'll continue to be wrong and others will think that lack of counterarguments means I'm right.\n\nThis is what happens with televangelists, pundits, nationalities, ethnic backgrounds, sexualities and anything on a TV, in a book or on a computer in general, especially where fame, titles and associations are concerned. Sometimes people think even a website or PDF means the author knows all. The loudest or most vocal get so many nods without much reason if any. Brains get shut off because people think they can leave it up to one person to get everything correct. Humans naturally operate and progress on independent rationality and ideas. Authority is the antithetical approach. Even science is full of scientists testing other scientists' ideas. It doesn't always take a scientist to make a correct assertion on the validity of statements in science, though reasoning is demanded and for good reason. It can come down to mathematics, observations and pointing out both inconsistent ideas and unforseen ramifications.\n\nIf you're both empathetic and knowledgeable, you may have proper reasoning to disagree or agree on many things and that's good. The problem is when the arguments are left to so few to discuss issues. Bias, oversight and general mistakes are hard to avoid. Only more voices can put ideas to the tests that they require to be validated or disproven.\n\nSay, for instance, the fact that I've reasoned how you couldn't change the past if you could ever perform \"backward time travel.\" At best, if it's even remotely possible, you'd create a separate timeline, not destroy nor overwrite the original. So, sorry to say, but if you stop your long dead dog from being hit by that car on that fateful day and you take your dog with you, you'd be dognapping from the alternate timeline version of yourself. It wasn't really your dog. Your version of that dog is still dead. Your timeline still has the past events of your version being dead. You can't prevent injuries to yourself that have already taken place either. Your spine will still be fucked up from that car accident five years ago. It seems that it took a few self-described scientists too long to figure that out while a few others were on the mark, but you may dare figure out why I might be wrong and possibly persuade me.\n\nI don't agree with every transgender person and not every transgender person agrees with me, plus not everyone who shares a label with you shares every idea nor sentiment with you, so there's room for outsiders to enter the conversation, plus I think it's obvious that nobody can assume they're always right and go on scott-free, though personal bias will often let them think that they can.\n\nI don't like people just rolling with what I say. I myself may keep thinking of why I might be wrong in order to refine my perspectives, and in the end might wish someone had corrected me sooner. Quite a few people change their minds in a similar pursuit to not live through their last days alive as a moron. Whether asked for or not, your critical thinking might be more desperately needed than you think. And yes, even the stubborn and in denial people need to be called out. That can be done so without shaming them.\n\nJust don't approach this with guilt-tripping, anger nor threats as those stop the flow of ideas in their tracks. Appeal to the part of the person's brain you seek to correct. Keep emotions out of it, as those are often temporary and fade with the idea tied to it. The appeal needs to be lasting, if you are to take your position seriously. Do consider that people might not see the flaws in their ideas, so don't be hard on them as that plays into guilt-tripping. Don't give them the idea that you're a nasty person, as that's all they will know of your interaction with them, not the idea you intended to get across.\n\nQuestion everything, motivations, and everyone's \"authority.\" That is your right.",

			"body": "Whatever file you want to share to people with restricted internet access or share to mirror leaks or videos at risk of disappearing, tell people exactly how you downloaded it (where from exactly, what quality, etc.) , what the file name has to be and which folder to move it to. Everyone's copy of the file needs the same checksum. Since I've done this with BitTorrent many years ago, I've finally figured \"Why not try this with ZeroNet?\" If the file is very large and your upload bandwidth is terrible, you need to give this a try.\n\nHere's an example request: http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1oranGeS2xsKZ4jVsu9SVttzgkYXu4k9v/16NS3rBdW9zpLmLSQoD8nLTtNVsRFtVBhd/1536629576\n\nWithout taking this shortcut, it's fat chance or an agonizingly long wait before you become a seeder of Big Buck Bunny.webm. I don't have the means to try the other method of creating multiple seeding nodes on other people's internet connections, but the shortcut I want us to try as described in the first paragraph is far more doable while the file is already on the clearnet with high bandwidth. You don't have to do this for Big Buck Bunny.webm. We can do this for another very large file that is perhaps more important.\n\nComment here if you need us to become seeders with this shortcut. You probably should include a checksum of the file.",

My recommendation is bumping up text a lighter gray unless background colors are made darker, but darker background color makes anything else with a hue of color more intense, so it doesn't always work as well unless the color channels are bumped closer together in value. Example: The deep blue text on kxovid is fine in the light theme, but it's way too intense on the dark theme, making it hard to read. Bumping up red and green, maybe bumping down blue too, will help.\n\nIf I'm given a template theme, I will retheme sites with obsession over clarity, balanced pop (in other words, no pop), and eye strain.

			"body": "I was kind of surprised for no reason other than ZeroMux being the first solution to big files to find that big files are added very simply since ZeroNet was updated for them, so I guess overcomplicating ZeroNet can be common. I saw some other threads and started feeling completely sure this was the case that people are intimidated by the unknown, which explains some things.\n\nYou want your site accessible via TOR? That's built into ZeroNet's backend. ZeroNet sites don't use .onion addresses. There's nothing you have to do there.\n\nAre you worried about signing taking longer and longer the more files you add? Don't be.\n\nWhat kind of site do you want? We will show you a site or two that might closely match your needs. Clone it. Your new site will be under Owned Sites on ZeroHello. Copy the alphanumeric string in the address bar or link address for that site, paste it on: http://127.0.0.1:43110/1LtvsjbtQ2tY7SCtCZzC4KhErqEK3bXD4n/ then submit.\n\nStart editing customizations you want into the text files of your site's folder (it's in the data folder with the alphanumeric string for the name). Changes made to CSS, JS and COFFEE files within your site's folder might not show in the browser unless you clear the browser's cache or append\n\n**?v=*AnyNewVersionNumberYouDesire***\n\n after the file name before the closing \" of the file's URL inside the HTML document.\n\nPeople recommend saving older versions of these files in a .git folder with revision numbering in the names. Also do that with content.json if you edit something you're not sure will end well.\n\nSome time had passed since you entered the alphanumeric string on New 0net Sites, so you might see the peer number had risen. You can sign and publish from the sidebar now, which you'll do by dragging left the 0 button to open the sidebar and see the \"Sign and publish\" button. Click it. Share the URL. Congrats!\n\nI've had a very slow start, but I've received some help and learned common but not obvious things eventually, mostly general web development not specific to ZeroNet, but they were very simple. The biggest help was from this community. You will take off much faster/smoother with more people who had the same problems before you, so fret not. It's all newbie stuff you'll get through very quickly.",

			"body": "I created this site initially for showing off local peer discovery. If LPD works as good as day one, then on a mesh network you would see the benefits of both mesh networks and ZeroNet. Streaming 4K is not very common yet because all around the world there are people who can't get that quality of broadband.\n\nAnd then, as people ask how ZeroNet works and how to create a site, I've plugged it in consistently to demonstrate relative ease for getting such a site started, which might be of great help if the other media sharing sites leave you dissatisfied.\n\nI sincerely do not give a damn if you use any of Kave's code nor reuse the name. It's the world's least original name. I want you to have that liberty. All code is function, not personal property. I've told you how to passively extract algae oil and how to make silver snow (I know I repeat myself a *lot*) instead of work toward a patent if that was even possible. I don't like the idea of IP that much.\n\nMy expectation is that if you're an amateur, you can make something that works for you so you don't have to wait on someone else to fix it, and if you're well rounded in web development then you can adapt the code for a public-contributing site. The irony is the appreciation doesn't match the use. There's only appreciation and a few things extra wanted from me (I'm not experienced and there are a few things I'm waiting upon to feel encouraged to do more).\n\nOverall, it's a quick and fairly effective solution to KopyKate and IFS, if you're not fine with ZeroUp and clones. I'm trying to give this to you. I can't own it. I've been helped, helped to create a site for you, if you really do need it. It was effectively by the community for the community from the get-go.\n\nShould I document my somewhat impoverished life and hammer in your head my humbleness?\n\nIt's okay if you laugh or facepalm. I really thought something great would become of it, and I'm buzzed on alcohol, so of course a mini rant would happen.\n\n#Please take this thing if you want to and do whatever you want!\n\nIt's like the fruit cake of ZeroNet.

On 4Kave, Big Buck Bunny was fully downloaded from a peer, but the video will not play more than five seconds. Before, it played in entirety and I've checked this weekly over many months. Corruption did not happen on my device but on a peer's device. Firefox says the file is corrupted and the only confirmation I needed to know is that two entirely different browsers, Chrome and Firefox, both cannot play the video.\n\nPossibly it's unchecked file decay on someone's storage or memory, corrupted packet, or manipulation. More likely than not, it's one of the former two, but we can't eliminate the third possibility entirely and we can't pretend this can't happen, because the corrupted video exists now on my device... unless the BigFile plugin is buggy. The bad piece isn't being detected and rejected by ZeroNet automatically. So... files have a shelf life on ZeroNet if they're going to decay like this unchecked.\n\nAdd the fact that I cannot repair the file with an original copy but delete it, its associated files and its content.json entry, then I have to sign again, leaving me no confidence that peers will remain due to arbitrary salting of the file checksum with FS data. Seed repair is needed, but not possible yet.\n\nI refuse to add IPFS as a separate client software dependency, otherwise the purpose of the site is defeated. Extra dependencies that have to be installed by the user with expectation of reduced privacy is an adoption sin, anyway.\n\nI will be researching PubSub, tempted to migrate away entirely if IPFS closes the dynamic web and ease of use gap it has with ZeroNet.\n\nI'm not angry, but this still doesn't sit well with me.",

The NSA for instance threatens the very programmers whose software we rely on when they can. Whenever they are in reach.\n\nThat doesn't mean that Google is not terrible or that it's not evil, but centralization is the vector of evil for which these companies become infected.\n\nThis is why we sometimes support small businesses, barter, or buy off the black market for a few things. Maybe some of us are purists because we don't want to feed the problem, and that's good. That's also very difficult. I'm probably not one of them, although I try as you might.\n\nAnyway the point is that maybe we need to not look at this as an economics problem but look at this as a structural problem, because money does exist for compensation of goods and services. How many more solutions to money can there be? I think but do not hope that we've run out of ideas there.\n\nYou can't destroy that which is defective such as the structure of society, but if you have the better solution, I think Darwinism could favor it.\n\nYou don't have to operate within its rules, but you do have to prove the worth of a new system and it has to be executed and it has to be on the ground running and it has to be infectious and it has to be nothing but good. Constructive, not destructive. Most importantly, unstoppable. The icing on the cake is to very casually dodge the law and/or normalize the solution.\n\nEventually the superior system could occupy and squeeze out the inferior system.\n\nAlso, I don't think we're going to stop censorship reaching an absolute maximum. It's still worth trying to resist in my mind because I'm not a defeatist, but isn't that starting to look a little subjective at best what defeatism is with the way things are going, downhill, very consistently headed there? Plan B, for whatever problems needs to be executed at the same time as plan A or preferred. We need to stop just asking permission to thrive as decent human beings.\n\nThis is why ZeroNet was invented. Tamas cannot rely on those greedy know-nothing politicians in Hungary or anywhere bossing and taxing everything to hell with the threat of prison or death. It takes a secret society to run a government doesn't it? So why would anyone rely on them?\n\nIt's the same reason why you don't ask a thief to watch your house while you're on vacation. There is little to nothing that you can get from asking the petty for anything. You don't expect change from them. You know that they are hardwired to always subvert you.\n\nSo what we have to do is to never rely on begging mercy. Begging is not how wars are won. I do believe the top 1% of the 1% is at war with the rest of us.\n\nI believe your illness could be much easier to treat or cure than the doctors tell you.\n\nI believe in making sexual predators fear for their lives and I won't apologize.\n\nI believe you could pave these roads for a fuckton less than what's coming out of your paycheck right now. \n\nYou should always call the shots. Don't ask permission to thrive.\n\nAnd yes, sometimes that means that you have to have your own arms. Nobody will protect you. Even the police have no obligation to save your life and it is known historical and legal fact.\n\nI don't get in trouble for the things that I do because there is plenty of nuance, but online I could have done better.

What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.\n\n**Don’t Make Assumptions** – Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.\n\n**Always Do Your Best** – Your best is going to change from moment to moment. It will be different when you are healthy as opposed to when you are sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.\n\n**Be Skeptical, But Learn to Listen** – Don’t believe yourself or anybody else.

It can also interfere with prescriptions working properly due to change in metabolic rate, I believe. It can be easily overdone if you're not careful. In great excess, it can make you feel like you're dying. It has an LD50, meaning there's a point at which it can kill you.\n\nCBD: Use for physical ailments and anxiety, but maybe preferably before bedtime as it can cause premature sleep if used too early, throwing off circadian rhythm. It may make your brain dependent for a few days for sleep aid. Use just enough.\n\nTHC: Can exacerbate anxiety if you have it. I understand it's medically useful and can give you deep inspiration for humor and fiction, but I don't know everything it's useful for. What I know is that your worries will multiply in intensity.\n\nAlcohol (Okay, maybe that can be considered a hard drug as it's not really medically useful. I'm skeptical of pro-wine propaganda): Just bad for mental health, can make you mistakenly miss a former date that wasn't good for you, and can cause angered rumination of the past. Obviously it deteriorates your body, brain and your DNA, contributing to cancer risk. Shortening your lifespan isn't cool. Whatever you thought about it making you socially acceptable is in context of unhealthy friendships.\n\nNicotine: Only useful when your lifestyle is already problematic for anxiety control. It's really bad for your heart. Supposedly in a small amount it's protective, but research this. Don't take my word on usefulness as advice, but with a grain of salt.\n\nE-cigs: Glycerin makes nicotine more addictive as it's a sugar.\n\nMelatonin: It's in natural cherry flavoring as it comes from cherry tree bark. Watch out for this as it can guarantee you fall asleep with even one can of beer, which is absolutely dangerous for non-buzzed light drinking before driving. I'd be wary of even an artificial fostering as it may unintentionally analogous to melatonin (that's just a guess to consider, knowing there are pharmaceutical analogues to mint, for instance).\n\nPsilocybin: Don't take with juice unless you really want to trip, doing something unusual. Otherwise it's a great medicine. Goes great with cannabis. It can be critically beneficial for PTSD and coping with terminal illness.\n\nDon't trust just anyone giving you street (black market) drugs especially if they have access to your body in any capacity. Perverts will lace any of these with date rape drugs that incapacitate you from escape, puts your health at risk when this happens. Treat all dealers with maximal suspicion. Worst case scenario is meth laced in, ruining your life and moral values.\n\nAnd while I'm at it: \"All these things need to be respected\" is the main summary of this post. All but alcohol should be treated like medicine. The abuse of the useful ones works against you. Use them when they're needed.",

A little fact here is there's some correlation between MtF transsexuals and autism. Not a lot, but some.

The website was bombarded with traffic that overwhelmed its servers, rendering it inaccessible.\n\nIn response, 8chan switched to BitMitigate, a cyber-protection service owned by a web hosting company called Epik.\n\nBitMitigate also provided protection to the neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer.\n\nBut then BitMitigate itself was driven offline.\n\nBoth Epik and BitMitigate relied on infrastructure provided by another company, Voxility.\n\nAnd Voxility decided to remove Epik and BitMitigate from its network.\n\n\"Hate speech is totally against our service policy,\" a spokeswoman told BBC News.\n\n\"This is a firm stand from Voxility... we all should work for a safer internet,\" she said.\n\nWhere will users go?\nOne 8chan admin said he was working to increase the site's availability on the dark web, although users will need the right software and know-how to access 8chan this way.\n\nMr Watkins said he was working to get 8chan back online but being driven offline had \"forced a lot of people to find other places to talk\".\n\nSome users migrated to the Reddit-inspired message board Voat, although this website also faced DDoS attacks on Tuesday and disabled account registration.\n\nIn his video, Mr Watkins acknowledged Cloudflare and Voxility were private companies entitled to reject his custom.\n\nBut his supporters say moves to \"de-platform\" controversial websites will further efforts to decentralise the internet.\n\nThe controversial social network Gab has already made moves in this direction.\n\nGab describes itself as a platform for free speech and has become popular with neo-Nazis and far-right personalities banned from sites such as Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAnd the company has made the code that powers its platform open source, so anybody can take it and host their own version of Gab.\n\nThere are also projects such as ZeroNet, which is designed to decentralise web hosting.\n\nInstead of storing information on a web server, ZeroNet shares data among thousands of users - similar to the way films are shared via torrents.\n\nA copycat version of 8chan has already appeared on ZeroNet. And in theory any messages posted cannot be removed by administrators or law enforcement, because the content is shared across so many different devices",

Do you ever find compromise? Do you slowly integrate your foliage to be less disruptive? I think maybe I'll have to remove the ground litter that came with the moss if I am to reintegrate it.\n\nBullet points:\n• Not all grass can be mowed, so cover it with moss.\n• Not all areas can grow grass, so cover them with moss.\n• Not all areas are weeded, so cover those with moss.\n• Moss makes great erosion control at the end of rain spouts.\n\nI'm glad that I never bought any. I've foraged for it all. I don't want to put it back where I've found it just yet. I also don't want to risk it dying.\n\nIt's bullshit. I'm kind of pissed and would rather find a new place to live if I can't put my green thumb into this apartment. I envy Japan because their culture is in favor of what I do.\n\nI don't know why people allow lawn-policing. You should be able to pretty-up your own space, especially with many pros to it if you have a list of them.\n\nFirst world problems, yes, but I think you deserve some freedom there as much as I feel I do.",

			"body": "Everything you need, Google and/or Facebook has.\n\nThe reason why DuckDuck Go doesn't replace them is because those companies provide more features or services under one hood/site.\n\nBut, I agree that no company should dominate in every area. The problem is that these services from different companies don't seem to have an API to communicate together and unify under one dashboard, customized and shared from geeks to grandparents, or if they do, they don't seem to aim for users to custom-package dashboards.\n\nSo, I'm getting my baseball bat for this dead horse (the previous threads might be deleted anyway):\n\nStart.me is the closest to this solution that I've seen. You can customize and share a dashboard, but I think ZeroNet could do it better.\n\nZeroNet might never actually be a threat to these companies, but a small key advantage ZeroNet has is that there are no passwords and the same account is useful across multiple services. With Google and Facebook, it's one to two accounts. Your family doesn't want to create another account only to forget the password later on, and password managers aren't exactly graceful solutions. That's one of ZeroNet's greatest strengths.\n\nIF ZeroNet is to come close to becoming a threat to Google and Facebook, I think there would have to be something like Start.me, everything under one hood/page.\n\nBut let's not forget that safe browsing practices are important. I wouldn't encourage the tech-retarded to join ZeroNet. They'll invent some unheard of headache for you to suffer through. I don't know if you can really guarantee a carefree browsing experience for them, and they probably would expect that, so ZeroNet might remain as something mainly for activists, geeks and nerds, not by its own doing, but because some people will never fully understand how it's different from the clearnet. The plebeian needs analogies for every god damned thing to do with computers, and good luck figuring out how to compare ZeroNet to fields of wheat, because half of your family is stuck in the bronze age, believing a man walked on water, a donkey and a bush spoke to humans, that witchcraft is real, that sodomy created a giant butthole made of moisture known as Hurricane Katrina, that Russia stole your socks and Trump is colluding with gnomes.\n\nYeah, we don't need them all, but maybe something like the concepts of a customizable, combined services web dashboard will draw in more of the right people. Just remember that simplicity and familiarity are very important in interface design. Simplicity should come first, then falling back on familiarity if you can't make it simple enough.\n\nI keep mentioning these points periodically because I study why these companies are massively popular, and brainstorm how to compete with them without repeating what created these monstrous, duopolistic corporations.\n\nThose are my trusty old opinions.\n\nWhether ZeroNet can or can't do this is not up to me since I'm not that skilled, but I'm glad to impart some deep thought on the subject and possibly encourage further innovation.",

You don't find yourself rooting for Arthur as you don't really feel his pain, what much there is. There was something bad in his past not portrayed in the film, but more so the plot takes a turn in the present of the film's setting, so you don't see his childhood and that seems a bit insignificant in contrast to the present with violent thugs jumping him.\n\nIt's difficult to identify with Arthur because most of what you see is someone who doesn't get much respect from a few peers and is jumped a few times. Arthur is quite intact with the outside world even if he doesn't seem to all be there. He starts murdering people. It's maybe a bit darker than I expected, but in contrast to what little you see happen to him, you'd probably feel the same. I expected Arthur to be relatable with his frustration at society. The movie kind of escalates by Arthur's own doing. There isn't a goal in the plot, just seeing what made Arthur the Joker, and as violent as some scenes are, it doesn't push you in any direction. You're just watching Arthur become a murderer, basically.\n\nI have found myself more immersed into the movie Drive, which is about as violent if not gorier, but has you caring for the characters and worried for them. Drive has a clear plot and stronger motivations.\n\nIt's like Fight Club in a sense but lacking in what pushes the character over the edge, both emotionally and in what is portrayed.\n\nI'm the kind of person who would likely relate with a very realistic Joker.

The 5G scaredy cats don't. I didn't run out of breath from it.\n\nGiven enough power, any frequency stopped by an object could cook said object, but radio is regulated to safe frequencies and power levels. I'm more worried about leaving the LED torch on while wearing black jeans. That LED will cook your skin if left shining directly on your black jeans.\n\nAnd, what worries me for sure is not 5G, but UV rays pouring through the sometimes gaping hole in the ozone layer, which you can actually see on rare occasion occurring. Heck, I think chrome paint should be banned so I don't have to sit in a car with a dozen mini reflections of the sun beaming at my eyes.\n\nWhen it comes to David Icke and Alex Jones, they become really vague when they reach the point in their rants that's beyond the present, so I think they're just parroting nonsense but don't realize it.\n\nEdit: Now I'm a bit concerned over what I've seen in MouthyBuddha's documentary about 5G.

			"body": "Universal Smart Video format was an idea by Daniell Mesquita (a pedantic nutter whose not around here anymore) to build in features like those of YouTube into the videos themselves. It's a great idea, but it's not complete.\n\nOne other idea I would add to this is intro deduplication and then some.\n\nWhat I mean is that every video a career YouTuber makes has at least one intro that's used in multiple videos. So, the idea is to make the intro a video by itself paired to the content videos. The reasons this would be great to see with P2P technology is simple:\n\n1) Smaller video sizes.\n2) The content video can be prefetched while the intro plays, virtually eliminating delays that P2P technology often has with videos.\n3) Outros could be deduplicated too, as they usually end with the same music and animations, from one episode to the next.\n\nEven if USV isn't actualized, both ZeroNet and the Clearnet could benefit from this idea. Intro and outro clip-stitching to content videos could be implemented site-side.\n\nI believe this feature, as insignificant a it may seem, would save on data transfer and time enough that something like ZeroNet would benefit in user experience.\n\nIt's just as likely that nobody would ever implement this feature, but it had been on my mind long enough that I had to mention it someday.",

You might be next if you've created anything important here.\n\nJust know that all cexy says about Nofish and other people is pure lies and false insinuation. Cexy isn't an idiot, but the first persistent shill on ZeroNet. I was wrong to think this person would show mental issues and turn out a misguided normie. The burden isn't on me to disprove cexy's fabrications.\n\nThe lemmings can walk off a cliff if nothing will help them see who's who clearly. Cexy contributes nothing to ZeroNet. Remember that. I want ZeroNet to be safer for all, not a safe space. Fuck safe spaces.\n\nMOAB is fully commented now and without any mystery to it, in response to recent comments about it. I know I could have done better sooner. The community made me stick with its original goals when this single bipolar admin (me) became very annoyed at a few people being idiots. You can tell me what you don't like about it and I will likely change it accordingly. You can try to wear me down as a shill or hateful moron, but I know it's a test and I have a promise to keep on MOAB.\n\nIf you're not satisfied with what I do, then fine. It's not forced upon you.\n\nI'm bored, I'm a neet most of the time, but also astounded by how some people jump to conclusions like meth heads do. I'm seeking employment so I'm not stuck here hoping for ZeroNet friends to fill my time. Everyone needs a career and I lack one. Thanks for the motivation for self-improvement, at least. This steam the few try to make can be used to run engines, ya get me?",

			"title": "Joe Biden Wants To Destroy Free Speech on Social Media",
			"body": "https://reason.com/2020/01/17/joe-biden-wants-to-destroy-free-speech-on-social-media/\n\nBiden tells the New York Times he would revoke Section 230 protections and hold Facebook (and other sites) liable for their content.\n\nERIC BOEHM | 1.17.2020 3:00 PM\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times' editorial board, former Vice President Joe Biden made his most stringent call yet for cracking down on free speech on the internet.\n\nAfter being asked by the Times about previous comments Biden has made regarding Facebook's refusal to remove negative ads targeting his campaign, the Democratic front-runner attacked both the social media platform and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n\"I've never been a fan of Facebook,\" Biden says. \"I've never been a big Zuckerberg fan, I think he's a real problem.\"\n\n\nBiden and Facebook have been feuding for months, as Reason has previously covered. In an October letter to Facebook, Biden's campaign called on the social media site to reject political ads containing \"previously debunked content\"—like a Trump campaign ad linking Biden and his son, Hunter, to corruption in Ukraine. Shortly afterwards, Zuckerberg said the company's policies were \"grounded in Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.\"\n\nThat hasn't sat well with Biden. In a CNN town hall event in November, Biden said he would be willing to rewrite the rules for all online platforms in order to force social media companies to \"be more socially conscious.\"\n\nIn this week's interview with the Times, Biden has gone a step further. Now he's calling for revoking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996—a snippet of federal law that's generally regarded as the internet's First Amendment, since it protects online platforms from being legally liable for content produced and posted by third parties.\n\n\n\"Section 230 should be revoked, immediately should be revoked, number one. For Zuckerberg and other platforms,\" says Biden.\n\nWhen the Times' Charlie Warzel points out that Section 230 is \"pretty foundational\" to the modern internet, Biden takes his personal disagreement with Zuckerberg and blows it up into a policy that would destroy free speech for all internet users.\n\n\"That's right. Exactly right. And it should be revoked. It should be revoked because it is not merely an internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they know to be false, and we should be setting standards not unlike the Europeans are doing relative to privacy,\" Biden says. \"You guys still have editors. I'm sitting with them. Not a joke. There is no editorial impact at all on Facebook. None. None whatsoever. It's irresponsible. It's totally irresponsible.\"\n\nBiden goes on to say that both Zuckerberg and Facebook should be held civilly liable for false information posted on the platform, and even leaves open the possibility that Zuckerberg could somehow be held criminally liable. All of this, Biden says, is because Facebook ran \"Russian ads\" during the last presidential campaign.\n\nThose ads were comically bad and had a negligible impact on the outcome of the 2016 election. What would significantly impact the future of American democracy and society would be the elimination of Section 230 protections for the entire internet.\n\nBut if you look back at Biden's long political career, it's not too surprising that Biden is willing to take overly broad federal action that will surely have unintended consequences.\n\nIt's not that Biden has been an opponent of free speech in meatspace or online. (He even voted for the Communications Decency Act when it passed the Senate back in 1996.) But Biden has a long history of jumping aboard the political bandwagons created by moral panics, pushing policy to expand the government's power to deal with perceived threats.\n\nAs I detailed in a Reason feature last month, Biden was instrumental in passing a 1984 anti-drug law that effectively created the modern civil asset forfeiture system which has been regularly abused by law enforcement to seize cash, cars, homes, and other valuables from individuals who are often never charged with a crime. In 1986, Biden co-sponsored the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, spurred by a moral panic over several high-profile deaths caused by cocaine. The bill added more mandatory minimum sentences for federal drug crimes, including the provision requiring a five-year prison term for anyone convicted of possessing 5 grams of crack cocaine or 500 grams of powdered cocaine. That massive discrepancy \"unjustly and disproportionately\" penalized African Americans and poor communities, the American Civil Liberties Union said in a 2006 report on the law.\n\nLater, he co-sponsored a 1988 law that bolstered prison sentences for drug possession crimes and established the Office of National Drug Control Policy, effectively creating an internal lobbying organization to defend the drug war against critics.\n\nMost famously, Biden championed the 1994 crime bill and its harsh \"three-strikes\" rule, which imposed life sentences for anyone convicted of a violent felony if they had two prior offenses on their record—including drug crimes.\n\nYou see echoes of that same playbook in his attacks on social media companies. To Biden, sweeping penalties are the only way to stop what he sees as a crisis—consequences be damned.\n\nTo pass those crime bills, Biden worked closely with Republicans. Even in today's era of heightened partisanship, Biden touts his ability and history of working across the aisle as a chief virtue. So there is good reason to worry about a President Biden finding common cause with Republicans like Sen. Josh Hawley (R–Mo.) to repeal Section 230.\n\nDecades later, it's now obvious that the anti-drug policies of the 1980s and 1990s have had disastrous consequences for many Americans—especially minorities, who have been particularly victimized by the arbitrary crack/powder distinction Biden once pushed—and have filled prisons with nonviolent offenders.\n\nRevoking or rewriting Section 230 would be similarly bad. Free speech online has given voice to everyone and cracking down on that right, as with all forms of censorship, would most hurt those who have less political or social power.\n\n\nBut you can expect Biden to frame this as a commonsense solution that reasonable people on both sides of the aisle support. That's what he does, and that's why he's dangerous.",

			"title": "Standing up for developers: youtube-dl is back",
			"body": "https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/\n\nAbby Vollmer\n\nToday we reinstated youtube-dl, a popular project on GitHub, after we received additional information about the project that enabled us to reverse a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown. \n\nAt GitHub, our priority is supporting open source and the developer community. And so we share developers’ frustration with this takedown—especially since this project has many legitimate purposes. Our actions were driven by processes required to comply with laws like the DMCA that put platforms like GitHub and developers in a difficult spot. And our reinstatement, based on new information that showed the project was not circumventing a technical protection measure (TPM), was inline with our values of putting developers first. We know developers want to understand what happened here, and want to know how GitHub will stand up for developers and refine our processes on these issues. \n\nIn this post, we provide answers to common questions about the DMCA and why GitHub handled this case the way we did, describe why circumvention claims deserve special treatment, and share how we’re updating our policies and fighting to improve the law.\n\nWhy did GitHub process this takedown in the first place? \nAs a platform, we must comply with laws—even ones that we don’t think are fair for developers. As we’ve seen, this can lead to situations where GitHub is required to remove code—even if it has a multitude of non-infringing uses—if it is in fact designed to circumvent a TPM. But this is exceedingly rare. \n\nLess than two percent of the DMCA takedowns we process are based on circumvention claims, and of those two percent, this was a particularly unusual case. \n\nDMCA takedown claims based on circumvention are a growing, industry-wide issue for developers with far-reaching implications. We’ll get into this in more detail, but first, here’s some quick background. \n\nCircumvention claims under the DMCA\nMost takedown notices we receive allege copyright infringement—that someone used their copyrighted work (often software code) in a way that infringes their rights. But as many people noticed, the youtube-dl takedown notice fell into a more unusual category: anticircumvention—an allegation that the code was designed to circumvent technical measures that control access or copying of copyrighted material, in violation of Section 1201 of the DMCA.\n\nSection 1201 dates back to the late 1990s and did not anticipate the various implications it has for software use today. As a result, Section 1201 makes it illegal to use or distribute technology (including source code) that bypasses technical measures that control access or copying of copyrighted works, even if that technology can be used in a way that would not be copyright infringement. Circumvention was the core claim in the youtube-dl takedown. \n\nGitHub’s developer-focused approach to the DMCA \nGitHub handles DMCA claims to maximize protections for developers, and we designed our DMCA Takedown Policy with developers in mind. Nearly every platform with user-generated content accepts and processes DMCA takedown notices to comply with the law. For GitHub, many of those notices come from developers wanting us to enforce the terms of their open source licenses, for example, when someone is using their code without the proper attribution required by the open source license they adopted. Here are ways our approach protects developers:\n\nGiven the cost to developers of an unwarranted takedown of code, we ensure we have a complete notice before we take action. We distinguish between code that merely can be used in an infringing way and code that is preconfigured to be used a certain way. We also recognize that code can provide access to copyrighted content without violating the law (for example, fair use). In some cases we can keep a project up because the content identified in the takedown notice is not in fact infringing or circumventing a TPM that controls access or copying of copyrighted works. \nOur process sets a higher bar for 1201 claims than the infringement claims we typically get. We require complainants to provide additional information specific to circumvention, and to describe the technical measures and how the project is designed to circumvent them, for us to consider a notice complete. Below we explain how we’re further strengthening our process.\nWhenever we process takedowns, we notify all the affected repository owners about the takedown and give them options to dispute it. We allow the repository owner to make changes to address the allegations in the notice and in many cases, we can keep projects up because they do. \nWe are transparent with the developer community about DMCA takedown notices. Every time we process a DMCA takedown notice or counter notice, we publish the text to our DMCA repository, dated on the date we process it (as opposed to when we receive it), so that anyone can see the notice and the basis for our action. \nThese are all steps we currently take to help developers, which go beyond our legal obligations and typical industry practice while still meeting the requirements of the DMCA.\n\nyoutube-dl\nAs we explained, the key claim in the youtube-dl takedown is circumvention. Although we did initially take the project down, we understand that just because code can be used to access copyrighted works doesn’t mean it can’t also be used to access works in non-infringing ways. We also understood that this project’s code has many legitimate purposes, including changing playback speeds for accessibility, preserving evidence in the fight for human rights, aiding journalists in fact-checking, and downloading Creative Commons-licensed or public domain videos. When we see it is possible to modify a project to remove allegedly infringing content, we give the owners a chance to fix problems before we take content down. If not, they can always respond to the notification disabling the repository and offer to make changes, or file a counter notice. \n\nThat’s what happened in this case. First, we were able to reinstate a fork of youtube-dl after one of the fork owners applied a patch with changes in response to the notice. \n\nThen, after we received new information that showed the youtube-dl project does not in fact violate the DMCA‘s anticircumvention prohibitions, we concluded that the allegations did not establish a violation of the law. In addition, the maintainer submitted a patch to the project addressing the allegations of infringement based on unit tests referencing copyrighted videos. Based on all of this, we reinstated the youtube-dl project and will be providing options for reinstatement to all of its forks. \n\nWhat we’re changing\nGoing forward, we are overhauling our 1201 claim review process to ensure that the following steps are completed before any takedown claim is processed:\n\nEvery single credible 1201 takedown claim will be reviewed by technical experts, including when appropriate independent specialists retained by GitHub, to ensure that the project actually circumvents a technical protection measure as described in the claim.\nThe claim will also be carefully scrutinized by legal experts to ensure that unwarranted claims or claims that extend beyond the boundaries of the DMCA are rejected.\nIn the case where the claim is ambiguous, we will err on the side of the developer, and leave up the repository unless there is clear evidence of illegal circumvention.\nIn the event that the claim is found to be complete, legal, and technically legitimate by our experts, we will contact the repository owner and give them a chance to respond to the claim or make changes to the repo to avoid a takedown. If they don’t respond, we will attempt to contact the repository owner again before taking any further steps.\nOnly once these steps have been completed will a repository be taken down.\nAfter a repository is taken down due to what appears to be a valid and legitimate 1201 claim, we will continue to reach out to the repository owner if they have not already responded to us, in order to provide them the opportunity to address the claim and restore the repository. \nEven after a repository has been taken down due to what appears to be a valid claim, we will ensure that repository owners can export their issues and PRs and other repository data that do not contain the alleged circumvention code, where legally possible.\nWe will staff our Trust and Safety frontline team to respond to developer tickets in such cases as a top priority, so that we can ensure that claims are resolved quickly and repositories are promptly reinstated once claims have been resolved.\nAll of this will be done at our own cost and at no cost to the developers who use GitHub. We believe this represents the gold standard in developer-first 1201 claims handling. Like we do with all of our site policies, we will document and open source this process so that other companies that host code or packages can build on it as well. And we will continue to refine and improve this process as our experience with these types of cases inevitably grows.\n\nDeveloper defense fund\nDevelopers who are personally affected by a takedown notice or other legal claim rely on non-profits like the Software Freedom Law center and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to provide them with legal advice and support in the event that they face an IP claim, under the DMCA or otherwise. These organizations provide critical legal support to developers who would otherwise be on their own, facing off against giant corporations or consortia.\n\nNonetheless, developers who want to push back against unwarranted takedowns may face the risk of taking on personal liability and legal defense costs. To help them, GitHub will establish and donate $1M to a developer defense fund to help protect open source developers on GitHub from unwarranted DMCA Section 1201 takedown claims. We will immediately begin working with other members of the community to set up this fund and take other measures to collectively protect developers and safeguard developer collaboration. \n\nIf you want to support developers facing legal challenges, you can consider supporting SFLC and EFF yourself as well.\n\nHow we’re working to improve the law\nNo matter what we do to protect developer rights, we still must work within the boundaries of the law. And the DMCA’s current boundaries are hurting developers. One way to address the problems with the DMCA is to work to improve the law itself—and to prevent even worse laws from being enacted around the world. We were successful in a multi-year effort to stop the EU copyright directive from mandating upload filters for software development, and we’re taking lessons from that fight to the US as broader DMCA reform begins to be discussed. \n\nWe are also advocating specifically on the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA to promote developers’ freedom to build socially beneficial tools like youtube-dl. Right now, the U.S. Copyright Office is conducting its eighth triennial review process of exceptions to the anti-circumvention provisions of Section 1201. We will be saying more about that soon, but if you believe, like we do, that the DMCA is overly restrictive in its anti-circumvention provisions and want to change that, you can contact the Copyright Office directly too.\n\nWe will have more to say about how you can join the fight to make copyright law more developer-friendly soon–stay tuned.",

			"body": "The problem is that Ubuntu and many other distros dropped 32-bit support. Compiling for ZeroNet requires 32-bit support, so I use Linux Mint Debian Edition.\n\nThe reason I needed this wasn't even clear to me until I did an experiment: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2587\n\nI was actually able to automate signing and publishing Syncronite without root, because I had installed dependencies instead of them being bundled binaries! Linux Mint (not the Debian Edition), being based on Ubuntu, can't allow a cron job to sign and publish without root, because you can't compile the dependencies with 64-bit only. I know, it's dumb, but that's the way it is.\n\nThat's a big deal for anyone whose site's objective is grabbing content from the clearnet regularly with a cron job and publishing to ZeroNet. You know, mirror sites. You don't want ZeroNet to run as root if it has a vulnerability undiscovered by the developers. With root, your system is potentially burnt toast.\n\nAnd, you know... compiling is safer than trusting binaries, and potentially can optimize for your CPU. I don't regularly compile code, but that's how I understand it.\n\nI don't know why 32-bit support is needed to compile for ZeroNet. Maybe @GitCenter: has the answer.",

(Updated)\n\nBy Preston James, Ph.D\n\nNote: The history of the Khazarians, specifically the Khazarian Mafia (KM), the World’s largest Organized Crime Syndicate that the Khazarian oligarchy morphed into by their deployment of Babylonian Money-Magick, has been nearly completely excised from the history books.\n\nThe present day KM knows that it cannot operate or exist without abject secrecy, and therefore has spent a lot of money having its history excised from the history books in order to prevent citizens of the World from learning about its “Evil beyond imagination”, that empowers this World’s largest Organized Crime Cabal.\n\nThe authors of this article have done their best to resurrect this lost, secret history of the Khazarians and their large International Organized Crime Syndicate, best referred to as the Khazarian Mafia (KM) and make this history available to the World via the Internet, which is the new Gutenberg Press.\nTrending\nYoung Doctor Left Paralyzed MINUTES After Taking Pfizer ‘Covid-19’ Vaccine In Mexico\n\nIt has been exceedingly difficult to reconstruct this hidden secret history of the KM, so please excuse any minor inaccuracies or errors which are unintentional and are due to the difficulty in digging out the true history of Khazaria and its mafia. We have done the best we can to reconstruct it.\n\nIt was Mike Harris that connected the dots and made the actual discovery of the presence of the Khazarian Mafia’s secret history and blood oath to take revenge on Russia for helping Americans win the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, and their blood oath of revenge against America and Americans for winning these wars and sustaining the Union.\n\nAt the Syrian Conference on Combating Terrorism and Religious Extremism December 1, 2014 — in his Keynote address, Veterans Today Senior Editor and Director Gordon Duff disclosed publicly for the first time ever that World Terrorism is actually due to a large International Organized Crime Syndicate associated with Israel. This disclosure sent shock-waves at the Conference and almost instantly around the world, as almost every world leader received reports of Gordon Duff’s historical disclosure that same day, some within minutes.\n\nAnd the shock-waves from his historic speech in Damascus continue to reverberate around the world even to this very day. And now Gordon Duff has asked President Putin to release Russian Intel which will expose about 300 traitors in Congress for their serious serial felonies and statutory espionage on behalf of the Khazarian Mafia (KM) against America and many Middle East nations.\n\nWe now know that the Khazarian Mafia (KM) is waging a secret war against America and Americans by the use of False-flag Gladio-style terrorism, and via the illegal and Unconstitutional Federal Reserve System, the IRS, the FBI, FEMA, Homeland Security and the TSA. We know for certain that the KM was responsible for deploying an inside-job, Gladio-style False-flag attack on America on 9-11-01, as well as the Murrah Building Bombing on April 19, 1995.\n\n The Hidden History of the Incredibly Evil Khazarian Mafia\n\nby Preston James and Mike Harris\nVeteran Today\n\n100-800 AD – an incredibly Evil Society Emerges in Khazaria:\n\nKhazarians develop into a nation ruled by an evil king, who had ancient Babylonian black arts, occult oligarchs serving as his court. During this time, Khazarians become known to surrounding countries as thieves, murderers, road bandits, and for assuming the identities of those travelers they murdered as a normal occupational practice and way of life.\n\n800 AD – The Ultimatum is delivered by Russia and other surrounding nations:\n\nThe leaders of the surrounding nations, especially Russia, have had so many years of complaints by their citizens that, as a group, they deliver an ultimatum to the Khazarian king. They send a communique to the Khazarian king that he must choose one of the three Abrahamic religions for his people, and make it his official state religion and require all Khazarian citizens to practice it, and socialize all Khazarian children to practice that faith.\n\nThe Khazarian king was given a choice between Islam, Christianity and Judaism. The Khazarian king chose Judaism, and promised to stay within the requirements laid out by the surrounding confederacy of nations led by the Russian czar. Despite his agreement and promise, the Khazarian king and his inner circle of oligarchs kept practicing ancient Babylonian black-magic, also known as Secret Satanism. This Secret Satanism involved occult ceremonies featuring child sacrifice, after “bleeding them out”, drinking their blood and eating their hearts.\n\nThe deep dark secret of the occult ceremonies was that they were all based on ancient Baal Worship, also known as worship of the Owl. In order to fool the confederacy of nations led by Russia that were watching Khazaria, the Khazarian king melded these Luciferian black-magick practices with Judaism and created a secret Satanic-hybrid religion, known as Babylonian Talmudism. This was made the national religion of Khazaria, and nurtured the same evil that Khazaria was known for before.\n\nSadly, the Khazarians continued their evil ways, robbing and murdering those from surrounding countries who traveled through Khazaria. Khazarian robbers often attempted to assume their identities after they murdered these visitors, and became masters of disguises and false identities — a practice they have continued even to this very day, along with their child-sacrifice occult ceremonies, which are actually ancient Baal Worship.\n\n1,200 AD – Russia and the surrounding nations have had enough and take action:\n\nAbout 1,200 AD, the Russians led a group of nations surrounding Khazaria and invaded it, in order to stop the Khazarian crimes against their people, which included kidnapping of their young children and infants for their blood sacrifice ceremonies to Baal. The Khazarian king and his inner court of criminals and murderers came to be known as the Khazarian Mafia (KM) by neighboring countries.\n\nThe Khazarian leaders had a well-developed spy network through which they obtained prior warning and escaped from Khazaria to European nations to the west, taking their vast fortune with them in gold and silver. They laid low and regrouped, while assuming new identities. In secret, they continued their Satanic child blood and sacrifice rituals, and trusted Baal to give them the whole world and all its riches, as they claimed he had promised them, as long as they kept bleeding out and sacrificing children and infants for him.\n\nThe Khazarian king and his court Mafia plotted eternal revenge against the Russians and the surrounding nations that invaded Khazaria and drove them from power.\n\nThe Khazarian Mafia invades England after being expelled for hundreds of years:\n\nTo accomplish their invasion, they hired Oliver Cromwell to murder King Charles 1, and make England safe for banking again. This began the English Civil Wars which raged for nearly a decade, resulting in regicide of the royal family and hundreds of the genuine English nobility. This is how the City of London was set up as the banking capital of Europe and launched the beginning of the British Empire.\n*David Icke was the first ever to courageously expose the Rothschilds publicly in front of hundreds. This of course makes him an international hero and we need more with his kind of courage to break open the coverup hiding the Khazarian Mafia and bring an end to their worldwide illegitimate power.\n\nThe Khazarian Mafia (KM) decides to infiltrate and hijack all World Banking using Babylonian Black-Magick, also known as Babylonian Money-Magick or the secret art of making money from nothing also using the power of pernicious usury to accumulate interest:\n\nThe KM used their vast fortune to enter into a new system of banking, based on secret Babylonian black-magic money-magic that they claimed to have learned from the evil spirits of Baal, in return for their many child sacrifices to him.\n\nThis Babylonian money-magick involved the substitution of paper credit certificates for gold and silver deposits, which allowed travelers to travel with their money in a form that offered easy replacement should they lose the certificates or have them stolen.\n\nInteresting how the very problem that was started by the Khazarians also had a solution provided by them. Eventually the Khazarian king and his small surrounding court infiltrated Germany with a group that chose the name “the Bauers” of Germany to represent them and carry on their Baal-powered system of evil. The Bauers of the Red Shield, which represented their secret blood-based child sacrifices, changed their name to Rothschild (aka “child of the rock, Satan”).\n\nThe Rothschilds as the front Men for the Khazarian Mafia (KM) infiltrate and Hijack British Banking and then hijack the whole nation of England:\n\nBauer/Rothschild had five sons who infiltrated and took over European banking and the City of London Central Banking System through various crafty covert operations, including a false report of Napoleon winning against the British, when actually he lost. This allowed the Rothschilds to use fraud and deception to steal the wealth of the English nobility and the landed gentry, who had made business investments with the City of London Banking institutions.\n\nThe Rothschilds set up a private Fiat banking system that specialized in making counterfeit money from nothing — charging pernicious usury for the British people, using what should have been their own money.\n\nThis was the black art of Babylonian money-magick; they claimed to insiders that such technology and secret money power was provided to them by Baal, because of their frequent child bleeding-out and sacrifices rituals to Baal.\n\nOnce they had infiltrated and hijacked the British banking system, they interbred with the British Royals and infiltrated and completely hijacked all of England and all its major institutions. Some experts believe that the Rothschilds genocided the Royal Family members by staging secretly-managed illicit and adulterous breedings with their own Khazarian men in order to replace the Royals with their own pretenders to the throne.\n\nThe Khazarian Mafia (KM) wages an international effort to eradicate Kings who rule by the Divine Right of God Almighty:\n\nBecause the KM claims to have a personal partnership with Baal (aka the Devil, Lucifer, Satan) because of their sacrifices to him. They detest any kings who rule under the authority of God Almighty because most feel a responsibility to make sure their own people are protected from infiltrators and treasonous “Enemies within the Gates.”\n\nIn the 1600’s, the KM murder the British Royals and substitute their own fakes. In the 1700’s, they murder the French Royals. Right before WWI they murder, Austrian Archduke Ferdinand to start WW1. In 1917 they assembled their KM army, the Bolsheviks, and infiltrate and hijack Russia, murder the Czar and his family in cold blood, bayonet his favorite daughter through the chest and steal all the Russian gold, silver and art treasures. Right before WW2, they murder the Austrian and German Royals. Then they get rid of the Chinese Royals and disempower the Japanese ruler.\n\nThe Khazarian Mafia’s intense hatred of anyone who professed faith in any God but their god Baal has motivated them to murder kings and royalty, and make sure they can never rule. They have done the same with American presidents — running sophisticated covert operations to disempower them.\n\nIf that doesn’t work the KM assassinates them, like they did to McKinley, Lincoln and JFK. The KM wants to eliminate any strong rulers or elected officials who dare to resist their Babylonian money-magick power or their covert power gained from their deployment of their human compromise network.\n\nThe Rothschilds create international narcotics trafficking on behalf of the KM:\n\nThe Rothschilds then covertly ran the British Empire and crafted an evil plan to recover the vast amounts of gold and silver the British had been paying to China for its high-quality silk and spices that were unavailable anywhere else.\n\nThe Rothschilds, through their international spy network, had heard of Turkish opium and its habit-forming characteristics. They deployed a covert operation to buy Turkish opium and sell it in China, infecting millions with a bad opium habit that brought back gold and silver into the Rothschild coffers, but not to the British People.\n\nThe opium addictions created by Rothschild opium sales to China harmed China so much that China went to war on two occasions to stop it. These wars were known as the Boxer Rebellions or the Opium Wars.\n\nThe money the Rothschilds gained from the sale of opium was so vast that they became even more addicted to the easy money than the opiate addicts were to the opium.\n\nThe Rothschilds were the funding source behind the establishment of the American Colonies, by incorporating the Hudson Bay Company and other trading companies to exploit the New World of the Americas. It was the Rothschild’s who ordered the mass extermination and genocide of the indigenous people of North America to allow for exploitation of the vast natural resources of the continent.\n\nThe Rothschild’s also followed the same business template in the Caribbean and in the Asian sub-continent of India, resulting in the murder of millions of innocent people.\n\nThe Rothschilds start the international slave trade, an enterprise that viewed these kidnapped humans as mere animals — a view that the Khazarians would impose on all the people of the world who were not part of their evil circle, which some called the “Old Black Nobility”:\n\nThe Rothschild’s next big project was to start the worldwide slave trade, buying slaves from crooked tribal chiefs in Africa who worked with them to kidnap members of competing tribes for sale as slaves.\n\nThe Rothschild slave traders then took these kidnapped slaves on their ships in cramped cells to America and the Caribbean where they were sold. Many died at sea due to bad conditions.\n\nThe Rothschild bankers learned early on that war was a great way to double their money in a short time by lending money to both warring sides. But in order to be guaranteed collections, they had to get taxation laws passed, which could be used to force payment.\n\nThe KM Rothschild private Fiat Counterfeit Banksters plot eternal revenge against the American Colonists and Russia who assisted them for losing the Revolutionary War:\n\nWhen the Rothschilds lost the American Revolution, they blamed the Russian czar and the Russians for assisting the colonists by blockading British Ships.\n\nThey swore eternal revenge on the American colonists, just as they had when the Russians and their allies crushed Khazaria in 1,000 AD.\n\nThe Rothschilds and their English oligarchy that surrounded them plotted ways to retake America, and this became their main obsession.\n\nTheir favored plan is to set up an American central bank, featuring Babylonian money magic and secret counterfeiting.\n\nThe Rothschild KM attempts to retake America in 1812 on behalf of the Khazarian Mafia but fails, once again because of Russian interference:\n\nThis failure enraged the Rothschild KM, and they once again plot eternal revenge against both the Russians and the American colonists and plan to infiltrate and hijack both nations and asset strip, tyrannize and then mass-murder both nations and their populace.\n\nThe KM’s attempts to set up a private American central bank are blocked by President Andrew Jackson, who called them Satanic and vowed to route them out by the grace and power of Almighty God.\n\nThe Rothschild banksters regroup and continue their covert attempts to install their own Babylonian money-magick bank inside America.\n\nFinally in 1913, the Rothschild KM succeeds in establishing a major beachhead inside America — and an evil enemy of all American enter the gates of America:\n\nIn 1913, the Rothschild KM was able to establish a beachhead by bribing crooked, treasonous members of Congress to pass the illegal, Unconstitutional Federal Reserve Act on Christmas Eve without a required quorum. The Act was then signed by a crooked, bought off President, who was a traitor to America, like the members of Congress who voted for it.\n\nThe Rothschild KM then create an illegal taxation System in America:\n\nThe KM put an illegal, Unconstitutional tax system in place, in order to make sure that Americans would have to pay for high-level USG spending, approved by a bought-off, crooked Congress and Presidential puppets, put in place by corrupt KM campaign finance.\n\nIt is easy for the KM to garner enough money to elect anyone they want, because when you control a bank that is a secret major counterfeiter, you have all the money made for you that you desire. At about the same time that they created their illegal tax system in America, they also bribed members of Congress to approve the Internal Revenue Service, which is their private collection agency incorporated in Puerto Rico.\n\nSoon afterwards, they set up the Federal Bureau of Investigation to protect their banksters, to serve their cover-up needs and prevent them from ever being prosecuted for their child sacrifice rituals, pedophile networks; and to also serve as a covert Intel operation on their behalf.\n\nNote that the FBI has no official charter, according to the Library of Congress, and has no right to exist or issue paychecks.\n\nThe Rothschild KM deployed the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia to extract incredibly savage, bloody revenge on innocent Russians, which they had plotted for many years, ever since Khazaria was destroyed:\n\nThe Rothschild KM pre-staged and engineered the Russian Revolution by using its central banks to pay for the Bolshevik infiltration of Russia and their Revolution on behalf of the Khazarian Mafia (KM).\n\nThe Bolsheviks were actually created and deployed by the Khazarian Mafia (KM) as the essential part of their long planned revenge on the Russian Czar and the innocent Russian people for breaking up Khazaria in about 1,000 AD for its repeated robbery, murder and identity theft of travelers from countries surrounding Khazaria. This little known fact explains the extreme violence taken out on Russia as long standing revenge by the Rothschild controlled Khazarian Mafia (KM).\n\nIn an well-planned savage and inhuman bloodletting that stunned the world, the Bolsheviks were unleashed in full fury on behalf of the KM to gain revenge on the Russians. This had been planned since the destruction of Khazaria.\n\nThe Bolsheviks, at the direction of the Rothschild KM, raped, tortured and mass-murdered approximately 100 million Russians, including women, children and infants. Some of the torture and bloodletting was so extreme, we are not going to mention it here in this article.\n\nBut readers who want to know can do some in depth internet research on the “Red Terror” or the “Bolshevik Cheka” or watch the classic movie “The Checkist” which is available on www.youtube.com.\n\nThe Rothschild Khazarian Mafia (KM) once again decided to sheep-dip themselves and infiltrated and hijacked all Judaism:\n\nThe Rothschild KM created a master plan to control all of Judaism and mind-kontrol Judaics. The Rothschild KM has hijacked Judaism, patterned it off of Babylonian Talmudism (Luciferianism or Satanism), and gained control over the banking and Wall Street professions in general, Congress, the major mass media; along with most wealth and economic means of success.\n\nThus, the Rothschild KM could pass out wealth and success to those Judaics who drank their Kool-aide and use them as cutouts, assets and Sayanims. In this manner, the Rothschilds hijacked Judaism.\n\nTheir financing of the Israeli Knesset and construction of it using Freemason occult architecture displayed their commitment to the occult and Babylonian Talmudism and all the evil accompanying it, including child sacrifice to their secret god Baal. They set up a NWO system called World Zionism which taught and inculcated susceptible Judaics with a paranoid group delusion of racial superiority, which assumed that all Gentiles were intent on mass-murdering all Judaics.\n\nFreemasonry architecture was used in the building of the Israeli Supreme Court\n\nThey called this racially-paranoid mass Judaic delusion of world conquest, “World Zionism”, which is really a form of covert Babylonian Talmudism or Luciferianism that had been unknown to mainstream Judaics. The system was designed to use Judaics as cover, but also to anoint them with Babylonian money-power, in order to use them as cutouts, and to later be sacrificed to Lucifer in two stages.\n\nThe first stage would be a their planned WWII in Nazi work camps, cut off from supplies, resulting in the deaths of about 200,000 Judaics from starvation and disease, along with about 90,000 non-Judaic inmates from the same causes, according to respected Red Cross official figures. This number is 5% of what the Khazarian Mafia (aka the World Zionists) claim.\n\nThe second great sacrifice would be a final one, when their New World Order Luciferian King would be placed into power, and when all three Abrahamic religions would be eradicated — especially Judaism, which would be blamed for all the wars and destruction of the world.\n\nBy then, the Rothschilds would once again morph themselves into a complete new identity not associated with Judaism in any form, not even World Zionism.\n\nIt is important to realize that the Rothschild KM took Germany down to nothing after WWI, created a vacuum for Fascism, and then rebuilt it, creating Naziism and installing Hitler as a counter-force to their Russian Bolshevism.\n\nHitler became a problem for the KM when he broke free and begin acting in the interests of the German people and the free people of the world, and developed his own banking system free of the Rothschilds.\n\nHitler introduced a financial system that was free of usury and beneficial to the working class. This mandated the utter destruction of Germany and the German people, because the Rothschilds and the Khazarians could never allow an economic system that did not depend upon usury to exist.\n\nWe see the same thing today with the Khazarian war against Islam, because Islam forbids usury. That is why Israel is so vocal and aggressive about destroying the Islamic people of the world.\n\nThe KM expected this to be a large WWII and when they supported both sides, this could be used to industrialize the whole world and maximize their bankster money-power.\n\nThe Rothschild KM then bribed and induced Members of Congress to send American Soldiers to their pre-stage and engineered WWI:\n\nAs a continuance of their well-proven pattern of financing both sides in any war to maximize profits, the acquisition of more federal tax monies and increased international power, the Rothschild Khazarians once again bribed, blackmailed and induced members of Congress to declare war against Germany in 1917.\n\nThis was facilitated by a KM false-flag attack with the sinking of the Lusitania.\n\nThe Rothschild KM has since developed the usual pattern of covertly staging false-flag attacks as a standard operating procedure for inducing Americans to fighting wars for the Khazarian Mafia.\n\nAfter WWII was finished, the Rothschild KM deployed the Cold War, and used this as an excuse to bring Nazi scientists and mind-kontrol experts to America under Operation Paperclip.\n\nThis allowed them to set up a worldwide spying and espionage system that far exceeded any of their prior efforts.\n\nUnder this new system, they continue to infiltrate and hijack all American institutions, including the various American church systems, Freemasonry (especially the Scottish Rite and York Rite), the US military, US Intel, and most private defense contractors, the Judiciary and most agencies of the USG, including most State governments, and both major political parties as well.\n\nThe Rothschild KM sets up Nazi Work Camps as a pretext to later manipulate the Allies into granting them their own private colony in Palestine, using land stolen from the Palestinians:\n\nThe Rothschild KM was able to use their self mis-labelled, so-called “holocaust” to serve as a mind-kontrol trigger to thwart and resist any criticism of their Zionist ways.\n\nThe truth of the matter was that the Rothschild KM set up the Nazi work camps to make huge profits for their corporations that ran their work camps and supplied their Nazi war machine.\n\nOnce the Rothschild KM gained their own private homeland in Israel in 1947 through their covert political manipulations, they began to secretly view all of Palestine as their New Khazaria, and began plotting how to genocide all the Palestinians and steal all of Palestine for themselves. Their plans include their fantasy of constructing a “greater Israel” by taking over the whole Middle East and manipulating dumb American Goyim to fight and die on their behalf, taking all the Arab lands for Israel and the Khazarian Mafia (KM), so they can asset strip their wealth and natural resources, especially their crude oil.\n\nRecent peer-reviewed Johns Hopkins genetic research by a respected Judaic MD shows that 97.5% of Judaics living in Israel have absolutely no ancient Hebrew DNA, are therefore not Semites, and have no ancient blood ties to the land of Palestine at all. By contrast, 80% of Palestinians carry ancient Hebrew DNA and thus are real Semites, and have ancient blood ties to Palestinian Land. This means that the real anti-Semites are the Israelis who are stealing Palestinian lands in order to build Israeli settlements, and it is the Israelis who are the ones tyrannizing and mass-murdering innocent Palestinians.\n\nRothschild Passing Dynasty on to 7th Generation, Marking 200 Years of Banker Family Rule\n\nThe Rothschild KM decides to morph again and expand their ranks:\n\nIn the meantime the Rothschild KM realized that they could not stay hidden much longer from the public unless they morphed again and expanded their secret leadership.\n\nSo they worked hard to further infiltrate and hijack Freemasonry and its secret offshoots, and inducted top members into their pedophile network and child sacrifice rituals.\n\nAlso, key members of Congress were inducted into their secret satanic network by giving them special power, high USG, military and Intel positions, accompanied by great monetary rewards and high status. Massive KM espionage fronts using Israeli-American “Israeli-first” dual citizens as cutouts were set up inside America to funnel the Khazarian banksters’ counterfeit money to politicians for their election campaigns, in order to own and control them when elected.\n\nThe Rothschild KM decides to Mind-kontrol the American masses to make it much easier to manipulate them into approving their illegal, Unconstitutional unprovoked, undeclared, unwinnable, perpetual wars needed to make huge profits and gain more world power:\n\nThe Rothschild KM decided to gain complete control over all public education by setting up the Department of Education and creating globalist and socialist curriculums based on political correctness, diversity and “perversion is normal” teachings. Fluoride is added to the public water and toothpaste, and dentists are mind-kontrolled to believe that fluoride prevents cavities, and is not harmful to brain function or thyroid function, which it is.\n\nThe addition of fluoride to the public water supply and to toothpaste is to dumb-down Americans by on average lowering the operational IQ and making folks much more docile than they would normally be. Programs to develop and deploy vaccinations to dumb-down children and create huge numbers of future chronic health problems were initiated.\n\nDoctors have been mind-kontrolled and misled by biased research that was cherry-picked, ignoring any studies that were negative — and that included most of them. All vaccine cell lines are contaminated with SV-40, a known carcinogenic slow-acting virus.\n\nThe KM used its monetary power to gain control over all of the allopathic medical schools, and set up and controlled the American Medical Association and other medical societies, in order to make sure their agenda based on lies and deceit was continued.\n\nPart of this massive plan to dumb-down and mind-kontrol the American masses was the KM’s buying up and consolidating all the American mass media into six controlled major mass media (CMMM), owned and controlled by their cutouts on their behalf. The CMMM functions as an illegal news cartel, and it should be broken up under antitrust laws and for inflicting espionage and illegal propaganda as a weapon of war against the American people.\n\nThe Rothschild KM Chieftains decide that it is time to use America to complete their final take-down and occupation of the Whole World by instituting a major False-Flag attack inside America to blame on the Islamics whom they want America to wrongly attack on their behalf:\n\nSo the KM Chieftains use their top Israeli-American “Israeli-first” dual citizens living in America (aka, the PNACers and top NeoCon Cutouts) to plan a major nuclear attack on America on 9-11-01.\n\nBibi Netanyahu, the operational head of the KM, deployed the Mossad and these Dual Citizens to set up and institute this attack on America which was to be blamed by the CMMM on Muslims.\n\nThey informed their top Rabbis and “Friends of World Zionism” not to fly on that day and to stay out of NYC, as did “Larry Silverstein”, one of the primary men involved in the operation.\n\nThey used their main cutout in the DOD to lure the Able Danger investigators to the Pentagon Naval Intel meeting room, where they would be assassinated by a Tomahawk cruise missile that was fired from an Israeli Dolphin class Diesel submarine bought from Germany.\n\nThirty-five of the Able Danger investigators who were investigating and tracking the Israeli theft of 350 decommissioned W-54 Davy Crockett nuclear pits out of the backdoor at Pantex in Texas were murdered by this Tomahawk hit, which was timed with the detonation of bombs pre-planted in the Naval Intel wing, which was newly hardened to no avail.\n\nThe Israeli Mossad front company, Urban Moving Systems, was used to transport the mini-nukes made from the stolen W-54 nuclear pits from Pantex (and originally made at the Hanford processing plant), where they were stored in the Israeli Embassy in NYC and transported to the Twin Towers for detonation on 9-11-01.\nBaal aka Moloch, Lucifer, Satan. Take your pick it’s the same evil spirit that wants to mass-murder all humans. In exchange for doing his “dirty work” he rewards those allow him to snatch their souls by giving them incredible riches, fame and power. This is the secret blood contract called “selling one’s soul.”\n\n \n\nThe incredibly Evil Secret Agenda of the Khazarian Mafia (KM) is now revealed publicly for the very first time by Veterans Today’s own Gordon Duff. We now know that Bibi Netanyahu ran the nuclear attack on America on 9-11-01 and did it as an overall Khazarian Mafia (KM) Agenda.\n\nHold on to your chair, this is very big secret and explains a lot of what has been going on inside America, all caused by Israel and the Khazarian Mafia (KM) which has infiltrated almost all of Americas institutions of Government and society.\n\nNow for the first time ever the very specific secret incredibly Evil Agenda of the Khazarian Mafia (KM) is going to be revealed, thanks to an interview that Mike Harris had with Veterans Today Senior Editor and Director Gordon Duff on his talk-show “The Short End of the Stick” on 3-10-15.\n\nI have heard a lot of shocking insider’s secrets over the years but this one really takes the cake and explains exactly what Israel and its minions in America have been to us on behalf of the Rothschild Khazarian Mafia (KM) that has screwed up almost every aspect of our lives creating a poor economy, lots of unemployment and underemployment, massive crime, alcoholism and drug, screwed up schools that dumb down the kids, various eugenics programs like fluoride in the public water and toothpaste, and mercury in vaccines which are a big fraud, and rampant political corruption.\n\nThis interview is now sending shock-waves around the world and when you consider the content that Gordon Duff disclosed for the first time anywhere publicly, you will be shocked. And you will understand that Bibi Netanyahu is the Operational Head of the Khazarian Mafia (KM) and was the one that ordered and supervised the Israeli Nuclear Attack on America on 9-11-01.\n\nIn this interview Gordon Duff disclosed from a written transcript of what was said at a meeting between Bibi Netanyahu and American traitor and some other spies in 1990. Gordon Duff disclosed that Netanyahu was a KGB spy like Jonathan Pollard. And we know now that Israel was started as a satellite of Bolshevik Russia and was quite unhappy when the Soviet Union fell.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu was meeting in at Finks bar in Jerusalem, a well-known Mossad watering-hole. Here is what he said as taken directly from the transcript of the recording which was witnessed and has been 100% fully authenticated:\n\n“If we get caught they will just replace us with persons of the same cloth. So it doesn’t matter what you do, America is a Golden Calf and we will suck it dry, chop it up, and sell it off piece by piece until there is nothing left but the World’s biggest welfare state that we will create and control. Why? Because it’s god’s will and America is big enough to take the hit so we can do it again, again and again. This is what we do to countries that we hate. We destroy them very slowly and make them suffer for refusing to be our slaves.”\n\nThis is exactly what the Rothschild Khazarian Mafia (KM) has been doing to America since it successfully infiltrated and hijacked America in 1913. Knowledge of what Bibi said on behalf of the Rothschild Khazarian Mafia (KM) should make us all furious and get motivated to drive these evil creatures out of America and take our great Republic back.\n\nWhen Bibi Netanyahu mentions god’s will, the god he was referring to is Baal (also known as the Great Owl or Moloch), the god these Khazarians believe requires them to worship him by constant bloodletting and painful human sacrifice and mass-murder and that if they “sell their souls” to Baal (aka Lucifer or Satan) do this they will be rewarded with incredible riches, fame and great power. When they “sell their souls” what actually happens is that their souls are snatched away and they become inhuman or soulless and take on the characteristics of Baal, that is they become increasingly psychopathic and evil.\n\nWhat Bibi Netanyahu was discussing was the upcoming nuclear attack on America on 9-11-01, and when he mentioned “they will just replace us” he was referring to the top Circle of Twelve, the group he answers to that Veterans Today’s own Columnist and talk show host Stew Webb disclosed to the World by identifying 11 of the 12 who call themselves the “Illuminati” or “Disciples of Satan.” These men do semi-annual child sacrifice in Denver and eat the hearts of children, drink their blood after they pedophile them.\n\nFolks, we must get this information out to everyone we can, then unite and drive these soulless Baal worshiping scum out of every nook and cranny of America and bring them all to justice and final judgement for all their incredible evil.\n\nAnyone who understands what Bibi Netanyahu thinks of Americans as a golden calf to asset strip and slaughter should be enraged and driven to community organizing, and political action against Israeli espionage inside America through the Federal Reserve System, AIPAC, JINSA, the Defense Policy Board, the CFR and the like.\n\n*\n\nThe Rothschild KM planted has 25 nukes in major American cities and other major cities in Europe in order to blackmail the associated government. This is referred to as their Samson Option, and was first discovered and disclosed by Seymour Hersh:\n\nThe Rothschild KM also gained some S-19 and S-20 Warheads from a corrupt Member of Congress assigned the task to buy up Ukrainian Mirvs on behalf of the USG in order to decommission them. Instead, he sold them to the Israelis and split the money with other key Congressmen involved.\n\nThis is high treason and a capital offense punishable by execution. Right after their attack on America, the Rothschild KM told the US Administration that they would detonate city-buster sized nukes in some American cities, including DC, if the Administration refused to allow Israel to create their own large police state occupation force inside America, based on the consolidation of all American Law Enforcement and alphabets under one central Israeli control.\n\nThis new Israeli occupation force called Homeland Security (DHS) was initially run by dual citizens and perverts. Former DHS Director Janet Napolitano is being sued for sexual harassment of men working at DHS whom she ordered to move their offices into the men’s lavatory.\n\nDual Citizen traitor Michael Chertoff, (a name translated from Russian as “son of the devil”), was the criminal mastermind that set up DHS, along with former head of the East German Stasi, Marcus Wolfe, who was hired as a special consultant and died mysteriously as soon as his mission was completed.\n\nThe Rothschild KM never thought they would get exposed for their nuclear attack on America on 9-11-11, but they made one of the biggest tactical mistakes in history and overplayed their hand from excess hubris, based on too much easy success due to their extreme money power in the past.\n\nSoon mainstream America will know that Bibi Netanyahu and his Likudist Party deployed the attack on America on 9-11-01 on behalf of the Rothschild KM:\n\nThey thought that they had complete control over the CMMM and could prevent any of the secret IAEA and Sandia Labs investigation from ever being released to the American public.\n\nThey made a serious tactical error, because now the truth about their role in the 9-11-01 attack on America is being published on the worldwide Internet, the world’s new Gutenberg Press. What the Rothschild KM did not understand was the power of the Internet and how truth-nuggets published and broadcast on it resonate with the people of the world and spread like wildfire, at the speed of light. Truth is being diffused to the masses everywhere.\n\nThis incredible tactical error by the KM is so great that it will actually doom them to the complete exposure and eventual complete destruction they deserve. Bibi Netanyahu’s order to proceed and deliver the nuclear attack on America on 9-11-01 will go down in history as one of the KM’s biggest mistakes, and the one that will be blamed for their exposure and destruction by the world that is now ganging up against them.\n\nThe Russians have now leaked the IAEA and Sandia Labs and Able Danger files given to them by Edward Snowden. Soon all of these files will be provided to all Americans and the world via the Internet, and this cannot be stopped.\n\nA number of Russians in the High Military Command in Russia, and in the highest positions of leadership in the Russian government realize that it was the same Organized Crime Cabal that organized the Khazarians into Bolsheviks to mass-murder 100 million innocent Russians — and these men want payback.\n\nThat is why they are making sure that the Rothschild banksters will be put out of business, which will decapitate the Khazarian Mafia from its endless, elastic counterfeit money supply. This is why the BRICS Development Bank was created — to replace the US Petro Dollar as the world’s reserve currency, but this one, unlike the US Petro Dollar is backed by gold, silver and real commodities, with NO counterfeiting allowed.\n\nThe CMMM is failing, and most Americans no longer believe any of their prime-time national stories, especially the under-thirty crowd, who cherry pick facts from the Internet and construct their own beliefs.\n\nSo many Internet users now reject the CMMM that the truth about the Israelis attacking America on 9-11-01 is becoming easier each day to believe. Soon all of mainstream America will know that Bibi Netanyahu and his Mossad and dual citizens did the 9-11-01 attack on America.\n\nThe American Military High Command knows that Bibi Netanyahu ordered his Mossad and stateside Dual Citizens to attack America using nukes on 9-11-01 on behalf of the Rothschild Khazarian Mafia (KM):\n\nVarious deep cover covert operations are now being deployed globally to expose and decapitate the Rothschild KM from their endless, elastic money supply.\n\nTheir days of anti-human power are now limited. The secret, incredibly well-trained US team called the “Nuclear Snake-Eaters” is now hard at work searching all incoming Israeli diplomatic pouches and shipments; driving by and flying over synagogues and Israeli embassies and Mossad safe-houses with high tech gamma ray and helium-3 neutron detectors; and using ultra high-tech custom-tuned and -focused satellites to search for any stored nuclear pits, as well as working hard to recover all stolen nuclear pits by the Israelis anywhere in the world outside of Israel.\n\nThis super-elite team was alerted by Michael Shrimpton’s phone call to MI-6 notifying them that an Israeli “City Buster” was planted near the Olympic stadium. This call wrongly has landed him in jail. The City Buster was recovered by the “Nuclear Snake-eaters”, who entered England and recovered and disarmed a large city buster. Sadly MI-6, wanted this nuke detonated in order to gain more power for the Khazarian Mafia in England — their home base inside the City of London Financial District — since it has been losing power fast.\n\nA secret name for these KM Chieftains which run much of the world out of the City of London is Gog and Magog, despite what so many historians believe is the secret name of Russia which it is not. It is the secret name of the top KM, and apparently represents where they originally came from.\n\nThe secret team of super-elite “Nuclear Snake-eaters” is ready to be deployed to Israel anytime, should the nation collapse after most European corporations divest from Israel, and the US cuts off all aid, in order to comply with American law. It is illegal to give aid to a nation that has nukes, and which has not signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Agreement. Israel has nukes detectable from satellite-based Helium-3 sensors and has never admitted it, nor has it signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Agreement. We must all demand that our Congress and Administration obey the law and immediately cut off all aid monetary and military aid to Israel, and arrest all Israeli espionage front directors of AIPAC, JINSA, the Defense Policy Board, the “Joint” in NYC, and the ADL, etc.\n\nIt is unknown but suspected that a significant number of these stolen nukes have been already recovered. It has been reported by insiders that a very solemn message was communicated to Bibi Netanyahu and his Likudists, as well as all top members of Israeli espionage fronts in America, like AIPAC, JINSA, the Defense Policy Board, the ADL and the like.\n\nWhat was this serious warning? If insider reports are accurate, these folks were told that if there is one more Israeli based false-flag attack, those who ordered it or were involved will be hunted down under American National Security and eliminated, and the Israeli defense structures associated with such will be turned to dust.\n\nThe rest of Rothschild KM history will likely be determined by YOU:\n\nThe future of the Rothschild KM will likely be determined by Veterans Today readers and We The People who learn the secret, forbidden history of the Khazarian Mafia that was excised from the history books and libraries by the KM to protect their evil history that no one would accept if it was known.\n\nSo share this story with your family, friends and associates and take it viral. Be clear about this — unless the KM is able to operate in abject secrecy, it will be attacked from all sides and destroyed forever. So take away their secrecy by exposing their hidden history for all Americans to know and understand.\n\nThat is why they have worked so hard to buy up and control the CMMM and public mass education including colleges and universities, to make sure the people of the world would never find out about their secret evil, which is so inhuman, so homicidal that the whole world would gang up on them and attack them from all sides at every level they exist at.\n\nThe big question remains: Was the true cause of leaders of the Khazarian Mafia’s incredible evil and savagery toward the human race a byproduct or nature or nurture? Some believe that this gross parasitism and inclination to mass-murder, engage in pedophilia and child bloodletting and child sacrifice is due to a toxic culture, best described as malignant Tribalism, characterized by a paranoid group racial superiority delusion. Others think the leaders of the KM are the bloodline of Cain, that is, “children of Cain”, that are the Devil’s own and have absolutely no soul or human conscience, but are pure predators like a wild beast — while at the same time being incredibly two-faced, that is able to put on a good con and a nice face on the outside. Perhaps it could be both factors. In any case, it is time to expose this evil, the greatest evil the world has ever experienced. It is time for the world to work together to eradicate this problem now and forever, by whatever means necessary.\n\n*\n\nMike Harris is the Financial Editor of Veterans Today, a radio host, a former GOP Finance Chairman, Gubernatorial Candidate for Arizona, and a Senior Vice President of Adamus Defense Group, Switzerland.

			"title": "The Far Right’s Fear of ‘Glowies’",
			"body": "https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/01/what-glowies-mean-online-spies/617717/\n\nIn the aftermath of the January 6 riot, extremists have become obsessed with the federal agents who might lurk among them.\n\nOlga Khazan\nJanuary 25, 2021\nSarah Silbiger / AFP / GETTY / THE ATLANTIC\n\nUpdated at 9:15 a.m. E.T. on January 25, 2021\n\nJudging by the actions of those who stormed the Capitol, far-right extremists don’t fear arrest. But they do fear one thing: glowies.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, many far-right groups’ main concern was figuring out how to recruit more people to the cause. But as federal law-enforcement officials continue to round up people suspected of involvement in the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, and Joe Biden’s administration promises a crackdown on white-supremacist and anti-government radicals, extremists are on the verge of a crack-up, posting widely and worriedly about spies in their midst—“glowies.” That’s the term far-right groups use to describe people they suspect of being federal law-enforcement agents or informants infiltrating their communication channels, trying to catch them plotting violence, or prodding them into illegal acts.\n\nThe term is in widespread use among extremists: On January 6, one Telegram user made their channel, which was popular with the far right, private because “nameless faceless glowies are joining.” Two days later, another person suggested that glowies would “float dead cop story, to redirect public attention and sympathy,” referring to the death of the Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was beaten with a fire extinguisher during the riot and later died. One user recommended downloading an alternative platform, ZeroNet, saying, “Glowies cannot take it down.”\n\nScreenshots of these Telegram channels were provided to me by Meghan Conroy, who researches far-right extremism at Moonshot CVE, an organization that aims to counter violent extremism. In addition, I found variations on the “glow” terminology all over 4chan, the imageboard that froths with racist and misogynist messages, and on TheDonald.win, the far-right successor to the pro-Trump subreddit r/The_Donald. All three platforms featured discussions of storming the Capitol in the days leading up to January 6.\n\nExtremists have become more wary of real or perceived glowies since January 6. On the January 11, someone on 4chan asked, “What kind of shit should I get for the boogaloo?,” meaning the civil war that the far-right boogaloo bois are preparing for. This, another person responded, seemed like “glow”—the potential sign of an FBI agent. The same thing happened when another user asked about the best place to store guns. On TheDonald.win, someone suggested that the death of Ashli Babbitt, the woman killed during the Capitol riot, was possibly staged or orchestrated by glowies. “Since all you glowies are here looking for ‘Domestic Terrorists,’” another wrote, “Look in the mirror then apologize for Ruby Ridge you sick fucks,” referring to the 1992 siege by U.S. marshals in Idaho that led to the deaths of three people.\n\n“With increased content moderation by platforms and tons of researchers/analysts paying more attention to the right, it appears these folks want to keep the momentum of the sixth going but are afraid to talk about it openly,” Conroy told me via email.\n\nFederal law enforcement, of course, has a long history of monitoring extremist groups. FBI informants infiltrated both the far-left Weather Underground and the Ku Klux Klan, among others. The FBI declined to comment on whether its agents or informants are currently monitoring far-right communications channels or posting in them directly. But federal agents don’t have to be actively watching the channels to complicate the extremists’ mission. Being watched makes planning harder. So does constant suspicion. The mere possibility of glowies among the militias might be enough to reduce the threat of extremist violence in the coming months.\n\nFar-right forums are rife with racism and misogyny, so perhaps it’s no surprise that glowie derives from the language of hate. The term originated with Terry Davis, a computer programmer who had schizophrenia and harbored paranoid conspiracy theories about the government. In a 2017 YouTube video that has been viewed nearly 1 million times, Davis says: “The CIA niggers glow in the dark; you can see them if you’re driving. You just run them over.” Because the internet can be a terrible place, the term took off, becoming popular on 4chan’s white-nationalist /pol/ board and spreading to other platforms.\n\nGlowie has also sprouted other permutations: Someone who seems suspicious is said to be “glowing.” Seeming too much like an FBI agent—known as an “alphabet” in these forums—is called “glowposting.”\n\nFor instance, asking a question like “Do you know where I can get schematics for 3-D-printed guns?” might be considered glowposting, because it suggests that the user is attempting to lure his interlocutor toward committing a crime, says Hampton Stall, a senior researcher at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project and the founder of the MilitiaWatch blog. If someone is suspected of being a federal agent or an informant for the FBI, other group members will “fedjacket” him or her, making the case about why the person is secretly a snitch. To prevent feds from joining, some forums have devised elaborate vetting procedures. For instance, they’ll ask potential members to send a picture of one of their biceps, on the theory that a reverse image search will reveal whether the picture is original. Also, “they’re very bro-ey,” Stall told me.\n\nThen there’s “glowing,” which is talking about things that are violent and threatening—and therefore likely to attract the attention of cops. In a chat on the Element messenger app that Conroy is in, people have asked, for example, “How brightly are we allowed to glow here?” Or, as part of a conversation about the apparent desire to execute members of Congress, one user said, “Yeah, I’d say every single congresscritter needs to go.” “That’s my kind of glowing right there,” another user responded.\n\nIn order to attempt to cover their tracks, extremists will sometimes spell out their violent desires, then quickly add, “in Minecraft.” Because you can’t get arrested for wanting to kill people in a video game, right?\n\nThe meaning of glowies has evolved over time. In addition to referring to feds, the term is sometimes applied to dissenters, anti-fascists, or tech companies that might try to take down far-right forums. “If somebody gets out of line in the chat, they accuse them of being antifa,” Stall said.\n\nIt’s hard to impersonate the subculture of a group you don’t belong to, so newcomers tend to write messages that read as slightly off, a “How do you do, fellow kids?” from an interloper. The members think, “This could be law enforcement, this could be antifa, but it’s probably not Joe White Supremacist,” says Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League. “Anybody who strikes them as being different from the crowd is raising alarm bells with them.”\n\nStill, the extremists’ glow-dar isn’t very good, Stall said. They miss people who are very obviously federal agents, or they accuse random users of glowing because they’ll say something like “Time to kill all Democrats.” Police officers who sympathize with white supremacists have been accused of glowing when they actually appear to be trying to help the extremists’ cause.\n\nExtremists’ suspicion of law enforcement might seem strange, given that off-duty police officers were among the mob who stormed the Capitol earlier this month. But although far-right extremists tend to see local law enforcement as the ultimate authority, federal agents, to many of them, are extensions of the federal government, and therefore illegitimate.\n\nIn fact, as Arie Perliger, a professor of security studies at UMass Lowell, pointed out in a recent paper, even as law-enforcement officers have joined the ranks of far-right militias, militias have increased their attacks on law-enforcement and military targets. “You can be a police officer, but if you’re not someone who’s part of their constituency,” Perliger told me, “you’re the enemy.”\n\nMany people who have expressed support for the Capitol insurrection talk of glowies, but it’s not yet clear how many of the people who actually seized the building are familiar with the term. Though dozens of known white supremacists who were on a terrorist watch list joined in the Capitol attack, as The Washington Post reported, the mob also included everyone from a horned shaman to a tech CEO. Members of militias like the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters also appeared to be there, but several experts told me those groups don’t typically use online lingo like glowing, which is more commonly used by younger, more tech-savvy radicals.\n\nRegardless of their affiliation, the rioters largely saw the day as a success. To some, it was a sign that the broad far-right movement is growing in strength. “The race war that they really fantasize about, you know, ‘It feels like that we can actually bring this to fruition now, that we’re really gathering steam following what happened on the 6th,’” Peter Simi, a sociologist at Chapman University who studies extremists, told me. Counterterrorism officials are predicting that the boogaloo movement, in particular, might commit additional violence in the coming weeks.\n\nThat’s especially likely because the Biden administration will stoke these groups’ rage. “The history of the militia movement for the past four years has been them scrounging around to find other enemies to spend energy on—antifa, Democrats in Congress, governors doing lockdown measures, Black Lives Matter, all sorts of other things to occupy their time,” Pitcavage, of the Anti-Defamation League, told me. “But with Biden as president, it’s quite possible that they will revert to form and once more become extremely antagonistic to the federal government and grow.”\n\nAnd though extremists have recently been kicked off mainstream sites like Facebook and Twitter, they are still active on more esoteric platforms, such as Gab, Rocket.Chat, MeWe, Signal, Rumble, DLive, BitChute, and AR15.com, among others.\n\nStill, even in these obscure corners of the internet, they might be right to be paranoid about glowies. “There’s a long history of law enforcement infiltrating these groups,” Simi said. It’s highly likely that federal agents are actually monitoring these forums today, several experts told me. Trump ignored the threat of domestic terrorism for much of his presidency, but federal law enforcement has cracked down on the groups somewhat in the past year. Federal agents charged several boogaloo bois last fall, and last winter agents arrested the former leader of the white-supremacist group Atomwaffen Division for planning “swat” attacks on journalists and other foes.\n\nSocial media has long empowered militias and other far-right groups, and experts told me their banishment from mainstream platforms like Facebook could impede their growth. Every time a forum gets shut down, the extremists have to find a new home, a disruptive waste of their time. “The more time that they have to spend reorganizing and recalibrating is less time that they can spend planning more concrete, dangerous activity,” Micah Clark, a Moonshot CVE program director, told me. “A lot of the far right has had free rein on the internet for years longer than they should have.” Now, he said, these groups “are freaking out, because they sense that things are changing.” Some forums urged members not to attend protests on Inauguration Day, saying it might be an opportunity for entrapment.\n\nBut even if federal-agent infiltration doesn’t lead to any arrests, it might serve another useful purpose. These extremist groups, which were already predisposed to paranoia, now have something to be paranoid about. Real or perceived glowies are putting a healthy fear into these groups, which thrive on the premise that they are on the right side of history. It’s humbling to go from being a well-regarded CEO to being judged a criminal and a terrorist.\n\nThese days, the Capitol rioters might be thinking, as Clark put it, “I have all this privilege, and I might have just thrown a lot of it away.” The white men at the apex of American society don’t fear much. But they do fear falling to the bottom.",

			"title": "Introducing Clarion",
			"body": "https://github.com/bytemaster/clarion/discussions/2\n\nIntroduction\n\nClarion aims to give everyone in the world the tools to broadcast their message to everyone who wants to hear their message without creating dependencies on centralized infrastructure. It will achieve this with a censorship resistant \"friend to friend\" network which will leverage the unused resources of your friends and family to distribute your content.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to provide the performance and reliability of a \"centralized service\" with the freedom and independence of a logically decentralized network. With the help of the Clarion community we can free our friends and family from the tyranny of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Amazon, Apple and Google and produce a social network free from manipulation and 3rd party dependence.\nPrior Art\n\nClarion learns lessons from other projects, including RetroShare, Hive (previously SteemIt ), and Voice. RetroShare is far closer to the desired level of decentralization, but has a clunky interface that isn't viable on mobile. Meanwhile, blockchain based networks are \"logically centralized\" and require all full nodes to process all transactions. This is not suitable for home users at scale and creates dependencies on a small number of web portals.\n\nOne of the more successful decentralized protocols is IPFS and IPNS. These P2P protocols facilitate the publishing of location independent websites; however, they have a couple of drawbacks. Among these drawbacks are the need to keep your own node online in order to seed your content -- there is no free way to \"push to IPFS\". There is also a high latency to looking up content. Lastly, there is not really an opportunity for dynamic multi-user interaction.\n\nProtocols like Zeronet provide an application framework to build dynamic websites which are loaded/shared over the BitTorrent protocol. My experience with Zeronet is that it doesn't work well on Mobile, it takes a long time to \"sync\" pages, and suffers from excessive spam or needed moderation. At scale, a Zeronet application is just a logically centralized as a blockchain application.\nProgressive Web Application\n\nOne of the architectural design decisions that sets Clarion apart from most other peer to peer applications is the choice to utilize a progressive web application powered by Web Assembly. Recent actions by Google, Amazon, and Apple have demonstrated that we cannot rely on app stores and hosting providers to distribute our applications and content. This means the only viable way to get a censorship resistant application onto a cell phone is via Progressive Web Applications.\n\nWeb Assembly allows us to implement the logic of our social network in high-performance C++ while reusing most of the same code in the browser that we use in \"full nodes\" running on open platforms like desktops or personal servers.\nApplication Platform\n\nThe core of the Clarion OS is a friend-to-friend message propagation protocol that enables the following kinds of message flows between cryptographic identities:\n\n    asynchronous person to person (like email)\n    realtime person to person (video/chat)\n    one to many (like tweet/Facebook)\n    many to many (like an open chatroom / blockchain )\n\nUtilizing Web Assembly plugins it should be possible to build many different kinds of applications on top of Clarion OS, including tokens and smart contracts. A key distinction between Clarion OS and prior blockchain platforms is that the base layer has no need to reach consensus on the \"order\" of user actions nor to interpret the meaning of transactions. If typical Ethereum and EOS smart contracts are considered \"layer 1\", then Clarion OS could be considered \"layer 0\".\nProject Status\n\nClarion OS is just getting started and is in the early design stage. We are assembling a team of developers to build the first prototypes. This project will be developed in the open and welcomes contributions from anyone interested in restoring the internet to the level of logical decentralization that was intended before Big Tech locked us into their services and stopped producing tools that empower people.\n\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/dan-larimer-s-newest-project-is-another-attempt-at-decentralized-social-media\n\nDaniel Larimer, former chief technology officer of Block.one and a co-founder of Block.one and Steemit, has revealed his next project, called Clarion.\n\nThe project is meant to become a mobile-first decentralized social media platform, supporting all types of social features like personal messaging via text and video, publishing content to followers or having Discord-like voice chat rooms.\n\nAccording to Larimer, Clarion “learns lessons from other projects,” including the initial idea for Steemit and Voice, two social media projects he launched or backed.\n\nAccording to him, the two previous attempts at decentralized social media were “logically centralized” and required “all full nodes to process all transactions.”\n\nLarimer’s idea of a better network draws more from RetroShare and Zeronet, two platforms based on peer-to-peer messaging, with the latter based on BitTorrent. He also cited file sharing protocols like IPFS as good examples of decentralized networks. These present usability challenges though, especially on mobile devices.\n\nClarion would be developed as a “progressive web application” based on WebAssembly, a framework that allows building high-performance apps on the web, programmed in languages like C++ and Rust. This is mostly necessary to avoid the reliance on native applications distributed through app stores, with Larimer noting that “recent actions by Google, Amazon, and Apple have demonstrated that we cannot rely on app stores and hosting providers to distribute our applications and content.” The WebAssembly architecture also helps when designing desktop full nodes, as it requires minimal changes to the code.\n\nClarion’s blockchain-related aspects are somewhat less clear, as Larimer described it as not needing to reach consensus on the order of user actions, thus making it a “layer 0” platform. WebAssembly plugins will still allow building applications on top of the “Clarion OS.” Larimer clarified that there will be no tokens associated with the project’s base functionality.\n\nThe announcement was met with some skepticism in the community due to Larimer’s perceived history of abandoning projects. Larimer was the co-founder of Steemit, a blockchain-based social media platform popular during 2017, which he left in favor of Block.one, the company behind EOSIO, a blockchain framework underpinning both EOS and Voice, another social media platform.\n\nAfter Larimer left his post at Block.one in January, many interpreted it as a sign that he was going to build something else, which appears to have been the correct intuition. It is interesting to note that the projects Larimer left did not fare too well afterwards, with Steemit being acquired by Tron in a rocky and controversial deal, while EOS is currently struggling against its newer competitors in terms of adoption.\n\nLarimer still seems to be particularly interested in decentralized social media, a space that is also seeing a growing list of competitors. While his past experience would make Larimer an excellent candidate for building a viable “Big Tech killer,” it also raises the question of why Clarion’s basic ideas could not be implemented earlier, while he was still heading those projects.",

Can I access my v2 onion after September? Is this a backward-incompatible change?\n\nV2 onion addresses are fundamentally insecure. If you have a v2 onion, we recommend you migrate now. This is a backward incompatible change: v2 onion services will not be reachable after September 2021.\n\n##What is the recommendation for developers to migrate? Any tips on how to spread the new v3 addresses to people?\n\nIn torrc, to create a version 3 address, you simply need to create a new service just as you did your v2 service, with these two lines:\n```\nHiddenServiceDir /full/path/to/your/new/v3/directory/ HiddenServicePort <virtual port> <target-address>:<target-port>\n```\nThe default version is now set to 3 so you don't need to explicitly set it. Restart tor, and look on your directory for the new address. If you wish to keep running your version 2 service until it is deprecated to provide a transition path to your users, add this line to the configuration block of your version 2 service:\n```\nHiddenServiceVersion 2 \n```\nThis will allow you to identify in your configuration file which one is which version.\n\nIf you have [Onion-Location](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/onion-location/) configured on your website, you need to set the header with your new v3 address. For technical documentation about running onion services, please read the [Onion Services](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/) page in our Community portal.\n\n##I didn't see the announcement, can I get more time to migrate?\n\nNo, v2 onion connections will start failing nowish, first slowly, then suddenly. It's time to move away.\n\n##Will services start failing to be reached in September, or before already?\n\nAlready, introduction points are not in Tor 0.4.6 anymore, so they will not be reachable if relay operators update.\n\n##As a website administrator, can I redirect users from my v2 onion to v3?\n\nYes, it will work until the v2 onion address is unreachable. You may want to encourage users to update their bookmarks.\n\n##Are v3 onion services going to help in mitigating DDoS problems?\n\nYes, we are continuously working on improving onion services security. Some of the work we have in our roadmap is [ESTABLISH_INTRO Cell DoS Defense Extension](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/305-establish-intro-dos-defense-extention.txt), [Res tokens: Anonymous Credentials for Onion Service DoS Resilience](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/331-res-tokens-for-anti-dos.md), and [A First Take at PoW Over Introduction Circuits](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/327-pow-over-intro.txt).

			"title": "Announcing Arti, a pure-Rust Tor implementation",
			"body": "https://blog.torproject.org/announcing-arti\n\nby nickm | July 08, 2021\n\nGreetings!\n\nToday I'm happy to announce a new era in Tor implementation.\n\nOver the past year or so, we've been working on \"Arti\", a project to rewrite Tor in Rust. Thanks to funding from Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG), we can finally put the Arti project up in our priorities list, and devote more time to it.\n\nBelow I'll talk about why we're doing this project, what it means for Tor users and operators, where it's going in the future, and how people can help.\n\nA Little Background\n\nTor is a set of protocols to provide anonymity, privacy, and censorship resistance on the Internet. Tor is also a program (in C) that provides client-side and server-side implementations of those protocols. We started Tor back around 2002, based on earlier Onion Routing designs from the mid-1990s. In 2006, we incorporated the Tor Project as a nonprofit charity. Since then, Tor has grown to handle millions of users around the world.\n\nWhy Write Tor In Rust?\n\nToday's Tor is written in the C programming language. Although C is venerable and ubiquitous, it's notoriously error-prone to use, and its lack of high-level features make many programming tasks more complex than they'd be in a more modern language.\n\nFor us, these problems mean that programming in C is a slow and painstaking process. Everything we write takes more code than we'd like it to, and we need to double-check even the safest-looking code to make sure it doesn't fall prey to any of C's list of enormous gotchas. This slows us down seriously, and increases the cost of adding new features.\n\nRust seems like the clearest way out of our bind. It's a high-level language, and significantly more expressive than C. What's more, it's got some really innovative features that let the language enforce certain safety properties at compile-time. To a first approximation, if the code compiles, and it isn't explicitly marked as \"unsafe\", then large categories of bugs are supposed to be impossible.\n\nThat's a huge win for us in programming and debugging time, and a huge win for users in security and reliability. Since 2016, we've been tracking all the security bugs that we've found in Tor, and it turns out that at least half of them were specifically due to mistakes that should be impossible in safe Rust code.\n\nExample: Multithreaded Crypto\n\nHere's a case where Rust's safety can really help us.\n\nFor years now, we've wanted to split Tor's relay cryptography across multiple CPU cores, but we've run into trouble. C's support for thread-safety is quite fragile, and it is very easy to write a program that looks safe to run across multiple threads, but which introduces subtle bugs or security holes. If one thread accesses a piece of state at the same time that another thread is changing it, then your whole program can exhibit some truly confusing and bizarre bugs.\n\nBut in Rust, this kind of bug is easy to avoid: the same type system that keeps us from writing memory unsafety prevents us from writing dangerous concurrent access patterns. Because of that, Arti's circuit cryptography has been multicore from day 1, at very little additional programming effort.\n\nWhy A Full Rewrite?\n\nAt one point, we had hoped to slowly replace Tor's C code with Rust, one piece at a time. That hasn't worked out for us, however.\n\nOur problem here is that the modules in our existing C code are not terribly well separated from one another: most modules are reachable from most other modules. That makes it hard for us to rewrite our code one module at a time, without first untangling it to be more modular. And untangling the code is risky, for all the same reasons that working in C is typically risky.\n\nWith a rewrite, we figured that we can keep our existing C code stable and make only minimal changes to it, while building up a working base of Rust code to serve as a basis for future development.\n\n(And while we're writing a new implementation, we can clean up design issues that have been hard to fix in C. For example, the complicated structure of the C code has made it hard to adopt for embedding into other applications. But with our Arti rewrite, we can take embedding into account from the start, to help support applications down the road.)\n\nWhat Can Arti Do Today? What Features Are Missing?\n\nFirst off: Don't use Arti for real privacy yet.\n\nArti doesn't yet run as a relay at all. It doesn't support Tor's anti-censorship features yet, and it can't connect to onion services yet.\n\nFinally, note that today's Arti is missing several key security features for privacy: you shouldn't use it for browsing if you have actual privacy needs at all.\n\nSo what can Arti do? Right now, Arti can successfully bootstrap, run as a SOCKS proxy, and connect over the Tor network. It has an (unstable) API that you can use to embed it in other Rust programs, and give them support for connections over the Tor network.\n\nWhat Are The Next Steps For Arti?\n\nThanks to funding from ZOMG, we're going to try bring Arti to a production-quality client implementation over the next year and a half.\n\nIn our first phase, we're focusing on the missing security features that we need in order to get Arti as secure as Tor. We estimate we'll be done with this in October of this year. This phase will probably move the most slowly, since we're ramping up our Rust development capacity (and getting better at Rust!), and as we're finishing up some existing commitments.\n\nIn our second phase, we'll focus on all the features needed for seamless embedding. We'll add missing features for efficiency and responsiveness, and add APIs for bootstrap reporting and other functionality that applications need to give a good user experience. We estimate we'll finish this around March of 2022.\n\nIn our third phase, we'll work to get Arti ready for production client use. We also expect that this will involve a lot of fine-tuning, experimentation, and fixing issues in response to early experimentation and user experience. We expect we'll finish this around September of 2022.\n\nAnd in our fourth phase, we'll be working on anti-censorship features (including bridges and pluggable transports). We think we can do that in a single additional month, wrapping up around October of 2022.\n\nBeyond that, the plans are unwritten (and so far, unfunded). The next priority will probably be programming support for v3 onion services, and after that, all the other missing client-side features that users need.\n\nAnd then? We also want support for running a Tor Relay in Rust. That will require a great deal of additional effort, but it should help significantly with the network's performance, reliability, security, and pace of development.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For The Existing C Tor Implementation?\n\nDepending on whether you're an optimist, you might say that that the C Tor code isn't going anywhere soon. Or you might say that its days are numbered.\n\nIn order to make the time to work on Arti, we need to devote our resources in that direction. We expect that in the coming years, we will spend more and more time programming in Rust, and less in C. Eventually, once our Rust implementation of Tor is a good replacement for our C implementation, we will stop adding new features to the C implementation, and eventually drop support for it entirely.\n\nBut that's far off, for now. At present, we're going to continue supporting and developing our C Tor as a client and relay. We expect that the pace of new features in C will slow, but we will continue fixing issues, shipping bugfixes, and solving important problems in our C code, until Rust is ready to replace it entirely. We will work to keep C Tor users secure, safe, and private, until it is finally ready to be replaced.\n\nHow Can I Try Out Arti?\n\nRemember, don't try it yet if you want security or privacy, since it won't give you those.\n\nIf you'd like to try Arti with TorBrowser, you can read the instructions in our CONTRIBUTING.md file. They assume that you have cargo installed, and that you know how to build rust programs.\n\nIf you'd like to write a Rust program using Arti, have a look at the arti-tor-client crate. For now, you're probably better off using ours instead of the one on crates.io. (Remember, these APIs aren't stable, and are subject to change without warning.)\n\nHow Can I Follow Along With Development?\n\nWe're going to be posting updates in a bunch of different ways, to see what works best for everybody.\n\nFirst off, we'll be posting regular updates (more technically and more frequently than you'd really want from this blog) on the tor-dev mailing list, and eventually on a dedicated website.\n\nSecond, we're going to be recording some of our regular meetings and posting them on the Tor Project's YouTube channel in a dedicated playlist. There we'll be talking about what to work on next, how to organize and schedule, and generally keeping track of pace and priorities.\n\nThird, we hope to be hosting regular public hackathons and programming sessions for interested developers. More information as it develops!\n\nHow Can I Help?\n\nFor now, we most need developers and documentation -- especially you're already familiar with Rust or Tor, but even if you're not.\n\nThe CONTRIBUTING.md document has a few suggestions of where to start, but it's still pretty new.

Coders historically serve a purpose to make tasks easier, from the creation of languages, compilers, kernels, userlands, operating systems, libraries, desktop environments to applications, websites, markups and APIs that save time and need of training to create and publish new content or software. That's the whole reason why computers and the internet are widely popular, because of the tools they're built with. So much rides on the groundbreaking work of the past and continued support and refinement for past and new technologies.\n\nI don't know how people expect adoption of something that doesn't make tasks easier. Sure, I can compile code using terminal commands, but if someone scripts/automates the process, they're a hero to me and most everyone else. Business thrive on automation and shortcuts toward creating, maintaining, debugging, troubleshooting and providing support for products and services.\n\nWrite once, save everyone's time.

In /Config, we apparently can manage how Tor is used in Zeronet. Per the description, making connections go thru the Tor network make it slower for the peers to connect and data transfer of the big file is slower too. It is cost of the anonymity i think. [...]\n\nTor meek bridging allows Tor peers to connect. I don't know if disabled disallows Tor peers to connect to your node, but if that's the case, Tor peers would still be able to access via other peers.\n\nTo further answer scararoot's questions, sites using WebTorrent are not private because WebTorrent uses WebRTC. Torrenting using an external application isn't private either unless the external application uses i2P or a trustworthy VPN. ZeroNet's torrent protocol is configured  differently than those two to protect your identity if Tor is properly set up, but WebTorrent and BitTorrent are separate from ZeroNet's implementation, so where they're used, there's a risk, and ZeroNet has no control over them, only its own implementation.\n\nSome sites use external, clearnet JavaScript, so uMatrix or uBlock Origin (I think uBO is one of them) is needed to block them. They also block WebRTC if I remember right. They are browser extensions. Be sure you know the browser extension is properly configured before possibly risking exposure.\n\nSome firewall apps can be used to block clearnet access from the browser, thus blocking clearnet scripts and WebRTC, but on Android if you don't have root access, that would be at the alternative cost of not being able to use Tor, i2P or a VPN, because some firewalls use the VPN module instead of hosts files to work without root access, meaning Tor, i2P and VPNs are unavailable while the VPN module is occupied by a rootless firewall app.",

This is the case for everything networked.\n\nI don't imply that IP addresses are attached to files, but the packets containing file pieces need to know where to be routed for delivery. Forcing encryption helps privacy some, but tunneling via Tor, i2P or a trustworthy VPN is better, because adversaries could be peers. Tunneling forwards packets through an additional encrypted channel per server connection so the sender and receiver don't see the destination and origin, meaning they don't get to see each other. Tor and i2P are better than a VPN because a VPN only forwards packets through one server hop, so the VPN could possibly pry to see the complete delivery route of packets. Tor and i2P use multiple server hops, like a courier service with a minimum of three deliverers that don't get to know the full delivery route.",

I imagine it would be the best layman's explanation, however.\n\nIt's rather complex to wrap your mind around in full detail without visually portraying/mapping out how they work. I don't even know how cryptographic handshakes work, but maybe I can reason out how they might.\n\nThe point though is that the identities' user.json file(s) you wish to keep anonymous need(s) to be used **only** with Tor and never without, as Tor is most recommended in preserving your anonymity on ZeroNet. It's the best supported protocol for technical and privacy reasons. So, yes, you can assume the anonymity of your identity or identities to be permanently compromised (you instead had dubbed \"poisoned\") if ever used without Tor. The files are safe  either way, but when anonymity should be assumed to be compromised, adversaries may know it's you behind those identities, and they can't be expected to forget. Assume that they know from that point forth. It's like a superhero who tried to be anonymous being found outside their lair wearing their bodysuit but without the mask. Tor is the mask and the username is the bodysuit, like Batman's masks that hide his facial features and bone structure completely. The bodysuit is useless for anonymity if ever seen worn without a mask. Some ZeroNet ID providers allow you to change usernames for a public key in your users.json, but that won't renew anonymity because the public key remains. A separate users.json file would be needed.\n\n\"Bruce Wayne?! You're Batman?! You're Batman!!\"",

I wouldn't know how they did it.\n\nI've known about the hardware backdoors, but otherwise, not very long ago, my emails were being intercepted (SSL alerts suggested this and it happened with more than one email), but it wasn't sensitive information. The prying eyes were looking for something, but what they were looking for was nonexistent. Someone knowledgeable on this responded to me sharing this story, saying that it had to be an investigation. So, regardless of backdoors, the resources are there to find information that you may expect to be privately kept. It doesn't matter the email provider either. It was both Gmail and ProtonMail. No email newsletter nor common website uses PGP or GPG, so interception of such a source of information is trivial for those who can perform MitM attacks.\n\nI've not done anything to cause harm, but regardless, someone thought I might have or thought I was a threat. I think it's likely there was suspicion of child abuse since I've received a jailbait email many years before. I've only responded in kind \"I have no interest in such things, officer.\" The suspicion pops up out of the blue. Although, I've donated to causes of those who've upset whores of the Military Industrial Complex, but that's not or at least wasn't illegal, knowing full well that the goal was to expose war crimes, not vulnerable people, and had been carried out by those parties with professional care.\n\nPeople assume a lot about me, and it's both laughable and sad, but in the end they're wasting their time and making fools of themselves.\n\nI'm not worried, having nothing to hide, but the results of the suspicions speak to greater issues of information security. When governments have the tools to rip open your privacy, you can bet someone else had them too or will obtain them. This is what happened with the CIA. They've been hacked and their tools had been exfiltrated. There is a potential cascading of vulnerability to more than just government entities, and that's where my concern lies. I could easily become too broke to feed myself if my financial information is found by a malicious actor. I've made calls to hospitals and utility companies to be vigilant and keep their software updated. One hospital franchise was already on it. If we ignore vulnerabilities in hardware and software, cyberwarfare could come our way. There is a national security issue in having backdoors or unknown vulnerabilities everywhere.\n\nUnder an oppressive regime or living in a country targeted for regime change, this needs to be remembered. In the event that your country becomes rogue, you have to be ready. If you ignore these things becoming your reality, you could easily become imprisoned, executed or murdered for pissing off the powerful. You don't want to let them know you're resisting their power if you become the greatest, immediate existential threat to them and if you value your life. At least survive long enough to expose high crime.\n\nWhoever thinks we're full of shit has their heads in the clouds and clearly doesn't understand what had happened during their unconscious existence.\n\nNumismatist, worry not about educating the doubters who couldn't be bothered to pay attention before nor do the research themselves now. I'm the kind who prefers warning labels to be abolished so that the ignorant find their way out of the gene pool. I seriously hope idiots don't stop eating Tide Pods, and I'm saddened that the woman who lit a quarter stick of dynamite thinking it was a candle had lost her fingers instead of her life. Those things breed and vote. Though, I guess I can say I'm a hypocrite since I've backed you up.",

The site only lists the file. ZeroNet points to the IP addresses and port numbers of users who have the file chunks where a connection is possible and sends copies of the chunks to peers requesting the file while both are online. The peer who clicked to download the file isn't a seeder until they have all chunks of the file.\n\nThe problem is that some people don't keep their device that runs ZeroNet on/online or they have a very unreliable internet connection. They might even be saturating their internet connection's bandwidth with other online activities that happen to be very demanding of upload bandwidth. This prevents files from propagating as soon as possible.\n\nIt's like BitTorrent. Say you went to a website to download a Linux ISO or Blender movie. The website works fine, but that doesn't have any bearing on seeders being available for files you want to download via BitTorrent or similar protocol. You've downloaded the ZeroNet site IFS rather quickly a good while ago as it isn't very large, and the site remains on your device, so it was no problem revisiting, but seeders of the file you try to download from that site aren't available for whatever personal reasons.\n\nZeroNet doesn't behave like a clearnet cloud service, file sharing clearnet website nor video sharing clearnet website anymore than BitTorrent does, except that people can opt in to automatically download new files and you can make a ZeroNet proxy download the file if it isn't already downloading all new files. The original seeder has to be online long enough that another peer downloads a full copy of the file. The more seeders, the more likely the file may be available if any of them go offline for any reason. More seeders online also gives more total bandwidth to the file, so assuming everyone has 1Mb/s upload speed there are 100 seeders of the file, you have 75Mb/s download speed, and John/Jane has 25Mb/s download speed, then there is enough seeder bandwidth for you and John/Jane to download the file at your full internet connections' download speeds at the same time.\n\nIn essence, seeders have to be more reliable, and manually tell proxies to download or more peers should probably automatically download files if they have a fast enough internet connection and feel safe about coming back to a bunch of never before personally seen files. It's a voluntary process. Another issue is one completely out of most people's hands unless they setup a VPS (but even a VPS needs time to download from you and/or other peers with slow upload bandwidth), and that's the fact that most residential internet connections have a very slow upload speed, usually 1Mb/s at least in the US, plus most ZeroNet peers are in China, connecting to outside peers with Tor, which is slow because of its multiple layers of encryption going through multiple nodes (It's the cost that comes with privacy under an oppressive regime that imprisons people for communicating over the internet by unapproved means). It's a bottleneck with all P2P software and even the clearnet that residential upload speeds pale in comparison to download speeds, but P2P software can also scale enormously in bandwidth with a large number of seeders to meet your full available download speed, so there the plus side of P2P. Not much can be done about these problems beyond what already listed. However, there's another I've not heard of others trying but will work: If you want to share a large file, you could run ZeroNet on multiple devices on the same LAN (router), have them all download a copy (it will be faster since there's no internet connection requirement between them to be a bottleneck), then connect each device to routers on different internet connections. For instance, I could theoretically have one device at my mother's house, another at my father's house, another at my grandparents' house, another at a friend's house, my uncle's house, my cousin's house, etc. to make the file upload to strangers around the world faster and with better redundancy. It's an idea I've thought about trying, but it would come with an expense. It would get the file off the ground faster than even uploading the same file to YouTube. You should however make sure you have the additional port that ZeroNet would benefit in internet upload speed from opened or forwarded to the device running ZeroNet. Another known strategy is that if the file is on the clearnet, then make sure everyone knows where to get the exact same file and manually drop it into the folder where ZeroNet or BitTorrent would save it to, so then they can bypass the wait to become a seeder.\n\nIf you weren't familiar with ZeroNet functioning like BitTorrent or you weren't familiar with BitTorrent, no worries. I'll explain what else you need to know just like I did here as best as I can. We can break this subject down into individual questions or parts. I've thrown at you as much as I can at once just in case you wanted a full explanation first.\n\nIf this was too much to grasp, what I do is keep reading even though I'm only taking in a few bits of information at a time, re-read and read some some more until I better grasp it. Take a break if you have to. Don't force yourself to understand more than your brain can absorb in one pass. A lot of things have taken me multiple readings to better absorb the information.\n\nNote that I don't know what you know or don't know. For all I know, you may have known about BitTorrent, but didn't catch mention of similarities ZeroNet has with it or you didn't make the connection. I've been like this on other subjects many years ago. I'm very patient and understanding.",

I'd say it's finally become too hot to ignore the censorship that already exists and more to come, not just to the EU, but the US. Every major publisher and big tech company is starting to like where this is going. And, where big tech gets in legal trouble like with the Russia scare over the US 2016 election, the laws might change to force them to further censor their services when already they make false positive detection of spam and have no human oversight, so post reports are taken at face value just like with Twitter and YouTube, and all the while nobody at these companies are screening out CP. It's all about pu$hing smaller publishers and websites off the internet. If they can make monied interests happy with advanced screening technologies, even if broken, it will become law eventually.\n\nThe only silver lining here is that counteractive technologies like ZeroNet come into existence as a result.\n\nI'm not even conservative and yet I've been worried about where governments are going.\n\nWelcome to the ZeroNet family. I hope we all get along at least for having a common interest fundamental to freedom of speech online.

I like computing (and also maths) because they are aside from the real world, where no one gets offended and there are no opinions.In maths, the only thing that should matter is reaching correct solutions.In computing, the only thing that should matter is writing code that just works.And yes, in the way there will be confrontations about whether a snippet of code works better and faster than other, but that should have nothing to do with IRL stuff. Ever.I fucking hate the world. I fucking hate that people get offended and that they start crying out loud. So I take refuge in both maths and computing. And one of these seems to be falling apart.\n\nI feel the same. It's Anita Sarkeesian/Hillary Clinton politics to call non-sexist/non-racist things, words and people sexist/racist. This distracts from actual sexism and racism.

SJW is just a tool. I am sure - those so called feminists and transgenders who force CoCs and witch hunt are not feminists and transgenders at all. They are not interested in minorities support and protection. [...]\n\nA minority of them might be feminist and/or transgender, but they don't realize they're mostly surrounded by fakers and attention seekers with an agenda where they flock. They are definitely a minority in the feminist and queer communities, and yet are the loudest, trying to turn every honest mistake, fetish and manhood into a reason to be alienated/ostracized. You've nailed it on the head.\n\nIt's not only bad for things like this, but also bad for the co-opted movements and their people. We lose respect from some and some are afraid they will offend us. It creates a huge emotional divide with the rational ones yelling from the chasm of the canyon and the rest at the cliff tops, hoping people hear us when we say we're not all batshit insane.

Or will this feature more content in the future? [...]\n\nI achieved it with anchor tags around img tags, then including target=_\"top\" in the base tag. Videos had to be converted from WebM to MP4 to play in the browser instead of download. It used to be that having URL safe characters for the video file names would allow VLC to open, %20 for spaces, but for some reason that stopped working. Browsers are not very predictable with what they do for video files, but playing in the browser is 100% the case now.\n\nI used to think that because my browsers couldn't download the videos in entirety that this meant ZeroNet gets stuck. There is apparently a limitation to file sizes. I'm thinking of putting categories of videos up as icons on the front page so there will be game trailers and Creative Commons movies at the very least. Big Buck Bunny was up there in WebM and seemed fine. Sintel seemed problematic due to MP4 size (it comes in MOV originally and my video converter doesn't support  to-WebM conversation, only from-WebM), but I'll give it another shot. MP4 is still the standard because Apple sucks and as mentioned MP4 files get special treatment by browsers.

You don't need CJDNS to run ZN over IPv6, and you're not going to make your ZN node accessible over IPv6 using CJDNS (hint: because CJDNS isn't actually using IPv6 addresses, it's just using hex based addressing and ripping off the name), and that's what the post implied. [...]\n\nNote that they've been aware of CJDNS and non-CJDNS incompatibility and they've informed me before you gave me a detailed explanation.\n\nAnyway, I'm unfollowing this thread. I'm not on forums for the drama. Focus on discussing how ZeroNet and its upcoming patches should be designed, guys. I won't name anyone.\n\nA few Zeronetizens get angry easily or come up with conspiracy theories about others. This isn't good for the community. Even during struggles, frustrations should be contained. It's not always easy, but we know what keeping our cool is good for.\n\nI'm personally not affected from start to finish. I try to understand the subject material, don't mind if I don't know everything right away, don't give a shit who said what (correction or filling in is good enough), and I don't catch people's anger, so I'm not feeding the flame that's burning bridges between the wise and/or skillful here. Don't feel shame nor anger at this being pointed out. Some are aware of their own irritability and others are not. The point is that this is the worst way for us to go about conversation. Some need to be reminded.\n\nDisarm the anger. Be calm as a Hindu cow. Indulge in memes, run laps, whatever.\n\nMe, I'm worried about potential of liver cancer or cirrhosis, and I can't stress over it even though I'm jaundiced ever since I nearly killed myself. I've been violent and even got cabin fever. So, am I perfect and you're not? Nope. I'm pretty sure I'm the biggest fuckup ever, and still, we all have to work on our own emotions. Nobody else will fix it. Stress simply isn't healthy.\n\nYour reputations aren't vulnerable; only your emotions are.\n\nPeace.☮️",

Hope this helps\n\nI know those two as being the most common for browser connections, 440 as well. I'll keep testing TB. It's hard to tell if it's at least improving my connection. It seems faster with a VPN, which suggests Sprint might be throttling websites and ZeroNet/BitTorrent or it's a radio keepalive issue. I like that both the library and TB (sort of) have 443 open and I can have TB automatically disable in trusted WiFi hotspot. The library probably doesn't allow certain requests either, but that's untested. Anything for speed, at least, amiright or amiright? I'll try creating trackers on steady connections, unrelated to the VPN stuff, though a combo might be good to try as well since VPNs add some security and who knows if those other broadband connections are also throttled.",

I think in my case the facial femininity/masculinity is easily overlooked by those men in particular. Pheremones supposedly aren't detectable by people, but I think they register subconsciously.\n\nAnd it's definitely true what you say about everyone having a scope of attraction.\n\nSome aspects of attraction change with age or chemical effects for some, I believe. Otherwise old married people would have trouble fucking. Sexualities may also flip, which is a common personal report by trans women, but not all of them. Then there's romance, which often correlates with sexuality, but not always. For a guy, I've always mostly been hyperheterosexual (PTSD amplified it) while also knowing a handsome guy's face when I see it, but feeling like I'm homoromantic.\n\nSexuality can be influenced by nerve connections between sensory organs, sexual organs and the brain. I've experienced changes there in transition. Since I couldn't get to my endocrinologist to renew my HRT prescription, I see that from before transition to present, I'm no longer hypersexual.\n\nThere are also studies showing that the stress hormone cortisol causes an increase in estrogen by converting progesterone. I wonder if a lifetime of extreme stress can influence sexuality, but that isn't confirmed. It might a little or none at all. Since genetically sound members of either sex share all the same hormones but leaning one way or another, it would probably be better for me to assume stress doesn't effect change on sexuality.",

It runs while the page is open, defaulted at 50% CPU and can be disabled from the page, though the setting doesn't stick for me. It won't run outside the site.\n\nThe reason it's detected as a Trojan is because there have been modified versions used in site drive by attacks, alleged harm to phones and such.

It's a bit too good to be true, that I know. I could buy a house if they're not bullshitting, and I find it hard to believe yet, but I'll wait and see.\n\nAnd, even while Bitcoin turned out legit, at the time I learned about it, Mt. Gox was the center of attention. They ran with people's money.\n\nThen, banks took over Bitcoin with Lightning instead of actually resolving its problems, slapping regulatory cruft onto it. You'll see a video about it on KopyKate BIG Official.\n\nAnd yeah, I see fiat money as being part of the problem. We can create something of more physical value rather than just appreciation, as there are extremely valuable/rare materials out there that could make a $10,000USD's value coin. Or, how about energy as a currency? One of these will work if people move toward those, the material value one being most likely. I don't feel so much like all these fad coins will gain enough traction, especially if they're not decentralized. Some have flopped hard or turned out a scam.\n\nThen again, I'm no expert, just an observer, so research before deciding whether or not you believe me. I have knocked on Bitcoin before and felt proven wrong, though I see some apparently not so great news about it beyond obvious FUD that I can believe.\n\nThere's a lot of noise and so little clarity out there for a number of them, whether they're up to standards on security/trust, tangibility/appreciation and improving upon those standards or not.\n\nConsider my understanding to still be poor and not trusting of any of this.

[...]\n\n(My unprofessional opinion incoming) I don't see JavaScript as necessary for \"sexiness,\" but for interactive functionality. I don't know what other way this could be done, but it possibly leads to a very good question: How can we have sites as apps (preforming highly interactive data handling) without JavaScript or limit to a subset of JavaScript that can't allow anything malicious? If there's answer to this, it needs to be explored, because people will try to fuck over others. There are a few sites trying to run CoinHive abusively, they're absolute shit and a waste of everyone's time, but the point is to find a way to prevent nasty web software from running in the first place for people who can't afford the alternative since sites like that ruin trust when people need trust. Blocklists are limited to awareness of the people who own them as much anything else people own, like antivirus software. No antivirus is perfect. Only recently had one of us discovered those jerk sites, so if it wasn't obvious before that we can't make all of ZeroNet safer for blocklist users, it should be now. I hope there's a way people can use ZeroNet in a very locked down fashion, maybe not losing functionality of sites that employ something safer, and/or wait for the user to whitelist programmatic code to run.",

How is the graphics performance, if for example one want to run 3d applications or games?\n\nI think KDE has the best compositor if the distro has it properly configured, because you can set display refresh rate (good for monitors above 60Hz). Some distros are butter smooth with rendering. You'll see it with the mouse moving across the desktop, which can mean that you will have less stutter in games.\n\nIt's really hit and miss between distros and releases though, unless a lot had changed since I've been distro hopping.",

I notice only new large files slowing down the next signing, proportional to a new file's size, so adding a new file later isn't last stretch of time + signing new file(s) stretch of time. It's only going to sign large static files once each.\n\nI make tons of tiny changes to 4Kave's tiny documents. There are under 16GB of optional files, videos hundreds of megabytes to over a gigabyte each. It would be tremendously slow had ZeroNet been re-signing unchanged large files, but as I said above, that's not going to be how it works. I sign from the side bar, exactly the same no matter what I add or change. Files won't take a longer que to get through if everything else is signed.\n\nSo, say it takes your computer ten minutes to sign a terabyte of optional files. First you signed index.html saying \"Content coming soon!\" and the site signed and published in a millisecond. Next, you added 100GB of new optional files and it took a minute just that once because it won't be redone. You changed index.html after that to say \"Still more to come!\" and again it only took a millisecond. Then, 400GB of newer optional files, four minutes. \"December update!\" just a millisecond. 500GB of the latest optional files, five minutes. \"Done!\" one millisecond.\n\nOf course if you didn't already sign new optional files, they will grow the delay to sign changes to index.html because of the que being longer, but still, just one time each file.\n\nNow, if you change a large file, like correct a brick texture in the Milltown Ultra High Definition Texture Pack ZIP file or you made a mistake in a video, my guess is that the large file will be re-signed and take the full time of any equally sized new file would, but I don't know this, having only put up files that I don't plan on changing. I'm still very sure though that it would in that case. You can test this pretty quickly, buuuut unless you REALLY regret the older version going up before the final version of the large file, then leave it. If you wanted to change just the brick texture, you should keep all textures as separate files instead of a massive archive file, else you'll probably lose seeders for all of the textures instantly. I think a big glob of file risks unrelated file pieces being changed unnecessarily for the slightest update to it, like re-delivering a whole movie saga pack to every past customer just because you created one new sequel.",

Files are signed independently and shouldn't be signed again unless changed, but the sha's have to be aggregated afterwards somehow to show these are the valid files according to the zite owner. If I'm not mistaken this would mean a lot of small files will be slower to sign than a couple of big files, if only one of them is changed. Would like some input from someone more experienced though.\n\nIt's file size(s), not number of files.",

It may be likely that at most there is one species reminiscent of our intelligence per galaxy.\n\nWe will probably be more likely to find anything like us through the multiverse if it is accessible at all and then you know that we're talking about an extremely long stretch of time before we get to that point where we are capable of doing that.\n\nI think the best evidence of a multiverse we might have would be the black spot in the cosmic background radiation. I think that slight difference in the laws of physics between our universe in an adjacent universe would probably show up as a cancellation of certain detectable particles waves or forces. Essentially two parallel universes just barely noticeably out of phase. Sine waves not lining up but only noticed at the furthest corner of the overlap between these universes.\n\nOr was it gravity and not cosmic background radiation I'm not sure. Because isn't gravity the only thing that transcends universes? Maybe virtual particles.\n\nAnyway it's just a matter of thinking about how we got here and how improbable it is for any other alien life to become anything like us.

It is not ideal approach to show all the shit content to newbies and expect them to go thru all of it and block existing bad content and future bad content (after seeing it). Some kind of community assistance (not only site admin, not only a few mods) in marking bad content as such may help. And i vote for such content be hidden by default with easily accessible option in user profile to unhide it. Though no one came with an antib0t system which would be reliable in this. So we have to relly on site admin and mods (all these die and disappear soon or later) to keep the site clean from content they treat harmful.\n\nI think tagging would make for more honesty.

The reason most mainstream churches in the United States never criticize the US government is that back in the 1960's (during the Vietnam war) Lyndon Johnson managed to convince most of them to be converted into non-profit corporations in order to avoid taxes (a total con job, by the way).  So, now that they are corporations, the government can dissolve them and confiscate their assets if they don't do whatever the government tells them to do, just like all other corporations are subject to.  This all goes on out of the eye of the public, because what church would like it's members to know that its doctrine and policies are actually subject to control by the government?\n\nMy mother had gotten some strange attention from a pastor for telling her interpretation of the Bible, telling other church goers to keep an eye on her.

It is likely  that more common desktop linux distributions will officially run on raspberry pi 4 but i would suggest the system should be completely loaded into RAM at boot because SD cards are not good with read/write cycles (I.E. just as in puppy linux). I am curious if Pi4 could be used as a terminal server (something like LTSP.org ) to improve performance of an old laptop which has not much more than 1GB. I definitely would prefer 2 Ethernet instead of 2 HDMI for that. In such setting it could nicely host something like a tor gateway as well. And of couse a zeronet bundle! I heard  the GPU part stil relies on proprietary stuff anyway, but that way it would not really require it.\n\nI'd go for Pro Grade SD cards.

The mechanism for biofilm formation is a function of quorum sensing between the individuals. Staph, Strep, and many others function in this way. They are harmless when present in reasonable numbers. Studies show that lactobacillus interferes with the process of communication and prevents quorum sensing forcing these bacterial populations to remain non virulent.

The probability comes from the idea that energy resources of a Dyson sphere would be applied to simulation instead of the needs of the creators of the Dyson sphere.\n\nEven as a dream by a supreme machine, it's a waste.

Our Indian friend was never bothered by it and had similar acknowledgement of India's rampant perversion. It's known that India has a rape culture, not that the US doesn't have some of it too. Our white trans woman friend accused us and a black woman to be Nazis. She wouldn't read the articles I shared about the problem. We scathed her for her stupidity. We're since blocked. This is the only trans woman we personally knew to be like this. I think we told her she's racist to ignore what Indian women suffer through.\n\nNow, if I share Count Dankula's \"Gib Wife\" video, I know in certain circles I'd be accused of being racist, but we aren't remotely in them anymore.\n\nThe SJW thinks that sexism and rape culture is just a US white people problem and actively ignores all evidence that women are being kidnapped and raped in other particular countries, because they're brown-skinned. So they assume that brown people cannot do harm. That's how bad they are.\n\nAnd, to be clear, I do know that in the US, some people blame victims and come out of the woodwork to defend sex offenders, even mental health workers do.\n\nIt only makes sense to not ignore these problems wherever they happen to be, but the SJW does not sympathize with brown women, because they think that would be racist.",

I didn't feel his motivations, and the things that happened to him weren't very good at gathering empathy from the audience. He for the most part was forwarding the plot by pulling out a gun. You don't really get into his mindset. I think any other movie where the main character has enough with the evil in the city could have made a better Joker flick. I imagine something like between Taxi Driver (Travis Bickle) and The Shining (Jack Torrence) for a Joker origin.\n\nArthur Fleck seems impossible to feel for.

They may be good at writing and reading sequential data, which is what happens when you dump some nice 4k ALL-I 400mbps GH5 footage on one, for instance, but it may be struggling heavily with small files. I tried running Zeronet with the data directory on a NAS attached via a 1GBPS connection, which is some 100-120MB/s throughput, and it was a chore just browsing zero. The latency and iops of the magnetic disks killed the experience. SD cards have a similar problem, and even if they were quick enough and didn't wear out rather quickly, having the site there would be a bit of a choppy experience due to the slow access of numerous small files. I've got more than 100k files in my data folder, and it's not even a huge amount of stuff.\n\nOkay. I'm thinking I should only get one for recording videos if that really matters to me.",

The Jewish blooded people I know are in no way any of that and are actually Christian, a few others possibly being agnostic or atheist. Ethnicity has corellation with religion as much as geography does, and we don't ever have a whole population unanimously agree on one idealogy. Why does this hate toward them happen?

There will also be the time, when the era of representative democracy will be over and the first sign away from that is the Swiss direct democracy, which in turn itself will be replaced with something one day.

Also, it depends how deep you think of it being true and usable in real life, say, if knowing a lot about video games gets you friends in school then that's a good incentive to keep on playing, on the same note if it fills dreams in your heart (like truly living a magic medieval world or dating a girl with cat-ears, you name it). As for the 'more bad than good' part, it mostly applies to kids that have it harder than grown-ups to tell between real world and virtual videogame worlds (and all the way said worlds behave). So they could end making weird dances in public, raising sticks and chanting spells waiting for powers to imbue them, or evicting certain places like the plague, fearing that only bad things happen inside those (hospitals, prisons, generally any closed family oriented business at night). With that last note, it applies to general media too, so in short the issue here is that videogames exploit boundless creativity that sets it truly apart from real world and some of its consumers sometimes fail to tell the difference from real and fake, or at least, that what works in one doesn't necessarily in the other. Also, if you aren't a stable person, or have your wrongly set up on something then video games won't do bad for your perception but will show how things are done (let's say you wanna die and you play DDLC, or you understand that some bullies at your school won't ever be punished unless you do something and you learn how to, uh, 'deliver justice?').\n\nI'm gonna have to disagree with your thesis.",

The architecture of the ZeroNet is that signed copies of files are shared and if a ZeroNet site, generally called as zite, has a newer version, let's say, the original author of a zite adds another entry to its blog, then a newer signed version of the file(s) get(s) distributed around. Forums like the current one contain multiple posts, which are signed files. It is possible to distribute sound files like OGG, MP3, WAV, etc. but the classical streaming is not possible.

They're broadcasted, and received by a client in real time. IE a direct p2p communication, not reading files from a website. You can't \"host\" a radio like that. Likewise you can't really decentralize something like that. You can enable p2p sharing to help reduce the load on the streamer, and there's definitely tech to do that, but it's still ultimately centralized (receiving a broadcast from a particular person/group). I'm not really seeing what benefit using ZN would bring in that regard.\n\nP2P cuts internet connection speed requirements for the host. If a radio stream is 1Mb/s, then my connection can multiply the bandwidth six times. This could be done for listening or in the background. The alternatives are IPFS or WebTorrent, and we all know those are not exactly polished like ZeroNet is.\n\nDo you or do you not want that?

Before then, I've only played a tiny bit with HTML and HTTP servers.\n\nMany shitposts were made as I was learning or thinking I was learning. I eventually figured things out. Some of my posts were bogus for knowledge and I didn't know at the time.\n\nI now try to help other people to get them through the humps that I've run into much faster.\n\nI'm also one of a handful of autists here, but don't attribute me being occasionally a bit abrasive to that. I just choose to be like that in a few threads, hate not required. I turn around and sometimes include myself to be fair with my comments, and still might show a nice side immediately after. I'm not really edgy anymore though, gladly. I was really bad in the past, because I was at a low point in my life with severe depression.\n\nI make discoveries once in a great while, like how to extract algae oil passively, or how to make an excessively potent silver solution.\n\nWhat people credit my intelligence for is mostly just me not being afraid to experiment and not overcomplicating problems either (KISS). But, I've tested with a genius-level IQ. Either way, I prefer not to be looked at as better than other people. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and I don't think those tests expose my weaknesses. If people saw my weaknesses, then I'd be treated more fairly, and I would prefer that. Otherwise, I'm judged at the extremes, excessively praised or ridiculed, and I don't like that. It also socially maroons me.\n\nNow, back to ZeroNet. I always wanted BitTorrent technology to be built into a web standard, and ZeroNet is as close as it gets, with the exception of IPFS. ZeroNet beats IPFS for ease of development and ease of use, so I was excited to learn about it.\n\nI've stopped using clearnet social networks because of censorship. That means I've left some friends behind, but censorship was becoming a very big concern, since YouTube was deleting what I wanted people to see, Google+ possibly worsening that with shadow banning of content, and MeWe trying to protect my precious feelings. I've had enough and decided it was time to leave all of that behind, with the exception that I use Videoder, which accesses YouTube, but I sometimes promote ZeroNet, so I bring purpose with my continued, ad-free use of YouTube.",

You can discover websites with Zerosites and such, announce stuff on zerotalk and zerome, do comments, do likes. Only lacks views and dislikes, really.Also, LBRY isn't that decentralized. I'm pretty sure you still need their website in order to do anything, and you can't easily change stuff in your own video website like with a zeronet website.Also,  I am very serious, okay? :(\n\nI've known you as a lighthearted joker.

Sure there are places like zeronet, freenet, tor and mastodon as examples where you can basically say and post whatever you want but you deal with alot of bullshit trolls and twisted ppl and it can be offensive and confusing for new people. not knocking the networks as they have their place, but the closest thing to an actual Facebook replacement that i know of is MEWE. and their censorship policies are nowhere near the level of Facebook. also worth noting, they don't collect your data. (So they say anyway).. cant hurt to investigate it.\n\nOkay. Well, I guess I've over-reacted to what little censorship it enforced.

The main feature of the WebM video formathttps://www.webmproject.org/is that the whole video does not need to be downloaded to display part of the video. Therefore WebM-video files should be particularly easy to remix. That's what YouTube uses by default. Basically, Your proposition is nice and all, but it's just a regular web software project, nothing that requires some extra video encoder or container format. Given that ZeroNet zites are stored locally by default, the client-side video re-mixing should work even better, faster, with ZeroNet than with the classical WWW.\n\nI know.

A workaround to it might be to use the NilFS file system for the root partition, but the NilFS has a security flaw that one user can access the files of another user. The NilFS is fine for robotic applications, where there is only one user and no internet connection, but for anything networked the NilFS can be an issue. Root partition file system has to be available during boot time and therefore it has to be compiled into the kernel, not loaded with modprobe. Compiling a custom kernel can be a lot of work.

You can always unpin your file(s) at a later time...   Fairly Easy!\n\nDon't listen to vcrovuep4lnye2b9. IFS has nothing to do with IPFS.",

There is a wiki, but I just remember some important bits about making trackers. You need to forward a port to your computer matching the file server port number on the [Config](/Config/) page. If you do in fact have an open port, then go into the [Plugins](/Plugins/) page and activate the Bootstrapper plugin.\n\nYou can also use Yggdrasil to have a Yggdrasil ZeroNet tracker. Just enter the Ygg address on the Config page after you've successfully done the above. It's the \"File server external ip\" input box.",

Inherently P2P hosting automatically favours content that is popular because more people watch/seed it. It's a bit like the concept of bumping a thread. I love it. I believe in decentralised, P2P networking. I just can't fathom it hasn't taken off yet because normie web is now 99,99% compromised. The time to migrate here is now.

In particular, too many things about its inner workings are unknown to an average person, and and can't be known without a specific culture. For instance:I run ZeroNet under Windows and continuously received messages about Tor errors, use meek bridges... Uh? And why? Sometimes it worked, sometimes didn't.I run it under a Linux live distribution and it works flawlessly, although without Tor that isn't included in the distro.I tried it under Tails and it doesn't work. What does Tails have, or lack, compared to the another live distro?I created this user. What data have I to backup to be able to write as the same user under another Zeronet install, or recover it in case of failure? I created it without Tor, therefore I must remember this is a public user and to never use it for evil doings :D. This is fine, I'm looking at ZeroNet as a way to host an online community without server costs, and I don't need anonymity. But those who need it?Assuming that the public and private key couple has been generated on my machine by my local copy of the ZeroNet script, and the public key communicated to ZeroId, what prevents a modified version of the script to communicate the private key too? Can this happen, or there is some security by design?These are the questions that come to mind to someone who doesn't know how ZeroNet works in details. An average non-technical activist who looks at Zeronet as a tool for anonymous freedom of expression, may ask himself questions like these, and wonder what other issues may exist that he can't even imagine.

My apartment and I were not fit for keeping Onyx. Tamas Kocsis doesn't seem fit for continuing ZeroNet's existence anymore.\n\nAnd, I wonder if security issues are cropping up for ZeroNet as-is.
