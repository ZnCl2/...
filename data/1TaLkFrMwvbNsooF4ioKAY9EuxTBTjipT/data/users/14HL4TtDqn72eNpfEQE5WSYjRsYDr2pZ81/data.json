			"title": "Mass FM radio/TV signal piracy operation",
			"body": "Alright, let me explain my plight a little.\n\nI'll be moving interstate in about a month or so to a township near Uluru (that big fucking rock in the middle of Australia) to do some work at the resort there. I'll have some downtime on the weekends and me, being the AV geek I am, hatched an idea for a project so fucking retarded I might as well give it a shot.\n\nConsidering how remote this place is (nearest town, Alice Springs, is 5 hours away, everything else is flat desert) and the general small size of the population (some 900-odd people working at the resort plus a max of 800 guests or so, so a little under 2k people), I imagine the TV and radio situation is probably shithouse. Why don't I run a little pirate FM radio (and eventually TV) operation out of my dorm room? Who would bother to report me? It's a tiny-ass market in a remote location.\n\nI've been messing around at home with PiFMRds on my singular Pi 0 W and having that as an internet radio rebroadcaster. It seems to work mostly well other than the occasional crash (granted, it really isn't great from a general emissions standpoint, but it's nothing a little filter can't fix). The plan is to have a bunch of Pi 0 Ws broadcasting a station each, some internet radio (I've been testing with some Soma FM stations), others just playing saved content (like a podcast or audiobook format). \n\nIf possible, I'd want them to all run through a singular filter circuit and amplifier and all come out of the same antenna. Is that realistically doable or would there be a ton of interference from the different signals? I could always just invest more in multiple antennas and filters, I'd just preferably want to not do that.\n\nThere's also the question of pirate TV. I'll probably attempt to give this a shot at a later date, but I want to run a singular DVB-T station playing a variety of programming (mostly cartoons, some Adult Swim shows, a few movies here and there). Probably too much effort for something like that, but I'll see what I can import from China when the time comes.",

Why do you think they banned most VPNs?And why do you think they hated 8chan so much? Because the owners are free speech absolutists, collaborated with authorities only when strictly necessary and allowed most VPNs and Torposting. That's a big no-no for glowies.\n\nJapMoot also wants to sell user data and information, so there's that too.",
