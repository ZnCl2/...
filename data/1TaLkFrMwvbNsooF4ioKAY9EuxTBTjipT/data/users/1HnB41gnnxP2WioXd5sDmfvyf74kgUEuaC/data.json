Even though bitcoin blockchain is expensive sometimes, but for people want this level of immutability is fine. Like telegram before, people have to shorten their message. \nI personally don't think file size limit is not a problem, because for people living in China, their words are under heavy censorship in all social media. These data stored in bitcoin blockchain cannot be deleted by government, that's a major success already. \nOf course I will try to spread your project! I think it has a lot of real world use cases!",
