The way I see it is that technological progress will render the formation of a state impossible, but that will not happen for a long time.\nThe four technologies needed for this to happen are as follows:\n1. Quantum Entanglement Teleportation - Tariffs will become impossible\n2. A completely uncensored and self archiving internet protocol - Censorship will become impossible.\n3. A completely private cryptocurrency with real world value - Taxation will become impossible\n4. Widely available faster than light travel - Expansion into the stars will be impossible to regulate",
