It lets you build real time multiuser apps without writing server code, or deploying servers.\n\nHow does Croquet work?\nWhen a Croquet app starts, it automatically connects to a nearby cloud-based reflector in our worldwide fleet. The reflector mirrors user inputs to a virtual computer running on each user’s local client. Croquet makes sure these virtual computers stay in bit-identical synchronization. Every user has the same shared experience, even though no central server is coordinating things.\n\nWhat is a reflector?\nA reflector is a special type of public server located in the cloud. It's very simple and lightweight. All it does is forward events from Croquet clients to other clients that are connected to the same multiuser session. Reflectors are completely generic. Any app can use any reflector. This means that it's easy for us to deploy lots of reflectors across the globe, so everyone is close to a low-latency multiuser experience.",

ZeroNet points to the IP addresses and port numbers of users who have the file chunks where a connection is possible and sends copies of the chunks to peers requesting the file while both are online. The peer who clicked to download the file isn't a seeder until they have all chunks of the file. [...]\n\nThat is the problem indeed. I do know about BT and how ZN works. \nWhat I asked earlier is about IFS, which I don't know. But you didn't feel like sharing at the time. That's ok.\nNow I understand that IFS is not a data storing server, but simply a tracker like in BT.\nIt would be interesting to have a crawler mode for IFS and anyone else running a supernode that is willing to cache things on upload (like 0net.io).\nIf it were a data dispersal based system, the initial upload would need to complete somewhere temporarily to avoid the source disappearing and leaving behind a dead link. Then as more users come by, a small chunk+ec data could be distributed to them, even if they don't download the file. As the 'seeding' reaches a certain threshold of nodes (visitors), the temporary file is freed, and now a swarm of potential small chunks exists (along with the full downloads), where all don't need to be downloaded, because of a good error correction algorithm that can reconstruct any missing or slow chunks at its leisure.

(no CPU)\nThe statistics coming from math is only able to deal with independent random variables. (non real world)\nThe data must be changed into i.i.d. form randomized before algo can take a look. (non real world)\nThe real world is all dependent, so the models we generate are pure fiction based on randomized data and independent variables. (we can't do dependence)\n\n\nYou only get to see the rare achievements in the news, not how many failures it takes to get there. Makes it look like anyone can do it. (you can't)\n\n\nThe truth is that AI is not A nor I, today. It's just clever linear algebra. It has a very narrow purpose. (clustering & probability)\nAFAIK there is no AGI since we don't have algorithms that are scalable and don't use back propagation.\n\n\nAny algorithm that is feed-forward and uses back propagation is doomed because it ends up an incoherent black box that can't be trusted, audited or understood. It can tell you that pic is a cat, and sometimes it will tell you it's a bus. You don't know when it's going horribly wrong and all that needs to change is a pixel or two. (totally can't trust it)\n\n\nI work at a company that has solved parts of this problem, but it's relatively unknown still. We can perfectly explain the black box above given the model. Not even DARPA can do this yet. This is crucial for trust and explainability.\n\n\nMost AI should not be called AI, because AI is not a thing, or a technology, it's actually a concept.\ny=x is a simple \"AI\" because it predicts the value of x given any value of y.\nif x==1 then do y is also an example of an expert system which is a category of AI.\n\n\nWhat we're all talking about is ML which is its own category in the hierarchy of AI.\nDL is a sub class of ML, which stacks many ML models and transformations together.\nML is relatively simple, DL is a spaghetti mess.\n\n\nPeople like to call their chat bot, app & oracle AGI, but it's really just a collection of a few different ML or DL systems together. A few narrow focused systems bunched together with smoke and mirrors to make it seem like AGI.\n\n\nIf and when someone does create an AGI, they may not know it until it starts doing it's own thing at breakneck speed.\n\n\ntl;dr We currently don't have the math, statistics or algorithm technology for achieving a proper AI concept, not to mention AGI.",

It may be useful data in the future, but it's too early to tell.\n\nThis can also fall into the category of: why do we bother creating machines that mimic the human brain?\n\nWe don't understand most of the brain or ourselves as a biological machine. Why would we want machines in the same way? We wouldn't. We need machines to do things for us in predictable and correct ways better than we can ourselves. Not the other way around ;-)\n\nI'll still read about it, even though it's mostly media hype and a source of humor. \n\nLike the time they claimed a rat brain was uploaded to the cloud, when in reality they thinly sliced a rat brain, took pictures of the slices and uploaded the images.

(so far)\nWe appear to be trying to brute force it without sufficient understanding. (not good)\n\nEven if you could 3D print a brain, it wouldn't be much more than a lump of stuff you can't use as a brain, let alone a vessel to upload to, or a virtual brain. Other organs are much simpler.\n\nIn fact, I've worked on a storage system that is **so** reliable that one day it might be suitable for upload of a digitized mind, and it's so resilient and bit perfect to preserve it's exabytes of stored information, yet the human mind is lossy, doesn't perfectly remember things, and functions in a completely different associative manner. The storage system exceeds the brain in this case, yet it's not required for a brain. (ex: Westworld)\n\nLike I mentioned before, current systems are just a bunch of linear algebra. Do you need to have a talking hammer to build things? No. You just need it to do things that are not easy for you.\n\nSo it's more about augmentation, and working with these systems than having them replace  us.\n\nWe humans are so myopic, confused and blind, we assume things we see, hear and feel are all there is, when there is so much more we simply ignore because we can't prove it. Thinking we understand a biological machine if far from understanding ourselves and all the things we don't see.

When you create a record in a DNS zone, that information is stored in your nameserver. Anyone trying to resolve your domain then gets pointed (hopefully) by the centralised authority to your nameserver. Whereas GNS, being fully decentralized by design, stores that information in DHT. The validity of the records is assured cryptographically, by signing them with the private key of the respective zone.\n\nAnyone trying to resolve records in a zone of your domain can then verify the signature of the records they get from the DHT and be assured that they are indeed from the respective zone. To make this work, there is a 1:1 correspondence between zones and their public-private key pairs. The owner of a GNS zone, is really the owner of the private key. And a user accessing a zone needs to somehow specify the corresponding public key first.\n\nPeer identities are used to identify peers in the network and are unique for each peer. The identity for a peer is simply its public key, which is generated along with a private key the peer is started for the first time. While the identity is binary data, it is often expressed as ASCII string. For example, the following is a peer identity as you might see it in various places:\n\n`UAT1S6PMPITLBKSJ2DGV341JI6KF7B66AC4JVCN9811NNEGQLUN0`\n\nYou can find your peer identity by running gnunet-peerinfo -s.",

Holding them both taught and moving them up/down does not make them move towards or away from the wall, merely disturbs it surface, creating wave like effects which seem to move if we follow one of them visually. The rope and sheet do not actually change position. Still in your hands and still nailed to the wall.\n\nIf you put particles on top of their surface, the waves propagate and move the particles, but the sheet itself does not move.\n\nMIT recently did a double slit experiment using a liquid silicon surface and silicon grains, which behaved exactly the same (interference pattern behavior), but can be modeled much more simply via fluid dynamics.",

The other component is the ether or vacuum energy matrix.  \n  \nTaking this further, just like a stick in the water is not the source of the ripples, it is a component of the effect as it interacts with the water's surface.  \n  \nThe point effect observed (not an actual particle) also neatly explains why tunneling works. It's not a hard particle that has to \"tunnel\", it's an energetic effect that simply transfers the effect (energy) through the medium (bumping particles or just passing through).  \n  \nThe time conclusion is well thought out as well, since just like a particle effect, we may be experiencing a time effect.  \n  \nHence the 'present' is really the superposition of the past moving forward and the future moving backward coalescing into a point reality effect creating the 'present'.

The beta radiation emitted by the Tritium is blocked by the glass walls of the pill, but they cause the phosphorescent coating to glow. This light has no trouble passing through the glass and lands on the photovoltaic cells where it produces a small amount of electricity! Commercial Tritium batteries — like those produced by City Labs — cut out the middleman by using betavoltaic (as opposed to photovoltaic) cells in direct contact with Tritium gas. Those commercial devices are more rugged and efficient, but come with a very large price tag (thousands of USD per unit). On the other hand, homemade devices constructed using the packing tape sandwich method are as cheap as it gets, but aren’t particularly rugged.\n\nThis kit provides a good compromise between price and quality of construction. We’ve designed carrier boards for both of the photovoltaic cells which we supply pre-soldered and fixed to the boards with chipbonder. We’ve also designed and cast custom silicone rubber grommets which cushion the Tritium vials between the two photovoltaic cells, preventing the cells from getting scratched or chipped and — most importantly — the vials from getting broken. The carrier boards also allow you to choose whether the photovoltaic cells are wired in series or parallel and provide you with breadboard compatible pin spacing for the battery terminals.\n\nSo how much power does it make? Not much. The best measurement we were able to make suggests that the maximum power point of this arrangement is 25nW, if you can build a circuit that loads it properly (between 20 and 30nA at about 0.6v). Further experiments show that the battery will — given enough time — charge a capacitor to a voltage of 1.5 volts. Using this battery to do any work will likely involve a clever energy harvesting circuit, but keep in mind that this tiny amount of power will continue to flow for about 20 years — the half life of Tritium being 12 years. It’s also worth noting that these measurements were taken using green colored tritium tubes from aliexpress, your mileage may vary with the color and quality of your Tritium glow tubes. Feel free to experiment! ...\n\nhttps://github.com/sparkfunX/Nuclear_Battery_Kit",

There is an alternative email like platform called [ConfidantMail](https://confidantmail.org), which also happens to be written in Python and has notifications to a clearnet email for when you get confidantmail.
