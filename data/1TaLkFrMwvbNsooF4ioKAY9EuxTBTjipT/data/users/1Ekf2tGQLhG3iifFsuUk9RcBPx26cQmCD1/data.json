			"body": "__*长文预警*__\n不爱看长文的同学请直接翻到大字处\n\n先举五个反审查软件中文翻译的例子\n1. tor->洋葱, bitmessage->比特信\n2. psiphon->赛风\n3. i2p->i2p\n4. shadowsocks->ss\n5. i2p->大蒜路由\n\n总结一下几种方式\n1. 意译\n2. 音译\n3. 不翻译,直接照搬英文\n4. 缩写?\n5. 二重意译\n\n再说说几种方式的利与弊\n首先说不翻译(第三种),好处是方便理解,辨识度高,缺点是在中文环境输入一个含数字的英文不方便\n然后是第四种,好处是简洁且辨识度也较高,缺点同上\n接下来第二种(音译),好处也是辨识度高,缺点是可能令人产生歧义(不知道一个词是翻译名还是句子结构虚词)\n接下来说说上面三个(不翻译,缩写,音译)的**通病**\n就是这三种方式的翻译产物通常不具有其他意思(比如说赛风智能指赛风但洋葱除了指tor之外还可以指一种蔬菜),这就导致了关键词屏蔽和关键词审查的可行性\n比如说把\"赛风\"或者\"i2p\"作为审查关键词是可行的,而把\"洋葱\"作为审查关键词是不可行的,原因显而易见(因为如果把\"洋葱\"作为审查关键字那么大概农产品行业会受很大损害,政府多半不想这么做)\n\n接着谈剩下两种翻译方式并在此顺便感谢大家读长文的耐心\n结合上面的论述,可以发现当意译正好能得到一个常见原中文词(如洋葱)时,可以比较好的结合高辨识度(即中文用户能记住中文名和英文名关联性的程度)和低审查可行性,但如果意译产生的是一个不常见词(如比特信)时,虽然辨识度高,但也导致了审查可行性升高(比如说把\"比特信\"做关键词是可行的)\n\n# 不爱看长文的从此处阅读\n然后再说第五种(\"二重意译\"这个词是我自己瞎编的)\n不难发现,二重意译是当直接意译不可行的替代方案,是意译+联想的翻译方式\n例子:因为i2p与tor相似且洋葱与大蒜相似且tor->洋葱,所以i2p->大蒜\n这种翻译(或命名)方式能够大大降低关键词审查的可行性\n\n最后说ZeroNet的中文翻译问题\n1. 不翻译:ZeroNet->zeronet\n2. 意译:ZeroNet->零网\n3. 缩写:ZeroNet->zn或ZeroNet->0n\n显而易见,以上三种(四种)翻译方式的共同缺点是关键词审查的可行性太高\n\n目前我想到一种利用\"二重意译\"的解决方案\n`ZeroNet->Zn->锌(或锌网?)`\n\n如果有其他方案欢迎大家评论区补充,第一次在zn上写长文,感谢各位有耐心读完\n\n同时发布在以下链接\n[NewGFWTalk](https://0net.io/NewGFWTalk.bit/?Topic:21_1Ekf2tGQLhG3iifFsuUk9RcBPx26cQmCD1/+ZeroNet)\n[ZeroTalk](https://0net.io/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1551412773_1Ekf2tGQLhG3iifFsuUk9RcBPx26cQmCD1/+ZeroNet)\n[ZHIHU](https://0net.io/1Q9LrWv27gyToaqDXA2GF2ZSA6PhznX7z1/?Topic:1551412972_1Ekf2tGQLhG3iifFsuUk9RcBPx26cQmCD1/+ZeroNet)\n[ZeroMe](https://0net.io/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1BLueGvui1GdbtsjcKqCf4F67uKfritG49/1Ekf2tGQLhG3iifFsuUk9RcBPx26cQmCD1/1551413210)\n[GFWTalk考古专区](https://0net.io/1Nse6WcodQ5Mj6ZwvZvuyCVvQESwuxbCUy/?Topic:4_1Ekf2tGQLhG3iifFsuUk9RcBPx26cQmCD1/+ZeroNet)",

(i surly wont check my mail box at a second before the deadline 🙃)\n\ncontacts: (please speak english or chinese, or i will use google translator, which usually leads to misunderstandings)\nemail: hex3c@outlook.com\npgp: 0x428df46623333333\n\nhave a nice day🙂",
