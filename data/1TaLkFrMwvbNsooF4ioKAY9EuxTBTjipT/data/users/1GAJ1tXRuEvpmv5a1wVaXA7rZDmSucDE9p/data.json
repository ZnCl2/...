				"body": "Welcome to the wonderful(ly expensive) world of dolls. While I have not heard of anyone who has 3d printed their own, I do know of a very few who had hand sculpted and casted with resin. No small feat, I might add. Assuming you're on a budget, you could try getting them second hand from stores like Mandarake.co.jp which is where most veterans in the hobby look given the limited availability of stuff.\n\nThe expensive (mostly 1/3 60cm Volks) resin and vinyl dolls are generally collectors' items and often an outfit set would cost as much as doll. So if your daughter isn't too picky about it, I would recommend you look at brands like Parabox and Azone which cost magnitudes less and have their own line of affordable outfits. You would then want to consider adding blushing and detail to the faces (a \"faceup\") - both the cheap and expensive ones start off as pieces of plastic but it's the faceup that makes the difference.\n\nP.S. You're a great dad!",
