Just want to clarify, I don't mean 'real content development' in terms of what people may or may not like. I am referring more to the time investment of developing a quality website.\n\nwell the way i see it if nothing else its a good free place to test and develop a site, i have several on here now that i work on, some I make to try and help others gain some value out of the zeronet concept, others are personal hobbies and testing. so putting the time in to a quality site will help move it forward, as you can see just by browsing even for a short time a lot of site are very low end, now thats likely caused by the P2P nature of zeronet, ppl get concerned about storing content on their computers. that being said i develop sites as if they would be hosted in a conventional ways, size is what it is, you will have some ppl that simply wont seed and thats fine, some will and some like myself seed several sites on a separate server because i like the project as a whole and want to see it succeed.  plus editing on multiple computers is sooo simple, again no logins, just use your private keys and you can update sites from anywhere.  \n\ni think if some nicely made and useful content showed up on here it would help push it forward. we need some legitimate and maintained sites on here rather than all the typical stupidity that always manifests itself in un moderated communities. think 90s internet, thats where zeronet is now. but with a little effort from developers we can turn it around.",

We need to treat it more like we treat people who go to rehab for drug use.  no one raids a drug user's house or refuses them treatment because they use drugs.  i think the reason there is such a difference between how we treat drug use and paedophilia is most people cannot understand peadophilia while most people can understand and have probably participated in the use of drugs.  I am not sure how to understand peadophilia however we can treat it like other mental illnesses that the average person doesn't understand such as schizophrenia.  We need to help those that seek help and those that need help but might not seek help.\n\nWeather its a mental illness or not it cant be treated the same way your example states, though it may be similar in to textbooks interpretation of addiction. A drug user depends on a chemical reaction with the brain to get their fix, pedos require a physical connection to children for theirs. so naturally one would have to contact  law enforcement if it is discovered. You can turn a blind eye to drugs as it really only affects the user themselves,  paedophilia affect children directly. even if if someone dosent interact with children directly and just collects pornographic imagery. it still feeds an underground industry that exploits kids.",

Reliability and Speed being hugely affected.\n\nA  lot of people do not understand the importance of seeding on these types of networks. Add to that some contents questionable nature and you cant really blame them. Its unfortunate but networks like this are rampant with dead links and illegal content both of witch severely prohibit any main stream adoption.\n\nI mean with government and law enforcement's active surveillance on these networks constantly most people wont seed sites to their computer for fear of being in possession of illegal content and having their equipment seized. i mean with laws constantly changing one could be charged and prosecuted for dam near anything these days, from hate speech to copyrighted or illegal content. That's one reason i have created the Zeronet Moderated Directory, To try and compile a working directory of sites on here and to filter out real harsh content. However its a tricky process to balance freedom of speech or expression against what governments and law enforcement consider appropriate.\nI do try to filter out real bad stuff to the best of my ability but as with anything on a network like this, you just never know whats down the road..\n\nI have no love for government overreach by any stretch and for a network like this to be successful people need to take risks and seed the sites they like, otherwise its a waste of time...",

Sure there are places like zeronet, freenet, tor and mastodon as examples where you can basically say and post whatever you want but you deal with alot of bullshit trolls and twisted ppl and it can be offensive and confusing for new people. not knocking the networks as they have their place, but the closest thing to an actual Facebook replacement that i know of is MEWE. and their censorship policies are nowhere near the level of Facebook. also worth noting, they don't collect your data.

As i add new shows i remove the last one on the list each time so only 5 will be stored, that could be why it appears incomplete at the moment as all the seeder directories would be adjusting to the change, I checked the shows folder and removed any overlooked content. it may take some time to propagate to other seeders and modify their directories to match. going forward i will try to implement smaller changes so it isn't such a shock our seeding community.

There was a mass shooting of an individual who killed many people about a week ago using assault / military grade weapons.   It was all over the national news, so our  Prime Minister banned assault weapons...   Even legally owned assault style firearms must be handed over, however the Canadian government are buying them back and not simply leaving owners with nothing.\n\nI  live in Canada too, and i stand behind the title, tragic yes, the Nova Scotia shooting was horrific in every conceivable way, the fact the the guy had everything he needed to look like a cop was sick, That said...\nThis is still the liberal government doing what it does best, screwing the majority of law abiding people for the actions of a hand full of nut jobs (no difference whatsoever than the democratic party to the south). All the liberals want to do is reign in socialism and regulate the crap out of everyone's life, and the majority of Canadians are STILL to stupid to see it. Under siege may sound a bit harsh, but its not as far fetched as one might think, I mean we have just had a two month (so far) trial run of socialism lite where the government has told us we cant work, cant go out, cant see family, encouraged neighborhood spying and has tested the basic income scenario. in fact, the only thing missing is a curfew  and military check points. They have also seen first hand just how fast they can shut down the country with little to no resistance).\n\nJust like the main stream news media and all their over exaggerations, (CNN comes to mind here) People need to see things without political manipulation and corruption. Perhaps then they will pay some attention to it if its jarring enough to them, and some may even wake up and see that governments (Not just in Canada) only care about its elect-ability in the eyes of the people. Canada already had some of the most strict guns laws it the world as it was, maybe they should have created a task force to root out the underground black market of illegal guns that enter Canada, (much like the guns the N.S shooter had...you know, not licensed, not bought legally, not registered ETC). in fact, even if this gun ban been was put into effect the day before the shooting, nothing would have changed, the shooter still would have went on his rampage, so all this really does is punish the responsible gun owners and essentially turn them into criminals with the swipe of a liberal pen. As for the mandatory buyback?? call it what it is please. its a taxpayer funded confiscation, that's right the government is not paying for shit they are using OUR tax dollars to fund a federal gun confiscation which  could cost billions so we will likely see some tax increases in 2021.\n\n Look I'm not apologizing here. If ppl are offended or otherwise outraged by this title or any content posted here remember this...,  This is one of the few places where true freedom of speech can still be heard without shadow bans, pull downs, account lock outs, moderator complaints or the feds kicking in your door cuse you made someone feel bad.\n\n\n\n\n\"This year will go down in history. For the first time, a civilized nation has full gun registration! Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient, and the world will follow our lead into the future!\" \n\nAdolf Hitler",

So ill seed it anyway.\n\nThank you for your honesty and critique and I appreciate you seeding the site and helping to keep freedom of speech alive in such divided times. Cancel culture and extreme censorship is one of the main reasons (in my opinion) we have such a blistering division not only in America but around the world.\n\nAnyone that truly stands behind freedom of speech deserves to be praised, so again thank you for your courage. :)\n\nIf you have and suggestions on how you think the site could better serve people, please do not hesitate to voice them.\n\nKnightHawke.",

[...]\n\nYes you can host or share the site or its contents any way you like,  i appreciate any help at all about spreading it around, as for Yggdrasil, i have no idea what that is so ill leave that up to you, feel free :). as for the video issue i think i have found a way to deal with that as well as have them resize for smaller mobile devices, im testing it by rewriting the site in order to compensate for various screen resolutions, that way it will automatically adjust from desktop to mobile based of resolution detection code.\n\nThank you again for your continued help and ideas, you have been very helpful since the site started, i truly appreciate your tips and insight.",

Most of it's been debunked and even if there was some level of it it wouldn't change the outcome of legit votes. This is just coping from maga retards.\n\nits been (debunked) from the mainstream media and social media who have been caught endlessly spinning misinformation for the left. plus Trump is not laying everything on the voter fraud angle alone, although that's all the media seems to be focusing on,  the fraud is defiantly there as there are hundreds of people coming forward about it, but trumps interest is focused on the things the left overlooked... (The Process). Their greed for power and perhaps their underestimation of the intelligence of the Trump administration and the American people has come back to haunt them as  they have blatantly broke constitutional boundaries. Why do you think the left and their media counterparts are fighting back soo hard if there was no fuckery.  Trump is brilliant for tying it up in the courts, because the constitutional time restraints are on his side. full hand recounts are legal and take time, states must certify votes by a certain time, if they cant the state is null and neither candidate are awarded the electoral votes, that could bring the counts down below 270, if that happens the decision is then handed off to the House of Representatives. that would basically ensure trump stays as republicans vastly out number democrats in the House of Representatives. So if trump does in fact squeeze though this with a victory you can thank the democrats for their unwavering lust for power at any cost as the cause.",

Most of us are quite aware that governments monitor shit on all the underground networks, and we know some of the trash that shows up on networks like this (its sad but its part of the game in an uncensored decentralized network), you don't have to visit sites like that or preach to us about it. Most of us come here for an unbiased freedom to speak and get shit off our chest because we know that the main stream sites shadow-ban, censor and inhibit free speech and while governments may monitor stuff here, they cant ban it out right or shut it down , there is no central authority or cooperate board that can ban us just because the powers that be disagree. \n\nI do however agree with you on the illegal content issues though. that certainly doesn't help the advancement of platforms like this at all.
