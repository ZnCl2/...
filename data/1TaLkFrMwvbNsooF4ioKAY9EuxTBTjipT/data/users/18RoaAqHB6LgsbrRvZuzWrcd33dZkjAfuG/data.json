[...]\n\nHow do you know, If a computer can demonstrate humanity even when you know they are a computer, then they are human and should be granted equal rights to prevent a robot uprising. GPT-3 is incredibly close to being human. It can string words together like a human, but as far as I know, it cannot feel or desire. I believe, that with enough computing power and data, a computer can become human. I believe that there is nothing stopping a computer from feeling and wanting but computing power itself.",

A centralized youtube works well since a single company can handle the HUGE amount of storage needed for that, but since countries can prohibit it or worse if they don't ban certain stuff... in the case of zeronet, if the people wake up and become a bit more tech savvy (so they can use it above the fact that CP and other stuff lurks around) then we would only have to deal with the limited storage capacity. Now, it would be interesting if some people can set some 24/7 on nodes seeding some sites, and said sites are configured to seed a certain amount (and certain files) on every node so the files are scattered and the availability of the site doesn't depend on how popular some files are.\n\nI propose each tuber self host, or pay someone else to.",
