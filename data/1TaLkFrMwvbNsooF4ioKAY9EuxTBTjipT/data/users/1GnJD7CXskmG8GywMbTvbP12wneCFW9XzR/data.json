By the way the github description of the project missing an example on how to import the export .md file back to ZeroMe. Or is this tool built basicaly to do readable export of the posts and no import? Unsure if there would be some usage case for importing, if it would work and if not better for this purpose to backup user's zerome directory (ZeroNet/data/HUBID/data/user/USERID - IDs visible when one copy the URL which is under ones username link on ZeroMe)\n\nI didn't edit the exported .md. I just put the exported markdown files and related jpeg files on GitHub, and [GitHub Pages](https://mmap.page/dive-into/gh-pages/) will \"render\" it automatically.\n\nI wrote zerome2md for readonly export because I want to publish a copy of my zerome posts on clearnet.\nThus there is no import.\n\nThough I can image some use cases for importing, for example, you want to edit existing posts or add new posts on your phone, but you do not have ZeroNet installed on the phone. Then you can open and edit the exported markdown file on the phone with some edtior. When you go back to your computer, import it to ZeroNet again. Potentially, it may even auto sync your ZeroMe posts to some external note taking application/service. So you can edit it on your phone easily (with mobile application of that note taking application/service). But it would be another project.",

Only the admin/site owner can edit a static site. For example, ZeroTalk is not a static site.\n\nHere is  [a list of popular static site generators](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/05/02/top-ten-static-website-generators/).

I suspect many need help here.\n\nI use Jekyll (no endorsement, just because it is the default option of GitHub Pages). And it turns out quite straightforward to deploy a Jekyll site on ZeroNet. The internal links need some extra attention, and become tricky if RSS is involved.
