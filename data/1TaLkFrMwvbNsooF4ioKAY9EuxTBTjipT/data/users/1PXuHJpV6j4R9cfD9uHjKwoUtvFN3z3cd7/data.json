That was a very dirty move from FR ... The lobby agenda was very strong these last days too, using dirty ways to win this battle (blackmailing representatives with bad press, etc..).  In the end, they got what they wanted... Time will tell how the feared directive will manifest to the real world and if there will still be a way to enjoy the internet as before (the clearnet will most likely become a commercial plattform).",
