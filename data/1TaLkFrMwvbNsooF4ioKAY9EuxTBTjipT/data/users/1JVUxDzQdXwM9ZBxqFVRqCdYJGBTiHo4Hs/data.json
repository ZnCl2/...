What you have to consider is can you live a very, very simple life until the debt is forsaken legally by the owner? \n\nYou say you have a job. You may have to leave it and get a much lower paying position.\nIf you have a home, you may have to sell it - or give it to a very trustworthy friend or family member.\nGo small, live in an apartment or caravan if you can. And as strange as it sounds, don't save your money.\nBut don't spend your money on things that can be repossessed. Eat well, exercise at a gym, go to the doctor, go to school. Be poor. It's not shameful - it's a penance. You'll overcome it. You'll be a better person afterwords.\nWrite me, I'm more than happy to provide you advice. I support seven people on a single minimum wage job.",

				"body": "> [nooneimportant](#comment_2_1CVLeFVQw2wWbBdpM5PtQhtzd7wjKzB24b): I want to pay this back. It's not about not paying. I can \"disappear\" almost anyone I'd like to. I'm just not a bad person. Many people ask for money in much more simple cases, so why shouldn't I?\n\nWhile I advocate not paying, that's not the point. It's to bring about change in our society as a whole. Nobody should be expected to sink to the level of a beggar just to be defended; especially if you were in the right in the matter. If you were victorious in your case, you should owe nothing. Details do make your case more intriguing. Do you wish to share anything about your particular circumstance?",
