				"body": "I use Linux. BSD is not very friendly as a desktop or laptop OS for the average person these days. I can't recommend a Linux distro very well. I use NixOS and love it, but it isn't user friendly by any means. Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora all seem fine. I like MXLinux as a \"just works\" distro. As far as security goes, you really need to dig into everything and educate yourself, there's no way to grab something out-of-the-box and expect it to fit your needs. If you use Linux you'll never wake up one day and find an automatic update disabled an app for \"hate speech.\" You're free. That's a big benefit. But privacy, and security? Don't expect anything there if you don't put in serious work.",

However, I'm very skeptical that any plan coming out of Germany or EU politicians will strengthen our countries against modern threats.",

Even if oil was seriously going to run out, it would make the economic incentive for new energy sources so tremendous that we'd see amazing innovations in energy production. We already have nuclear power and electromagnetic engines anyway, we could run out of oil this decade and handle it just fine, but we won't run out.",

				"body": "In my opinion, chan style sites are pointless if they don't have working automatic thumbnails. An image board is an image board. If thumbnails are hidden or blurred by default then it might as well be something more like a BBS or reddit style message board where there is more structure for conversations. I guess the other route to go, if it's just text based instead of media, is something akin to twitter/gab. My point is just that an image board without thumbnails is going to be very annoying to use for anything but plain text conversation, even if it does have the upside of avoiding legal issues.\n\nOne option for zeronet to get past the issue of illegal content is to improve encryption techniques and for websites concerned about legality to foster a strongly self-moderated community, so that illegal content is quickly blacklisted. If done correctly, it would be similar to clearnet - if I visit 4chan and someone posted illegal photos, I'm not breaking the law for my browser automatically getting those photos. I think if a few things slip through the cracks, then mens rea will protect seeders, but it depends on the websites having a strong system and community of self-moderation.",
