Whether or not you use Tor or a VPS, you'll always have to 'trust' someone else to keep your data away from the authorities.\n\n4chan people are righy for various reasons:\n\n Tor has more eyes from the governemnts than amy other services ( as vpn, vps ... ) which it made the FBI make a lot of exit nodes that can exposes anyone\n  Tor's traffic is very obvious to any servet you cannect with it, that's why google and other serveces block it and the isp that has your real ip address also know that you are using tor\n   Also, keep in mind that even without the bugs in firefox that can expose and did all users previously, they still can know you from link the entry node information with the exit node and knowing who you are ( much more like bruteforce and rarely used ), also don't forget that Tor project is located on the 5 eyes and funded by the governemnt directly\n\nThere is more, but I didn't want to make it too long",
