And some zite owners allow the clone button, which you can find by clicking the 3 dots next to the zite name in ZeroHello.\n\nno, that cloning does not store userdata, the idea of the backup is to stand against censorship by owner,\nsay for example, owner starts to mass delete things on example zerotalk, we can REVERT to last known GOOD STATE in history of zerotalk, and FORK it by cloning EVERYTHING, including userdata to another site which we CONTROL, to restore user freedom\nwhat's empowering in this example is, anyone can do it, if a group of community dont like that, they can fork off into their own community\nand yes i agree optional files might be a problem\n\n> [blazar](#comment_24_1P1baCe1LLjror4CZjChWFy7D7cVWyPL83): If you want to access an older version of a zite you have to make a lot of backups.

[...]\n\nIdea is to built another system up from ground but only possesses the necessary parts(bulky malware makes easy spotting) with barebone(we are suppose to just use mirror how zeronet works without using it)\n\nFor sake of example, say we managed to embed zeronet into your malware and\nuses different ports etc so if by odds the user also have zeronet it wouldnt clash with it,\nnow we just need to call 127.0.0.1:ourport/(CNC's address)/ (we will open it on a hidden web browser because javascript is needed), but it will probably only be needed for the first time so zeronet knows we need it to seed that site,\nnow the malware can access zeronet'sroot/data/(cnc address)/commands.json or whatever it needed\nall that left is for the botmaster to edit the site's commands.json and sign+publish it\n\nBut lets step back and think what this can be used for, all i can think of is just to use it for something like ddosing or flooding where a respond is not necessarily needed\nYou cant even do anything like the ransomware or just extract any data from infected host without doing something crazy(which only works if you alter the protocol grately) like each malware makes it's own site and propagate all malware peers to host it, the site itself will have the response, assuming the botmaster will be in the peer, they will automatically get the response that way without exposing themself since they could just be seen as just another infected machine doing what it was commanded to do(you could encrypt the response with owner's public key doe which means the response itself is actually secret)\n\n**TLDR**: ideally you dont have to use zeronet but just use their concept, also doing it using zeronet which will only yield a one way connection is complicated, and the possibilities of altering the protocol and making it a two way connection thus making it more useful",
