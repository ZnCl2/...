Also: \"Last updated: January 14, 2017\"... So probably a lot of dead links and ones that at one point accepted Bitcoin but stopped doing it, etc. Either way, I don't trust running stuff outside of my control. And it's not what my question was about.\n\nOnly biggest companies require ID like hetzner OVh etc.\nJust 'google' for offshore vps and you can give them any fake data without proof\nThen pay with paypal or bitcoin for more privacy",
