Apparently the to_table thing can be written either way BUT FOR SOME ZUCKER-DICK LOVING REASON every fucking table apparently needs a json_id... The guy responsible for the doc should mention it IMO.\n\nYeah it's a mess to be honest, hard to understand what's going on.\n\n>Apparently the to_table thing can be written either way\n\nGood to know.",
