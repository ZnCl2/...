Neither Blokada nor NextDNS block the test links, so you're probably less safe using them.\n\nAll of these DNS firewall schemes rely on user reports (usually delayed). They are mostly no different than antivirus products reliant on signatures...\n\nAttackers are far more nimble than any such systems. Worse, legitimate users then tie themselves up in knots. Consider the capchas you've endured over time.\n\nAbout the only success you'll ever get from blocking might be with the spies you purchase and install into your home. Like smart TVs, or many devices using web based control panels (really in the cloud). Even then - you just annoy them. Those weasels will find a way.",
