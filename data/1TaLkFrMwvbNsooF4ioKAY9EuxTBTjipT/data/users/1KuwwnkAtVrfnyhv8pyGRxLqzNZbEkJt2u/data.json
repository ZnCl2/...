If anyone want to contribute or report a bug it would be much appreciated.\n\nA small explanation of how it works :\n* It use the big file feature for songs.\n* Every playlist is a hub. The site doesn't offer the possibility to create one but you should be able to clone one of the hub that are already available.\n* You can also manage permission. The playlist can be read only or public or just give access to a couple of people. A more detailed guide on how to do that will come soon.\n\nWhat to expect for the future:\n* A page to manage your playlist\n* Better user experience (the code need some refactoring)\n* Follow update of playlist\n* Desktop application - experimental - This could be achieved by using electron and loading the url of the page and maybe some other cool feature if possible like notification.\n* A plugin to quickly add a song listened on clearnet to your playlist or even other site like ZeroSTLN\n\nMany exciting stuff to do !\n\nPS : The address [Mixtape](/mixtape.bit)",

			"body": "I have been looking into zeronet-kivy and python GUI framework.\nI would like to create a Zeronet Browser POC. Having a native browser could give more control over the application and offer other opportunities for plugins and site. \n\nIt would be great to be able to do it and using a lib to render site. The best one I have found is webkit and it seems to work great with PyQT. There is also https://pypi.org/project/cefpython3/ which seems to be compatible with a bunch of GUI framework. It doesnt seems to be maintain for kivy or it is maintain by a third party and doesnt really push update.\n\nUsing PyQT and webkit seems the right choice but PyQT seems to have a annoying license ? Might not be a problem because Zeronet is free. \n\nOther solution is the Beeware : https://pybee.org/project/using/desktop-app/\nBut seems quite a young project.\n\nI also tested Pyinstaller to create ready to use app and dpkg to create packaging for linux. \n\nHere the state of my research. Please comment if you have feedback or other lib to add.\n\nUPDATE: I finally chose to go with pyt5 : https://github.com/rllola/ZeronetBrowser\n\nUsing Electron would have require having 2 languages in one app making it more difficult to package, distribute and update. Also contrary to what it has been said javascript doesn't allow to embed python code (like for bindings in c++/python). It would just call the app and start it externally. Using IPC would have been a good solution for communication between the 2 processes. However it would have been a lot of work, lets keep it simple.\n\nThe project is open to PR ! I am focusing on packaging, distribution and update first and if anyone want to start adding features please do. You actually don't need to know that much python to start. ",

Please feel free to share them here.\n\n!!! Important !!! Using this plugin will show your address IP (it doesn't use Tor) but you should be fine behind a VPN.",

Careful using it because it will not make you anonymous even if you use ZeroNet with Tor.\n\nThis plugin allows you download files from the Torrent network.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How to install it\nYou will need to install it via this site [/1ChMNjXpW5vU5iXb9DSXzqAUfY46Pc2RTL](/1ChMNjXpW5vU5iXb9DSXzqAUfY46Pc2RTL). Once it is installed you will be asked to restart ZeroNet and then refresh the site.\n\n### How to use it\nYou will be presented with a form to add a torrent via either a magnet link or a .torrent file. To properly test if the plugin is working please click on the `sintel` link which will fill the form with the Sintel movie magnet and then submit.\n\nYou will need to wait a bit for it to connect to peers and start downloading the film. It will then show the video  player and you can start to watch Sintel as it is being downloaded.\n\n### How to stop it\nOnce you have stopped ZeroNet or disabled the plugin (using [/Plugins](/Plugins)) the torrent will not be shared anymore.\n\n### Where is the file saved\nThe file will be saved in your `data` folder under the folder of the site that it has been requested from (so here `1ChMNjXpW5vU5iXb9DSXzqAUfY46Pc2RTL`) under a `downloads` folder (e.g `data/1ChMNjXpW5vU5iXb9DSXzqAUfY46Pc2RTL/downloads`).\n\n### How can I hide my identity\nUse a no-logging VPN.\n\n### Where can it be used\nIt can only be used in site that supports and have implemented the specific api of the plugin. Documentation will be available soon. Devs can also take a look at this file for the available actions implemented by the plugin (https://github.com/rllola/zeronet-torrent-plugin-example/blob/master/app/stores/Site.js)\n\n## Whats next\n- UI page for the plugin (show list of torrents and save path)\n- Configuration\n- Dev documentation and tutorial\n\nImportant! This is still work in progress. Don't use it if you don't want to.\n\n# UPDATE\n\nNew version out and should fix the issues mentioned in the comment. \nIf you installed the plugin before, you will need to delete it. Go back to the site, install restart ZeroNet, refresh the page, grant the permission for the site and test the demo!\n",

I tried then to explain in a really simple way how Zeronet works (might have lost a couple of people on the way). We then talked about the Zeronet advantages and particularities (Tor, Built-in account, Namecoin, Plugins, BigFile,...).\n\nI ended the talk with a small demo and showcase what the community has build. \n\nI had the usual questions : \"What happened if someone download child pornography ?\"  and \"But does it work on Blockchain ?\"\n\nA couple of people talked to me after so I would say it is a win.\n\nI will probably publish the presentation somewhere soon but I want first to change a couple of things.

If someone come with 10000 nodes they can create a new chain that's all.

I have been reading the documents that are referenced in the Bitcoin whitepaper. I also realized that you might need a central server which would be sure that the items are chained and then distribute the hash to the others.\n\nOr each and everyone could have is own hub with his own chain and from time to time you will add the hash of someone else chain in yours which would prove the existence.\n\nI am just throwing ideas here.

It is impossible without using VPN.\nYou can use torrent with Tor (https://www.best-bittorrent-vpn.com/tor-for-torrents.html) but it is difficult to configure and slow so a VPN is the way to go. \n\n>Otherwise anyone sharing a video is risk to a cease and desist, the same as when uploading content via a normal torrent client and no VPN.\nSharing pirated content is illegal and you risk to have problem is you do. But if you have the permission to share, it is fine. Let's say you created a small fun tv show on hacking you can share via torrent protocol and you won't get problems.\n\nI have been working for 2 years with libtorrent. I never used a VPN to hide (and it is not good practice I was just lazy) and I never had a problem because I was using free torrents (https://www.freetorrent.fr/torrents.php <-- sorry it is in french)\n\n>It is imo even more dangerous as people might not be aware they are revealing their iP automatically by clicking on any video thats copyrighted on your service. They think they are safe/protected by using ZN via tor=always, but your plugin is circumventing tor protection and risking anyone to be easilly exposed without a VPN.\nIt is why it is a plugin. You will have to install it on Zeronet. It won't be there by default only for people who want to use it. I will try to make it as clear as possible about the risk that you mentioned. It could also even be made unavailable if tor is activated to prevent any risk.\n\nRemember this plugin was developed before BigFile where available (which would gave you access to streaming because webtorrent didn't really work well..). It is now just an attempt to get files from torrent network available here (like for example to be use as a bridge with PeerTube). If some people run it they also can make those files accessible for people who only use ZN. No one is forcing you to use it. It is just a fun project.",

Even if it would not pay the artist it was a huge chance for people to be publish on those because it would make them known because of all the subscribers.

[...]\n\nThe POD concept makes me think of FOAF and they actually mention it somewhere in the site.
