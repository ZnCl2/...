ZN is fully opensource, are you sure you dont breach the original license?\n\nI was not modifing any ZeroNet code here, you can update the ZeroNet core as you do on Desktop version. App is written in flutter framework, due to very low people know about flutter, so releasing code doesn't get any help from community, if you know how to code with Flutter, that will be helpful to me, at this stage project need polish, which is mentioned in app store page. Once I am happy with code, I will definitely open source the app. Building app is very cumbersome at this point, so it will be pain to contributors at this stage, I was planning native apps with ZeroNet Protocol, so it will be used by standalone apps as well, these features take more time to implement as well.",
