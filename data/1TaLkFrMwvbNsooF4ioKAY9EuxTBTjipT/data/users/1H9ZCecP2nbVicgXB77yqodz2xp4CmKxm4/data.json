Like, wtf? It is a chinese malware, I wouldn't touch that with a 10 meter pole. \nWhy use messenger? what kind of outrage of selling your data would be enough for ppl to stop using it?\n\nI think the problem is lack of immediate observable consequences. If you touch a lit candle, you immediately feel pain and try your best to stop touching it. If someone looks over your shoulder on your piece of paper or monitor, ppl would be outraged because of \"privacy\" , but when something much worse is happening in your digital area, nobody cares because you can't see it. People are very uneducated about IT and that's a big problem too.\n\nAt this point, I kinda sometimes wish corpos like google and facebook start weaponizing the sheep's data in a way that is uncomfortable and finally detrimental to their everyday routine, that's the only way for ppl to finally care. The fact they do it so sneakily is working very well for them still.",

Merely using Tor is not enough, you have to be careful with behavioral analysis, for example the style of your writing, timing correlation etc. Sure, you can't verify if anyone does what they say (not collect and store data).
