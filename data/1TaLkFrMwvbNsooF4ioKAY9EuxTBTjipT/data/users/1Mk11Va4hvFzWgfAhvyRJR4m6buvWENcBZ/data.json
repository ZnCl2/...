BitTorrent with web seeders are more permanent than ipfs, such web seeders can be hosted by nextcloud, or even zeronet or freenet (if it's running).

If the video is not popular it never gets seeded. Here is a fun challenge. See if someone could post Red Dead Redemption, or the Lord of the Rings trilogy [in one video] on Zeronet and have it work.
