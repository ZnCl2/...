Please! Use IFS for streaming also YOUR FILES! :)\n\nI used MystiQ software to compress video files as much as needed to stream them also without the seedbox (using a flat connection also from a single node). i suggest to use these FFMPEG options to convert video files to the compressed format that i'm using:\n\n-f mp4 -b:v 400k -r 29.97 -aspect 16:9 -vcodec libx264 -b:a 80k -acodec aac -movflags faststart\n\nMystiQ is a GUI for FFMPEG that can make the conversion task easily.
