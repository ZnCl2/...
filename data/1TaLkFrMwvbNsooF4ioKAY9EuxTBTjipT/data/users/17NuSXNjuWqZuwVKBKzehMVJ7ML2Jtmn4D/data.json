Once disabled you should have the option to boot into your installation drive with UEFI or legacy. Usally those are shown as \"drivename (UEFI)\" for the former, and \"drivename\" for the latter.\nIf you select the legacy install drive than you will be able to install the OS without UEFI\n\np.s. all this \"should\" is because sadly not all computer bios allows to change Secure Boot settings, expecially on laptops",
