It used to work almost always until nofish made some changes to prevent automatic generation of IDs based on banning certain IPs depending on undisclosed criteria (current version of ZeroID is proprietary).\n\nIdk if it is proprietary because there is no license field but the source code is not obfuscated. In the all.js file, only jQuery is minified, the rest is at the bottom of the file. Of course it is in JS, not coffescript.\n\n> [emmet](#comment_1_1N4DSSHorDvEkDGkQfUhnnryYiTdtUW8hU): It's a bit more complicated than that. The point of certificates is that only trusted parties (certificate authorities) are allowed to map names to keys. Then the dilemma is who becomes that trusted party, since can easily become a gatekeeper and prevent people from generating certs for one reason or another, like ZeroID does with Tor, or they can just go down and then nobody is able to generate certs (like with KXoID).\n\nI don't think that's how it works on ZeroNet. The authority is just a zite with a mapping in a certain format. The developer of each zite chooses which authority to trust.\nhttps://zeronet.io/docs/site_development/cert_authority/\n\nSeems rather simple to implement, the matter is making it popular.\n\nAlso, you have to pay namecoins to register and renew your certificate every six months. That would prevent sybil attacks.",

You just dip a q-tip into the end of the solution and hold it near their face. I found that with a bit of sugar, hydration, and being placed in a shaded area, they're usually ready to get moving again after a little while. Not sure exactly what causes them to end up in this state. Perhaps they went to far from home? Bad food? High summer temperatures?\n\ncute",
