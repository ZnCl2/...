Its peer to peer where everyone shares their resources, and it gets copied to multiple different computers. By copying the content, the data becomes un-censorable due to it being in multiple places. This allows for mirrors to exist inside and outside of ZeroNet. Also, you can delete content that you downloaded from ZeroNet. Also, I just heard the 8chan on ZeroNet got CP posts, since the chans usually get those type of people. I heard the advice to avoid the site because technically having the CP and seeding(you sharing your resource of content you downloaded) it is illegal. This is why I mostly don't just wander on random sites on ZeroNet, and like to stay on text stuff, and click to download like ZeroMe. 8chan on ZeroNet runs on where it just downloads straight. On ZeroMe, there is less risk, since you wont accidentally download something illegal just by browsing. If you want a example of what I mean, you can go here for ZeroMe: http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/ It will have content of \"show image\" to get the image, instead of just downloading images all the time.\n\nThx,  That is helpful,   I will check out zero me, keep the system clean and be cautious.     I think decentralized internet is a great idea...  I know it takes power away from some and want to be safe.  We should have these freedoms but things are upside down.   extremists everywhere lol",

You need people to drive interest, and you need interest to drive people.  08Chan helps.  The lowest hanging fruit to get more people IMO would be to reform groups of people kicked off of traditional social media sites.  Websites with unique and valuable information are good as well.  Some people just have to take the leap in the beginning, and create content even if there is no one initially there to see it.\n\ni hear ya,  most people dont even know what linux is.  They eat what they are fed.  I think this 8chin thing will help spread the word no doubt but these things are totally suppressed.   The concept of privacy is suppressed.  The corporations try to suppress open source projects until they can monopolize on them.   open source has no promo with the lack of budget.    When i try to spread the word its like people have some sort of cognitive dissonance and what i say does'nt line up with what the tv told them.",

There is a small demographic of people who this is targeted at.  Most if not all of us can see the trajectory of free speech on the normal internet, and as a result our infrastructure for communication must become more sophisticated.  As cool as the concept is right now, its still in its infancy.  A lot more functionality and systems will be added to it as time goes on.  We are the early adopters who see the potential in this.  What we want this to become is intrinsically part of its growth process as it matures as a project.  More people understanding and appreciating what ZeroNet is will come as it grows.\n\nI personally feel its a second chance for the internet.  I am very excited with zeronet and decentralization.   I just have a strong negativity bias when it come to the powers that be and the ways they try to keep things down until they can gain control of it.

There is little to no red tape or bureaucracy to slow you down, and there is no giant apparatus you need to redirect.  There are a lot of VERY intelligent people attracted to projects such as these.  When you get groups of people such as that to passionately focus on a central goal, the output can rival that of major corporations.

Its easy to write of as senseless and hateful violence, its possible when we're talking isolated cases. But people are reacting with violence since there is no way for them to speak. Deplatforming, censoring and attacking people for telling the truth doesn't create the healthiest mind.The entire argument for freedom of speech is that it creates peace and stability. When a society starts aggressively attacking its dissidents, their numbers will grow and we get violence and destruction instead of debate and agreement.\n\ni fully agree.  when when people loose the words to express themselves.

Its hard to know when people tell lies or how often or how big.  We naturally want to believe people would have enough respect to be honest.  It's also really hard to know when perps are bullshitting  because a lot of the lies are small and pointless.  But they all add up to a false reality they painted in their victims head.  A huge red flag for me is if I observe someone telling a little lie to someone for no real reason.  Like an excuse for something minor and certainly not worth lying over.  But if it works to create a better image for themselves. I take note.  Most people do this to some degree but when people are pathological liars and lie about everything... at what point do they believe their own bullshit?  or Do they know exactly what they do?  The answer is likely far more \"simple\" than i could imagine.  I should do more research and compile a list of red flags.  I have a list of my own but its always nice to compare notes.",

Is it better to be right or happy?   Words mean little when interacting with people.  If you are at work and not happy or angry with something your co workers do you need to be calm yourself before you approach them.  If your intensity level is at a 10 then your words mean nothing.  Right or happy?\nIf you are feeling happy or calm when you bring up issues and remain calm and help them draw their own conclusions rather than simply telling them they are wrong, it might be more effective.   People are easy to repel with body language even if you are right.  Just work on calming yourself and avoid arguing.  Suggestions are received better than random instruction.  It just takes some practice and the key is yourself.   Perfectionism does not bring happiness or impress others.  Need a better balance.",

The toxic level is off the CHARTS!!\n\nYou are welcome. Glad you find this useful and hope it can be helpful for you.  One thing you might find interesting is CBT(Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) You could research it online.  I have found it to be most useful for myself.  It's a simple concept that takes practice.  In essence,  Its about our own thoughts and how quickly we react to beliefs that may or may not be accurate.  Its about slowing down the process and basically questioning everything. And being aware of our many automatic thoughts that happen very quickly and go unnoticed.  If we can have better control of our automaitic thoughts.. we then should have better control of our automatic reactive behavior.   And in theory.. life, interactions, and stress levels should automatically get better.  I think they should teach it in school, but it would go against the status quo.  It's worth checking out if you have not already.",

Then again, I'm pretty calm lately.\n\nIts worth checking out.  I don't know if its something they offer where you are,  But the internet is a wonderful thing.  With practice we can basically rewire our brains.  And catch ourselves beating ourselves up with negative self talk, which is natural but not good for overall happiness.  This therapy trains us to make well thought out decisions over automatic reactions. I think anyone with and open mind and willing to be honest with themselves would benefit huge.  I should upload material sometime. (need a scanner)  Its psychoactive therapy rather than the typical psychiatry that is most common.  Its the reason I do not take meds or self medicate.  Its helped my stress threshold incredibly.  Like everything though.. moderation and to be taken it with a grain of salt.  It's all about the balance.  Its a can of worms to open as well.  When i got better at taking myself off \"autopilot\" and taking more control..  i really noticed how the people around me fly on autopilot and are quick to believe and react in this fast paced world.  Will start to realize the world is far more insane than you might have believed yourself to be.  This therapy goes straight at your own core beliefs and how they are mostly inaccurate.  Everything thought, belief, or action must have evidence.",

So now therapy is optional because nothing bothers me anymore. I'm no longer jumping to conclusions.\n\nSorry to hear that,  Hopefully its only for a short time and will simply all blow over. I feel your pain. I find myself in the tar pit as well. No longer jumping to conclusions is the most important. Meds are subjective to the individual.  I have my concerns with dependency over long term use.  It's your choice if they help or not.  I am skeptical (for myself) because its a one size fits all solution for everyone regardless of anything.  And big pharma is most likely still the biggest industry in north America. But not much you can do but comply in these situations.  I must say though,  If you had the chance to get some free therapy and learn some better coping skills in a group setting.  It definitely food for thought.  Its a big eye opener to meet people who have been on meds for 20+ years.  With CBT especially, I find it directly addresses the many lies that gaslight us all rather than a pill base solution.  The only reason I am not ordered to take pills is a whole lot of self advocating and many solid debates with many psychiatrists and the proactive measures i took before court,  and some luck.  and good behavior.

It seems as if the truth is irrelevant between women.\n\nThat's unfortunate,  but as everything, education is never free.  In the court of law truth costs money.  The only people that benefit are the lawyers and judges.  I concluded that i could not afford truth, so I got the best lawyer i could to simply plead my case out so 95 percent of the bullshit evaporated. I could not afford justice.  Its a fine system when money dictates whether you can have a proper trail or not.  what i learned from that experience was avoid court at all costs. Say even with a divorce where two people who got together have a disagreement and want to part ways...  the lawyers are the clear winners.  Female attorney and female judge...yikes.   In this modern world... work is for woman.\nI have to deal with 100 percent women who hold power over me for awhile yet.  Talk about punishment.

I will check it out thank you\n\nCBT is therapy that can certainly help with impulsive behavior.  I'm a skeptic but have found it very helpful for many aspects of overall life.  Its basically habit forming exercises that requires yourself to provide evidence to justify thoughts, beliefs, and actions.  This will slow down the whole thought process and encourages mindfulness and well thought out actions.\nIn practice its also a great defense against mind pollution and typical everyday bullshit.

People stuck in this dichotomy see the only two options as Laissez-faire capitalism and hyper-equal socialism/communism. It's not entirely their fault either, as this is how the media tends to portray it and it's likely all they've been shown. There should be a space so someone can work harder and be rewarded more, to appease the so-called greed factor, but you also need to keep an iron grip to prevent exploitation, usury, etc and ensure labor capital soars while loan capital is crushed. I also don't think everyone does something for material and wealth alone, but that's aside the point in this small rhetoric.\n\ndivide and conquer...  popular opinions these days are very extreme.   black or white.   left or right,  climate change doesn't exist or we all gonna die in a week.   commies or nazis.

The government uses hate speech laws to control the debate.\nCertain logical/legitimate topics are off the table and not up for debate whether the \"people\" like it or not. It's ripe for abuse and being exploited in many ways as we speak.  Hate speech laws are redundant to existing laws and not worth the exploits.  If someone harasses or assaults another its already illegal. Creating special protected groups the government can then use it to \"goat\" the citizens against one another.  We have an abusive relationship with our government. They are like the worse parents ever. They starve us, punish us, make silly rules, and play favorites.

I feel like I'm in that boat since I am aware of how big the universe is and how oh so special/complex life is, but I just can't bring myself to care about that really. I don't even know how to put it into words, it's hard to describe how little I care about that. [...]\n\nTypically if you do not care about your future you probably lack goals. If your environment sucks an obvious goal would be to better it. How do you know the universe is soo big? Is it because that's what people say? What do you know as fact based on your own experience disregarding all you have been told? The universe can be as big or as small as you like it to be, if its so big that you feel meaningless then you might want to zoom the scope in so you can see yourself and your surroundings and focus on that.  To a certain degree happiness is a choice and could be a goal.  Figure out what you would want and go for it.  Waiting for something brings nothing.  The comfort zone is like as tar pit.  It goes nowhere.  Do you have goals or dreams?",

They are by far the most free country on this planet. In Canada guns are fairly useless, especially handguns.  To have a restricted license they could potentially inspect to see they are stored properly, thus consenting to searches.  Self defense is equal force so if someone broke into your house and got shot they better also have a gun or you will be criminally charged. Even if they had a gun you will have to defend yourself in court.  But none of that will be an issue because your guns will be legally locked up properly, no chance you would have the time to access them for self defense.  Not properly storing the firearms could land you in jail for 10 years and earn a lifetime ban.  Owning guns in Canada is risky business and useless for self defense.  They could decide to take the guns away at any time like the other cucked and disarmed countries. They could not do that in the states.",

Secretly communist controlled Umbrella Insurance Company or....Farmer's Insurance as its known in America, noticed the unique properties of this new creation and injected it into Fal Gaung prisoners for human trial. These prisoners were given cosmetic surgery to appear Western and fake IDs and evacuated with other Americans, but mostly Europeans, in the Great Exodus from Wuhan. Thus infecting Europe and America simultaneously, allowing for testing of the new virus, but more importantly it gave the Chinese military precious time to test new satellite killing  weaponry. As we debate over the virus the Chinese government triumphs over its success, but unknown to the ChiComs the satellites they are killing are actually owned by PornHub to handle the excess demand of millions of people now stuck in quarantine. Thus, the now sexually depraved populace is released from quarantine back into society, to which they set about expanding the population on a huge scale. But, these people unaware of the sexual predator laws of which are extremely strict, all end up like Weinstein and get 23 years in prison. And therefore, we will have a surplus of cheap prison labor.

In many countries people can loose their freedom and be subject to the mental health system if others feel they are a danger to themselves or others.  The hypocrisy within these systems is mind blowing and arguably not helpful.  The only one who can help you is you.  There are some good coping skills one can learn and some new types of therapies that are great.  But you would have to take the initiative to pursue them,  or by doing something really shitty and being ordered to do so.  It was a good day for me when I realized the world was far more insane than I was.  You don't have to suffer like you do.  We are all prisoners of our own minds unless we learn to become the master and not let our thoughts run wild and bully us.  It requires 100 percent honesty with oneself and practice.",
