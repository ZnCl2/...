It doesn't matter how horrible you feel your life is you're probably going to come to the conclusion to not do it. I personally think we don't choose to die like how we don't choose to be born. I think ultimately the 'universe' decides everything and we are wrong to think we make the decisions of the outcome of our lives as we are merely a part of that universe, not independent from it. The people who die of suicide  was granted that death by nature while others who attempt will either not be able to do it due to survival instinct or end up failing to kill themselves. They will die of other causes.",
