It's an issue with their exclusivity.\n\nThat's a good point. If anyone can fork an article, and paywalls become useless, how are they going to monetize their content?",

I see all these games come out or that have come out and part of me wishes I could go back to when I played more, because they look really interesting/fun. But these days I keep finding I don't have as much time or energy to devote to video games as I once did. Other things just happen to feel more important at the moment.\n\nThat doesn't mean I don't play at all, just in very short bursts.",
