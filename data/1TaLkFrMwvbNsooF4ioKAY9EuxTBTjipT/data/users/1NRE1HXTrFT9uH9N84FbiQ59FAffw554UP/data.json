Dead wrong.People that deny science are people that refuse to accept demonstrated reality.When people say others \"deny science\" they're not using an appeal to authority or some \"conclusions are infallible\" argument.People that deny science are people that use known logical fallacies in order to avoid changing their unsound conclusions, and they specifically outright deny both the scientific research and make claims about conspiracies.If someone says \"the scientific method is never adequate enough to make specific sound conclusions\", then they're science deniers.You obvious don't have any understand of how serious and prevalent science-denialism is.Everyone from Feynman to Popper had pointed out that science-deniers are a real thing.There's entire documentaries about people that have things demonstrated right in front of them, and they refuse to believe it because they're pathologically fixated on a belief they arrived at via unsound reasoning.\n\nAnd this just exemplifies how much of an idiot you are.  Nobody here is denying science.  Science is a method.  What is being refuted is your conclusions.\n\nYou are the biggest culprit of using logical fallacies here...and you provide no counter argument.  everything you've stated is ad hominem and I find no examples otherwise.",
