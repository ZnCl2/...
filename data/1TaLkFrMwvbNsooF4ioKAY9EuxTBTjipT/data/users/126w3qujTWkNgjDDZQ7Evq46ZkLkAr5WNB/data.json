				"body": "In my opinion, you are simply looking at things from the wrong point of view: it is true, the world is full of injustice, creativity is oppressed and the government is invasive. But it could not be otherwise. Human beings, for the most part, are stupid and chaotic beings, devoid of any spirit (without religious or mystical references) or ability to rise up.\nThe society to which you aspire (which is the same to which I also aspire, to be sincere), is a society capable of functioning only with individuals endowed with creativity, intelligence, spirit and the ability to rise. With the \"mass\", the \"vulgar\", which by its nature is self-destructive and lacking the necessary skills to understand what is necessary for a proper functioning of civilization, such a society would result in a catastrophe: continuous wars, even abuse worse than the current ones, and the loss of everything that differentiates us from the \"beasts\".\n\nThe alternative, no matter how bad it is, is not: if someone feels superior and different from all of this, he will be forced to live almost certainly relegated to an elité of individuals who have decided not to approve themselves.\n> just to wake this country up\nIt is useless to try to wake up the world (or even just your country): they are all in a coma.\nThe only thing to do is to look at society from above, using it for its own purposes when possible, and laughing and distancing itself from it when it is not possible.\n\nThis was my opinion, then, everyone thinks what he wants.",

If  the FBI obscure the server, you can't access to the content anymore.\nBut if every client that downloads the content becomes a server, the content would be offered by multiple PCs at the same time.\nFor example: if a photo is hosted on a P2P network, and it has 1000 peer, the FBI can obscure one or two of these, but not all at the same time, so the photo remain accessible . If the original peer goes offline, there is other 999 that can offer the content. \n\nI hope I have answered your question :)",
