The other option on Bisq is a face-to-face meeting, and there are not enough people using this method to make it practical.  I'm thinking that a ZeroNet zite could be created to make buying and selling bitcoin practical, convenient, and private.  I'm not aware of any application that provides all three.\n\nWell, there are as well other options. At the end you somehow need to invest physical money into crypto, you can't mine them anymore to a point that you will gain something. Either cash, credit card, bank account or something. You can tumble them or buy XMR and then sell them for Bitcoin and you should have a good layer of privacy.",
