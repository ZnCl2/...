			"body": "Incredible podcast (now censored and deleted) by RedIceRadio interviewing Jeremy Narby about anthropology and mythology and a counter theory about the antediluvian origins of our world. \n\nFrom WIkipedia:\nJeremy Narby is a Canadian anthropologist and author. He studied history at the University of Kent at Canterbury, and received a doctorate in anthropology from Stanford University.\n\nNarby spent several years living with the Ashaninca in the Peruvian Amazon cataloging indigenous uses of rainforest resources to help combat ecological destruction.\n\nNarby has written three books, as well as sponsored an expedition to the rainforest for biologists and other scientists to examine indigenous knowledge systems and the utility of Ayahuasca in gaining knowledge. Investigating the connections between shamanism and molecular biology, Narby hypothesizes that shamans may be able to access information at the molecular level through the ingestion of entheogens, specifically ayahuasca. The resulting documentary film was Night of the Liana.\n\nSince 1989, Narby has been working as the Amazonian projects director for the Swiss NGO, Nouvelle PlanÃ¨te.\n\nThe Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge (1995) ISBN 0-87477-911-1\n\nShamans Through Time: 500 Years on the Path to Knowledge (2001) edited by Jeremy Narby and Francis Huxley ISBN 1-58542-091-3\n\nIntelligence in Nature (2005) ISBN 1-58542-399-8\n\nPsychotropic Mind: The World According to Ayahuasca, Iboga, and Shamanism (2010) ISBN 978-1-59477-312-9\n\nPodcast:\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1uPLoaDwKzP6MCGoVzw48r4pxawRBdmQc/data/users/1G6SeTLb1v6LQfgg7ee4VuGQ61wkNVqdzz/RedIceRadio%20-%20The%20Cosmic%20Serpent%20-%20Jeremy%20Narby.mp4",
