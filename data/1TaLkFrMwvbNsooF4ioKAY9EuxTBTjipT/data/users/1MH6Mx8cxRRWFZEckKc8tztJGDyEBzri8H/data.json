Coherent design is an area where most Linuxes are missing. UI and usability is in many respects lacking. Look at Haiku OS (BeOS) where the entire system was designed with this in mind.\n\nOther than that, OpenSUSE is rather nice. Ubuntu was doing their best with Unity, but now dropped in favour of Gnome.",
