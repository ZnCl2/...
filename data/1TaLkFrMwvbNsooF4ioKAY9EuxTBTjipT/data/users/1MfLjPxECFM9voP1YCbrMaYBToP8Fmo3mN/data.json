It is under heavy development for almost 3 years now. If you know MTG you can learn it in one play session. Though similar, it is much more balanced and more complex when played properly (but you can learn the finesse secrets one-by-one). Also it is exclusively hosted in 0-net.\nAt the time there is no professional print-set - art work is still in developement - so you would need to print your cards by yourself - but it is worthy - some may say it is the best card game ever ;) (let's get real: it IS the best card game ever :D )\n\nThe esperanto version is also made to make translations easier - learning esperanto is highly recommended, esp. for english speakers - consider also seeding the esperanto talk: http://localhost:43110/1YwB6u3f9TUfre8H9scXkbPyeuMaJSJio/\n",

It is centered around human / social interaction, esp. all kinds of trickery, manipulation, treason, deception and diplomatic talk - which cannot be implemented by a computer client. Play via internet is intended to be realised by a video conference with real cards. (you could use a laptop with a small mirror by the web cam and play on top of your laptop if you have no external web cam)",
