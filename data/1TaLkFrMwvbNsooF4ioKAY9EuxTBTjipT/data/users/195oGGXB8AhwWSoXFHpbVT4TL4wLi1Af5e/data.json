I think you could very well succeed with landing some job in software/IT, especially if you have completed some university studies already and can put together a portfolio of some open source project you've been working on (KopyKate should be a good start). \n\nActually, I think it's mostly your environment that is treating you a bit harshly. I'm also currently studying for a software engineering degree at a university in Europe, my 4:th year, but I'm still struggling with some freshman courses. Only difference is that here it is no big deal, when I fail I can try the same course again next semester.\n\nPersonally I have found that after a stressful semester with university, working a few months with something totally different (e.g. delivery rider) can be really relaxing, but then again some other people really hate doing physical work... But I really think you can allow yourself to have a little higher ambitions than working at UberEats. If you want to try something different I have heard about people having success with doing a Working Holiday at some restaurant/bar/tourist resort in AU, NZ, and Thailand for 3-6 months.

For example, even though Sweden and Finland are pretty close neighbors, they traditionally have had very different approaces. Sweden have used their \"BankID\" system, basically a USB Smartcard reader that works with the web browser through some extension/Java applet. Finland on the other hand have single-use codes printed on a piece of paper. Most banks in Finland still use the old system with codes on paper, but some have transitioned to the mobile-only app for 2FA and it is expected this will be the new standard with all banks pretty soon.",

				"body": "Nowadays I use my mail server primarily for the purpose of receiving mail. Previously I used to forward mail sent to my personal domain to a Gmail or Outlook address, but at some point particularly Outlook started to apply very strict spam filtering, which caused important mail (for example a notice about termination of my housing benefit) to end up in the Spam folder in Outlook, or in some cases it was even discarded completely. With my own mail server however I can be sure that I receive every piece of mail that is sent to me.\n\nAll outgoing mail has to pass through my ISP's SMTP forwarder. When sending mail to most destinations, Gmail included, it usually works just fine and the mail ends up in the recipients Inbox. However, Outlook seems to be the exception, as I'd say 60 % of the mail end up in Spam, or is discarded completely. This is one of the things I hate the most with Outlook; you can not be sure the email will even end up in the Spam folder, because it can be discarded completely and the sender won't be notified of this. Gmail also occasionally seems to reject some mail without even putting it in the Spam folder, but in Gmail's case the email is rejected (so the sender will get a bounce notification that the email was not delivered), while Outlook silently discards it.\n\nI have a friend who is also running his own mail server. He usually complains particularly about Gmail being too strict with what mail they accept, while I think Gmail usually works quite OK while Outlook is the big problem. However, he has a business internet connection, which means his server can send outgoing email directly as his port 25 is not blocked. However, as I have my server on a residential internet connection, port 25 is blocked so I have to send all mail through my ISP's SMTP forwarder, which means any of the ISP's customers could be sending spam and have the SMTP server on a blacklist.\n\nWhether you should send mail from your own dedicated IP address, or use your ISP's SMTP server, might depend on what mail you will be sending. If you'll only be sending verified mail you know is not spam, it might be a good idea to use a dedicated IP address as it is unlikely it will end up in a blacklist as long as you do not send any spam. If however you'll be forwarding mail to a Gmail/Outlook account, which will include forwarding of any spam emails as well, it might be better to use your ISP's server as that server is likely used for sending other legitimate mail other than yours, which might increase it's reputation and not cause it to end up on a blacklist even if you forward a few spam emails.\n\nPlease note that these opinions are solely based on my own observations of running an email server, so they are not necessarily that accurate. The volumes I have on my server is about 10-15 incoming mails/week and 0-2 outgoing mails/week.\n\nIn conclusion, you will learn a lot by setting up your own mail server, and if you ask me, it's also great fun. As long as your recipients does not use Outlook, it might also work quite well.",
