I can use it from every device that has a browser as long as I am in my home network.For access outside your home network you could consider using a Tor service just like I do for ssh access. But I normally don't need Zeronet outside of my home network.\n\nInteresting never thought, making my PI available over TOR hidden service, cause then i could access it from anywhere as long as i can connect to Tor....\n\nany recommended guides for what you did?",
