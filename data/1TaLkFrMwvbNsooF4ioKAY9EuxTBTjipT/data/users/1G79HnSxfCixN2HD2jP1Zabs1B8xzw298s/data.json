S. DEBT as we speak 23 trillions, coincidence?) \n\n2nd scenario would be to represent 90% of the Global wealth in Bitcoins and the other 10% in Gold, Silver and other assets) that would still make 1 Bitcoin worth ~900,000 per coin. \n\nElites know and hide the plan. \n\n*all estimates \n\nFeel free to take part in the discussion.",
