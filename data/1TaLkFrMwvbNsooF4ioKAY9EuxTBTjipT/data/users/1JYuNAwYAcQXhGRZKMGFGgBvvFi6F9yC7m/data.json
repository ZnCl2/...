It was the best site on the internet for years in my opinion. After its reboot, it was cucked from day one of the kun. I will always remember 8chan fondly and have an image museum of its many great threads, happenings, and fantastic OC. 8chan was like 2006-2010 4chan, while it lasted. Much fun was to be had.\nI have a lot of faith in Millchan now and think that if there is a one-click-blacklist-all-cp button, it can be the platform that pushes ZeroNet to the next level.",
