				"body": "Safety of law enforcement officers policing the mentally ill are jeopardized\n\n \n\nIn 1998, people with mental illnesses killed law enforcement officers at a rate 5.5 times greater than the rest of the population.8\n\nIn 1998, law enforcement officers were more likely to be killed by a person with a mental illness (13 percent) than by assailants who had a prior arrest for assaulting police or resisting arrest (11 percent).9\n\nSince 1998, six law enforcement officers have lost their lives in encounters with assailants with mental illnesses in the Washington, DC metropolitan area alone.10\nSafety of people with mental illness is jeopardized by law enforcement\n\nPeople with severe mental illnesses are killed by police in justifiable homicides at a rate nearly four times greater than the general public.11\n\nIn Phoenix, incidents in which police used force with mentally ill people tripled between 1998 and 2003, continuing to rise despite a training program introduced in 2001 to teach officers about mental illness and how to appropriately respond to a mentally ill individual in crisis. In 2002, 30 chronically mentally ill people had confrontations with Phoenix police that ended with force, from physical restraint to shooting.12\n\nNearly one third of those killed in police shootings in New York City in 1999 were mentally ill.13\n\nA review of 30 cases of people shot and killed by police in Seattle disclosed that one-third of the people showed signs of being emotionally disturbed or mentally ill at the time of the incident.14\n“Suicide by cop”\n\nThere are also many cases where individuals with mental illnesses provoke police into killing them. This is now commonly called “suicide by cop.”\n\nOne study examined more than 430 shootings by Los Angeles County deputies between 1987 and 1997 and found that incidents determined to be suicide by cop accounted for 11 percent of all police shootings and 13 percent of all fatal shootings. The study found that suspects involved in such cases intended to commit suicide, specifically wanted to be shot by police, possessed or appeared to possess a lethal weapon, and intentionally escalated the encounter, provoking law enforcement officers into shooting them.15",
