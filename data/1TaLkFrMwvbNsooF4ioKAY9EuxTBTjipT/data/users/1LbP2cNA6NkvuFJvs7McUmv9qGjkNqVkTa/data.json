			"body": "I just found an issue that erases an already downloaded video to re-download it again. I was seeding the video of the Mosques shooting uploaded by a certain user, then tried to see the same video but uploaded by another user. As the latter was loading I closed the video page as I was merely interested in the comments it had but noticed that the first instance of the same video was gone as well, and both videos uploaded by those two users were being downloaded at the same time. As I can see both videos share the same hash so the site just over-wrote it. \n\nVideos should have a distinguishable filename to avoid this, or better, the site should check if the file exists before attempting to do anything; this could help to kickstart seeding of some videos by placing the video in the zite folder and then trying to watch the video on the zite.\n\nKeep zeroing~",

[...]\n\nSounds like a good approach, only take one thing into account: The handling of the file should be treated like a non-mutable object wich will exist as long as there's at least one reference to it in any zite, like, how objects are handled in garbage-collector using programming languages. Say you have the same video or picture being used (referenced) in ZeroMe, ZeroUp and KopyKate for example, you may delete the file 'logically' from any of those sites but the file on-disk won't be ever touched unless the three of those sites actually delete it, so there's no lingering references to a file and that file becomes truly disposable.\n\nKeep Zeroing~",

I'm sort of a lets call it an intelligence operative (Though I don't do any ops and she doesn't know anything about that) so I will kill myself if I go to jail (this one she knows very well). Currently I'm trying to minimise the damage done to children, either by convincing her to calm down, or by keeping everybody alive, but it's getting harder and harder. She's using really fucked up things to get this done. Help from my \"company\" is basically a proposition to \"solve\" this. But for fucks sake, it's my own wife! The fuck should I do? I want my children to have a father and a mother ALIVE. I can't understand her thinking.\n\nI'll assume you lost access to your other account or something. So you are kind of part of a secret police/hitman organization, won't inquire more info on that aspect but I find it hard to understand why you'll outright end your life if you end in jail, maybe in your country jail life is too tough or you'll find old 'customers' in there, idk. So she is trying to plummet every aspect of your current life and get you in jail, we still don't know why (neither you), as well, she ignores that you are part of an 'intelligence organization' (talk about Mr. and Mrs. Smith) and your utmost desire is to leave your children as unharmed as possible. \n\nWell, I can't think of anything besides trying to run away. \n\nIf you tell her about your job she will use it against you by calling you a bad influence to the kids or allegating you blackmailed her or something of sorts. Help from your company is counter-productive and (ideally) should not be used at all; if anything, some periodic surveillance would be much appreciated to know if kids are doing well but we aren't there yet. Given how you express yourself and what you've told us, I summarize things as:\n\n- Wife's crazy and only wants to cause you havoc and suffering,\n- Law is by her side, which means police is as well,\n- Kids are too young to take any roles into this and/or to see the whole picture and can't really (neither you want them to) take bands on their own,\n- Social media may not have gotten into this but it will worsen everything (say, having facebook people grind/bully you online),\n\nDisappear, she is against and after you, not after the children. I don't know if you are a wealthy guy which would add more sense to her actions. Of course that law enforcement agencies have way to track you so it's not easy (maybe not doable at all) but that's what I think is better as of now. Also, if you have at least one relative in talking terms with you I think it would be wise to explain your fears to it (don't talk about your job tho, that won't help).\n\nBest of lucks, keep us informed if you need more advice and tell us if things go right.

You should prefer a journaled file system though. NTFS had to be defragmented without journaling.\n\nJust to add, my main FS has been btrfs since a real while ago, more than 2 years now I think. It's pretty solid but it's almost a requisite to be aware of its many quirks and features. Snapshots did save me from some zeronet corruption (since SIGTERM isn't being handled properly) and many more times has helped me bear the not-always-stable ArchLinux updates. It's not meant for backing databases or virtual machines tho but I've found it pretty stable in my experience. Don't recommend if you don't plan to keep an eye over your filesystem.",

It's called an \"include\" or something like that: you need to reference child content.json from parent one\n\nI'm testing that in another site, so I added one folder to the zite root folder and modified /content.json to ignore the whole folder, say 'subdir'. Then in 'content.json' I added the include for 'subdir/content.json'. When signing it does skip all files under 'subdir' but I'd expect it to actually sign them and put in under 'subdir/content.json' instead, which it isn't doing.\n\nWhat I want is a way to make every folder have a content.json file that contains said folder files' hashes so no content.json is huge enough to make publishing fail or a zeronet instance to stall if the user/zite tries accessing a broken link or a not yet downloaded file. Any ideas if that's actually achievable? or do I have to manually make all hashes for non root content.json file?\n\nKeep Zeroing~",

Alone. \n\nThat's one reason many are trying to bring many more here, WE NEED MOAR PEOPLE. That ensures the longevity of zeronet as a project by keeping it popular and relevant, and by filling it with value in the form of content. There are other important reasons to call in the masses as well, many out there have a lot to say, or few things that matter a lot but they might never find the way to do it out there. Here we have free speech but how of afutile and useless thing would it be without any speech to be given? Don't think I'm outclassing you here, I truly understand the joy of being out of the crowd, the relief one feels when getting free from the cramped 'real world', but the people using zeronet aren't enough yet. \n\nA good thing we are missing is a way to keep tiny private groups of people to communicate with, like moderated irc channels composed of 20 or less users with a topic, so you can always listen to those important to you no matter how much spammy the rest of the userbase is.\n\nOutside we are powerless to lead our digital lives, with so much censorship and the law becoming more and more repressive, here we go after the same amount of people, but giving the power to each one in a way they can lead their digitals lives without opressing other ones.

That and also that I feel like ending it all is like giving up and I consider myself too pride for such thing, think of me as a more humble version of Vegeta.

Now, I've actually felt like a utterly powerless excuse of a person, dragged by society with many many eyes looking down on me, dissapointed. At those times I just moved out of the scene when able, that is locking in my room, skipping all social activities (wasn't ever a fan of socializing...) and never taking the initiative for doing things even if I liked them. I bet it was just my fear from death and pain what kept me alive at those times but now I for sure know something. I've noticed that, what was keeping me down was my own lack of sheer will to start doing things, not saying that you just need to go to the park and breathe and stuff, instead just *do*, do what you must to stay alive and move on but this alone won't make anyone move one leg after another, you also need a *reason*, may it be a dream, a goal or just a short-term checkmark just find something and stick to it (wouldn't recommend religions, anything can happen with those). To be honest, the you of now may be just taking everything bad out of your life and self-inducing a really lame overall feeling, but probably months/years later you could really make a laugh out of the current you.\n\nIf the wind is freezing cold and the sun won't shine for you then grab some wood, grab some fur and somehow make it through the winter, you'll find reasons to think different soon enough.

Linux users are used to UNIX philosophy of make one thing properly. Also, it isn't as easy to customize for the end user and everything depends on it too. For example, I can disable and mask some services easily but can't really turn logging off, and afaik you still would have to keep some code for handling different distros unless all systemd distros just decided to do their stuff the same way, which could be done with other init systems as well. I'm using runit and it's lovely in terms of speed, maintenability and ease of use. There are few scripts for it in the repos so far but making my own isn't hard at all.\n\nNow, let's be fair, I don't think I could run big time daemons with all the fancy stuff like isolation and cpu usage limit with it, but it does the job for me the average linux power user quite well.",

There's the feminine touch too, as Gensoukyou is full of girls you'd think it would be rather difficult to find the most feminine of them but just a few are delicate enough for that. There's Sakuya (again) but Kaguya may be another rival depending on what depiction of her you have.\n\nNow, if you ask for the cool moveset, or the outfit, or background/origin, well...\n\nI really like the idea of Lunatic Eyes of Udonge, but Youmu gets to a softer side of me for the bushido way of living she follows (and handling two swords like nothing). Yukari is rather interesting as well with all the boundary gaps she creates and Komeiji sisters' ability to read minds paired with their personalities are rather positive in my opinion.\n\nIf I were to choose one in terms of favourite possible girlfriend, I think either Mokou or Shameimaru would be my first options, mokou is a fire hazard but she seems reserved and under control most of the time.\n\nAnd finally, as you may expect from almost everyone, Marisa has a really special place, being a human with such high firepower, her rather rude and freeloader personality make her an interesting companion too, she is just charming, Alice can advocate for that too, lol.",

So they could end making weird dances in public, raising sticks and chanting spells waiting for powers to imbue them, or evicting certain places like the plague, fearing that only bad things happen inside those (hospitals, prisons, generally any closed family oriented business at night). With that last note, it applies to general media too, so in short the issue here is that videogames exploit boundless creativity that sets it truly apart from real world and some of its consumers sometimes fail to tell the difference from real and fake, or at least, that what works in one doesn't necessarily in the other. Also, if you aren't a stable person, or have your wrongly set up on something then video games won't do bad for your perception but will show how things are done (let's say you wanna die and you play DDLC, or you understand that some bullies at your school won't ever be punished unless you do something and you learn how to, uh, 'deliver justice?').",

Now for a more primitive reasoning, humankind is your kind and you are genetically wired to actually care for your survival and welfare. A lot of things in the human body are meant just for survival. The pain and it's importance for alerting us of danger, the way fear works in one's mind and things like adrenaline, the high nuisance that is the pain from hunger, etc...\n\nBut if you mind a more fair case, many people would argue that it is important to protect endangered species (some from social fear of going against mainstream media, others from a vague idea of the beautiful world we have, etc..), a scientific reason is because animals are all huge cocktails of different genetics that hide secrets of biology that the world (say, humankind) has been using for its advantage. From their anatomy to what substances make what things work or not work in them, they are quite good research subjects so preserving for the future, when tools and theory may allow for better and quicker understanding of their inner workings, is a reasonable idea, don't you think so?",

You see, there is/was a zite called antilibrary, it is now abandoned (apparently) but it was a project for keeping a big library of books here in zeronet. I think the author was facing issues on how to store all the books while allowing users to only get the ones they wanted up to an extent (more like, a couple books stored in chunks, you wanted one from it, you get the chunk). Now your zite. I don't know if you'll only ever keep 5 books at any given time, or if your zite will be growing by five books each week. If the former then I'd suggest not using the names of the books as their file names, but using generic filenames based on positions like book-0, book-1, etc... this would properly overwrite the past week 5 books and your zite won't likely be leaving the, by then, not referenced 5 books of the past week lingering in the users directory folder (as far as I know, it won't delete files in the zite folder that don't figure in the content.json).\nInstead, if you want to form a bigger library week by week, then mind storing every week's books in their own folder per week, with their respective content.json file and an include referencing all those week's content files. This will ensure your content.json files won't grow too big over time, and I think it aids with organization :)\n\nGood luck and thanks for the books.",

Then now, many countries are in war time/emergency states, civil rights vanished on thin air and  everyone's forced to obey on the premise that many other people lives are at stake by them not doing so.

Take for example a simple thing. Decades ago a metal beam would be so durable that you'd keep it as a family treasure without issues if it was at least properly treated against corrosion or not made solely of iron (and even if made of iron, it would likely last many many years), nowadays metal beams are as hollow as possible and while it can do the job it was meant by the manufacturer, it's also fragile enough as to not last long after manufacturer's expected lifespan. That's planned obsolescence and we (I assume we all do) loathe it. That's what we are discussing about, how comes you actually had to mean destroying something man made before for it to go down (ignore other too big things like the titanic and huge buildings as those are quite fragile based on its sheer size, and even the titanic fought like a champ), today you can just jerk a couple things and you'll find in the need of buying another.",

The thing is that a lot of that info can be easily escalated into artifacts of destruction and man slaughter among other things. Like, what's the difference between a slingshot and a crossbow? they are both based on quite similar concepts and one could say they are essentially the same in different scales and tiers.\n\nI try to express the same with the bombs topic, pyrotechnics are sometimes just fancy sparking, others they are quite powerful sonic weapons (if not fire hazards), and some are true ways to set something in fire. Finally, as I stated before I like to think on knowledge as a neutral thing, and on that thought I think that a game is only fair if both sides are balanced, that is, not only government and military should control power (by extension, knowledge), not even with the excuse of protecting. Many times along history the success of small guerrilla movements has depended on at least some clandestine weaponry knowledge, like the laser snipers hong kong people used against police. That said, that's quite the controversial topic and I bet many countries around the world are likely to charge you for having (not even spreading) such information in possession, so a notorious warning about what things one's about to see and seed would be appreciated.

But they are really difficult to perform in a scientifically useful way. Let me just outline this a bit: Everyone can do \"some kind of study\" and show exactly the impact he/she was looking for. And hell yeah, pharma companies buy a lot of exactly such biased studies. And de-publishing a once shown effect is very tedious too, even if no one can really reproduce the effect in a re-staged experiment. In the end, you have to rely on the peer-review system. But in that system you succeed by publishing articles that show something new, not so much by debunking stuff. That's why this system has trained itself to inspect and accept new results very carefully. So that's one thing: Controlled experiments are a pain in the ass to design, conduct, evaluate, review, and even to reproduce. Plus, trying new or not yet approved medication on humans is something that is even worse than other experimental studies. Usually you go with animal testing first, because clearly you don't want to damage anyone more than necessary. Next issue: participant selection with humans is usually hard enough, you always need a control group, watch your distribution over gender/age/... But worse: subjects who participated in one study, also cannot participate in another. Because that might lead to additional threats to validity. So in the case of very urgent matters where you want to have clean studies in very short time, such as with our covid-19 situation, you basically want to pre-select promising approaches/drugs before you invite participants. And then it's peer-review time again. [...]\n\nI see, wasn't fully aware of the inconveniences on just trying to reproduce a well known study. Don't worry for your manners, as of now I have quite a high esteem of you given your liking to properly established facts while not being overly harsh on people that doesn't. Yes, there are many tin hats around here (me among them), I know that I can be wrong any time on any manner; my main drive is more like trying to get as much input from whatever so I can feed my inner classifier algorithm better (over time, you start to see flaws in everything that has them).\n\nWelcome to zeronet, by the way.

I'm more radical and they're conservative; but perhaps three competing projects, should they succeed, are better for ZeroNet health so yeah I'm forking.

I'll make a gitlab account later for creating issues, I'd like a way to enqueue a massive amount of signPublish commands from the zeronet cli interface, I have a script that updates my zite that way and it takes A LOT of time since every call to it seems to reinitialize zeronet (the overhead per call is huge).",

Regarding the symlinks approach, I admire the genius of taking advantage of ext filesytem family for storing small symlinks in inodes but I think portability is of better service for zeronet as a whole so now I want feedback on this idea:\n\nI have to read about details of berkeley DBs but what if each site folder instead contained a single files.db folder storing the pairs of filename <-> block hash that the symlink approach tries to solve? if there are no big issues with the DB format (or maybe good ol' sqlite could suffice) it would solve the problem in a portable way and even it could be used with indexes over the block hashes (they are of fixed length too) so the refcount keeping for each content block under __blockspace__ becomes less indispensable as it would be reasonably fast to query a couple hundred indexed db's in case a refcount isn't reliable, and the sheer amount of files in the zeronet folder tree would be quite smaller (if it's of any service).\n\nAnother suggestion is for implementing a wayback machine sort of functionality; since the content will be deduplicated automatically almost all use cases will see a dramatical speed up and space usage reduction and everything that a given site's folder will do is just have all its files scattered linking to the correct content blocks but storing pretty much nothing on themselves, so it's quite easy to just zip/tar that folder structure with a timestamp and automatically it becomes a snapshot of the zite (would also work with the berkeley/sqlite db approach I suggested above but there would be no need for zipping, only copy-rename)\n\nFinally, I have a question for big files support, I've noticed that everynow and then zeronet seems to treat piecemap.msgpack files as either content or piecemaps (that is, sometimes it counts it as files part of the site, other times as meta files solely there for keeping track of a big file download progress), will there still be need for such files? can it be solved with just a db file for big files pieces (piecemaps.db maybe?) per site?\n\nEND OF FEEDBACK",
