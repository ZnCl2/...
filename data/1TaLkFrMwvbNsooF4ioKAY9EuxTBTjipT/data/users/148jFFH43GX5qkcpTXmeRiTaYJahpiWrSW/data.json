We know that trust drops in areas where the ethnos is attacked, not only between separate ethnic groups but also among the same ethnic group.  It is no coincidence that much of the actions of globalism against everyone is happening now after decades of deconstructing this racial/ethnic solidarity.\n\nOf course, ethnic solidarity is only one of the defenses against the globo/zio/banker cartel.  Strong family ties, and yes class ties can also help groups hold fast against outside attacks.  What's the best way to revive a class consciousness, and how do we \"weaponize\" it against enemies?",
