I use their email service, they seem alright.\n\nNo I forgot where I found the source from but the main company that owns NordVPN also owns ProtonVPN. I use to use Nord up until the latest breach they didn't tell anyone about. The best VPNs I used since then are AirVPN and ExpressVPN. The more I looked into Nord being a shady company, the more I felt uncomfortable using them. The breach was the icing on the cake and I finally deiced to drop them.",
