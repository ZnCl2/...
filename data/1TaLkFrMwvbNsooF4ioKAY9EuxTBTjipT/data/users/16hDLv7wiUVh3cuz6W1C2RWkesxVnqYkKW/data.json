I just mind my own business and then all of a sudden this black guy points to me and out rite says \"your a racist\" i looked at him like um ok why? This other black guy started to chime in saying yeah he is. I looked at him, said. Im not a racist, what makes you say that? he replied \"your white, so your automatically a racist and started laughing\" see my problem with this is that in America this can lead to serious problems for me. And its next to impossible to speak against is because they will just turn it around and use it to prove that i am one... I fear that if something is not done about this, then it will lead to a nasty future where the whites are not persecuted, and ultimately discriminated against... Now again i dont think im a racist but since this was about a week ago now, i have to say im feeling a little PISSED!!\n\nsome people are just crazy, ignorance is the best thing to do.",
