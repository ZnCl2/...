XD\n\nI don't really buy into the vaccine tracking thing, particularly when it starts down the vein of \"microchips\", but when they require \"papers\" confirming vaccination status to participate in literally any facet of society (air travel, crossing state lines, retail shopping), the vaccine is legitimately a tracking device and a system of control. \n\nI'm not particularly at risk from the virus, and am not terribly concerned about vaccine side effects, but I will not be participating from a perspective of principle. This is not smallpox. It is not the plague. Yes, people are dying, and that's always a tragedy to lose people, but public policy MUST NOT be based on feelings (sadness), but on facts, statistics, and the greater good. \n\nA virus with a fatality rate of less than 0.02% (generally) is not cause for such a usurpation of liberty. As such, I will not comply.",

It's just good propaganda that make you idiots believe it.\n\nI think we're on the same side here, lol. I had the China virus - admittedly, I'm in a low risk category, but I've had much worse symptoms from the flu.\n\nI don't do the flu vaccine either, yet I contract it with approximately the same frequency as the average rate WITH the vaccine. Based on that, I don't think I need it.\n\nLong story short, I won't be doing the China virus vaccine (nor the flu vaccines), but I will continue doing what I do when I have any other illness - try not to share it... A little common sense goes a long way. Sadly, it's becoming a scarce commodity.",

In my opinion, the China virus is little more than Flu 2.0. No justification for shutting down the planet.",

There's plenty of information that states the recovery rate from the so called Sars-Cov-19 virus is 98% for the average person in good health.

You may only have a small pool of assets invested, but you can lose FAR more than what you've put in.\n\nTBH, I didn't fully understand shorts until I sat down and invested some cycles in understanding it. It's not a complicated concept, but there's some obscurity in the terms used that make it a bit less clear for the uninitiated (myself included). After I grasped the concepts, I put in a short order for a very small amount of money, on an equity I knew wouldn't be insanely volatile for any real duration. After closing out my position, I made something like $0.30, but it was worth the exercise to understand the mechanics of the transaction.",
