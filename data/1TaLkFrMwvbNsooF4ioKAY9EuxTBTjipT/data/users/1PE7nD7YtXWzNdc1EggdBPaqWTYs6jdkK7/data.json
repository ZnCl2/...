			"body": "So apparently a guy got banned from a linux foundation event for wearing a MAGA hat to a convention. The foundation says it goes against the CoC, I don't know or care that much if it really does. But isn't that a bit too much? It's was not a swastika, it was the merch of a democratically elected president.\n\nMy thoughts are:\n\n1 - I think people have the right to not accept others in their property for whatever reason they want, but that doesn't mean I think people should exercise this right at every opportunity.\n\n2 - The blog post raises some valid points about the way the thing was conducted by he linux foundation, doing all of this through public twitter posts is bad management.\n\n3 - I think this is a mix of virtue signaling and fear of bully-by-the-twitter-mob. Reminds me of a book called \"Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language\" that I've been wanting to read. Grooming is a very important for the structure of primate societies, it relieves stress and strengthens bonds. Maybe online mobs(like gossip) serve a similar purpose in human societies.\n\nThinking that those people are only doing this because they can't eat the fleas of strangers anymore offer me some \"poetic relief\".\n\nWhat do you think about what happened and/or my thoughts? Try not to get into whether you like Trump or not.\n \nhttps://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2019/11/08/OpenLetterLinuxFoundation.html",
