			"body": "Recently I'm engaged on special work to help some Christians, by using the decentralized web. \n\nSince I’m myself an amateur only, without very good mastering of PHP language,  \nI’ve got a few special questions here, related to the webpage style management. \nFor example, on the below site, \nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1B4vYHwkCywhjs3GMxFSvdCraYj5dh9LTV/ \nthere’s a plan to add a few lines of content at the bottom part of the page (called \"footer” or not? )\n\nAdjustment work has been done on the file of all.css, besides the other file index.html. \n\nSome problems are encountered on the newly added section, which includes the special bold line of text in the middle part, \n**the ShadowGate • A Hot Topic at the Sensitive Season — An Unprecedented Exposure！**\n\nThis newly added section is planned to appear at the bottom center position of the page, instead of the left position. \nRight now, I don’t know how to do the further adjustment, so as to move the position from left to center. \n\nMaybe some special adjustments are needed on the file of all.css, or a simple adjustment on the index.html can get it done? \n\nThere’re some excellent masters here. Please give some advice when at your convenience. Many Thanks.",

At that time, the video could not be played so smoothly as nowadays, like the ShadowGate video \nhttps://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYnqet8SwumRr9mxSFmgGxSnFSZQmcBBt99PmpqeaHYsd \nWith quicker speed of data flow now, some senior Christians are also attracted by the newly-emerging innovation. \nRight now, I myself need to learn lots of things, so as to make better presentation of content via this new technology. \nAs an amateur enthusiast, occasionally, there may be some silly questions.  In that case, please don’t laugh …",

				"body": "Thanks for your guide. You’re certainly an excellent master here!! \nThere'd be some unconventional content produced by some volunteers, at this special stage of history.  \nOccasionally, there may be some other questions. Hopefully, obstacles on the way of learning will be less and less.  \n\nAs to the site,  there’re some Chinese Christians as well.  Quite much of the Chinese content is focused on the potential of revolution in East Asia …  \nHowever, too many details are involved. It may be a worldwide topic …  \nThe percentage of English content will be higher.  ",

If it's not okay, it's better to use ZeroNet over Tor.\n\nHello Master, \n\nYour professional guide helps much! \nThere’re some other questions. It’s a little long, so details are organized in the below url \n[Questions by Amateur Enthusiasts ](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1B4vYHwkCywhjs3GMxFSvdCraYj5dh9LTV/?Topic:1_197jsoB6dvq3kKxENBre1AfZhG5JbhXrRF/Questions+by+Amateur+Enthusiasts)\n… … \n\nSo the question is \n**How to add functions that allow \nRAR file upload on a forum site ? **\n\nIf there’re many steps, it’d be better that there’s already a site that has such functions, then I can learn directly on that site, so as to reduce the frequencies of some silly questions. \n\nThe goal to add the new functions is simple, as shown in the below url (in Chinese, the general message is that quite many Chinese people like to get some softwares to circumvent the GFW)  \nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/168x9d56MSBjrq6TYoDaSvxXSux3nPzw37/?Topic:3_1KjezDT16Z47VxZasHVX4LLTb91h94FKXg/+V2Ray+ShadowSocks+Psiphon \nThose softwares often launch updated versions every few months. \nSo to add the functions of uploading .RAR files will help solve it. \n\nAt the era of coronavirus, timey access to the truth of facts data may help some people save their lives! \n\nMany Thanks!",

Just wondering...\n\nHello Master, \nA very nice video has been posted on a special File Share site, \nCharlie Chaplin - Adenoid Hynkel Speech - The Great Dictator (1940) \nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1H1DB7PXNUNo8LNLYZZZKd5qaRadLg8Uzk/ \nplease help check if it can be downloaded smoothly? \n\nCurrently, there’s some feedback that the smaller JPG photo could be spread efficiently on Zeronet, however, large volume files such as video or software may encounter some troubles of data-flow problems. \n\nAre there any other netizens who encounter similar problems? \nA question here, does it mean that\n **the more peers there are, the more quicker data-flow will be? **\nIf so, if there are hundreds of thousands of peers on Zeronet, then Video transmission will be much easier? \nIs this understanding correct? \n\nAs to the Chinese content related to some sites, now with the most crazy scheme exposed, more people will understand why great teamwork efforts have been made on some bilingual content.",
