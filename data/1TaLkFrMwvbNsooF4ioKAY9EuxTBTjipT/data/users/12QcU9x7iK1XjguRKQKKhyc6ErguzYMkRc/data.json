Since we realize this, we should prepare by making/finding/using things that are ready to roll out at a moments notice to the general public.\n\nThis is EXACTLY what must be done for the sake of public safety and human rights. If we do not think ahead, then the consequences for the masses will be dire and long lasting. Prevention is always cheaper than correction in politics and business I have come to find.",

Czy jest coś, na temat po Polsku?. Jak bardzo trudno to zainstalować?. Czy ktoś posiada wiedzę w tym temacie.Jeśli tak; to proszę o więcej informacji na ten temat..Wireless Mesh Networks to Circumvent Internet BlackoutsHello; Interesting project; Question?. Are there other projects of this type?. How can you join this?. Is there anything in Polish?. How hard is it to install?. Does anyone have knowledge in this topic.If so; then I am asking for more information on this.\n\nThere are other projects of this type; a quick startpage for wireless mesh networks uncensorable (or similar search terms) should show many results.\n\nThe means to sign up vary I am sure based on the projects design. More can be found on the individual project's respective websites.\n\nI am sure Polish language projects are beginning to exist. This is a new concept for civilian use. Previously mainly used in military.\n\nRelatively easy to install with a little tech knowledge.\n\nOthers may be able to help you more I am sure. :)\n\nLet us know if you come across any interesting findings or set up some cool networks! :D",

I was told to lay low because they felt my life may be in danger if I did not. They told me not to tell ANYONE that I had provided such information to them and that they would figure out what was going on as soon as they could.
