The police and now ITD has too much free time and they constantly poke daily drivers. Ofcourse to a less extent than a few years ago but still. I hoped it can be avoided, and it's a tough choice to discourage them in such a hard way :/ We don't see any other less damaging options for now. The french group which contacted us is in almost the same position. Really tough choices need to be made. Country instability because of fucked up \"safe car driving\". How the fuck do we explain this to the next generation? \"Someone fucked up your country because someone wanted to drive slower\"? This is just getting better and better. What's next? Fucking civil war because someone didn't want to cancel a ticket?\n\nAgree man, in Italy it's the same",
