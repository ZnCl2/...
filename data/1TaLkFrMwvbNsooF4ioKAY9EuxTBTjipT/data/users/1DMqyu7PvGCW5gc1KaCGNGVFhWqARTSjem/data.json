				"body": "I run ArcoLinux. It's built on Arch Linux and it's main feature is that it's designed to teach you how to use Arch from the g round up. It gets you away From windows and honestly frees you from the bloat, proprietary bullshit, increases computer lifespan, and more. Also, all of you data is secure. When I was on windows I'd delete files and they'd come up again  - you need special software to do regular shit. On linux, if I delete something, it's G O N E. This level of control offered by Linux (Arch) is why people love it so much. ArcoLinux is an out-of-the-box ready Linux distro, but you can get versions that are varying degrees of barebones. If you run mac/win I  H I G H L Y  recommend you switch to ArcoLinux - don't fall for the manjaro meme, or ubuntu or whatever. Arch has the best security, has the best repository, has the best documentation (ArchWiki + Arco Linux + AUR), it's unbeatable. It'll take probably a month or two to be a fluent, proficient user if you migrate from windows. There's no bullshit CLI stuff you have to learn, if you don't want to. The desktop environments (there are 8+ common ones) are amazing and highly customizable and everything is free to do. Please I urge any win/mac cucks to  transfer to linux. There are tons of resources out there, look up DistroTube to learn about stuff.",

Make a new ID with that mode enabled if you really need anonymity. [...]\n\nYes using tor always is important. \n\nAlso, make sure to seed the websites you like. If you seed them, and allow them to take up some space, then you will be directly contributing to the quality of the website. It'll only seed when the Zeronet server is running (i.e. when you're logged onto it via Tor-Browser), so your anon-level will remain secure. I have around 12 sites im seeding right now. I don't want this to die, I want freedom of speech for all.",
