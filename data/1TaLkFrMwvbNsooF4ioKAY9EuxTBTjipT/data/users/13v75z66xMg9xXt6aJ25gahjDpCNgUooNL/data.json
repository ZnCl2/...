WE polluted out air, water, land, food sources, etc, not Him.  HE allowed his Son to die a most gruesome death and yet we think He should \"protect\" us from harm.   He loves us no matter what we do, but as a parent He doesn't condone everything we choose to do.  As a parent He wants us to come to him and repent our sins knowing we are only going to sin some more.  WE choose our destiny, what we put in our bodies whether it's good for us or bad.  Don't blame him because we are unappreciative and greedy and careless.",
