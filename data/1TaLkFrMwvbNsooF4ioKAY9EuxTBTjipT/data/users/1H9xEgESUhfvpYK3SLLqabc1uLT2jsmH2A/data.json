I have my proxy UI restricted to my local IP and I don't have auto seeding enabled on the IFS cluster so I'm a bit clueless as to how the file appeared.\n\nThe file in question was `Michael_Caine_with_a_young_girl___Watch_online.mp4`\nWhich appeared on the proxy about two hours ago from writing this comment. Doing a search on IFS doesn't reveal the file so it must have been deleted or renamed.\n\nI did some further digging and I'm adding the user to my local blacklist to prevent future incidences from that user as they also have rape material published, so I am only left to speculate the legality of the 'young girl' video as well.\nThe UserID is `eroge@zeroid.bit` for anyone else who might be interested in adding it to their blocklists.\n\n`~\\ZeroNet\\data\\15fDN4wasXuyS8krtKvrxEVmWWLz6Qh518\\data\\users\\18fPUkt6NqUxRtpYgETn1fFmseYek1sJfF`\n\n```\n\t\"user\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"user_id\": \"18fPUkt6NqUxRtpYgETn1fFmseYek1sJfF_user_1\",\n\t\t\t\"user_auth_address\": \"18fPUkt6NqUxRtpYgETn1fFmseYek1sJfF\",\n\t\t\t\"user_name\": \"eroge@zeroid.bit\",\n\t\t\t\"cluster\": \"15fDN4wasXuyS8krtKvrxEVmWWLz6Qh518\",\n\t\t\t\"date_added\": 1583358697236\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\n \"address\": \"15fDN4wasXuyS8krtKvrxEVmWWLz6Qh518\",\n \"cert_auth_type\": \"web\",\n \"cert_sign\": \"HLs5dmnjASVrrzZhUQkI95u5feL0KeJr2dtmD5evmwHzJPOxkLo/xZFcLbE+v1DnmmPEpT/XHfP4hLLm8lBnd40=\",\n \"cert_user_id\": \"eroge@zeroid.bit\",\n  \"A_small_rape_clip_from_the_film_Trade___Watch_online.mp4\": {\n   \"piece_size\": 1048576,\n   \"piecemap\": \"A_small_rape_clip_from_the_film_Trade___Watch_online.mp4.piecemap.msgpack\",\n   \"sha512\": \"7a37a54ae94d930e705f2fa1123edf8ed195e2cf45fb9da370cf9fd3c907a3cf\",\n   \"size\": 9235087\n  },\n  \"A_small_rape_clip_from_the_film_Trade___Watch_online.mp4.piecemap.msgpack\": {\n   \"sha512\": \"ac9cd822c46147a23f80f09210778d621bcb63bbcc2207b5401ccd54895b4d73\",\n   \"size\": 381\n  },\n  \"Michael_Caine_with_a_young_girl___Watch_online.mp4\": {\n   \"piece_size\": 1048576,\n   \"piecemap\": \"Michael_Caine_with_a_young_girl___Watch_online.mp4.piecemap.msgpack\",\n   \"sha512\": \"e86b04d7d4e8ed628d49c9b65fb72b8f3c9d48e905c29f2271052efb0dc42ea0\",\n   \"size\": 4442076\n  },\n  \"Michael_Caine_with_a_young_girl___Watch_online.mp4.piecemap.msgpack\": {\n   \"sha512\": \"4258aef26c6a776e84d7164c9d131591cf537f6aef1b39f270d4b4237774ec78\",\n   \"size\": 239\n  },\n```\n\nJust wanted to post a heads up for anyone else who owns a seedbox to keep an eye out for mysteriously appearing files that you didn't authorize.",

Sadly, the United States is not one of those countries for the reasons listed below:\n\n - The US voting machines and ballot counting hardware and software are proprietary technology that has audits issued by the manufacturing company all while excluding any 'security' checks.\n\n - The electoral process takes huge sums of cash to compensate for travel, advertising, and campaign coverage.\n\n - The political system is based on a two horse race in that the two legitimate candidates will be either Democrat or Republican, and third parties such as Independent or Green will be ostracized and excluded.\n\n- The Electoral College has the power to swing the popular vote in the direction of a more favorable candidate. (as with what happened with Bush & Trump)\n\n- Provisional ballots are often not counted, which is coupled with voter spoilage and exclusion as seen with Interstate Crosscheck that was used to purge the ballots of millions of voters.\n\n- Gerrymandering which allows district manipulation to represent an unfair favouritism towards a particular candidate.\n\n- Individualized Targeted Advertising with political messages based on residential location and social media habits as seen with Cambridge Analytica.\n\n- The bias of mainstream news outlets that have shown to give an unfair advantage to one candidate while often spreading unfounded and repeat smear propaganda campaigns against the less desired candidates which will often have the article removed or facts correct at an unannounced later date after the election period.\n\n- The closing, limiting, and reduction of voting centers in areas of concentrated minority groups.\n\n- The Democratic National Committee admitting in court that the the organisation has a right to manipulate the Primaries and contribute funds to select candidates such as the usage of Superdelegate which are unannounced guaranteed appointments to a particular candidate regardless of other running mates.\n\n- Political parties often use joint fundraising agreements which allows campaigns to launder huge sums of cash.\n\nBut it is not all so bad as It seems that even the Democratic Capitalist America can't help but to sell themselves out to a country that identifies as Communist Dictatorship in the pursuit of unlimited wealth.",

After all, if the uploader has not found it worthy to keep their own material seeded, then why would anyone else?\n\nThe ability for other people to seed material WITH you is the intent of the network in that your client is not the sole provider of the material and to carry the sole burden of distribution as seen with conventional file hosting providers.\n\nTake the documentaries I share for example. Sure it is a strain on the proxy if it is the only one distributing that material, but when other people begin to view and deem the material is also worthy of their time, space, and bandwidth, does my own proxy begin to show a lightening of the load and the health and speed of the transmission of such material is dramatically increased.

I have shared titles from over two years ago and their status is still pinned.\n\nIf there is a delay in uploads it is likely because that node that published it is behind Tor, has inconsistent availability, (like someone's home pc), or is having a problem announcing their connectivity to the trackers. (Syncronite helps with that)\n\n> Surely the list was in my phone while this happened. Probably something different from a dead share happened, maybe a cluster corruption that spread between all nodes of the network? \n\nWe early adopters have to remember that many of the sites we publish on were just working proofs of concepts. Many expected their site to be used as templates for others to improve upon. Not to adopt and use. But I also understand that we must make due with what we have.\n\nAfter owning a zeronet proxy for over three years and seeding material from it. I would say I had my fair share of problems due to flakey bugs in the network. But my advice is to just be persistent. The clearnet was full of bugs and we as users had little problem adapting to those annoyances as well.\n\nFor example, when I publish material to IFS on my local client, I then go seed  it in my proxy so that I can then close my local client and keep my material seeded. Well, when uploading music to IFS, on the proxy I have to go to each file and play the mp3 and even advance the track position until the status bar shows 100% File Completed\n\nBecause every time I just click a mp3, or load a file and then browse away from the page, the mp3 will only load to %50 or so on the proxy (even though my local client is still running) which left unfixed will leave my proxy with an incomplete copy.\n\nOnce the file shows File Finished on the IFS status bar, I then go to those files and then PIN them on the proxy to ensure persistence. I've successfully used this method to keep music pinned in IFS for over a year without problem.\n\nI PIN both the file as well as the .msgpack file to ensure persistence.",
