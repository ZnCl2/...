			"title": "Are comments on RT being cyber-manipulated by bad actors?",
			"body": "RT (formerly Russia Today) is one of few online news media allowing free rein to discussion of the British nerve gas debacle and of the hysterical overreaction by the US and NATO countries to recent allegations of dubious validity that poison gas (seemingly chlorine) was used by Assad's government against civilians (and terrorists) in a community near Damascus.\n\nhttps://www.rt.com/\n\nReasoned opinion opposed to the US and UK stances is being deleted shortly after posting. Speculation about bad actors is deleted almost instantly. RT has no motive for approving the deletions. Bad actors have; this because well expressed views by educated people might just tip the balance in the minds of others as yet undecided where the truth lies.\n\nCould bad actors have infiltrated the comment system, presumably not an in-house one, used by RT? If so, where to point the finger?",
