			"title": "Few ZeroNet Peers coming from Un-Free Countries",
			"body": "I'm noticing on the ZeroNet STATS page that by far the most peers that are currently on line are in \"free\" countries, like the US and Western Europe.  There are only a tiny number from un-free places, like China and the Middle East.  What does that say about the reasons people are using ZeroNet and its effectiveness for people who really need to use it to access news outside their countries?  The recent post from the boarding school kid seems to indicate that TOR nodes are being blocked by any school (or by implication, country) that cares to do so.  If this is the case, then wouldn't it be impossible for ZeroNet users to form their own little local networks inside un-free countries, other than by hand-carrying data files to each other?  Or would those users just communicate with each other over their local, sectioned-off part of the clearnet, without going through TOR nodes?  If someone is reading this post from one of those countries (or boarding schools), please (if you feel it's safe to do so) let us know how you are reading it.",

			"title": "Skywire",
			"body": "I just came across information about Skywire, which is a decentralized network that uses skycoin as an incentive to use it.  I would love for this thing to become operational.  However, the skycoin  \"miners\" (not really miners, just used to process transactions) are sold by the Skywire organization for $2000 US each.  The software won't run on any other hardware (I think).   And the actual value of the hardware (as I figure it) is only about $500.  Also, the technical details of how the network will be set up are not well thought out.  The network starts out over the internet and then at some point transitions to a wifi peer-to-peer mesh network.  The problem is that wifi just does not have anything like the range needed to successfully transition off the internet.  I'm guessing that would initially require a range of something like 10 km.  So, this sounds to me like it might be a pyramid scheme dreamed up by a group of marketers.  Here are some links:\n\nhttps://www.coinbureau.com/review/skycoin/\nhttps://barbucrypto.com/2019/03/skywire-mainnet-skycoin-heralds-public-release/\nhttps://www.skycoin.net/\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts?",

The biggest problem is conveniently converting fiat currency into bitcoin in the first place.  I am aware that you can do this anonymously with bitquick.co and paxful.com.  However, the usefulness of bitquick.co is ending, because most banks no longer allow deposits into customers' accounts without ID.  It's also not all that convenient.  You have to use a burner phone in the transaction, go to a bank, photograph and email a bank receipt, etc.  I'm currently investigating paxful, but it seems to have problems too.  Already, it may be blocking my account, because I am connecting through TOR.  Does anyone know a secure and CONVENIENT way of buying bitcoin without revealing your identity?",

Not only do people identifying as the latest something-sexual get preferential treatment in the workplace, others, particularly heterosexual, biological males, are expected to cater to all the needs of the LGBTQI-whatever else crowd. This includes everything from uttering “correct” pronouns to special or shared bathrooms. Normal men also must adhere to draconian policies on “diversity,” which means never daring to disagree with or criticize the performance of a protected gender or sexual minority.\n\nBut has the solution been staring us in the face the whole time? One especially audacious budding politician from the University of Sydney, Alex Fitton, identified as a woman in late 2016 to win one of two student leadership positions...\"",

If nothing changes, and fast, the United States is about to suffer a huge death tole.  Various hospitals have already announced that they are at capacity, and this pandemic has just started!  Two days ago our local radio station broadcast a message from our local hospital saying, \"If you are suffering from Covid-19-like symptoms, DON'T COME TO THE HOSPITAL!\"  And, I am nowhere near California or New York.  I'm not even in a major city.\n\n[This article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/from-confidence-to-quarantine-how-coronavirus-swept-italy) says the mistake Italy made was ignoring people who were sick with covid-19-like symptoms.  My sister says she knows of two people who went to the hospital with covid-19-like symptoms, were tested, were told their illness was not the flu, and at that point, they were told to go home.  One occurred months ago.  Nothing was investigated further, no one was curious about what was making them sick.  I can imagine the doctor burping, farting, scratching his butt, and walking out of the exam room.  Our so-called medical \"professionals\" really are like the keystone cops of the world's medical professionals.\n\nThe worst part is that as I write this, I am watching a never-ending parade of traffic on the street outside my home.  I'm wondering where all these people going!  Why aren't they at home in isolation?!  I'm telling you that huge numbers of people are not taking this pandemic seriously.  They are going about their lives as usual, behaving exactly as they always have.  When 20% of them need hospitalization from covid-19, they will not get it!",

			"body": "I've been frequenting ZeroNet now for over a year, and I find my self looking more and more for entertaining and interesting content.  Maybe I have begun to lose sight of the point of ZeroNet.  I need to remind myself occasionally that ZeroNet was created by Nofish to provide a means of communication, should we reach a point where all other means have been taken from us.  The splintering of the Internet into government-controlled walled gardens has already begun in countries like Russia, China, and Iran.  In the United States and in many other countries that call themselves democracies, under the guise of preventing \"fake news\", laws are being passed and other controls are being put in place to prevent us from saying things governments don't like or are afraid of (while politicians are given free reign to continue telling the lies they've always told).  But this is happening slowly over a period of years.  Slow processes are less noticeable and harder to maintain vigilance against.  \n\nI and others try to come up with interesting content to keep people aware that ZeroNet exists, so that it will be here when they need it.  ZeroNet is a place where everyone can, and should, create content.  If we just want to be consumers of content, we can do that within all the walled gardens that already exist.  We can watch cat videos all over the Internet.  ZeroNet should be a place where we can let each other know what is occurring in our respective countries and discuss what we think about it and means of keeping communication open.  This and other decentralized networks that are mostly beyond the control of governments and the identification of those on them should be places where we are discussing those topics.  But, lately I have been noticing the volume of conversation declining.  \n\nFor a while, I was seeing comments appearing on ZeroTalk every couple of minutes.  Now, that has slowed to hours.  Why is this happening?  Are we becoming complacent?  Are people simply becoming bored?  Are people migrating to ZeroNet zites with cat videos and ignoring forums that have substantial, free-speech-oriented content?  Are they leaving ZeroNet for other decentralized networks that are better?  I know some have left after being confronted with the same old abusive comments that they find in other forums all over the Internet.  The valuable content they were finding here wasn't sufficient to counterbalance the abuse.  They are probably gone for good.  What are your thoughts about why ZeroTalk volume is down?  What can we do to increase it?  Or, are there better Zites on ZeroNet than ZeroTalk where important free-speech and open-communication topics are being discussed?\n\nI think I've been seeing the more abusive denizens of ZeroNet slowly losing interest and leaving.  So, perhaps ZeroNet is becoming a safer place for the more sensitive among us?  What do you think?",

			"title": "Bypassing China's Great Firewall",
			"body": "I found the following information at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_China#Evasion.  Below is a direct quote from the Wikipedia page.  Hopefully someone will find it useful.\n\nUsing a VPN service:\n\nInternet censorship in China is circumvented by determined parties by using proxy servers outside the firewall. Users may circumvent all of the censorship and monitoring of the Great Firewall if they have a working VPN or SSH connection method to a computer outside mainland China. However, disruptions of VPN services have been reported and the free or popular services especially are increasingly being blocked. To avoid deep packet inspection and continue providing services in China some VPN providers implemented server obfuscation.\n\nChanging IP addresses:\n\nBlogs hosted on services such as Blogger and Wordpress.com are frequently blocked. In response, some China-focused services explicitly offer to change a blog's IP address within 30 minutes if it is blocked by the authorities.\nUsing a mirror website\n\nIn 2002, Chinese citizens used the Google mirror elgooG after China blocked Google.\n\nModifying the network stack:\n\nIn July 2006, researchers at Cambridge University claimed to have defeated the firewall by ignoring the TCP reset packets.\nUsing Tor and DPI-resistant tools\n\nAlthough many users use VPNs to circumvent the Great Firewall of China, many Internet connections are now subject to deep packet inspection, in which data packets are looked at in detail. Many VPNs have been blocked using this method. Blogger Grey One suggests users trying to disguise VPN usage forward their VPN traffic through port 443 because this port is also heavily used by web browsers for HTTPS connections. However, Grey points out this method is futile against advanced inspection. Obfsproxy and other pluggable transports do allow users to evade deep-packet inspection.\n\nThe Tor anonymity network was and is subject to partial blocking by China's Great Firewall. The Tor website is blocked when accessed over HTTP but it is reachable over HTTPS so it is possible for users to download the Tor Browser Bundle. The Tor project also maintains a list of website mirrors in case the main Tor website is blocked.\n\nThe Tor network maintains a public list of approximately 3000 entry relays; almost all of them are blocked. In addition to the public relays, Tor maintains bridges which are non-public relays. Their purpose is to help censored users reach the Tor network. The Great Firewall scrapes nearly all the bridge IPs distributed through bridges.torproject.org and email. According to Winter's research paper published in April 2012, this blocking technique can be circumvented by using packet fragmentation or the Tor obfsproxy bundle in combination with private obfsproxy bridges. Tor Obfs4 bridges still work in China as long as the IPs are discovered through social networks or self-published bridges.\n\nTor now primarily functions in China using meeks which works via front-end proxies hosted on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to obfuscate the information coming to and from the source and destination, it is a type of pluggable transport. Examples are Microsoft's Azure and Cloudflare.\n\nUnintended methods:\n\nIt was common in the past to use Google's cache feature to view blocked websites. However, this feature of Google seems to be under some level of blocking, as access is now erratic and does not work for blocked websites. Currently, the block is mostly circumvented by using proxy servers outside the firewall and is not difficult to carry out for those determined to do so.\n\nThe mobile Opera Mini browser uses a proxy-based approach employing encryption and compression to speed up downloads. This has the side effect of allowing it to circumvent several approaches to Internet censorship. In 2009 this led the government of China to ban all but a special Chinese version of the browser.\n\nUsing an analogy to bypass keyword filters:\n\nAs the Great Firewall of China gets more sophisticated, users are getting increasingly creative in the ways they elude the censorship, such as by using analogies to discuss topics. Furthermore, users are becoming increasingly open in their mockery of them by actively using homophones to avoid censorship. Deleted sites have \"been harmonized\", indicating CPC general secretary Hu Jintao's Internet censorship lies under the larger idea of creating a \"Socialist Harmonious Society\". For example, censors are referred to as \"river crabs\", because in Chinese that phrase forms a homophone for \"harmony\".\n\nUsing steganography:\n\nAccording to The Guardian editor Charles Arthur, Internet users in China have found more technical ways to get around the Great Firewall of China, including using Steganography, a practice of \"embedding useful data in what looks like something irrelevant. The text of a document can be broken into its constituent bytes, which are added to the pixels of an innocent picture. The effect is barely visible on the picture, but the recipient can extract it with the right software\".\n\nVoices:\n\nRupert Murdoch famously proclaimed that advances in communications technology posed an \"unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere\" and Ai Weiwei argued that the Chinese \"leaders must understand it's not possible for them to control the Internet unless they shut it off\".\n\nHowever, Nathan Freitas, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard and technical adviser to the Tibet Action Institute, says \"There’s a growing sense within China that widely used VPN services that were once considered untouchable are now being touched.\" In June 2015 Jaime Blasco, a security researcher at AlienVault in Silicon Valley, reported that hackers, possibly with the assistance of the Chinese government, had found ways to circumvent the most popular privacy tools on the Internet: virtual private networks, or VPNs, and Tor. This is done with the aid of a particularly serious vulnerability, known as JSONP, that 15 web services in China never patched. As long as the users are logged into one of China's top web services such as Baidu, Taobao, QQ, Sina, Sohu, and Ctrip the hackers can identify them and access their personal information, even if they are using Tor or a VPN. The vulnerability is not new; it was published in a Chinese security and web forum around 2013.",

His mobile phones were taken from him, and at the time of writing, he had not been allowed to communicate with the outside world. The order for his internment appears to have been issued by the local 'préfet,' the official representative of the French executive.\n\nThe systematic use of psychiatric hospitals in order to silence or punish political opponents became widespread under communism, having started shortly after the Bolshevik revolution in Russia in 1917. The method developed under Stalin and then expanded as opposition to the 'socialist paradise' came to be considered a sign of mental illness. Under the 1966 penal code of the USSR, repression of dissidents openly targeted those who 'spread false propaganda defaming the Soviet State and its social system.'\"",

There she is again, addressing rioters with a rant about globalists, George Soros and stolen votes. And again, calling for weapons and gas masks moments before a rioter attacks an officer with what appears to be a baseball bat.\n\nNow, Bisignano has gone silent online. She is not allowed on the internet. Not because social media platforms banned her, but because a federal judge did. If Bisignano goes online while awaiting trial, she risks being jailed.\n\nJudges have long been reluctant to ban anyone from the internet, a restriction that essentially cuts a person off from much of modern society and has been reserved mostly for accused and convicted pedophiles. But as toxic disinformation becomes an increasingly dangerous threat, driving domestic terrorism and violence, the courts are facing vexing new questions around how often and under what circumstances those accused of taking part should be taken offline altogether.\n\n'We are headed into uncharted waters,' said Nina Jankowicz, a fellow at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank, where she studies disinformation. 'Given the threats we see continuing and the heightened alerts, it is clear things are not dissipating. … That is why judges are making these calls.'\n\nIn the case of Bisignano, the ban might have been an easy one for the judge to make. The defendant asked for it. Her lawyer saw it as one of the few bargaining chips the Capitol riot suspect from California had to stay out of jail for now.\n\n'If it weren’t for social media, she wouldn’t even be a defendant,' said Bisignano’s attorney, Charles Peruto. 'She knows that is what got her jammed in the first place.'\n\nYet attorneys for others accused of taking part in the attack on the Capitol are aggressively fighting the restrictions, and judges are struggling with how far to take them.\"\n\nI thought they only did things like this in China.",

It turned out to be a ruse.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was led into a conference room, where two FBI agents were waiting. I was immediately caught off guard, not having any idea why the FBI would want to talk to me. I’m a husband and father of two young kids, and I have always focused on building a good life with my family, both as a business owner and as an engineer in Michigan’s automotive industry. \n\nAlthough the FBI agents told me I could leave whenever I wanted, when the door closed and they started questioning me, it certainly didn’t feel that way. They told me they wanted my help in looking for people in my community who might want to harm this country. They thought I’d be useful to the FBI because of my language skills (in addition to English, I speak Arabic), my Lebanese heritage, and my engineering expertise. I felt unsettled because becoming an informant in my community would violate my personal ethics. Still, I maintained my calm, told the agents my primary obligation was to my family, and that I didn’t want to work for the FBI. But the pressure continued.\n\nThe FBI agents asked me about my political and religious beliefs, associations, and the years I spent living in Lebanon as a student. I answered all their questions truthfully. I was born in Chicago, and completed high school and three years of college in Lebanon before returning home to Michigan to finish my education. \n\nI repeatedly insisted I did not want to work for the FBI, but they kept increasing the pressure. I was shocked when the FBI agents accused me of affiliation with a terrorist group. I vehemently denied their false accusations, but it didn’t seem to matter. My anxiety level rose even more when the agents threatened my family and me. They said that if I didn’t agree to become an informant, my family would be investigated, my wife and I could be arrested, my children could be taken away, and my wife’s immigration status could be at risk. \"\n\nFBI agents who use thuggish tactics are thugs.",

			"body": "I know this has been said many times before, but I am sure that we can all benefit by being reminded from time to time.  If you are not a programmer, and you value ZeroNet and specific ZeroNet zites, the best way to support them is not to give money.  It is to use them.  In the case of forums like ZeroTalk and  ZeroVoat,  using means posting and commenting on existing posts.  The only way that ZeroNet can prosper is for enough people to use it to draw others in (the network effect).  New users will not return to deserted Zites.  So, if you have found some neat zite on ZeroNet that you would like to see prosper, interact with it in whatever way it allows.  If it is a blog that allows comments, then comment.\n\nAs with the regular Internet, a big problem that ZeroNet has is that most users are lurkers who are not interacting much.  Very, very few blog creators, forum creators, or any other sort of Zite creators have the mental and emotional stamina to continue supporting a zite for years that no one interacts with.  I think this is the main reason ZeroNet has become a graveyard of abandon zites.  You have to make your presence known to motivate creators to stick around.  And an occasional expression of appreciation (non-monetary) is also very much appreciated by creators and developers.\n\nPersonally, I love ZeroNet and ZeroTalk, and I really, really want them to prosper.  So, please do more than lurk.\n\nI would also very much appreciate your support for my two zites if they interest you at all: [ZeroTalk Tech](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EfLnw7GDXbZfJmGNoXGQ4XkuHGWkRZTMq) (now nearly two years old) and [The All-Night Bookstore and Cafe](http://127.0.0.1:43110/13gLfTixjjktySEGHBMnmrQu4qMJpoRuXw) (which has only been on ZeroNet for five days).  The second zite is especially dependent on your interaction.  In addition to being a long-term opportunity for socializing with other ZeroNet users, it was designed specifically to be an opportunity for the less technical ZeroNet users to post their own creative content.  I hope as many of you as possible will take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nPlease tell us some of your favorite ZeroNet zites in order to let others know about them, so they can support them too.",

			"title": "Some of My Thoughts on Free Speech",
			"body": "For a network that was created to support free speech, we ZeroNet users do not seem to talk about it much.  I know this can be a difficult subject, not only to discuss but also to solidify in our own minds.  We want to be free to speak about issues that are on our minds, but we cringe sometimes when others do.  Many of us find the speech of Nazis, racists, and child pornographers deeply offensive.  That incentivizes us to criticize the offenders and to attempt to force them to leave ZeroNet.  In effect, many of us believe in free speech without really believing fully in it.  \n\nI know in the case of child pornography, we have the additional problem of children being harmed, and that their rights should trump those of the child pornographers, so perhaps this is a bad example of a free speech issue.  Then again, for reasons that I will give below, maybe it is not.\n\nI guess I am concerned more about the choices we make as a result of our understanding than about defining specific topics or types of speech that should be allowed to be free.  Many of us seem to want moderation on a platform that was designed specifically not to limit free speech, i.e. not to have moderation.  Moderation can be found everywhere else, and that is a large part of why we are here in the first place.  So, why would we want to bring the same system to ZeroNet that exists on the social networks from which we have fled?  That seems illogical.  It just seems to me that many of us are busy trying to destroy the gift that nofish has given us.  If we want moderation, we know exactly where to find it.  We don't need to create it here--except perhaps on a few zites in order to attract those to ZeroNet who are not yet ready to fully embrace the principles of free speech, because we hope that some day they may.\n\nI am concerned that many of us have not yet grasped the principle that limiting the rights of one person is the same as limiting the rights of everyone, including ourselves individually.  We may not yet be aware that freedom is an obligation as well as a right.  The obligation that we have is to allow everyone the freedom that we would like to have.  In the case of free speech, this means allowing everyone to speak about anything they want--no matter how offensive--just as we would like the freedom to speak about whatever we want that may offend others.  As has been said by someone famous whose name I cannot recall, offensive speech ***is*** free speech.\n\nMaybe part of the problem is with language.  Perhaps we should not even be using the words \"us\" and \"them\".  In talking about free speech, really, we are all them, and they are all us.  I suppose that to take this to its logical conclusion, this may even mean giving up the belief that we have the right to decide what speech should be protected and what speech should not.\n\nI'm not trying to be preachy.  Everyone must judge for him or herself to what extent he or she is willing to support the rights of others.  I can't do that for you, and you can't do that for me.  In other words, I don't have any answers.  I'm not even sure answers exist.\n\nEarlier in my life, I believed strongly in a religion that teaches that God gave us our free will.  Unfortunately, few in my church understood the implications of that belief.  While we said we believed that God gives everyone freedom, we were busy trying to take that freedom away.  Instead of loving others as ourselves, we were busy judging them and expecting them to be better and more Christ-like than we were ourselves.  We were expecting them to live up to standards that we were incapable of living up to.  And we did not even understand what we were doing.  Nor were we alone.  I see politicians in my country giving speeches in front of giant flags where they use words written by others who are smarter and wiser.  They talk about how great our country is because we believe in freedom for all.  But, behind the scenes they seem to be working diligently to take away the freedom they publicly espouse.  \n\nThe desire to limit others' freedom--as it pertains to things that are really none of our business and where other people are engaging in practices that hurt no one but themselves--seems to be part of the human condition.  Perhaps it is a survival mechanism.  Or perhaps none of us are intelligent enough to clearly see our own hypocrisy.  Or perhaps, we really don't want freedom.  Perhaps we love the idea of freedom but not the reality of it.  Perhaps that means we don't really deserve it.  Perhaps only the Nazi's, racists, terrorists, and child pornographers are practicing the levels of true free speech for which ZeroNet was intended.  Perhaps the rest of us should leave who are trying to limit their freedom, since we can't benefit from ZeroNet, because we don't really want freedom?  Or perhaps--hopefully--my logic is faulty.  Perhaps I an simply confusing myself about a topic I don't understand, and I am extrapolating a line of reasoning too far.\n\nThese are some of my thoughts.  What are yours?",

So, who are running the trackers, and can anyone run one?  (Update: I answered my own question.  It looks like you can download the tracker software from Github (https://github.com/ZeroNetJS/zeronet-tracker).  So anyone can run a tracker. I get the impression from what I read on Github that trackers are some kind of generic things that are used on more than just ZeroNet.)  And when you say, \"currently my ZeroHello reports: TRACKERS: 52/68\", does that mean that there are 68 trackers in existence, or are there more?  (Update: I see from my ZeroHello: TRACKERS: 14/16.  So, I'm not connected to nearly as many as you.  This also tells me that the second number is not the total number of trackers on the planet.  So, we probably don't know how many people are currently connected to ZeroNet, because there could be many trackers that we don't know about.  But there must be a master list of trackers somewhere?)

I'm thinking this tracker-peer hybrid mesh network makes ZeroNet a lot more subject to governmental control than I was thinking, because all a government has to do is take down a small number of trackers (less than 50?) within its borders (including maybe a few within bordering countries?) to take down ZeroNet--as you said China is doing.

There isn't much out there about zeronet after 2016.\n\nThis is a three-month-old Reddit post:\n\n\nwaic90\n1 point ·\n3 months ago\n\nBy the way. Today I found many zites can't update in China due to the tracker connect problem.\n\nI tried to add 200+ trackers manually, but only 6 work ( none of them 100% success ).\n\nI wonder if our develop team has any plan to improve the decentralization or reliability of zeronet so that it can break through the blockade by the government.\n\n\n\nd14na\n1 point ·\n3 months ago\n\nThe current tracker-based system is very easily blocked by censors. I know that DHT is on the roadmap for the core developers.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom: https://acelewis.com/blog/about-zeronet         (2016)\n\n\"When ZeroNet sends the tracker a request containing the SHA512 hash the tracker sends back a request with the IPs of the people that have that file so you can connect to them...\"\n\n\"The only way for your site to go down is if everyone on your site decides not to seed (unlikely because many people/servers are set up to host all ZeroNet sites) or you get forced to use your private key to wipe the site.\"\n\n\"Due to the nature of ZeroNet you can go one step further and create a ZeroNet site (with the information on it) sign it and “forget” aka don’t save the private key. If you don’t have the private key then no one at all can edit the site, so no one can take it down not even you. This of course comes with the down side that you can’t update your site at all.\"\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom: https://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/p2p-web-hosting           (2016)\n\n\n\"The Intelligence Community have been flooding TOR with malicious nodes. With enough of those deducing the location of a hidden website becomes possible eventually. The higher the numbers of malicious nodes the higher the probability that a routing circuit will eventually be created comprising only the attacker's nodes. This allows the attacker to reveal the true IPs for both sides of the connections. This is called a Sybil attack.\n\nThere are probably some technical countermeasures that would make this sort of attack harder, but the kind of troublemaker who would be most likely to lead this effort has been kicked out following what looks an awful lot like a character assassination campaign by JTRIG. Probably the same people behind the allegations of sexual misconduct against Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange.\n\nEven if TOR wasn't being systematically compromised, keeping a hidden site hidden from determined investigators is very hard. It's easy to make mistakes.\"\n\n\"The main intrinsic limitation of ZeroNet is that it's less forgiving than the web with regards to unpopular content. The long tail is shorter. Beyond the handful of swarm-happy P2P sites is an empty wasteland of broken links.\"\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSo, the bottom line of all this seems to be that (as of three months ago) the Chinese government was successfully blocking zeronet, via removing trackers and blocking TOR nodes.  And, TOR really isn't all that effective anymore against governments' efforts to discover the identities of users by running their own TOR nodes--but I already knew that.",

The school can have a policy that states that every student that attends must let the teachers or whoever search their belongings upon request.  If the student does not comply then the school will kick them out.  If a student does not like this policy, then the student can go attend a different school.   The same applies for companies and their policies for cellphone use, searching belongings and many other issues.  A number of companies that i used to work for demanded that cellphones be kept somewhere other than with u while you worked so that you would not be distracted.  I still had access to my phone if i wanted but i couldn't have it on me.  If i didn't like that policy then i could have left the company.  The only exception to this is if you go to a public school or work for the government as the government is not allowed to search or seize your property without a warrant.

It is likely  that more common desktop linux distributions will officially run on raspberry pi 4 but i would suggest the system should be completely loaded into RAM at boot because SD cards are not good with read/write cycles (I.E. just as in puppy linux). I am curious if Pi4 could be used as a terminal server (something like LTSP.org ) to improve performance of an old laptop which has not much more than 1GB. I definitely would prefer 2 Ethernet instead of 2 HDMI for that. In such setting it could nicely host something like a tor gateway as well. And of couse a zeronet bundle! I heard  the GPU part stil relies on proprietary stuff anyway, but that way it would not really require it.\n\nTheir choice of two micro HDMI ports annoys me.  There is no way I'll be using this with two monitors, probably not even one.  The other issue is that no operating system runs on it yet, including the latest Raspbian, so there is no reason to buy it yet.",

Also, each Zite is owned by someone who has to be able to stop others from modifying their zite (centralization by design).  I think that's why there are so many zites that haven't been updated since like 2017.  A couple of website owners have died and others have apparently just lost interest.  Also, there is the bit-torrent tracker issue.  ZeroNet requires bit-torrent trackers to function (although other people say there are other methods of connecting, which I haven't investigated yet).  My understanding is that China has been fairly successful at taking trackers down.  I've heard the number 6 remaining out of 200+, but I don't know how to verify this.  Then there is ZeroID centralization; although people have pointed out that there are other ways of creating an ID on ZeroNet.  The bottom line for me is that ZeroNet is a combination of centralized and decentralized software.  Hopefully, it will become more decentralized in the future (like with IPFS, DAT, CJDNS, etc.), and there have been many, many discussions on ZeroTalk about this, so it's nothing new to people who have been here for a while.

This means that fresh fruits and vegetables have few nutrients. Then there is the fact that people go to Walmart and fill their baskets with Dingdongs, candy, and cookies, rather than the good stuff. Also, before the 1960's parents taught their children to eat nutritious food, because before antibiotics, a person being robustly healthy could mean the difference between life and death when he got sick. Now, we have antibiotics, so parents no longer have to teach their children to eat well to keep them alive",

[...]\n\nNothing you've said here makes sense.  But, why don't you tell me why you think crypto was created?  I thought is was to be a replacement for the fiat currencies we have now.  In other words, it was supposed to be a store of value, a medium of exchanges, and a unit of account.  I've shown that it can't be used as store of value, because an infinite quantity of it can be produced.  It's fine as a medium of exchange.  It's questionable as a unit of account, because the value of it fluctuates so wildly.  But it could possibly be stabilized somehow to make it a better unit of account.  So, while it could replace the SWIFT system, that doesn't mean it could replace our current currencies as a store of value.  We would need something else to act as a store of value.  We could use gold-backed crypto for that.  But, governments (who I'm sure are fully aware of the point I'm making) have already shown that they will shut down any real-asset-based cryptocurrency.  This brings up another problem with bitcoin that is off of our topic of discussion--it is not immune to regulation, and anything that can be regulated can be destroyed.

Until they can do this right then they may have a shot at regulating crypto networks.  [...]\n\nThey are doing more than just regulating centralized exchanges.  They are making it very difficult for anyone to buy cryptocurrency with fiat currency without identifying themselves first. The one exception is when the buyer and seller meet face-to-face (which almost never happens; see the sparsity of face-to-face sellers on Bisq).  This means that they can tax essentially all exchanges of cryptocurrency for fiat currency.  In fact, the US Internal Revenue Service is already mailing out [notices of taxes due](https://www.zdnet.com/article/irs-begins-tax-hunt-for-unreported-cryptocurrency-profits/) for exchanges taking place as far back as 2013 (meaning interest penalties apply).  Being able to tax something is a large part of the definition of being in controlling of it.\n\nAnother method of exchanging crypto for cash anonymously via an exchange was to walk into a bank and deposit cash into the crypto seller's account.  But, last year banks started putting into place rules that prevent anyone from depositing cash into an account (even their own) without showing identification.  So, this is just one example of governments finding ways of controlling crytocurrencies by regulation that has nothing to do with regulating crypto exchanges.\n\nThe problem with decentralized exchanges is that the buyer and seller have to trust each other enough to make the transaction.  How do you develop trust?  Right now, most sellers of crypto insist that buyers identify themselves.   Anyone who has used an exchange should have become aware of this.  The risky alternative is to mail cash in an envelope to someone you don't know.  Paxful (a centralized service) has this as one option.  Strangely, when I tried to do this (the first and only time I tried it), they blocked my account and demanded that I identify myself before they would unblock it.  However, someone will likely solve this problem and make decentralized exchanges viable.  That could make cryptocurrencies a viable medium of exchange--unless governments can find some way of counteracting it, like doing away with all anonymous cash (at which point we could barter goods for crypto (like on Openbazaar), which brings up another set of problems for doing this anonymously).  Remember that I said, for reasons I've already mentioned, that cryptocurrencies cannot work unless the buyer and seller can be anonymous.  I'm pretty sure Satoshi understood this.\n\nBut this still leaves the problem of cryptocurrencies not being a store of value.  This is why they shouldn't be used as investment vehicles.",

If we are using Bitcoin, then there will only ever be x bitcoins. Creating one clone gives you the ability to, at best, double the currency supply and thereby half the purchasing power. However, a second clone only reduces the purchasing power to a third. A fourth clone to a quarter, and so on. You would need to not only create these clones, but you would also need to persuade investment into them sufficiently to split the market cap. Each one would, also, need to be recognized by exchanges and/or retailers for direct exchange. Why should I, running my own business, accept CloneCoin 20 and keep its exchange rate updated when it's functionally equivalent to Coin1? You would need to create and persuade users to invest equally into CloneCoin 0-99 to get to the same degree of inflation we have seen under the federal reserve.\n\nThis is a reasonable argument, and I can only respond to it by giving my speculation about how people would react to your scenario.  So, let me argue semi-logically from the other direction.  If there were in the world only one cryptocurrency, say bitcoin1, and I look at that and say, \"Wow, bitcoin1 is really valuable.  Why can't I just create another 100 million units of cryptocurrency identical to it called bitcoin2?  I could make a pile of money, because people will look at bitcoin1 which sells for $20000 per unit and see my identical product that only sells for $2 per unit and say to themselves, 'Why should I pay $20000 for something that I can get for only $2?'\".  I think investors would agree with that and be willing to invest in it.  As a result, exchanges would be willing to make their customers happy by carrying it.    There is no reason that, seeing my success, other people won't create bitcoin 3-99.  I would guess that after about bitcoin6, people would realize what is happening and ask the exchanges not to carry bitcoin7-99.  At that point others will step in and create other exchanges for bitcoin7-20, and then bitcoin21-55, and so forth.  As long as there is a financial incentive to create the next bitcoin version, someone will, and someone else will create an exchange for it.  The real problem is that this will continue on until politicians decide to regulate it.  But, if bitcoin can't be regulated, as some still claim despite all the evidence to the contrary, then regulation cannot work and the number of bitcoin variants will continue to grow until there is no more profit to be made by another variant.  And that point will be reached when there are so many variants that they are worth nothing.  In other words, it will not happen any time soon, but it will happen.   On the other hand, if bitcoin can be regulated, then it will.  Once it is regulated it is under the control of a centralized authority.  Since the whole point of bitcoin in the first place is to prevent it from being under the control of a centralized authority, bitcoin will be no better as far as the crypto enthusiasts are concerned than the dollar, mark, or yen.  I could go on with my speculation and explain why that is true, despite the value of the blockchain, but I don't think there is a point, if you don't see the value of my speculative argument up to this point.",

Perhaps we will just have to agree to disagree and watch to see what happens.  \n\nI do have one example, however, of another tool that spreads on the basis of popularity in a similar way as cryptocurrencies.  That is Linux distributions.  Currently there are over 700.  I was not able to find how many people use which distribution, but I was able to find an indicator of the popularity of each distribution (at least the top 100), which I think may be fairly good indicator of the relative popularities of the Linux distributions.  Look at the right side of the page on https://distrowatch.com/ (scroll down a little to \"Page Hit Rankings\").  I haven't computed any statistics, but just looking at the rankings, I see that if I normalize the popularity of the  Linux distributions with the most popular, \"My Linux\", having the value \"1.0\", a few of the others look like this:\n\nRank:1, MyLinux, value: 1.0\nRank: 2, Mandrake, value: 0.60\nRank: 3, Mint, value: 0.44\nRank: 4, Ubuntum, value: 0.31\nRank: 5, Debian, value: 0.30\nRank: 6, Elementary, value: 0.30\nRank: 7, Solus, value: 0.24\nRank 8, Fedora, value: 0.22\nRank 9, Zorin, value: 0.18 \nRank: 10, openSUSE, value: 0.18\nRank: 15, CentOS, value: 0.13\nRank: 20, POP! OS, value: 0.10\nRank: 30, Alpine, value 0.07\nRank: 50, Kodachi, value 0.047\nRank: 75, Clonezilla, value: 0.032\nRank: 100, LibraELEC, value: 0.0255\n\nYou can also see from https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg that the creation of new Linux Distributions does not appear to be slowing down.\n\nYou could argue that the factors that determine the usage of Linux distributions are different than those that determine cryptocurrency usage, even though both probably have much in common.  But, one thing the popularity of Linux distributions suggests to me is 1) that people are capable of making more than just five or six popular, and 2) which distributions are popular is changing all the time.  If the same is true of cryptocurrencies, this would mean that even if you pick a winner initially to invest in, 5, 10, 20 years from now it could easily be an out-of-favor looser.  This means that if cryptocurrencies follow the same trend as Linux, they are still not a good long-term investment. (I think following a Linux distribution trend is an optimistic scenario, because I still think they are more likely to go to near zero value.)\n\nI should also point out that that there have been over 700 Linux distributions created in about 25 years, and Linux has very little economic incentive backing it.  There have been over 2000 cryptocurrencies created in about 10 years, thanks, I believe, to the economic incentive.  So, the number of cryptocurrencies are growing faster.  I don't know if they are coming into and falling out of favor faster than Linux distributions, but that could change.\n\nI guess we will just have to wait and see what happens.  It should be interesting in the short term to see what happens with Facebook's new cryptocurrency, especially to see how much of bitcoin's market share it manages to take away.",

People in Eastern Europe have lived with communism long enough to know that it does not work.

I read the whole thing and bookmarked it.  Seems like they were correctly pointing out many of the problems with capitalism.  Certainly capitalism doesn't do away with corruption.  But I still think history shows that communism doesn't work.  If it did, the Soviet Union would still exist.  As far as I can tell, it didn't die for political reasons.  It died because people weren't getting fed and their apartments were getting heated in the Winter--or is that just western propaganda?  My understanding is that the Soviet Union was done away with by it's own leaders and people.\n\nIf there are any, I would love to hear people on ZeroNet who lived as adults in the Soviet Union tell us what they think.",

Carl Sagan defined God as the laws of nature.  I suspect that was not just a euphemism for atheism.

I think the bottom line on most of what you said is that there is a tremendous amount of research that would have to be done to answer some of those questions.  And some may be inherently unanswerable.  I could give speculative answers, but without any real knowledge backing them.  If we are living in a simulation, we may be able to speculate about the purpose for it, but we can probably never know for sure unless the simulations \"gods\" reveal it to use.  Or, maybe they already have, and we didn't recognize the revelation.  Or, maybe the revelation would spoil the experiment being conducted via the simulation.\n\nI think there are some telling facts, like the reality of the quantization of space (Heizenberg's uncertainty principle), the quantization of time, the fact that many scientist now model physical processes in terms of information (like the evaporation of a black hole, for instance).   Until recently we thought we were living in an analog world.  Now we know it's actually a digital world.  Why should that be so?  I don't know the answer to that question, but in order for this to be a simulation, it would have to be so.  Proof of this being a simulation might have to come by digging down to the point where we understand at the sub, sub atomic level what matter and space really are and see something that would be impossible outside of a simulation.  \n\nOne of the reasons I like ZeroNet so much is that I \"meet\" people here who ask questions like these.",

I guess my point is to disagree with the opinion that I heard expressed that just the fact that a piece of code is open source almost by definition means that it has been gone over with a fine-tooth comb by many knowledgeable people.   What I'm saying is that even when knowledgeable people are PAID to go over a piece of code, that doesn't mean that they do a good job.  So, I imagine that when people are not being paid they are even less interested in reviewing other peoples' code.",

Whether you read a voice from a part of the world, written a few hundred years ago or today all speak about the same thing. After all, wisdom remains timeless.The only problem is not that there are wise people, but that they are not listened. [...]\n\nI think you are completely correct.  I have noticed that many of Christ's teachings are very similar to some Buddhist teachings, although they are not understood in that way by Christians.  For example, \"the kingdom of God is within you\" and \"my kingdom is not of this world\".  A Buddhist (or just a more enlighted) interpretation would be that he is talking about a system of government that is internal to each person, meaning that it is a personal thing, not a group thing.  But Christians have completely ignored this and still think he is talking about something that will happen during the millennium or in heaven.\n\nI agree with the sentiment I've heard some people express (including Christ, I think) that the reason wise people are not listened to is that the people who should be listening are just not at a place psychologically where they are capable of understanding what is being said.  So, no amount of listening would bring understanding.  That may be why Christ talked a lot about being like him and being like God.",

A person must find the steps, first.  And, the steps have to be in the right order.  Most people just aren't looking for the steps, because they haven't matured to the point yet where they realize that there are steps.  I think they understand that as it applies to child development, but they either don't see that it also applies to adult intellectual/spiritual/psychological development, or they just don't care.  With them the growth process happens unconsciously as events happen in their lives.  This is a slower process than combining the naturally occurring unconscious process with consciously looking for the steps.  It seems that almost all people die before they realize how to live.

I don't want to argue either, but having talked to enough fundamentalist (not to mention having been a sort of fundamentalist myself), I've seen that pointing out lies doesn't work.  What does in the end create the best outcome is to try to maintain positive relationships and have patience.  Eventually, and with enough of the right life experiences, even fundamentalists will eventually see through the misconceptions and the lies--if they live long enough.

You are certainly raising the level of discourse here on ZeroNet.  \n\nYour answer pretty much goes along with my assumption that the only way to access ZeroNet from China is to find unblocked TOR nodes (meaning new ones), get a satellite Internet connection, use a private network or mesh network, or mail a USB stick with the latest ZeroNet data (very high latency).  I love the idea of mesh networks--especially with hard-to-detect optical links.  I just wish more people were interested in creating and joining them.  \n\nAs far as the actions displayed by the Hong-Kong bankers are concerned, my assumption is that they are not upgrading their infrastructure because they are sending their money off shore where it will be safe from the Chinese government.

Don't know why.\n\nAfter spending a couple of hours browsing through the Aether subforums, I understand what you mean.  There aren't all that many posts in the vast majority of subforums.  Part of that may be due to the fact that posts are removed after six months.  But I think part is just due to the fact that Aether has too many subforums.  The result is that  you get the feeling of visiting a collection of mostly uninhabited islands, instead of a well-populated mainland.  Aether needs either fewer subforums or one \"general\" subforum where users go to post on any topic they want.  I think we've seen a similar phenomenon with ZeroVoat.  ZeroNet just does not have enough traffic to sustain active and ongoing conversations on a large number of separate topics.  ZeroTalk is a much more appropriate forum for  ZeroNet's current size.  Speaking of that, where have all the ZeroTalk users gone over the last month or two?\n\nHaving said that, however, I have to say that Aether looks like a geek's paradise.  Some of the most active subforums are Meta (a discussion about Aether itself), FOSS, Distributed Networks, and Linux.  In that way, Aether reminds me of ZeroNet when I joined it a year ago.  Most of the discussion on ZeroNet then was on technical topics, much of it just a bit over my head, but it was fun to read.",

So, I would find in favor of the muslim woman.\n2.  No.  I don't think gender balance matters.  What matters is empathy and a willingness to understand other's points of view.\n3. I would let the people of Berkley make the decision at the ballot box.\n4. Assuming you are talking about percentages of of Asians, and not total numbers, I would guess that two factors are at play.  The first is that Asians seem to be better socialized than whites in the US.  They also value education.  The second is that studies performed back in the days when it was politically acceptable to study the intelligence of races found that Asians and Jews were one sigma (about 15 I.Q. points) smarter than whites.  More intelligent, better educated people tend not to get caught by the system as much as less intelligent ones.  So, any supposed racism in the system is a red herring, since Asians don't have nearly as much contact with it in the first place.\n5. This one makes me tired.  I'll just repeat the proverb that those who live by the sword die by the sword.  I have nothing intelligent to say here.\n6. Men's and women's events have historically been separated because nearly everyone realizes that men and women have significantly different physical abilities.  We also separate most events into age groups for the same reason.  So, we separate people into groups to make the events more interesting for the spectators.  Why would we change that for surgically modified, steroid enhanced, or any other group of people?\n7. Employers hire people, largely because they hope to make money off of their work.  When employers don't plan to work closely with the people they hire, they will simply hire the people they feel are most profitable to hire.  In one job, athletic ability is more important.  For another, intelligence is more important.  For another, docility is more important.  For another, beauty is more important.  Etc.  When employers hire people that they will be working with closely, they tend to hire people who will not only make them money but also who they think they can get along with better.  Often employers don't know just by interviewing people who will make them the most money or who they will get along with better.  So, a lot of trial and error occurs.\n8. See the answer to number 4.\n9. See the answers to number 4 and number 5.\n10. See the answer to number 7.  The question should not be which system is more fair.  The question should be which system results in the most enjoyment for the audience that is paying to see the performances.",

However, I would rather that someone solve the problem the way nofish originally intended, by creating a clone of ZeroTalk with multiple people holding keys and just allow other people to find it over time.  I'm sure this has already been discussed on multiple occasions, so there may be some good reason no one wants to do this.  However, it seems to me that if at least 10-20 people who are now posting frequently on ZeroTalk would start using an alternative zite and encouraging others to \"follow\" it, so their posts also appear automatically in followers' ZeroHello feeds, then this would eventually move most people over to the new zite, especially those newcomers who hit their quotas.  We just need to keep explaining the problem to ZeroTalk users in a way they can understand.  If such an alternative zite or zites already exist, then we need to do a better job of publicizing it(them).  What do you think?\n\nI haven't noticed a ZeroNet update in at least several months.

I cannot over-emphasize the importance of the word \"illegally\".  This was not something that is in any way, shape , or form acceptable.  There were rumors of Project Prism all the way back to 2002, but no one had the guts to provide the proof needed to shine the light of day on it.  US citizens needed to know that their government was unconstitutionally surveilling them and hiding the practice from them.  In my opinion, providing this knowledge was far more important than any harm that may have been done to the NSA's efforts to surveil people in other countries.  And by the way, the NSA could have completely avoided Snowden's actions simply by following the rules laid out by the constitution, as they were supposed to do, as their political leaders vowed to do when they took their oath's of office.\n\nThe real problem with some people is that they absolutely refuse to have their own consciences.

We now have a LOT of information about methods the NSA uses to compromise commercial encryption software.

And it only works when the attacker has physical access to a running computer or a computer that has been shut down just seconds before and still holds data in RAM.\n\nBut, we don't know how many NEW vulnerabilities have been introduced into Veracrypt that were not in Truecrypt.  One thing we do know about Trucrypt, however, is that at least as of 2013, the NSA had not been able to crack it.  We know that, because Edward Snowden provided the proof.

THEN, and only then, run ZeroNet with this command:\n\npython3.6 /your_path/ZeroNet-py3/zeronet.py --tor_proxy 127.0.0.1:9150 --tor_controller 127.0.0.1:9151\n\nBe sure to substitute your path to zeronet.py above and whatever version of python 3 you are using. Also, I use the list of trackers from here: http://127.0.0.1:43110/15CEFKBRHFfAP9rmL6hhLmHoXrrgmw4B5o/\n\nIf using the python 2 version of ZeroNet:\n\npython /your_path/ZeroBundle/zeronet.py --tor_proxy 127.0.0.1:9150 --tor_controller 127.0.0.1:9151\n\nPart of your problem may also be that different versions of the Tor browser work differently.  I am using Tor browser 10.0.17, and this is what works for me:\n\n    Start Tor Browser.\n    Browse to about:config.\n    Enter network.proxy.no_proxies_on into the \"Search:\" box.\n    Double-click the network.proxy.no_proxies_on line that appears.\n    Enter 127.0.0.1 as the value of this preference.\n    Click \"OK\".\n\nYou only have to do this once, not every time you start TOR.  I believe this has been the way this works since about version 8.0 of the Tor browser.\n\nI hope that helps.",

You can also start with this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship#Technical_censorship).  The technical methods are:  DNS poisoning, blocking access to IPs, analyzing and filtering URLs, inspecting filter packets, and resetting connections.  China began blocking zeronet.io, perhaps four years ago.  China and Russia do block Tor exit nodes and torrent trackers.  Some in China have had to resort to Tor bridge nodes to circumvent this.  And, I assume they are using other methods that they won't discuss here for obvious reasons.  So, it can be done, and it is being done.  The only question is, how well is it being done?

The users' willingness to download data to their hard drives is really the limitation that prevents peer-to-peer networks from ever becoming Internet 3.0.  I don't think enough people have enough experience actually using peer-to-peer networks to understand that.\n\nHowever, having acknowledged that limitation, I still think peer-to-peer networks are wonderful for text-only communication like we do on ZeroTalk, because you only have to transmit and store relatively small amounts of data..",

That's not the issue.  The issue is that people are willing to accept even a \"low\" 5% risk of a long, expensive, extremely uncomfortable ICU stay and perhaps a 2% chance of death in exchange for what?  A political statement?  Is the \"freedom\" you are talking about the freedom to choose to die for no reason?  Donald Trump said you have nothing to fear from Covid-19, so even knowing the statistics, you are willing to follow him?  Trump received the blood products treatment--which is NOT without potentially serious side effects.  So, obviously, even he didn't believe what he was telling the public. \n\nIf you are worried about serious side effects from an unproven vaccine, that is a legitimate concern.  But in order for as many people to die from the vaccine as are dying  from Covd-19, 20,000 people would have to die per million vaccinated.

Old idiom, consider the source (connect the dots of the people disseminating the information). Discovering motives & agenda are key. [...]\n\nNice list.  However, I think this list still allows room for confirmation bias and manipulation by false sources of information.  But, there may be no better methods.\n\nI have believed false narratives for decades when I thought I was following all these rules.  Part of the problem is that there can be such a mountain of conflicting evidence that you just don't have a way of separating true evidence from fabrication and dismissing the mountain of false evidence.  Religion is a good example.  When something is really important to you, it seems nearly impossible to objectively separate real evidence from false evidence.  Plus, all evidence you see is automatically filtered through your pre-existing beliefs and world view.\n\nAnother example is the anti-vax argument.  I can see that if a person already believes that the governments of the world are in collusion to subjugate their citizens (which many people in them are) and limit the world population, he would be unable to resist believing that Covid-19 is either a hoax invented to further the control agenda or a tool for population control.  Anyone who says differently must either be in on the plot or a \"useful idiot\", no matter how knowledgeable and intelligent.  We have plenty of examples throughout recorded history of knowledgeable, intelligent people being wrong.  If, on the other hand, he believes that governments are trying to save lives, despite the evidence that governments are stifling contrary information from being presented, he will believe that Covid-19 is a genuine pandemic.\n\nLook at the UFO phenomenon.  You have knowledgeable, intelligent, reliable ex-military officers, scientists, and engineers coming forward through the Disclosure Project and stating that UFO's and aliens are real and visiting our planet.  You also have thousands of other eyewitnesses testifying that UFO's are real.    My own parents saw a cigar-shaped UFO back in the 1960's.  You also have those saying the military promotes the false belief in UFO's to camouflage the existence of classified projects.  You have people saying the military is setting us up to believe that aliens are invaders to increase their budget.  You also know that disinformation is a standard tool of the military.  You also know about the speed of light limitation.  And, you know that many people have been caught making prank UFO's and taking prank pictures.  You have a mountain of evidence, both for and against UFO's.  You also have a limited amount of in-depth information available.  You cannot really follow the money or know the true motivation of witnesses. You also have many plausible theories about why aliens are here. So, you can justify their existence using logic.  It is very difficult to separate the true facts from the false facts--even using the methods you have listed.\n\nAt times, getting at the truth seems impossible, especially for those who already have strongly-held beliefs.  It is not obvious.",

However, these are just thoughts.  I'm not saying they are right, or that I know what I'm talking about.  I posted this, because on a platform that is designed for free speech we don't talk very much about it.  And I feel that some of us are missing the whole point of ZeroNet when we talk about adding moderation to make ZeroNet look like the rest of the Internet.  I'm just hoping to start us talking more about these issue more often.\n\nI'm not really concerned about anti-vax issues.  I'm just trying to show that free speech is more nuanced and complicated than we understand.  I don't claim to be especially knowledgeable about it or that my views are better than other peoples, because I don't think they are.  Where free speech is concerned I think I'm in the dark as much as most people.
