(This could be something that happened to you personally, or just whatever.)\n\nWhile I don't believe in most crazy conspiracy theories, although a few seem plausible, I find them very insteresting to learn about. What are your favorites? Do you have any suggestions for ones I should research?  \nI'm planning on making a large compilation of all the popular ones.",
