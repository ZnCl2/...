In japan you can fall asleep on the street and people will leave you alone and the street will be CLEAN. And this happens all the time because Asians in general have a drinking problem. \nThis retard is one of those irl gay pedos whos cope is to call for drawings to be regulated. \nKoreans on the other hand ...",

The republitards already proved in 2018 that they won't stand up to obvious vote fraud, so in 2020 get ready for the counting in swing states to last three days while they keep \"finding\" more ballot boxes that go 99% dem.\n\nTrump lost already bro he banned bumpstocks over a shooting we still know nothing about, now he is laying the groundwork for his entire supporter base to be labeled as mentally unstable and have their guns taken away with NO due process and worse. the only people still shilling for him are out of touch boomers who will GLADLY hand over their freedom",
