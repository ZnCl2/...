For example, when the hit Left For Dead 2 was hiting the shelves, i volunteered to make a legal case against pirates. I was wanting to buy a legal copy and they sold me pirated one lying it was genuine. I was willing to come back with distributors and police and make a case. The distributors were not interested, not a tiniest bit.\n\nThose who are interested - they may start crawling VK and taking down movies, etc. Russian hit movies usualyl do. Because they care. Wester movies just do not give a thing.",

Afterall uploading files is not installing programs.\n\ni said \"starting point\" - for ideas, for example of implementing functions like cross-user de-duplication, etc.\n \nThose functions, their generic design, you can learn from them and then use the sam methods in your program. Of course you would have to code them yourself.",
