If a user on the clear net decided to go venture to a farm porn site and their computers get eaten alive by malware and browser hijacks, often spectators would blame the visitor for not taking proper precautionary measures of browsing a network blindly.\n\nMost Zeronet sites are moderated quite well and any questionable content is removed if not avoided entirely from being uploaded. I've been an avid user of zeronet for a while now and I have yet to run across any CP. (But then again I don't go looking for it and avoid sites that may contain it like 0chan (due to rumors)).\n\nThere are plans of implementing a global multi-purpose blocklist with different categories that users will be able to subscribe to. But that seems to be reserved for a future development.",
