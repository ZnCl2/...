			"title": "Separate mobile apps for popular zites",
			"body": "So, I've made a post on ZeroMe 2 days ago, in which I was talking about a way to make ZeroNet much more accessible to new users, here it is:\n\n\"I think that making some standalone mobile applications for popular Zites (ZeroMe, for example) where you just open the app and are immediately presented with the content - might really improve the ease of use for new users.\n\nThese apps might use some shared ZeroNet directory for identity and storage, but each one of them serves as just one Zite to be as beginner-friendly as possible.\n\nFor example, you want your grandma to join ZeroMe. Right now, they need to download the zeroNet app (which there are at least two on the Google Play), then open the ZeroMe link, find out that they need to register in ZeroID, do it, and only then they can use the social network.\nI think it's much easier to just download an app called \"ZeroMe\", which just greets you with the ZeroID register screen, where you input your username (or this step is skipped if you are already registered in another app), and then you immediately get into the network.\"\n\nFrom the discussion in the comments I've also understood that I need to clarify how this can work:\n\n\"I think that we can just let the apps figure out if they're first (maybe ping ZeroHello or something) and if they are - run the ZeroNet instance embedded eded in them. Yes, that's a little wasteful if you include ZeroNet in every app but use just one, however, I think it's fine for today's smartphones and won't take too much extra space\"\n\nThe point of this topic is to *maybe* think more about this and *maybe* find someone who can make this a reality, so if you have any thoughts or relevant skills and want to help ZeroNet become bigger - I'll be glad if you join me.\n\nAlso, I made a post about this on my blog where I explain how this is more friendly, you can check it out here: http://127.0.0.1:43110/1AV33QMZbXpkS9yU65qFwuykiLNo3rJs7M/?Post:8:Just+posted+my+idea+about+separate+apps+on+ZeroTalk\n\nAnd here's a link to the original post if you want to check out the discussion in the comments: http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1MoonP8t4rk9QamBUPh5Aspkwa1Xhf5ux2/1ufDwJisEDriKQxYJSz2HuUhgqAG15JyL/1594568893",

Instead, it will be linked to flat user terminals the size of a pizza box, which will have phased array antennas and track the satellites. The terminals can be mounted anywhere, as long as they can see the sky. Photographs of the customer antennas began to be seen on the internet in June 2020, supporting earlier statements by SpaceX CEO Musk that the terminals would look like a \"UFO on a stick. Starlink Terminal has motors to self-adjust optimal angle to view sky\".>",
