			"body": "Some general questions on this:\n\n1. What data can be seen by the internet service provider (ISP) when using ZeroNet ?\n2. When using a VPN connection is there any leak issue (WebRTC) with ZeroNet?\n3. All ZeroNet sites data are stored unencrypted on the local disk. Is this just because of the P2P technology or due to performance ?\n4. Supporting the net itself, is there any kind of full-node setup (like i2p) ? ... or just setup a raspberry with a SSD and keep it running 24/7 ?\n5. Is there any trust method / trust ranking for ZeroNet sites / ZeroIDs to highlight \"good\" sites / IDs and guide newbies ?\n6. When downloading sites, how can we protect ourselves from auto-downloading and contributing malicious content ? Any protection from ZeroNet or is it up to the users ?",

[...]\n\nThis sounds very interesting but I'm not sure if I get everything. A sketch would be perfect :) ... or do you have a source of this setup?\n\nMy understanding:\n0. Install (Linux) OS with LUKS or Veracrypt disk encryption, strong password\n1. Setup trusted VPN on your host machine (VPN HM)\n2. Install Virtual Box (VB)\n3. Install Whonix gateway (GW)  - standard setup\n4. Install Whonix workstation (WS) with a second VPN (VPN WS)\n5. Install ZeroNet on WS\n\nSo, traffic would be:\nZeroNet > VPN HM > GW Tor >  VPN WS ?\n\n... I didn't get the second VPN.",

				"body": "Well, there is no perfect solution: VPN > Tor  or Tor > VPN. It depends on your threat model - your objective.\nSee https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_a_VPN_before_Tor or https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_VPN a discussion on where to put you VPN https://forums.whonix.org/t/is-whonix-more-secure-with-a-vpn/3400 at least their conclusion is VPN > Tor makes more sense.\n\nFor me the question is more do you trust your ISP or your VPN or ... your Tor exit node. Furthermore, there are country where ISP are forced to save the users traffic for a certain time by law. So having a VPN outside 7 or 14-eyes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes#Other_international_cooperatives) makes sense to me but aren't the exit nodes the weak point in this chain? ... Anyway, this discussion will never end there are too many opinions. Maybe it is worth to start a new ZeroTalk topic on this.\n\nFor me still the question, the 2nd VPN in the WS. I just saw setups with VPN installed in GW.\n\nI will continue investigating and testing...",
