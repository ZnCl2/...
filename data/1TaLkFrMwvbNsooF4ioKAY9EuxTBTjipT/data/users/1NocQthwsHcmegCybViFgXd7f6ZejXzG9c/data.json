				"body": "The Light and Darkness 'meme' is incredibly prevalent in our world, it is incredibly important to Judaism and Freemasonry.\n\nOften with \"Light\" is meant \"Darkness\" and \"Darkness\" is meant \"Light\", with \"Evil\" is meant \"Good\" and with \"Good\" \"Evil\". It's a perversion of reality.\n\nHere's what goes into the Cake of Light of Thelema:\n\n>    For perfume mix meal & honey & thick leavings of red wine: then oil of Abramelin and olive oil, and afterward soften & smooth down with rich fresh blood.\n\n>    The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the **fresh blood of a child**, or dropping from the host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers: last of some beast, no matter what.\n\n>    This burn: of this make cakes & eat unto me. This hath also another use; let it be laid before me, and kept thick with perfumes of your orison: it shall become full of beetles as it were and creeping things sacred unto me.\n\n>Some commentators have interpreted this to mean that the \"blood\" component mentioned in the second portion of this quote may be formed from **menstrual blood or semen.**[2] \n\nSounds good right?",
