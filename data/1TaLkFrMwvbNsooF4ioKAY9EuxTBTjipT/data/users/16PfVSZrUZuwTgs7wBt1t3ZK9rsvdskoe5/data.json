It would be worth looking into this.\n\nI think this is way better than Namecoin's .bit, in a way, it is easy to use and free, whereas I've looked at namecoin for the past few weeks and there's almost no exchanges, it seems to have lost the popularity it once had. Stuff that used to integrate with it rarely even work.",

According to [this page](https://wiki.namecoin.org/index.php?title=Register_and_Configure_.bit_Domains), you can find out what the domain points to in both clearnet and zeronet inside the content of said names. Inside the blockchain, domains are marked as d/domain instead of domain.bit. The content appears to be a JSON object containing just about whatever you want to put in, however, they 'standardized' certain things, such as the following:\nFor clearnet:\n`{\"ns\": [\"ns0.web-sweet-web.net\", \"ns1.web-sweet-web.net\", \"ns0.xname.org\"]}` - An object with the \"ns\" array delegates anything that isn't before that array in the object to the listed name servers, it also supports IP addresses but it isn't a recommended use of the DNS delegation\n`{\"ip\":\"1.2.3.4\", \"map\": {\"demo\": {\"ip\":\"1.2.3.5\"}, \"*\": {\"ip\":\"1.2.3.4\"}}}` - An object with \"ip\" point domain.bit towards the ip in question, subdomains are in the map object, so in this example, domain.bit points to 1.2.3.4, demo.domain.bit points to 1.2.3.5, and every other subdomains point to 1.2.3.4.\n`{\"translate\": \"bitcoin.org\", \"ns\": [\"1.2.3.4\", \"1.2.3.5\"]}` - An object with \"translate\" will translate the change the domain to the value before doing the delegation, in this example, if you looked up foo.domain.bit, it would change it to foo.bitcoin.org before looking it up in the delegated name servers.\nFor zeronet:\n```\n{\n  \"zeronet\": {\n  \"\": \"1EU1tbG9oC1A8jz2ouVwGZyQ5asrNsE4Vr\",\n  \"subdomain\": \"1BLogC9LN4oPDcruNz3qo1ysa133E9AGg8\",\n  \"subdomain2\": \"1TaLk3zM7ZRskJvrh3ZNCDVGXvkJusPKQ\" }\n} \n```\nYou would put a zeronet object inside the domain's object and inside give each key-value pair where the key is the subdomain and the value is the bitcoin public address of the website.\n\nThe issue as I see it for your extension is that it is possible for someone to have both a zeronet and a clearnet .bit site and your extension would forcefully pull you into the zeronet one even if you intended to see the clearnet one. I assume you could either host or find a server online that offers .bit DNS lookup through an API that you could use in your extension to figure out if the .bit address has a zeronet object within it, but that still keeps the problem of there being also a clearnet site with the same .bit address.",

[...]\n\nI'm not saying we should immediately drop support for it, I'm simply saying that as ZeroNet grows, it will inevitably grow bloated, as more and more features are added, so we should consider whether keeping Namecoin, a DNS system that is largely dead is worth it, especially since I'm assuming ZeroName requires that someone, likely nofish, runs a full NMC node, which tends to eat system resources and HDD space quite a lot as opposed to other DNS systems. I agree that adding more DNS systems is worth it, but we should still consider if the effort of adding each, or the cost of keeping each is worth \"one more additional DNS system\".\n\n> [filips](#comment_217_1LFu1BTScmY82HHtg3TY2jAuSrCYNsQWEY): Name.yo is currently not a solution. When decentralization is added, other problems are fixed and it is added as built-in plugin, then it will be a good solution.\n\nThat's where I disagree. It isn't a perfect solution but it is a solution, likely a temporary one until something better is made or until it is improved with at the very least decentralization.\n\n> [filips](#comment_217_1LFu1BTScmY82HHtg3TY2jAuSrCYNsQWEY): I mean such abuse that one user would hijack all domains. This is something that good DNS system, even if decentralized, should have (Namecoin and ENS have this solved, but it is solved with paid domains).\n\nThis is difficult to do with a free permanent DNS system. Paid domains solve this easily because unless you have infinite money to waste on it, it's not worth doing this type of abuse, but with a free domain, any system you make to prevent this will likely be seen as attempting to prevent people from obtaining domain names, or setting up the basics for that, at least.\n\n> [filips](#comment_217_1LFu1BTScmY82HHtg3TY2jAuSrCYNsQWEY): IPFS is using DNSLink which is new standard for linking content from DNS.

The problem is that it currently runs a full Zeronet node on your mobile device, which is a rather horrible idea: mobile devices rarely have more than a few GB of storage available, and if they do have more, it's still not something close to what a dedicated PC can have, which means it's bound to run out, and you're also likely to be using the mobile device for something else than Zeronet, meaning you'll use the storage space for other apps as well. This all leads into the fact it hasn't reached the point where it could be called usable cause to do that it would need to be a minimal client that actually signs content locally using the keys and then shoot that off to a random full node for them to propagate it, which full nodes aren't currently designed to do, and ask full nodes to give them the website content when asked for it every time, and then delete it when the website is left or as part of the process to shutdown zeronet. Currently, the best method to use Zeronet from mobile is to use UiPassword on your PC and connect to Zeronet using that, which is to say, it's not a great method, since you need to know some about networking to properly set it up to be accessible for your phone from outside the local network if you intend to use it on the go.\n\n> [arruda](#comment_1_12pxfKmo6ZzL7RM8oYGGmEBCSUBZKzv7Bh): operating with a new form of address encoding that isn't human readable\n\nHopefully someday we'll get alternative forms of DNS all implemented into Zeronet by default so that problem will be easily fixed.",

Can you explain a bit more what's the difference?\n\nBasically, ZeroNet provides for websites hosted on everyone's (who uses ZeroNet) device. Manyverse provides for ScuttleButt on mobile. ScuttleButt provides a sort of micro-blogging social network where you only host the content of people you follow, and you start with exactly 0 people in your social network, and grow it progressively as you meet and add people to your list. In concept, an interesting idea, in reality, a pretty shitty one, cause, well, if you want to suppress speech, just ban someone from all public nodes (of which there are few) and ask people in those nodes to ban the person from their private node as well, and then the person disappears. This leads to a sort of system where instead of a large global hard/impossible to censor network like ZeroNet is you get essentially a bunch of closed off social networks that only accept people they agree with, an echo chamber essentially. If other people who don't follow the same ideology as the main SB devs decided to make pubs, they wouldn't be allowed on their official pub list, thereby removing the main source of potential users for such a small thing that has such a low user base. If they still managed to get adoption going for that pub in their community, you'd end up with 2 separate networks using the same protocol, because they don't politically agree with each other, and therefore refuse to host each other's content and will block anyone who attempts to link the 2 together in any way. It doesn't offer anything of value, in other words, besides being a closed-off system that is sort of decentralized.\n\n> [sheendocks](#comment_65_1P4KkC3wa5xtGD8m2MoBTf5p69G3Xr4aCU): Manyverse is list a social network for mobile (it's a mobile implementation of scuttlebutt which works on desktop too). Essentially, you can connect to people via bluetooth, those on the same wifi, via DHT, or via \"pubs\" which pull data from lots of users who decide to join (not really sure on how pubs work). Because Manyverse works via bluetooth and the local network it's resist to internet connections been taken offline. Andre Staltz develops it and has made some FAQ videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RANVVy9oyXE\n\nPubs are basically a normal client that somehow offer a permanent invitation code for others to join their network. Public ones post it on a public place like a website, private ones require the owner to give out the code to people they trust. As for Manyverse resisting being offline, that's kinda incorrect, it only resist it if someone else is using it and is invited in your client within bluetooth range or within the same local network (in which case if the local network has lost it's internet connection, so does their, so it's not resisting much at all since anything you put there will only become public to everyone else when one of you finally gets an internet connection back).",

Yet seeing it's the same in America is disgusting.\n\n\"The grass is always greener on the other side\" isn't a saying that you should believe the other side is better but rather that both sides are complete shit and looking from one side to the other it always seems like the other is objectively 200% better even though it isn't.\n\nAs for mental health, that's something I can't really help with since I have similar issues. As everyone says, diet, sunlight, talking with people, exercising, sleeping well and all that crap is supposed to help, but at the same time, I get what you mean that when you look outside online communities of like-minded individuals, it's incredibly hard to feel happy as you see people act like complete idiots, and react in stupid ways to things that should be really fucking obvious. One thing I always get reminded of is that if the average IQ of humans is 100, then half of them (hopefully me included) are above 100, and the other half below. Also, the IQ of crowds is like -100, no matter what the average IQ of all the individuals in the crowd is. Crowds are dumb as fuck.\n\nAnyways, I get you, as I was here like idk a year ago or so, disappeared for a while and am back now. Thing is, I wish changing all the things mentioned above was all I need to get rid of my mental health issues, but the issue is all of them require motivation to first do these things to get better but as my own mental health issue includes the symptom of practically always being unmotivated to do anything, I haven't actually managed to do much about any of it.\n\nAs for Ownership Transferal in cases where mental health is an issue, that's a little bit more complicated, git is kinda great at making sure you can't delete stuff without being able to undo the deletion, but the thing is, it requires at least one person to keep an up to date git repository of everything you wish to keep safe, and that's a whole lot harder to do. Things that automatically Sync properly, like say, Syncthing, don't have a proper functional git-like system of keeping history of versions, which means simply deleting the content of the folder would propagate to anyone else who's Synced to it as long as they're online, and would require them to actually maintain some external means of backing up the Synced content even though the whole point of syncing directories between machines is usually for the purpose of having a backup if for some reason one device dies. This makes things a bit awkward. I tried at one point to use git on a syncthing directory and if that wasn't hell to deal with, idk what is.\n\nPoint is, there isn't really an easy way to do this. Like it's been said, the current way would be to shoot over the users.json file through either ZeroMail or GPG encrypted email or some similar thing. But that doesn't help with things like zites that aren't a git directory meaning one could go in there and revert changes later or plugins that are entirely out of ZeroNet where if you don't diligently pull daily you might miss a change and then suddenly have everything wiped on the next update or something.",

A good example would be the US's 1st amendment, it only forces governmental organizations to not censor speech, this means that essentially defacto public spaces (such as twitter and youtube, for which the alternatives are so rarely used that they're essentially a monopoly) which are managed by private companies that can and do take political sides and censor opposing speech. This is a failure with free speech as the US implements it, it did not foresee the possibility that someday \"public spaces\" where political debates would be held could be privately owned, allowing for censorship.",

The point being to control your shit and have no one be able to censor it, however, a public clear net proxy means the proxy providers can likely access everyone who uses it's users.json, and therefore modify any zite you have and sign it as if it was yours.\n\nIf it is YOUR clear net proxy that you own however, then you should theoretically be able to update it yourself. I believe (don't quote me on that) that 0.6.x and earlier versions are python2-only and version 0.7.x and higher are python3-only. It likely requires manual intervention from whoever owns the proxy.
