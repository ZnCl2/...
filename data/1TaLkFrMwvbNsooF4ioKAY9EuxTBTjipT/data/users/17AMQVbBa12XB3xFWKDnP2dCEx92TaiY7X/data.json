			"title": "Why I No Longer Vote",
			"body": "http://misc-stuff.terraaeon.com/articles/no-vote.html\n\nThis post was pulled from Hacker News, so I thought it would probably be appropriate to post it on ZeroNet.\n\nWhy I No Longer Vote\n5-6-20\n\nReading Vane Vander's article Vow has jolted me out of the writer's block that I have been experiencing for the past two months. Actually, it is more like a life-long writer's block that occasionally lifts long enough to allow me to write something that could perhaps enlighten someone. Enlightening people is such a difficult task, because so few bother to read or think for themselves. I should probably give up my attempts altogether and spend my time writing pure fiction. But again, I have writer's block. Perhaps, if I spent more time reading, my writer's block might lift long enough to develop some good ideas, but my latest life adventure--creating websites--has been interfering with my reading. I think that is probably a good thing--doing, rather than just reading about other people doing. For the moment, I find that I really enjoy creating websites, even though it keeps me from reading and writing about other things.\n\nVane's perceptive and articulate article is basically about not letting yourself fall into the trap of \"groupthink\" in order to feel like you have a place in the universe, i.e. with other people. Unfortunately for me, it has taken me decades longer in my life to realize the truthfulness of her words than it has taken her in her life come up with them. I now see that when we align ourselves with a cause, we often succumb to the temptation to hand off our thinking and decision making authority to a \"team captain\", who we follow blindly. Even when some of his thoughts and decisions are ridiculous, we often have great difficulty taking back our autonomy.\n\nSometime less than twenty years ago, I recognized that voting and paying attention to politics for any reason other than its entertainment value is a waste of my time. In theory, voting is an expression of youthful hope in the system that the founding fathers of republicanism envisioned, and it should be applauded. In reality, it is no more beneficial to society than drawing straws to see which lieing politician will receive the next opportunity to abuse his or her power over us. Perhaps it is unfair of me to characterize all politicians as liars, but there does seem to be something about the psyches of people who run for public office that validates the stereotype. Don't get me wrong, I am by no means an anarchist or monarchist. I just don't feel that my country has ever lived up to its ideals sufficiently to be anywhere close to counteracting the destructiveness of human nature. Maybe that is just me seeing the glass as half empty, instead of half full.\n\nWe are left with politicians who lie to us to get power. After we vote for them, they do whatever they want. And, it seems that no matter their party, they all want the same things with power. For example, Bill Clinton, a democrat, supposedly a man for the little people, backer of labor unions, head of \"the most ethical administration ever\", signed NAFTA into law. NAFTA has been throwing jobs out of the US for decades now--taking jobs from exactly those who Clinton claimed to be protecting. I doubt those jobs will return to the US any time soon, even with the glaring problems associated with having everything made in China that Covid-19 has recently exposed--yet again. I could give other examples, but why? If you don't see the truth in what I have said so far, no amount of evidence will sway you.\n\nOne of the things I have been learning as I age is pointed out by Vane in her article. I have been learning not to waste my time fruitlessly supporting groups that have goals for society. Whether they are religious or political. My guess is that individuals do not change because society changes. Society changes because individuals change. But, I am not a psychologist, so that is just a guess. There could be more of a feedback mechanism there than I can perceive. One thing I am fairly certain of is that, if there is a feedback mechanism, it is detrimental to society as often as it is beneficial.\n\nSomething else I now understand is that freedom comes not from society but from within the mind of the individual. Freedom is an individual thing, not a societal thing. We become free as we learn to think freely and live our lives in ways consistent with free thought. I suspect this is a concept that is ineffable. So, there is no point in talking about it further, although I won't promise not to do so in some future article, provided my writer's block allows it.\n\nUPDATE: This article was pulled from Hacker News less than half an hour after I submitted it, but not before it had received nearly a thousand page views. I've never had an article pulled from Hacker News before. Perhaps, we have even less free speech in the US than I thought. This is why everyone should have his own website.",

			"title": "(re-post) UN Proposal to Ban Fictional Works as \"Child Pornography\"",
			"body": "source: http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1oranGeS2xsKZ4jVsu9SVttzgkYXu4k9v/1FzZsDQdh8wk71bDLxURPzmAt2FXehoNAB/1550688635\n\n# **UN Proposal to Ban Fictional Works as \"Child Pornography\"**\n\nThe United Nations is asking for feedback on a [new set of proposals](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRC/Pages/DraftGuidelinesOPs.aspx) for the international community to rally against child prostitution, the sale of children, and child pornography.\n\n## Sounds great, right?\n\nBut a close look at their definition of child pornography reveals that this extends a little bit beyond that. [Drawings, cartoons, written stories, sculptures, and other forms of fictional works](https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2019/02/u-n-proposes-initiativ…ban-loli-shota-and-underage-drawings-and-cartoons/77229/amp/) are also tucked in under the guise of \"child pornography\".\n\nA progressive new CSA (child sexual abuse) prevention organization, Prostasia Foundation, recently did [an excellent writeup](https://prostasia.org/blog/experts-to-united-nations-hentai-ban-would-be-a-mistake/) on this UN proposal.\n\n## **This ban may be counterproductive at preventing CSA**\n\nThere is no evidence that banning fictitious works has this effect. [Some experts](http://www.sexologytoday.org/2017/02/canada-and-australia-now-have-both.html) do [believe](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/01/can-child-dolls-keep-pedophiles-from-offending/423324/) bans, such as what the UN guidelines as written seek to ban, could actually lead to a rise in CSA.\n\nWith zero evidence that banning these things helps children, and with experts fearing that bans like this could put children in jeopardy, it is absolutely premature to implement such a ban until the necessary research has been conducted.\n\nthere is no evidence that banning fictitious works has any impact on reducing CSA (child sexual abuse). [some](http://www.sexologytoday.org/2017/02/canada-and-australia-now-have-both.html) [experts](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/01/can-child-dolls-keep-pedophiles-from-offending/423324/) believe that bans on the types of things these UN guidelines seek to ban will actually lead to a rise in CSA.\n\n## **This ban is a gross violation of freedom of speech and expression**\n\nThis will have chilling effects.\n\nMost anime, which frequently features high school aged characters, will fall under fire for having \"underage\" characters depicted. Novels, comics, fanfiction, art, fanart, sculptures, and other creative works featuring characters that \"appear underage\" (aka under 18) will similarly be harmed by the implementation of these international guidelines.\n\nWebsites operating in countries that follow these UN guidelines may find themselves reluctant to support anime or artist communities, since their duty to police content will become even more strict. We have seen the chilling effects on speech that puritan policies such as this have (see: Reddit's [harsh subreddit bans](https://piunikaweb.com/2019/02/12/reddit-facing-massive-public-outcry-after-alleged-loli-crackdown/), Steam's [removal of adult games featuring high school aged girls](https://nichegamer.com/2018/12/06/all-ages-modified-vn-hello-good-bye-banned-on-steam/)).\n\n## **We need to tell the UN that fictional children are not children**\n\nAlthough the UN's intentions are surely noble, equating artwork to child pornography is a farce which undermines the very concept of harm that CP creation and dissemination has on children, and a slap in the face to survivors of childhood sexual abuse, whose very real depictions of abuse and trauma continue to circulate throughout the internet.\n\nAnyone who would like to join me in presenting opposition to parts of the UN's proposal can do so. They are accepting comments by email. **Comments must be submitted by 31 March 2019.**\n\n* You can [email the UN](crc@ohchr.org) directly, following their [guidelines on submissions](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRC/Pages/DraftGuidelinesOPs.aspx).\n* Prostasia has created a [form to submit a pre-written email](https://prostasia.org/campaign/art-not-csem/) signed in your name.\n\n**If you are an active member in anime or artist communities, please help spread the word about this issue. Together, we can convey to the UN and the international community why this new attack on free speech will not be tolerated.**\n\n[ZeroMedium post](/ZeroMedium.bit/?/1FzZsDQdh8wk71bDLxURPzmAt2FXehoNAB/un-proposal-to-ban-fictional-works-as-child-pornography)",

The notion that the nature of the relationship has any bearing on the predilection for pedophilia is completely false. Second, who the child is makes no difference to the pedophile, much like heterosexuals are attracted to the opposite sex in general and homosexuals are attracted to the same sex in general. Attraction alone is simply a motivation for an action. Whether that action is undertaken is up to the individual feeling the attraction. In the case of molestation of children, it is damaging to the child, rape is damaging to the victim. There is no such thing as a \"healthy\" relationship for pedophiles. It's always damaging to the children involved.",

To this day I remember the name of the girl in my 7th grade class who first started growing breasts.  At the time I definitely preferred how she looked to how the adult teachers looked.  THINGS CHANGE.  There's no logic to an evolutionary type-casting here.  Pedophilia is simply a disease, nothing else - one that might be treated or cured if people would try.\n\nWell, let's consider reasons being attracted to youth makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint. Establishing an emotional bond in the formative years makes breeding when biologically possible more likely. Even the male penis is shaped to literally scoop semen out of the vaginal canal and deposit gametes as close to the uterus as possible. When we were less evolved reproduction was a competitive sport...it still is to some degree. Every competitive advantage including being the first to breed a female of reproductive age is a boon to spreading your genes. Cultural taboos prohibit inbreeding but for no good reason really, and pre-culture the first pregnancy and the next were very unlikely to be fathered by the same male. You could go so far as to say the first pregnancy would be best fathered by the male most likely to preserve both lives....the girl's father. I am in no way validating the behavior in modern times, nor do I think there is anything productive stemming from the attraction or the act of molestation. It is a preference that has to be sequestered in modern times, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a sound biological explanation for the orientation.",

The thing to bear in mind is that incest brings recessive genes together, causing their abnormal phenotypes to be revealed right away.  It's not \"bad\" in some \"eugenics is good\" sense, but in the sense that every other gene in your genome wants to get clear of the sinking ship before it pulls them down!  So no, incest is going to repel people, because the genes that feel repelled get shuffled into other descendants before the recessives meet and go boom.\n\nI disagree, royalty has been inbreeding intentionally for centuries now. The entire country of Norway is an ivory tower of inbred people who are largely much better off as a result. Not only that but they sailed all over raping everyone they could find. There is much more to genetics than 1+1=2. Epigenetics is uncovering switches that are environmental, much based on the diversity of your gut microbiome.

There are so many studies suggesting that exercising the sex organs is good for your health, going back to Kinsey, Masters and Johnson etc. Men live shorter lives on average then women, in every country of the world. You are suggesting that increasing daily testosterone levels contributes to health and longevity? It might increase vitality if you define vitality as being an oversexed musclebound meathead with anger management issues. Being addicted to porn might be a problem for some people, but masturbation is not the cause of that addiction. Probably it has to do with a misalignment of a person's sexual triggers and the reality they are living in. Women are consistently driven by emotional ties to people and porn doesn't often excel and portraying emotional ties between actors, thus dramatically fewer women suffer addictions to porn.",

Women are not livestock, and the rearing and support of offspring is the responsibility of each parent individually whether the association between the parents lasts or not. Second, marriage shouldn't be the only context in which intercourse is legal, largely girls are ready to have sex long before boys of the same age are, and their choices are their own. Older people have survived longer, either out of dumb luck or excellent choices and usually have extensive resources available to support families. Am I advocating every 12-14 year old girl go find a 30 year old partner? Absolutely not, but as a society we should be able to recognize that not every young woman wants or needs a legal association with a man in the form of marriage, or a law telling us what we can or cannot do with our sexuality. Once again, where a spectrum of acceptability should exist, the law has applied a binary system and unsurprisingly it doesn't work. Few things about human culture fit into binary systems, not even our gender, an obvious candidate for an applied dichotomy fit, much less attributes more nebulous like maturity and personality.",

Puberty being defined as a period where developmental changes in physiology are in progress and pregnancy is possible, but not structurally feasible. As a note, incontinence follows pregnancy in 21% of vaginal births and 10% of pregnancies ending with a cesarean section indicating that birth is not the only causal vector, and that physiological strain is part of pregnancy for mature women, and therefore is not surprisingly a disaster for bodies involved in puberty at the same time. Pubescent children don't have much interest in sex. Post-puberty, young women are restrained by familial and social constructs which are, in my opinion outdated. Society should pay for the rearing of every child, regardless of parentage. Education should start early, over 50% of the children born in the US are unplanned...but I digress.

Ants are incredibly diverse and versatile, literally products of evolutionary forces acting in a short time frame, but if you really want to be impressed take a look at the world of bacteria. Exponential growth rates, and natural selection happening before your eyes.

But no, zeronet, as Wikipedia says, is a web-like, and requires completely different design choices from the normal web. Even as soon as a site far exceeds the default quota of 10 mb, it is very likely that the site was poorly designed. It is not uncommon to see mp4 stuck directly into the browser's <video> player which obviously gives problems, or pages that act as galleries full of images that all consume the quota of 10 mb by default. A website that takes full advantage of zeronet potential, which was designed FOR zeronet, can easily host millions of users.\n\nI agree, developing zite on zeronet require a shift in mindset.

Molest either of my children and I'll cut your heart out with a spoon. If pedophiles want to jack off to pictures of girls in their underwear or even naked playing on the beach so be it. It is important to note though that children cannot legally give consent, and for the most reasonable set of consent laws on the planet, look to Japan; should it be illegal for two consenting 15 year olds to have sex? However I digress. Pictures of children engaged in sexual acts, something I think we can all agree is not acceptable, are being used as a method of censorship by spammers. What would be great is if some group of people would find an algorithm that would consistently identify such images and blacklist them as a site owner option. Likely this would require people screening every photo manually....a process that is currently illegal in most of the first world, so the problem persists.

Others might ask why employers pay so little to their employees when corporate profit margins are higher than at any time in history. If the stated rate of inflation is at 2% as they claim, then it follows that any increase in wages from my employer should be the rate of inflation plus some benefit for me, however like most working people my wage increases are never even pacing inflation let alone beating it. If the estimated real inflation rates of 8% to 12% are to be believed it is no wonder both parents in the average family are working overtime at their jobs just to try to keep up with the overhead associated with running a household. The question that keeps coming up as I walk along thinking about this is, when is it going to get better? We talk about universal basic income, but fund social programs not with effective corporate taxation, but with money that comes out of the working people's pocket...the only people who end up paying any meaningful taxes on income because they can't afford accountants to find the loopholes that allow the wealthy to escape paying them. Corporations maintain headquarters in tax haven countries and manufacture in counties where working wages are literally pennies on the dollar, paying nothing back to the infrastructure in the country that built the business in the first place.

You can justify anything with the right scriptures excluded....Start your own business, sure. I personally have owned several. I'm not motivated by money, I have more than I need but this isn't about me. It's about people who don't because they can't conceptualize the fiscal contraption they are in. Those who are in business should pay a living wage. If they can't pay a living wage, they can't be in business. Ruthless, but business is cutthroat. Anyone who has been in it knows that.

You certainly don't, not unless you make a living in computer security or work for a 3-letter agency. I remember privacy forums before 2013 when people just like you swore up and down that dragnet surveillance was a glowie paranoid fantasy - and then Snowden happened and much crow was eaten. [...]\n\nYour approach is abrasive but I don't disagree. We all do what we can to have some semblance of privacy, but the perfect execution of digital opsec/netsec is impossible in practical application. My point was that recently there has been irrational spikes in unproductive paranoia surrounding the surveillance state and who it is likely targeting. The time is not right for real exposure to risk, but connections are being made and as we are all squeezed into abject poverty there will eventually be a rebellion centered around distribution of resources. These connections will then be essential. Read what people have to say and have a mental hierarchy of trust stashed away, as one day soon you will need to know who is on your side.",

You are not being inoculated with an inactivated virus which would allow your body to create a normal immune response. Instead, your cells get a recipe to create only one particular component of the virus, the spike protein. This applies to both the mRNA and virus vector shots. How long will your cells continue to churn out spike proteins? Who knows? Will it result in Antibody Enhanced Disease? For some people, it looks like it already has. Again, we're not being offered a vaccine here. We're being coerced to participate in a mammoth medical experiment. [...]\n\nIt seems relevant to discuss the concept of promiscuous RNA programming here. Here is a good search topic for you all. Look into potatoes, specifically a pernicious grub that destroys millions of dollars in crop production each year. Monsanto used a strand of RNA with \"promiscuous\" end sequences injected into plants on small flakes of gold to permanently alter the DNA of potato plants. The plants then produced starch pods, the things we call potatoes with an engineered pesticide, inherent to the plant itself not only in the exposed generation of plants, but also in all plants produced from the grown potatoes. If you receive this vaccine, you are making yourself a GMO....the possible implications of such a genetic manipulation are essentially limitless. There could be strands of RNA literally directing your cells to have any desired attributes...it could make you produce pesticide, it could make you sterile, it could make you allergic to water, it could make you suffer anaphylactic shock in response to some compound not common, but intentionally introduced to specific water supplies.

By 15 she was having consensual sex with a young man her age. Technically this is illegal, and the law causes countless teen pregnancies every day because we cannot legally endorse sexual relations between people under the age of 18, even though human sexuality starts at the onset of puberty, a phenomenon that starts earlier each year because of the hormones in our food supply, most girls are advancing rapidly in their sexuality by 12, and most boys are developing by 13-14 with exceptions of course.

There are some compelling reasons to not get the vaccine. Foremost it is a leaky vaccine, it doesn't prevent transmission or infection; in fact it doesn't even completely prevent disease. This has the effect of increasing the spread by decreasing virulence. If such a vaccine was distributed for Ebola, the global population would be dead in a month.

Microwaves, radio, visible light, gamma, infrared are all part of the electromagnetic spectrum, the differences being the frequency of the wave form. The strength of the wave is the amplitude. Strong microwave radiation is a problem for anything that contains water because the water molecule has a dipole moment polarity and microwaves cause the water molecules to flip over rapidly reversing their orientation at the rate of wave frequency. This movement generates heat on the molecular level. Objects with no water don't get hot.
