The remaining 10% will require hospitalization, 5% of them in ICU, and 2% of them dying, most of them with comorbidity.  \nIt also doesn't help CDC and WHO dishonestly inflate case and death number, all dutifully reported ad nauseum by the lame stream media. Curiously, CDC and the White House are not requiring vaccinations for their employees.\nMandatory vaccination is unwarranted. Petty autocrats at every level of government use it to exert control over people. Vote them all out! Sue them in the courts. Unfortunately, I think these options are irrecoverably compromised. \nThe three boxes of liberty are the ballot box, the jury box, and the cartridge box. Sadly, the last option seems the only workable choice left.",

If you're in good health, have no predisposing conditions, why would you take an experimental vaccine? We don't know the number or severity of adverse reactions yet to be attributed to these Frankenshots. It may be years before we do.\nSpare me the emotional argument. Wearing a mask, social distancing, and lockdowns do nothing to prevent spread, but they are powerfully harmful both physically and psychologically.

Those inoculated with the vaccine become hypersensitive to the virus. When exposed to it in the wild, their immune systems go crazy and start attacking their bodies. The outcome isn't pretty.
