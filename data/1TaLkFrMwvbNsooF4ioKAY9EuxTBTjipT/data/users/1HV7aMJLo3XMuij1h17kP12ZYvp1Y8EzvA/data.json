However there is a hidden catch: the most devastating side effect of JAK inhibitor drugs is… sterility.\n\n> The vaccine offers no protection because the antibodies your body generate in response to its spike proteins have no effect on the actual coof because it mutates constantly. In effect, this makes the vaccine to not only offer protection but very likely makes the disease MUCH worse. \n\n> The worse the disease gets, the more likely doctors will treat you with JAK-inhibitors which will cause you to go infertile. These JAK-inhibitors are already being used everywhere. \n\nsource: https://disagreeable-eyes.surge.sh/ (clearweb)",

People need to be building servers and connect to the new networks in stead of reading bitcoin maps. Currently all the mass communication platforms are owned by one centralised globo homo and discussing anything that does not comply to their rule gets swept into oblivion. Even on FB it is incredibly obvious how they are shadow banning and compartmentalising people into fragmented echo chambers. Authentic, grassroots resistance is no longer possible. Thus the only logical solution is to set up a decentralised, self-hosted network. The only think globo homo could do is literally coerce governments to shut down the internet; but if they do that, they show their cards and they are fucked. So we need to get people off of orthodox social media and get them on blockchain infrastructure ASAP. All the idiots betting their money are wasting their time and energy all in spite of short-term thirst for quick cash; and even worse: they are actively compromising the true ideology and raisain d'être behind crypto. \n> [certy](#comment_29_1qNWEDofNoMxA5vQoWoDeC6fZ5Dt6Wgif): most coders have a too low awareness of the world around them, they are the perfect tools.\nSad but very true.",

For some weird reason I am more inclined to 'trust' zeronet because it was literally one of the first (if not the very first to create a decent P2P net browsing experience. Therefore I think the owners aren't likely to be pozzed. IPFS however has partnerships with various companies and even chainlink... so I'm not likely to trust that. \nUltimately we need something no single person or centralised power can stop.

An interface has to be found that allows google Zeronet pages to be packed on the server. I've already experimented with IPFS. Pining services are needed to keep the pages online. So the directness is gone. The pining services are also a possibility of censorship. Therefore, IPFS can only be used to a limited extent.\n\nif you 'enable Tor for every connection' apparently your IP *should* be hidden, although I have heard people claim on 4chan that certain intelligence agencies may be able to trace your IP in spite of Tor.

Inherently P2P hosting automatically favours content that is popular because more people watch/seed it. It's a bit like the concept of bumping a thread. I love it. I believe in decentralised, P2P networking. I just can't fathom it hasn't taken off yet because normie web is now 99,99% compromised. The time to migrate here is now. Communicating like this is pretty on point. I guess maybe perhaps the zeronet app could be improved upon a little bit but I love how well it works even now.",

How does an ISP block anything? There is no centralised server and/or domain. Perhaps I'm too much a technical retard but to me it seems that the point of this thing was to have something you can't really shut down as long as there are individuals running zeronet on their machines. The same principle with torrenting. The reason why they have never been able to stop torrenting is because it is P2P. You would have to block literal millions of users. However, what they did do and still do is blocking the websites that host the torrent catalogues. Why? Because it's more realistic to shut down. It's literally the only thing they can do. \nAnd the same thing applies to zeronet. If they want to shut it down, they would have to shut down the zeronet website and github so that you cannot download any new instances of the code. But then all you would have to do is find mirrors or contact individuals who have backed up the code. \nI have a backup... if they ever shut it down, I'll instantly mirror it on some shady, free file serving service, encrypt it and shill the link/pw in places where ppl might be interested in running zeronet. \nIn theory, zeronet should be more resilient than even the Tor network. Why? Because to host a Tor site, you're still using one hosting service. The moment they take this one server down, the site doesn't exist anymore.
