Since the video's are not deleted, only delisted, anyone can circumvent the copyright and DMCA laws by creating another site in another country that accesses the LBRY blockchain.\n\nBitchute - Partnered with [HopeNotHate](http://www.theburkean.ie/articles/2020/12/13/bitchute-removes-extremist-content-in-partnership-with-hope-not-hate) to purge the site of \"extremist\" content.\n\nRumble - This is new to me, so I'm still researching it.\n\nGabTV - Based off Gab.com, which had deleted a post from Andrew Anglin because they were threatened by AsianRegistry.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20170905105120/https://medium.com/@getongab/we-are-at-war-for-a-free-and-open-internet-426629fba4bf\n\nDTube - Used to be a proxy to YouTube in the same way that [Invidious](https://invidious.snopyta.org/feed/popular) is.

So, I can't comment on them, either. These four are what stood out to me because I remember some of their histories and wanted to make sure that they are all sus. Odysee is, so far, the best because while the site might delist a video, it's not deleted and can still be accessed if someone else creates a site that accesses everything the LBRY backend offers (without the delistings).",
