ZeroNet app would just start to accept them.\n\nMaybe it is just Apple thing, not sure. Here it seems that way -- https://css-tricks.com/create-url-scheme/ .\n\nHere it is described in more generic way -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_URI_schemes#Unofficial_but_common_URI_schemes",

I'm on Linux using the portable ZeroNet installation, so maybe that's why.\n\nIt's maybe not a thing yet. `zero://` was just an example of what I am looking for and then I was just explaining the example. I am not saying it is possible to do it that way.",
