				"body": "You're underestimating the power of ideology. It makes people tie bombs to themselves and make suicide attacks. It makes people even starve to death. And when your mind works with the fuel of an extreme ideology, you will proceed to destroy every single thing that is trying to oppose it. Currently, the opposing ideology against this, is liberalism of the west. As someone who is living under a religious totalitarian dictatorship, I  can tell you a true believer will do anything to defend this mindset, from backstabbing its best friend, to killing its own people, even applying something cruel like scorched earth policy.\nAnother thing is that an extremist ideology doesn't die off and decay over time, unless with the light of wisdom. Because of the poor education, bad infrastructure, and horrible economy, it's a very unlikely thing to happen. something like renaissance should happen in the middle east in order to eradicate the extremist mindset, just exactly like something that happened at the end of the medieval ages in Europe. \nBut there's a problem. Due to geopolitical reasons, the world doesn't really want this renaissance to happen. It's good to have a poor middle east, drowning in war and economic crisis. It brings them cheap oil, arms sales and it also makes China's development programs harder.\nDon't underestimate strong ideology and geopolitics.",
