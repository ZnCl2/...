Here are some screenshot for you to see proof.https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPqZpVheM4PQkbfGnbtqaDF4ni86vzxg34f4fmZDtekM1 [...]\n\nPure ideology; Majority of businesses (the ones that actually make you money) cost around 30k to start up.\nMost people right now don't make 30k in America let alone globally.\n\nThis place was better before it was filled with Nazi sperg posters.",

(site menu - corner button dragged to the left, scroll down to identity. Upon changing identity, one have to reload page F5).For me zeroid ID works (it shows up on comment form). Yours mentioned message shows for me if i use 08chan identity that is not authorized. Once i switched to zeroid.bit identity and reloaded page, i was OK (publishing fine).\n\nYou're a god damn genius anon. 1MILLION KEKS TO YOU SIR!",
