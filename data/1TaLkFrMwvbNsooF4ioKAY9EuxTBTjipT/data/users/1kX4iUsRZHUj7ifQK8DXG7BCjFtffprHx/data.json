FileWrite works so far, that means the messages are written to the users' data.json.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that something is wrong with my database. In inspected the db with a sqlite tool and my tables are empty. I'm using the same db scheme that is used in the tutorial. \n\nI would appreciate your help :)",

			"body": "\"In 2016, an Italian website called I’m With Putin appeared, promoting pro-Russian news and criticism of the West. That now-defunct site shared a Google tracking account with the official campaign website of Matteo Salvini, the far-right deputy prime minister and Italy’s most powerful politician.\"\n\n“The Kremlin has empowered and amplified other venal and anti-democratic actors to grow their influence in Europe, creating a snowball effect for its anti-Western agenda,” a European Union task force said in one of its recent summaries of Russian disinformation.\n\nOne example: Websites promoting what appear to be two local German anti-fascist groups, Antifa West Berlin and Antifa Nord Ost, share a server used by Russian government hackers who attacked the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election. The registration information for one of the German sites includes an anonymized email address that was also used to set up a pair of Russian spearphishing sites.\"\n\n\"This month, these two websites prodded thousands of Twitter followers to attend an anti-AfD rally in Berlin. The murky combination of anonymous online content and in-the-street action is reminiscent of 2016, when Russian groups pushed people in the United States to attend rallies claiming to support both Black Lives Matter and the police.\"\n\n\"A definitive attribution would require the kind of tools that the American government used to reveal the 2016 interference. Twitter said the accounts do not currently violate its policies. Neither of the anti-fascist groups responded to questions about their sites.\"\n\nSource: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/world/europe/russian-propaganda-influence-campaign-european-elections-far-right.html",
