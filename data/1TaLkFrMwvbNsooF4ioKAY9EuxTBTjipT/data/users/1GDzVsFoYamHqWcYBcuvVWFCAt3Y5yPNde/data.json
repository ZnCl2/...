I explained that in more detail in this threadIn a very broad stroke: Yes, since Tor relies on central hardcoded trusted servers, while I2P does not. However Tor has a (comparatively) massive budget, state level interest in staying anonymous and (in contrast to many opensource projects) a large number of random people who actually check and audit the source code regularly. The Tor network is also more used and (mainstream)popular then I2P, which improves plausible deniability if you get v&.\n\nthanx:)",

				"body": "> [redlibertyreal](#comment_11_1D6UcmziWg55aXV6TnCksXpjsFJ4gDK6Kw): Of course it uses IP to connect to the network, but inside the network router lease-sets (if memory serves me) are used (essentially just a pair of public keys) so you don't really know the IP of a person you are connecting to 2 hops out (average connection to an \"eepsite\" is 13 hops I believe), and 13 separate hops back. Their official website at https://geti2p.net/ has AMAZING documentation, I can read it for hours. I love I2P, I host my own hidden services with them, but I wouldn't say it's perfect. It doesn't have the same academic research, funding, and pen testing as the Tor project does to back up its claims (certainly not I2P's fault) so I wouldn't rely on it for STRONG anonymity. Theoretically it's better than Tor for darknets, but in practice who is to say? I2P though is by far my favorite \"darknet\". I steer clear of far too many things on ZeroNet because it is so decentralized, using pretty much only the main services (like ZeroTalk, ZeroMe, etc.). The pornography blacklist is a good start, but I don't think it goes far enough. I2P is decentralized, yes, but its services are centralized where they need to be, and every centralized service can be mirrored and replaced if you needed to go to the effort in a worst-case scenario. You have B32 addresses (the hostname, essentially super long public keys) and you can get a domain name free of charge to associate with the \"real\" address from people who distribute them (identiguy, meeh, zzz, etc.) Most of the domain name providers won't give you an address if you are doing bad things, and you yourself specify what DNS services your router will use. Bad people who reflect badly on the network and give it a bad rep are actively discouraged from participating. You can still do what you like, no one will stop you, but I2P is what I would consider an \"ethical darknet\", inspired by the same principles and ideas of the developers of other darknets. It's run by good people, the overwhelming majority of its users are good people. They are basically striving to avoid the mistakes made by the architectures by which information flows, to avoid the mistakes of Freenet, ZeroNet, and the culture of criminality that enveloped around Tor. It's unique in that regard. If you want to do bad stuff on I2P (other than piracy lol) I say \"fuck off\". But if you genuinely like the technology, are interested in the ideas and philosophy behind it, or want a safe place to host a decent anonymous website you'd feel comfortable showing your Grandma, I say to you, welcome!\n\nthanks for so large and clear explanation!",
