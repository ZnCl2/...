Maybe they will just take steps to have it scrubbed off the internet.\n\nEven if somehow they manage to backdoor it there is still libressl, and if somehow this too gets compromised people can develop new ones. The only way imo is to outlaw all non government issued encryption, but I don't see something like this happening any time soon. Unless something bigger than 9/11 happens...",

Many of these smaller companies either can't afford to continue and close or they are forced to go the direction of the major game companies or even worse get bought by these major companies, the ones that still manage to keep making good games and good profit are very very few.\n\nI hope in the near future the direction of the gaming industry gets turned around but I doubt it...",
