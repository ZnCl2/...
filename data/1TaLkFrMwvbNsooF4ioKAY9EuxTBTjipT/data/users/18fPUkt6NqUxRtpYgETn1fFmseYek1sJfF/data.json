			"body": "RapeLay is an eroge created by Illusion in 2006 and banned in all western countries. I find a rare english-translated version of this game and uploaded it on IFS with its sequel (IFS is the only zite that allow files bigger than 1 GB). The sequel of this game, also developed by Illusion, is Playhome. The 2 games are hentai rape-simulators and have a similar gameplay, but the latter is more advanced (improved graphics and plot, custom characters, mod, etc...)\n\nI hope that this network will guarantee long life to these rare gems!. Please download and seed these 2 files. These files are very big and i have a slow connection under TOR, please be patient, all the seeding process will require many days to be completed.\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/12MVkvYGcRW6u2NYbpfwVad1oQeyG4s9Er/index.html?view:item+id:15f1_1PmagXPm9EpReQTJrrsgBYignpgeGzCrZ6_item_21+type:archive\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/12MVkvYGcRW6u2NYbpfwVad1oQeyG4s9Er/index.html?view:item+id:15f1_1PmagXPm9EpReQTJrrsgBYignpgeGzCrZ6_item_19+type:archive",

The moment ZeroNet goes mainstream, many of th mainstream problems come with it.\n\nthat is true, but more nodes =more bandwidth and storage for all! Just now we can seed little videos files well!\n\nI see that porn files that are less than 10 MB are now well seeded, but bigger files don't have other seeds other mine. Can you help me to seed also these files? Can be a good idea divide big files videos in high compressed parts to make this more easy? My video bitrate now is around 400k...very similar to original porn sites where i taken the clips, because of this zeronet can be a very good alternativeto these sites if there are more nodes online",

You have as much freedom to share porn as I do to say that it's bullshit and you shouldn't.And it's not just a matter of me not sharing it. Pornography is dangerous in general and nobody should share or see it.Not through censorship, but through understanding that pornography and masturbation are much like having cocaine on you all the time.If I know this and keep quiet, shame on me for my omission\n\nOnly different point of views. Here anyone can censor anyone locally in his PC :D . Zeronet respect your decision as respect mine, and because of this i like this network. Personally i banned some users because i don't want to host their content, maybe others disagree with me, but what is in your PC is only your responsability, not mine.",

Including the rape scenes of various Hollywood creations. So, that site is not really a porn site in the 2020 sense. It's more like a historic archive of mainstream movie clips that should be preserved for historical culture studies purposes. Unpleasant clips, but so are wars and concentration camp photos. Worth archiving.\n\nTotally agree! Anyway rape scenes are also filmed in many modern movies that also won prizes like the Stockholm International Film Festival's award for best film, won by IrrÃ©versible (2002). I uploaded also the brutal rape scene of this film on ZeroNet.",
