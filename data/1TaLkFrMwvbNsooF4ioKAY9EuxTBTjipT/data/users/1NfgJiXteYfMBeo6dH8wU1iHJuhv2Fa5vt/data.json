Even Muhammad killed over 800 jews during his life.\n\nThe Quran also teaches that Moslems should welcome the Jews return to Israel as God gave Israel to the Jews for eternity and that their return was a sign of the end days.\n\n\"God granted the Land of Israel to the Children of Israel and ordered them to settle there. In addition, it is predicted that before the end of days, God will bring the Children of Israel to retake possession of the Land, gathering them from the different countries and nations (Sura 17:104)\"",
