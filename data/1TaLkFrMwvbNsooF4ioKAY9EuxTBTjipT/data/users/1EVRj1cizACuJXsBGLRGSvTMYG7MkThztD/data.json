			"body": "I've been wondering of how to have a really safe VPN without anyone knowing your location, even the provider.\n\nI was thinking of dedicated servers or cloud computing but I don't know how trustworthy are those, and those paid services like cyberghost, tunnelbear and whatnot aren't that ok to me.\n\nI was also thinking of getting a computer acting like a VPN server on another physical location, but I don't know how to hide that I'm connected to that server.",
