				"body": "Your absolutely correct.  The world elites are loosing control of economies with bitcoin. True capitalism is when there is unfettered control of trade.  Governments are in place to ensure fair trade, but not equal trade. Leave me alone and let me do what I do to help people, and they trade with me for my services and goods. TGR will change that, all transactions will go through them, they will determine what is correct.  It's not the users determining what the needs are, it's a group of the oligarchy who will determine what will happen, what we can do, what we can say, what we can think.  We will be less than serfs, we will be slaves.",
