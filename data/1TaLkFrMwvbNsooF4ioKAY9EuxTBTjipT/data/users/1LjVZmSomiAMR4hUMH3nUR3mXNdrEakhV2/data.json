Even assuming they did everything right with no evil intent - it's time to get a different set of eyes on our problem. \n\nIt's also time to face the possibility of an unpleasant reality. These vaccines are breeding superbugs. At some point, it may be appropriate to tell old people \"No more vaccines. We will do what we can to save you - but we can't risk young people.\"\n\nThat is the stark choice we may be facing. The old must be sacrificed to save the young.",

This does not apply if your ZN is running its own Tor version on Windows likely. [...]\n\nJust FYI....I use ZeroNet with the Tor browser serving as it's proxy. Have no idea if it is working in V3 mode or not - but everything works.",
