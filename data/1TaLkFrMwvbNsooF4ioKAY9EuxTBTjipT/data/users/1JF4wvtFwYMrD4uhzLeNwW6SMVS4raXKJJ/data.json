			"body": "And, so what happened to me was not exactly covered by the Q-Anon Conspiracy Theory, but it is very closely entangled or so it would seem... \n\nAgain, all of what I am telling you was provided to my local police and then passed on to the FBI for further investigation in the year 2017 just BEFORE Q-Anon came to be... So, please feel free to do a Freedom Of Information Act Request for more detailed information... Thank you...\n\nVery peculiar timing to say the least...\n\nAs a child of only 11 years old, I was provided strong doses of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine (aka 2ce or tucy) by an individual who went by the pseudonyms OtakuBoi666 and MyExcuse whose real name was/is supposedly Cameron Peter Rezk.\n\nHe pointed out how funny it was that his initials spelled CPR once... Side note... Sorry... Flashback..\n\nAnyway, he asked me to watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr8jqQcR8TA\n\nEventually introducing me to several \"other\" individuals who were involved in his scheme which operated out of San Fransisco Bay Area... Once I informed my local police he \"disappeared\" according to those of his associates who still had contact with him far long after I had broken off my relationship with him... The things he taught me were unspeakable... For some idea of what he had been doing, please see the following article found here: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/mindcontrol/chapter03.htm\n\nHe was a Hitler Fanatic and even sent many photos of him in Nazi Uniform... \n\nPlease Please Please! Save Our Children!\n\nThis is not a matter of QAnon being a PsyOp or not...\n\nI was HIT BY A TRUCK AND HOSPITALIZED IN 2011 AS I BEGAN EXPOSING THIS!!!\n\nThis is a cry for HELP!!!\n\nhttps://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_mindcon52.htm\n\n#MakeAmericaFreeAgain\n#SaveOurChildren\n#MKUltra",
