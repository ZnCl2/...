It's two clicks max for both. Want to upload some content? New site -> paste your files -> sign -> publish -> share. That simple. On the clearnet? Well first you need to go pay for hosting (because who self-hosts? If you do, you need to call up your ISP for a static IP or find another solution), then you need to go buy a domain name, both of which you need to pay yearly for. Set up the nameservers properly so they point your domain to your host. Wait however many hours that all takes. Then ftp or ssh into your server and upload your files. It's a huge pain and expensive. [...]\n\nI host my own website on a Raspberry Pi. It's only 25€ or so, _one time_, and for domain, I first used a free Dyn-DNS-provider (No-IP), and now I somewhat switched (still re-activating the No-IP-domain :D) to a domain I bought, which costs only 0.75cents a month (or so,.. I forgot xD).\nFor HTTPS I use LetsEncrypt. Not everybody thinks it's good or so, but I think so.\n\nYes, I admit, it all was somewhat hard'ish to set up, but I mean, _why not_!? :D\nIt was definitely worth learning about all that stuff.\n\nBut: I do agree, that a clearnet-site is not as safe as a zite in ZeroNet, and because I pretty much have nobody who visits my site, I can't really talk about how good _or bad_ the server actually is x(.\n\nAbout the thing that the user has full control of posting stuff, _maybe_,.. because I could just go into ThunderWave's code, and edit it, so that User 1 only sees messages from a selected range. Not everybody _can_ code, not everybody _wants_ to code, not everybody is concerned about his data's _security_ (hmm, the last is somewhat not the case for probably _any_ user on the ZeroNet :D), so if User 1 is just a \"normal\" End-User, _why_ should he check the code?!\nAfter all, ZeroNet isn't *just* for coders/programmers/whatever (or at least, it shouldn't!), but also for the everyday end-user, who just want's to go a different way, than the clearnet.\n\nZites are not always up. If all users just delete it, or have no internet access, then the user wanting to access the zite won't be able to download it (xD that's kind of a stupid argument right there, but _everything can happen_ (though, this _is_ true for somewhat private website e.g. a blog)).\n\nSo all in all, I totally agree with what you wrote! xD\n(PS.: I read it all x_O)",

Of course, the license might be hidden in the code, but apart from that, original code by the owner of the zite is just as libre as anything else. It is the problem of the owner of course, that they do not include a license for their own code.\nSo if I were to define libre after that, then anything that has no license is also libre, as it falls under no obligations to the owner.\n\nI am ofc, not a lawyer, and I myself don't really care that much if my code gets copied, tho I do care if someone were to take it and just let people pay for the use. But in my eyes, that is a completely different case. The first being libre, the second being that the person who copied, didn't inherit that \"libre\".\nThe fact that licensing is still so difficult for individuals, as you have to deal with a ton of differences, and can't really create your own, if you don't want any loopholes, has also kept me from putting a license on (almost) all of my own creations.\n\nAnyways, I'm probably writing a bunch of bullsh*t here right now, so I'll just stop commenting further, except if I want to clarify things for me.",

In order to support the TBB you likely need to use JIMP (or similar) (if you find a way around this, without the user having to configure anything, please let me know). If you want to look at how that could be implemented look no further then millchan(specifically (all are clearnet links) writeThumbnails(), class Thumbnails  and the thumbnail worker )\n\nOh, right, canvas support for the Tor Browser Bundle is a good point.. \nAs a question then, does it e.g. work for uploading an image on ZeroMe, if you happen to know?",

This is all way too complicated and I only have a few hours ( Max 12 ) per week to work on that stuff. I can't believe there isn't a way to end up with just a \"file2 = thumbnail(file,100,100);\" kind of function. There should atleast be some API commands to do basic image manipulations when we can't use PHP... No wonder there are no content creators on ZeroNet when the API/guide are so empty I can't even create a fucking thumbnail without having to learn and understand dozens of functions from a half-dozen of classes. Even with your example I had to read most of the stuff to know that I needed to import Class, PNGEncoder and Uploadable, adapt my code to them, finding out how to use every single needed Uploadable functions ( dataURLtoFile, handleUpload, handleUploadClick and resizeImage ), what they needed and how to call them only for both the way the API needs to be used ( AKA your mainloop needs to be a class ) and JS' scope works ( AKA apparently you can't call other class from your class... ) to fuck everything up. Now the hours I spent learning and restructuring everything is worthless if I don't spend a good 50 hours to recreate the zite from zero and restructure everything. To have thumbnails. It would seem my zite won't have normal thumbnails and fuck people's diskspace I guess.  [...]\n\nJust to clear any potential misunderstandings on the matter of the code in the repos:\n- You (@fantoski) only have to look at the `sample-image-data-zite` repo, as that is where the code for creating thumbnails lies\n- The relevant code for you starts from https://gitlab.com/AnthyG/sample-image-data-zite/blob/master/js/page.js#L142 and goes to L223\n-  `Class.coffee`, `ImagePreview.coffee`, `Uploadable.coffee`, `pngencoder.js` and ofc `ZeroFrame.js` are the only \"mandatory\" files of the whole project (and `page.js` for the own code obviously)\n- You do not have to care about any of the functions residing in previous files but the variables defined in the constructors of `Uploadable` and `ImagePreview` might still be important for configuration to your likings (thus then again, you also probably have to look a bit into the functions but that should be rather easy when understanding that not everything is needed to be understood)\n\nFor further documentation on ZeroNet, I really recommend checking out https://zeronet.io/docs, if you haven't already.\n\nI am not a complete \"pro\", neither in JS nor in ZeroNet, thus I will not always be able to help, but you might want to consider creating a private repo on GitLab and invite me to look at the code (I will handle it confidential ofc, but as I just said, you shouldn't expect that I'll be able to solve all your issues). :)",

Also, I did say \"IIRC\", which means \"if I remember correctly\" in this case, and as my knowledge on the mechanisms driving ZeroNet itself is not that good as opposed to that of others (like @gitcenter), I can't say for 100% certainty, that it is like I said.\n\nThen again, I follow my rules on ThunderWave (you can view them by typing `/rules` in the chat there). And as long as you also follow those rules on the zite _I am the owner of_, I will not have any reason to remove your content. You may always just clone ThunderWave and say that with you as owner, nobody has to fear any content being removed.\n\nBasically, there is no way for censoring to succeed, if the driving force beneath it is decentralization. ... or something like that.",

If you want a \"higher performance\" stream, then you could fiddle around witg increasing the FPS and Bitrate and decreasing the delay (which is basically how long each recorded-and-then-sent segment is) but _IIRC_ the latter will make the stream even choppier for bad connections as some segments might just get lost.\n\nOther than that, you could, e.g. give the browser process a higher priority or something like that.\n\nWhat browser are you using?\nAlso, what did you compare StreamZ against? Like, what other application did you use that you seem to know uses  WebRTC to stream? Would be quite interesting to know :D",

				"body": "@1bfqutudhtexlka, in general, you need at least one peer with an open port, to be able to publish data on ZeroNet and that's also a requirement for PeerMessage.\n\n@moor, the stream is captured through the [`mediaDevices`-API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) (IIRC), which I believe returns an object that, in the case of StreamZ gets converted (I guess \"or encoded\") to a base64-string. That base64-piece then gets sent to the peers (together with some other information, e.g. the ID of the piece).\nAs PeerMessage doesn't support a continous stream of data (I think), StreamZ uses the \"delay\"-setting when you set up a stream to split the data into pieces each as long as defined by delay. Then the ID gets assigned which is basically just the index of that piece of the whole stream. To counter stuttering when switching to the newly received video (because it has to load a bit at first), we use two players that alternate playing the videos. So having a too short delay might also be bad as I noted before because it might mean that the watching browser works more to load the pieces than to play them.\n\nI don't actually remember if we discussed using a different method for encoding the data tho, and I can only assume that the technique we implemented for StreamZ is somewhat \"unique\" as opposed to other streaming platforms, because we don't actually use a continous stream (if I am correct in that statement ofc).",

[...]\n\nIn theory you could make a thing similar to what @gitcenter did with the ZeroMail proxy for Thunderbird except that the UI for the plugin would still just be some zite.\nE.g. you could maybe use OpenCV for python to capture a stream from OBS, split it up into segments and then somehow give those to PeerMessage to distribute them.\n\nAlso, I guess other protocols would need to be implemented in PeerMessage, as StreamZ itself only has a connection to the ZeroNet instance and no power over the connection to actual other peers.",

If you want to see if a certain phone has been rooted before, then you might want to check out https://forum.xda-developers.com/ where each device should have a \"Android Development\" and \"Original Android Development\" section.\n\nFor my phone that I bought like 5 or 6 years ago, I only got an official update from Android 4.4 to 5.0 after a year, and that was it. By then I had already rooted it and extensively customized it with Xposed. Now the latest (and probably last) ROM that I am on is LineageOS 14.1 (Android 7.1.2) built in February this year. Before that, I had used RessurectionRemix for a very long time (it's certainly the most customizable ROM I've seen to-date) but the latest build of that for my phone is from like 2017 :(\n\nSo yeah, consider buying a mid-range phone (mine is / was a LG L90 D405 w7 for ~160€ or so) that is rootable and has active ROM development and you'll get immense value out of a very little price.",

I've set `thunderwave.bit` to be the default domain as you can see [in it's content.json](/thunderwave.bit/content.json). So when you click on `ThunderWave` in ZeroHello, you will open `thunderwave.bit`.\n\nThis imposes the risk that if you lose the power over the domain, that your zite might get redirected to a different zite instead, when being accessed through ZeroHello (if you don't change the default domain, that is).",
