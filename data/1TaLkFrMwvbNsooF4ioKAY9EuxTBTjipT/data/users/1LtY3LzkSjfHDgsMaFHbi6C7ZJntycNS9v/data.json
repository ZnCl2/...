Keeping spent fuel rods in cooling pools next to operating reactors - instead of safely storing within a safe multibillion dollar storage facility @ Yucca mountain....If the local yokels ever deprive their cooling pools of sufficient water, those rods will catch fire and render several states uninhabitable for thousands of years. We'll beat that Soviet nuclear accident by a long shot. \n\nIn the US, each side tries to push through their agenda - but is quickly countered. So you end up with endless gridlock worse than letting each side's zealots have their way. Neither side will let the other have a win.",
