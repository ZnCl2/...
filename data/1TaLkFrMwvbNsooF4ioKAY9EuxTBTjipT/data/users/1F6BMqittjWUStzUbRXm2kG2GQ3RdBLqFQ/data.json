			"body": ">  Elm - programming language for declaratively creating web browser-based graphical user interfaces. Elm is purely functional, and is developed with emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness. It advertises \"no runtime exceptions in practice\", made possible by the Elm compiler's static type checking.\n\nHello, everyone!\n\nI'm glad to introduce [Elm-ZeroNet](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1ANAneTCtamh2dgZrJWNPNMTEX8iXKawPg/) - a toolkit to build zites using Elm language. It is early beta, not all ZeroFrame API features are supported for now, but I think it's ready for testing.\n\nThis demo page created with Elm-ZeroNet as well.\n\nFuture plans: More support of ZeroFrame APIs, more Docs and Guides.\n\nUnfortantly, English isn't my native language, so, typos and error may and will occur in documentation and I will very happy, if someone could help to improve this.\n\nAny issues or pull-request are welcome",
