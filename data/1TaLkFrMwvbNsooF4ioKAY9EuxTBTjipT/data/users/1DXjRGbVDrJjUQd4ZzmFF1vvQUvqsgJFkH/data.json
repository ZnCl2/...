				"body": "Both AMD and Nvidia GPUs are reported to require significant troubleshooting (probably because 100% FOSS drivers for them are very hard to accomplish), just use an Intel integrated one. And while 8 GB RAM is enough to use it, 16 GB is really needed for a smooth experience, and even better 32 GB if you can afford it. Qubes OS doesn't support 3D acceleration, supposedly for security reasons, so a nice GPU would be quite useless anyway. RAM is allocated statically to each VM, so until you shut it down, it will always use and keep a lot of RAM for itself even if it doesn't really need all of it.",

				"body": "> [toyata](#comment_110_17mM4YqSx7nMkYcePZB2GWcJBzkogWpqA1): if a system grows large and bloated enough, and too many things start depend on it, it doesnt matter anymore if its opensource or not, it becomes a potential threat for misuse. Examples are anything related to Android or Chrome, where the main code done by Google no derivative can be said to be secure. With Redhat the driving force and IBM takeover, it is now of utmost interest to \"own\" Linux with Gnome/GTK/systemd and try remove any competition from the distro landscape. Only a \"unified Linux system\" is one that can easily be controlled and turned against its users.\n\nSo basically a Debian which focuses on 100% FOSS by default is a GNOME/systemd monster. Does that mean Debian is to be avoided? Ubuntu is cancer, Fedora is corporate, Arch has binary blobs in the kernel... what options do we have anymore?",

Read their news, it seems they have issues supporting sysvinit and are already hesitant keeping to use it.\nAnd besides, MX has a lot of binary firmware by default, so no freedom. They include eveyrthing in their repos, even Chrome, Steam and Spotify. Just install and run the \"vrms\" command - you can see a shitload of garbage preinstalled.",

Firefox while not perfect arguably is a 1000xtimes better than chrome. At some point, the most transparent and comnunity driven choices will likely be the best.\n\nLinux itself is largely controlled by Google (https://www.kernel.org/) so maybe we should look into BSD. And Firefox can be replaced with Tor Browser or PaleMoon",
