I feel like anyone would be happy to know someone has an interest in their country and culture, even if it doesn't really match reality.\nThey're in for a rude awakening if they decide to move to Japan and expect to be accepted wearing cosplay every day, but if they're learning the language they're bound to get a more moderate view of the country eventually. At least that was my experience with anime-loving friends. \nHonestly, they don't bother me any more or less than other teenage subcultures.",
