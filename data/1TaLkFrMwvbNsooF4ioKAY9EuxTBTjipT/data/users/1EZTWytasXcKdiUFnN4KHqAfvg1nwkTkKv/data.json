Because the mobile's storage capacity is too small. We must consider a sufficient number of personal computers to form a basic network. To have enough people to use zeronet, in order to have enough personal computers to form the underlying network.\n\nTo attract enough people to use, first you must  have an attractive thing. Zerotalk is ok. And the development of zerotalk technology has all have, upload pictures, embed video, set up the administrator, just need to integrate it.\n\nThis does not require Packing a bitcoin, ipfs, namecoin, etc. into one big, monolithic application.\n\nIf zerotalk builds a basic network, there is a technical problem that has not yet been solved, and the establishment and maintenance of large-scale P2P database. I think this is the real problem and development of zeronet will face to.\n\nFor example, from 100000 personal computers constitute zeronet basic network, each computer to take 30G hard drive capacity, 100000X30G = 3000T. So big a P2P database, how to build? How to run How to maintain This is the real problem.\n\nOnce zeronet can build a stable base network, the number of personal computers will be far more than 100,000 units. On this basis, is to consider when the mobile to join.\n\nBefore the foundation network is established, no matter how smart a person is, no matter how much favorite protocol can increase, will not succeed.",

Also, streaming data instead of downloading is becoming more popular (like Netflix/Spotify/Youtube), so being able to do some amount of that is a good idea too.\n> \n> That example isn't totally right. A network can be very redundant, or have high capacity, but having more of one means having less of the other. You can have more of each, but that's much harder. (this page explains it a little more).\n> For example, if there was only one site with a size of 30GB, then the whole network can only store 30GB. I know it's not really like that--but in the real network, just adding up the storage of each device isn't correct.\n\nI know that mobile phone applications are more extensive, but by the personal computer constitute a basic network is more feasible. The advantage of P2P networks lies in the storage space of a large number of personal computers. If you do not make full use of the personal computer's spare storage space, compared with the internet network there is no advantage. Mobile phone can be connected to the server, there is no need to use zeronet.\n\nStreaming data is good idea, but too much attention to it is not necessary. Twister is to rely entirely on streaming data, the result is not received posts. Of course, this problem can be solved, to reduce the distribution of old posts in the node on the line, but this again complicated the problem.\n\nI can see from your reply, you also know that a huge P2P database operation and maintenance is a difficult point.（But having more of one means having less of the other.

(besides any favorites we might have) This is not a failing of nofish to create a set of uniform zites for people to get started, but for people who stay here there are issues with this design.\n> For example, the working proxy sites with their long lists on ZeroHello are a good gateway, perhaps better than a static list since we can see popularity and know what is alive and updated. But 0lists a like hitting \"I feel lucky\" on Google. We end up with many crappy random half-loaded zites with few or no peers, and then have to go through our ZeroHello deleting the mess again. So for me the homepage is the bottleneck.

That will surely happen as zites get busier and more complex.\n> Also curious and waiting to hear details of nofish's new announcement as mentioned in the dev blog, if it pertains (has relevance) to any of this.\n\nI uploaded a picture, your picture becomes three.

In the future zeronet with more people, you can advertise. On the left one can put ads.\n\nMaybe big companies will buy your start-up business, you can make a lot of money.\n\nFirst of all, let a lot of people come in. Put zerotalk with image well, many people come in. This will be a successful business.\n\nIf you can win the venture capital, full-time development of your zerotalk with image and your app center, you have enough technical ability to be more likely to be successful. Your zerotalk with image the better development, the more people will use, your app center portal can do the better, the easier for you to win the venture capital.\n\nGo yahoo boss for entrepreneurial funds, he is doing the portal site success.

It's taken some time to fully understand your requests, but i do finally get your meaning. It's not your English, but thinking about the Chinese sites i've visited it makes sense. At this stage it's useful to hear your opinion how to integrate well.\n> Anyway, as far as i can tell (based on the top proxies) it looks like Chinese users will outnumber English user sometime soon. Language is one issue. Even now, i want to link to Chinese content creators but it needs mouse-over which translates title, etc. Also, Unicode handling..\n> Uncaught InvalidCharacterError: Failed to execute: The string to be encoded contains characters outside of the Latin1 range.\n> Just reading Tamas' announcement about TED talk on the dev blog.\n\nI hope you soon succeed, you succeeded my aim has also been achieved, so that millions of Chinese people use zeronet.\n\nThe faster you succeed, the happier I am.\n\nTo quickly achieve success, it is necessary to develop a Chinese people like to use the APP. I studied it, zerotak with image the most appropriate. Than zerome easy to develop, suitable for Chinese people like to do their own group, all the technology has been, and only need to integrate, you can succeed.\n\nZeronet development has three major difficulties, large P2P database is one of them. Zerome from the beginning to face this difficulty is not wise. Zeotalk with image to avoid this difficulty, but the same effect.\n\nZerotalk with image can be displayed on the home page img, can upload video, can set the administrator, there will be a lot of people cloning, there will be a lot of people use, so that your portal on the success, there may be large companies Buy your company.",

You don't need any software on the computer as the block is based on the IP address (of the trackers).\n\nI don't study the network. I don't understand the structure of the network and I don't understand how the Internet works. But I think that the connection of ZeroNet PEER is nothing more than the following situations:\n\n1， two peers connect to a server at the same time, there is no GFW software on this server, then these two peers can connect.\n\n2，Both peers are connected to a server at the same time. The GFW software is installed on this server. Therefore, the two peers cannot be connected and GFW prevents the connection.\n\n3，a peer is connected to the A server, there is no GFW on the A server, the b peer is connected to the B server, and there is no GFW on the B server. The a peer connects to the B server through the A server and then connects with the b peer.\n\n4，The a peer is connected to the A server. There is no GFW on the A server. The b peer is connected to the B server. The B server has a GFW. The a peer connects to the B server through the A server, and cannot connect to the b peer and is blocked by the GFW.\n\n5，a, b Two peers in the same local area network can obtain connections without using a server.\n\nSince China's Internet is in fact a lot of LANs, because most servers do not have GFW software and only a few servers have GFW software, in most cases zeronets should find peers, and only a few peers should be blocked.\n\nHowever, the actual situation is that a large number of peers are blocked. What is the reason?\n\nIf block is based on the IP address (of the trackers), there are 4 questions:\n\n1，whether the zero network peer must be tracker to connect?\n\n2，Do peers in the same LAN also have to be connected via tracker?\n\n3，Under the same local area network, two devices respectively accessing the Internet cannot find the peer and cannot connect to the tracker. But at the same time, networking can be connected to each other through local discovery. Why is that?\n\n4，some sites can not connect to any peer with one device, and 2 devices can connect to the peers when they access the Internet at the same time. Why is that?",

Tracker will interconnect them in case tracker or the peers are not located on the GFW restricted internet which has the tracker on the blocklist. [...]\n\n你连上互联网是通过一个服务商的服务器，很多服务器组成了互联网，你访问的网站被屏蔽，就是从你的互联网接入服务器到访问的网站服务器中间，至少有一个服务器是安装了GFW，这样才能阻止你访问这个网站。中共能大规模地屏蔽网站，是不是所有的互联网接入服务器都安装了GFW？那很小的城市的互联网接入服务器也有技术人员在管理这些GFW？那么，那些小城市的服务器上的GFW是不是很容易被人破解？或者被攻垮？因为技术力量不够。\n另外一个问题，P2P并没有他们要屏蔽的网站服务器，我们并不访问哪个服务器，这如何屏蔽？\n最后，其实这最终是个运算力的问题，如果某个网站存放在一万个服务器上，GFW任何屏蔽？有这样的运算力吗？\nzeronet就相当于将网站放在几万个服务器上，这可能屏蔽吗？",

He added, “We joined the Iranian people in calling for freedom and accountability.” Therefore, “The age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering.”\nThe U.S. Secretary of State reiterated that when America partners with enemies such as the mullahs, “they advance.”\nMaryam Rajavi, welcomed U.S. departure from policies whose first victims have been the Iranian people and the Iranian Resistance.\n\nShe once again underscored the fact that gaining access to weapons of mass destruction, violations of human rights, export of fundamentalism, and terrorism are the four pillars holding up the theocratic regime ruling Iran.\n\nThe ultimate solution for discarding the mullahs’ religious fascism is changing this illegitimate regime at the hands of the Iranian people and Resistance.\n\nRecognition of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), as the sole democratic alternative to the terrorist religious dictatorship in Iran, is the imperative to rectifying and ending the disastrous U.S. policy of appeasement over the past four decades. The clerical regime, which holds the world record in executions, will only understand a decisive and firm response.\n\nOn behalf of the Iranian Resistance, which has called for an arms and oil embargo against the mullahs’ religious dictatorship since 1981, Maryam Rajavi reiterated the need to take the following steps:\n\n1. Recognition of the Iranian people’s right to resistance to overthrow the mullahs’ religious fascism and achieve freedom;\n2. Designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) as a whole as terrorist entities by the U.S. State Department and the European Union; \n3. Expulsion of the mullahs’ intelligence agents and mercenaries of the terrorist Qods Force from the U.S. and Europe;\n4. Referring the dossier of human rights violations in Iran to the UN Security Council after 65 United Nations censures;\n5. Supporting the referral of the dossier of the 1988 massacre of political prisoners in Iran to international tribunals;\n6. Ouster of the mullahs’ illegitimate regime from the UN and recognition of representation by the Iranian people’s just Resistance;\n7. Decisive expulsion of Iran’s ruling religious fascism and its forces from Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon and Afghanistan;\n8. Compelling the government of Iraq to pay compensation for the properties, equipment, arms and camps the PMOI/MEK and the National Liberation Army of Iran (NLA), which had fully paid for them and whose evidentiary documents are available.\n\nSecretariat of the National Council of Resistance of Iran\nJanuary 11, 2019",

			"body": "本来我打算再过段时间提的，有人正在开发零网直播嘛，开发了直播就可以延伸开发零网电视的嘛，这是顺理成章的事。当然要先等这些开发完成。\n\n不过我看到有人在论坛上增加上传图片功能。为了避免开发走弯路，浪费了宝贵的时间。我还是现在提一下。\n\n1,不要在纯文字论坛中增加图片上传功能，开发单纯的图片上传论坛，功能简单，这样开发比较快。图片上传的模块网上有，直接拿来就可以。当然不是为了开发比较简单，是考虑以后数据库的使用。\n\n论坛一般不会有长篇大论的文章，所以纯文字的论坛占用的存储空间是很小的，所有的数据都可以存储到每个参与者的电脑或者手机上，不必用数据库分散存储。我们要有点前瞻性，手机的存储空间也会越来越大的。\n\n但是图片不同，增加了图片上传功能，存储量会增加很多。现在不用考虑数据库，但是迟早总要考虑这个问题的。\n\n虽然一个论坛中有文字也有图片，我们可以把文字与图片分开来处理，不过总是比不上单纯的图片论坛所有的数据一起处理来得方便。不要把简单的问题复杂化。\n\n2,现在不用考虑数据库问题，只要把所有的图片都设计成可选文件，让大家根据自己的设备做选择，使用电脑的可以多存储一些，使用移动设备的可以少存储一些，以后才考虑数据库分散存储，这样简单一些。图片文件的大小限制在200k以内，大于200k不能上传。\n\n3,可以考虑上传短视频，不要超过10M。太大的文件同步效果不好。\n\n4,设计上要方便移植。对已经做了纯文字论坛的人，只要复制几个文件进去，就可以增加一个图片论坛，当然这需要在原来的文字论坛中增加一个页面。互相不能有冲突。",

A block corresponds to an account or the corresponding 10 accounts are the same. Corresponding to an account easy to understand.\n\nTwister There are several problems now: It is difficult to receive new tweets; Avatars sometimes have, sometimes not; Repeatedly received a number of tweets, these are caused by same reason. Is the structural design issues，not about code.\n\nIn fact, twister is to complicate the simple problem.\n\nAn account corresponds to a block, as long as the account of all the information and data are placed in the corresponding block, so Avatar has been there, will not be gone. Will not repeatedly receive some tweets, of course, can receive new tweets.\n\nBecause when you focus on an account, all the data in the block corresponding to this account, except the key, is transmitted to you.\n\nHowever, each person has a different number of tweets, so the size of the block should be different. Some people send a large amount of a day, he needs the corresponding block larger.\n\nTwister can maintain the data every 24 hours, resize all the blocks. To push more blocks to expand adjustment.\n\nOf course, each block needs to be adjusted over time.\n\nThe same applies if the size of the blocks must be the same. As long as each block corresponds to a data block. All the information except the key of this block is stored in this corresponding data block, and all the data blocks are adjusted every 24 hours. This is called data maintenance.\n\nIn this way, twister existing problems can be solved.\n\nThe current development of twister does not require too much storage capacity, this issue should be put into consideration later. Image upload, video upload are solved. Then think about it.\n\nThe solution to storage is theoretically not complicated. Bigger data blocks are allocated as P2P databases.

However, twister stores all blockchains on your local hard drive, but the data in the blockchain is not all stored on the local hard drive.\n\nThe easiest way to turn a twister into a zeronet site is to store the data in all the blockchains on your local hard drive. At present, the amount of data in twister is not large. This method is ok and feasible.\n\nAnother simple method is to store only one month of data in the entire blockchain. Data for more than one month is not stored. This way the site will not be too big.\n\nThese two methods are especially desirable in the current zeronet and twister usage, and the network conditions are relatively poor.\n\nAfter the number of users of zeronet and twister has increased, consider storing data based on each individual's concerns, or running it exactly as if the twister were running.\n\nThis can be considered later, because the way the twister works is that the network can be implemented under ideal conditions. The current network is not ideal, causing the twister to not receive tweets.\n\nThe more difficult is how the signature of the twister and the signature of the zeronet mutually recognize each other.

This way the African refugee problem is also easily resolved.\n\nThe government of a country that produces a large number of refugees has no right to stop the allocation of trusteeships.

			"body": "Tibet’s independence, China’s problems have been solved in half. And this is Putin's willingness to cooperate.\n\nPutin must know that it will not take long for the Russian Far East to be corrupted by the CCP and the environment will be destroyed. Then build a few useless image projects to deceive the ordinary people. This kind of project is a corrupt project, used for corruption and money laundering of the CCP, and of course includes collusion with local Russian officials.\n\nPutin has no good response to this potential crisis. And whether Russia has the ability to deal with this crisis alone is also doubtful.\n\nAfter Tibet’s independence, this crisis against Russia will be much reduced.\n\nMoreover, Tibet is close to India and has close ties with India. India has long-term friendly relations with Russia. After independence, Tibet has no threat to Russia. Tibet and Mongolia are also very close. Russia and Mongolia have long-term friendly relations. Russia should welcome Tibet's independence.\n\nTibet and Nepal, not long, North Korea, and Ryukyu, used to be vassal states of Manchu, not administrative areas of Manchu. Tibet’s independence has no obstacles from international law.\n\nTibet is not a colony of Manchu, so Tibet independence does not need to conduct a referendum on the basis of colonial independence. As long as the Tibetan people’s administration, the Tibetan government in exile, announces the abolition of 17 articles signed with the CCP.\n\nTibet’s own ability to promote independence is very limited and requires the support of the Western world, especially the support of the United States. However, if it can unite with Russia, Tibet’s independence will be much easier.",

			"body": "Restoring Manchuria Russia will definitely help, because after the founding of Manchuria, China and Russia's Far East region were separated, effectively preventing the possibility of the CCP's large-scale direct entry into Russia. The restoration of Manchuria is also the result that Japan is most willing to see. Japan has previously fostered the independence of Manchuria.\n\nRestoring Manchuria is also very beneficial to the United States. The independence of Manchuria’s founding of the country separated the direct link between North Korea and the Chinese Communist Party. North Korea’s nuclear issue is easy to resolve.\n\nIn addition to the CCP, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and the United States are all happy to see Manchuria's independent statehood.\n\nManchu and Daming were originally two countries. In 1644, the Qing Dynasty occupied and annexed Daming and became a country.\n\nWhen the Revolution of 1911 broke out in 1911, the Manchu regime was facing a collapse. At this time, the North-South reconciliation was held. The Manchu regime and the Southern Provisional Government agreed to retain the royal family and implement the republican system.\n\nWhat is strange is that the North-South collegiate at that time did not establish a constitutional monarchy, but created a Republic monarchy.\n\nAs a result, the Chinese-made Republic monarchy was naturally and quickly failed.\n\nOf course, all the contracts at the time of the North-South collegiate, the agreement will be void. The Chinese seem to have never considered to comply with the contract.\n\nSince all the contracts at the time were invalidated. Then, the fact that Manchu and Daming were originally two countries cannot be denied. It is logical for Manchu to re-establish his own country.\n\nIt is very reasonable for the United States, Japan and Russia to join forces to restore Manchuria.",

			"title": "I hope the US government can understand that splitting China is better than constitutional reform",
			"body": "China’s split has been inevitable, and even if China implements constitutional reforms, it will split. Instead of first carrying out constitutional reforms and letting the whole of China move toward constitutionalism under constitutionalism, it is unnecessary, and it is also very easy to cause chaos and even war.\n\nIn fact, there is an insurmountable obstacle to constitutional reform in China. China's judicial system is the most corrupt system, and it is not used to maintain the rule of law, it is used to maintain the dictatorship of the CCP. If constitutional reform is to be implemented in China, there will first be a problem. Almost all CCP judges will be prosecuted and will be prosecuted for personal bankruptcy. Even most judges will face criminal prosecution.\n\nThis is almost impossible to initiate constitutional reforms without changing the regime.\n\nUnder the brainwashing of the Chinese Communist Party for nearly 70 years, all Chinese have different degrees of brain damage. If you want to implement constitutional reform in China, the process will be quite long and there will be repeated iterations.\n\nIn particular, there is a Red Second-generation Power Group in China, which is a political group of extremist thoughts. The relationship between the group is very close and the energy is very strong. In a unified China, no matter what system is implemented, its influence and destructive power cannot be underestimated.\n\nMost of the fathers of this second generation are from poor areas of China. In a divided China, they can only have strong influence in some poor areas, and they will not have a great influence on developed areas, so their power will be Will naturally die out.\n\nIn ancient China, many countries were actually independent states. Especially in southern China, it is just a group of tribes. However, in the early days of these states, there was a co-sponsorship. As for why there was a co-pushing co-owner, when it appeared, it was impossible to know.\n\nA unified China was formed after a brutal war that took more than 500 years. China’s move to split is actually only a return to primitive justice, and there is no conflict with modern political civilization.\n\nEspecially in Tibet, Xinjiang, and now the three northeastern provinces, until the Ming Dynasty was not China's territory. Tibet is a very old independent country that became a vassal state during the Manchu period.\n\nThe United States’ attempt to help China develop its economy and then the CCP’s efforts to abandon the autocratic dictatorship has failed. There is no need to try again. The dictatorship of the CCP will not change.\n\nSplitting China can gain Russia's support, which is easier to achieve than trying to change the CCP's authoritarian system.\n\nRussia does not want to have a strong, unified, unreasonable country on its side, which poses a great threat to Russia. Without this Sino-US conflict, it will take another 20 years for Russia's Far East and even Siberia to have a lot of trouble. This point Russia should be very clear.\n\nAfter the communist revolution broke out in Russia, a large number of Russians fled to Shanghai, some of which lived in the 1950s and 1960s. It is believed that the independence movement from the Communist tyranny can gain the sympathy and support of the Russian people.\n\nSplitting China should start with Tibet. The US government should assist Tibetans in exile to pass on information to Tibet. Not only must we pass on information to the Tibetan people, but we must also pass on the information blocked by the CCP to the Chinese Communists in Tibet. We transmitted the corruption information of the CCP's top officials to the military and police of the Chinese Communist Party in Tibet, and transmitted information on the assets of the CCP's high-level overseas to the military and police of the Chinese Communist Party in Tibet.\n\nThe US government should also assist the Tibetan people in launching an armed uprising. Even short-term occupation of some towns in the border areas of Tibet is of great significance to the independence movement.",

It is only from the Yellow River Basin to the plain area south of the Yangtze River, and only to the west of Hunan. And there are a large number of state-owned countries, known as the 800 princes.\n\nThese states do not know why, nor do they know when they started, and they have a common communist. This co-owner has no jurisdiction over the states, but has the power to command the world.\n\nIf a state has no reason to attack other states, using modern language to launch aggression, or the king of a state is inexhaustible, and modern language is a large-scale humanitarian crisis in the country, then the co-owner has power. Commanded the world and jointly crusted.\n\nIt can be seen that the eradication of the country and the destruction of the country have been in line with natural justice in ancient China.\n\nThe democratic United States is the natural co-owner of course.

			"title": "Trump must try his best to split China and end China’s autocratic tradition forever.",
			"body": "The development of science and technology to this day has already met the conditions for ending the autocratic tradition of China in 2000. China’s autocratic tradition in 2000 has been unable to break, and it has its objective conditions, not just subjective ideology.\n\nThere is no unified sense of autocracy in southern China. In China's 2000 centralized authoritarian history, only one time was the southern army's attack into the north, that is, the overthrow of the first centralized regime, the Qin Dynasty. After countless other dynasties, the regimes that emerged throughout the South were reluctant to cross the Yangtze River and enter the North.\n\nChina’s grand unified autocratic centralization has always been established by the northern regime. The South cannot prevent the northern regime from establishing a grandiose dictatorship. This is for objective reasons. Now the objective conditions for establishing a centralized system of authoritarianism no longer exist. Therefore, Trump should try his best to split China and end China’s autocratic tradition forever.\n\nChina can generally be divided into the north and the south by the Yangtze River. Northern China mainly produces wheat and miscellaneous grains, while southern China mainly produces rice. The language of the North China is very similar, and the basics can be understood everywhere in the North. The languages ​​of the South China are completely different and cannot be understood by each other. This two parts of the north and the south are very different.\n\nThe northernmost part of southern China is the Yangtze River Delta. It is an alluvial plain and hilly area called “Jiangnan”, the most affluent area in traditional China.\n\nIn ancient times, the military camp was in a difficult situation. It was very difficult to recruit troops in the \"Jiangnan\" area. No one wants to give up the affluent life of \"Jiangnan\" to be a soldier.\n\nGoing south to the south of the South China Sea, it was called \"Baiyue\" in ancient times. There are many mountains in the Baiyue area, and there are countless groups of tribes. The language and customs are different. inconvenient traffic. In the north, \"Baiyue\" is a mountain, meaning it has not yet developed. In the Western language, they are all indigenous peoples. Therefore, it is more difficult to recruit troops in the \"Baiyue\" area.\n\nThe northern region is completely different, and recruitment in the northern region is very easy. As long as someone pays for the troops, it is easy to pull up a team. This should be related to the general poverty in the northern region. The military camp life of several gimmicks in the day can attract young people in the north.\n\nThis phenomenon began in the Eastern Han Dynasty with Liu Xiu's rebellion and continued into modern times.\n\nLiu Xiu is just an ordinary peasant. His family was blood-related to the royal family 200 years ago. The Liu Xiu generation is no longer wealthy and has no political status. However, it is such an ordinary landlord family that can recruit and build their own army. And soon it will be able to expand to the scale of confrontation with the central government.\n\nTherefore, in the autocratic history of 2000, it was difficult for the South to expand its military strength. It was difficult to collect hundreds of thousands of troops, and it was impossible to conquer the North and establish a unified regime. On the contrary, it is easy for North China to collect millions of troops.\n\nThis is the fundamental reason why the southern regime cannot resist the invasion of the northern regime and the southern regime cannot be independent for a long time.\n\nHowever, the development of modern science and technology has made war no longer rely solely on the number of people to win. The objective conditions for the pursuit of the unification of autocracy in the North China are no longer there. As long as China splits again, the South will be independent and will be permanently independent. The North has no longer been able to build a united country through military power.\n\nSplitting China will end China’s oriental autocracy forever.",
