			"body": "\nThe major feature of Trumpism Revolution is a total change of conventional political mentality since the fall of former Soviet Union, by clearly indicating that the atheism regime in mainland, China is the most serious threat against America and the whole civilization of the planet! \n\nBefore the coronavirus crisis, Donald Trump in fact mainly cared about the materiel interest, as manifested in many trade negotiations. \n\nAfter the Covid19 outbreak, Donald Trump gradually realized that an all-around conflict with the atheism gang of the FAKE CCP is inevitable.  \n\nThen after the nationwide voters fraud crimes occurred in the 2020 election, besides Donald Trump, the majority of American people began to see how terribly America has been infiltrated by the atheism culture pollution!\n\nDuring the cold war time, in order to better fight against the former Soviet Union, an **ambiguous strategy** was adopted by the USA on the definition of China — it's not an important matter whether it'd be represented by Republic of China that respects the modern civilization based on Three Principles Of The People as advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, or by Communism Dictatorship China which boasted itself to be a \"People's Republic of China\", but in fact tramped upon human rights like ants, and should better be defined as an atheism dictatorship jungle,  or at least NOT a republic, as could be seen by more and more people. \n\nIt's a special stage of history now. The 2020 Election is a life-or-death battle that concerns the fundamental security issue of America — whether the Constitutional System of America's Liberty can long endure or not!  \n\nThe Supreme Court rejected the lawsuit launched by Texas state. Marathon style lawsuit is part of the unrestricted warfare. \n\nIt requires long term efforts to Make America Great Again. In order to ensure that the bright course not be destroyed by other politicians who stole the election, now it's time to redefine Taiwan, or redefine China, by clearly stating that \n## **Taiwan represents the Republic of China; that America encourages a peaceful reunification of China based on the Three Principles Of The People as represented by Republic of China.  The Constitutional Democracy inherited by ROC was also firmly pursued by many Red Noblemen. One prominent example is Xi Zhong Xun, who was the father of Emperor Xi Ji Pin. **\n\nA clear clarification on the definition of Taiwan or Republic of China will help protect the fruitful results by many people's efforts under Trump administration in the past few years.  \n\nWith the clear redefinition done, if the 2020 Election would not be stolen by distorted means, then formal diplomatic relations could be prepared at the next stage.  Or even if there are too many obstacles on the way ahead, the clear clarification on Taiwan's representation of the Republic of China can help **reduce the corruptive maneuver space by other politicians** who tend to betray America secretly. \n\nWith the international structure justified, **the domestic battle [to resume Rule of Law in America ](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1B4vYHwkCywhjs3GMxFSvdCraYj5dh9LTV/?Topic:3_139mS7MVsytiqfvLcqkb4S1VKqDMhCXs8n/Taiwan+Redefinition+a+key+to+Trumpism+Revolution) \nwill see less obstacles** on the road ahead.\n\n",

In early 2020, Mr Ren Zhi Qiang was jailed for his criticism of Emperor Xi; then in late 2020, the world-famous former CEO of Alibaba Jack Ma was jailed, just due to his over-pride which resulted in Jack's satirical criticism of Chinese system\nhttps://posts.careerengine.us/p/5f959a4a9210f13fd81feb51 \n... ... \n(**There're no systematic risks in China, since there doesn't exist any System at all.**) \n\nSuch criticism is certainly correct. However, the more important point is that, **the way to fight back by criticism is WRONG**.  The jungle system doesn't deserve any criticism at all. \n## The situation should be changed by action, not by criticism.",

			"title": "Emancipation of mind — 1st step of American Revolution!",
			"body": "##Emancipation of mind — American Revolution \n— Restoration of American Constitution \n\nNo intervention of politics by military? There can be some **dangerous traps of mindset** by the distorted medias. \n  \nThe long tradition that **military people should not interfere with politics** is based on some prerequisite conditions:\n1) Those politicians themselves should **respect the principle of justice and transparency**;\n2) At least there're **NO crimes of treason against their motherland**, involved on any of those president candidates.\n\nThe special republic system is itself built by great military warriors 200 years ago, with military troops formed mainly by the Protestants who refuse the feudal system of semi-slavery dictatorship by British monarchs. \n\nThe American Federation was built by the forefathers such as Washington, Jefferson, etc., **at tremendous sacrifice of many people's blood and tears**.  At the early stage of the republic, those politicians certainly needn't worry about crimes of treason among any of them, despite so many deviations on the ruling and management of the republic, since the republic is an inseparable part of their life. Such patriotic sentiment is the same among all the people who fought brilliantly for the independence of America! \n\nNo matter how many disputes or arguments occurred at Capitol Hill 200 years ago, no one could imagine that any of the president candidates might be involved with crimes of treason against America!  \n\nToday's situation is totally different. \nIt's simple mathematics work to see that there exists huge scale of voters fraud! \n\n\"Simple Math\" Shows Biden Claims 13 MILLION More Votes Than There Were Eligible Voters Who Voted in 2020 Election \nhttps://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/12/breaking-huge-simple-math-shows-biden-claims-13-million-votes-eligible-voters-voted-2020-election/ \n\nBesides the unshakable evidence, there're many other phenomenal facts that can mutually prove each other as logical evidences. \nJoe Biden says he's built most extensive \"voter fraud\" org in history  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGRnhBmHYN0  \n\nFurthermore, there're tons of other evidences gathered up by so many American citizens that are enough to further prove the huge voters fraud, such as data manipulation, manmade malfunction by Dominion voting systems. \n\nBased on the large scale of abnormal facts and phenomena, the default prerequisite conditions that military people should not interfere politics don't exist, since the 2020 Election dispute is not an ordinary domestic political dispute, it's a special war against America, launched by some corruptive American politicians in secret collusion with foreign powers, with the most vicious purpose to overturn **American Constitution**! \n\nIt's a special type of **Unrestricted Warfare**, which was launched much earlier than the election event in November, with the coronavirus pandemics taken as a special weapon to cause chaos in American politics and society. \n\nAt such special stage of history, with unprecedented means of **Unrestricted Warfare** that has infiltrated American society seriously, accompanied by crazy coronavirus spreading to many places of the United States, if American people are still misled by some hypocrite politicians or vicious journalists that **the 2020 Election dispute is just an ordinary domestic issue, and that military people should not interfere politics,  then the entire system of American Constitution may be totally eroded by the corruptive and crazy devils** who have seriously polluted the purified land of America, which was once the most glorious free beacon on the planet!  \n\nAs a speculative merchant, Donald Trump may be good at bankruptcy operation of corporation management in order to maximize the commercial interest.  But **American Constitution** should not be run with bankruptcy speculation. \n\nIn short, for American people, there's no way to retreat further.  If **American Constitution** can be easily insulted or overturned by a large scale voter fraud, and those military people don't take it as a dangerous war, but **simply take it as a small political joke that military should not interfere, then there will be many more disasters to occur on the land of USA …  **\n\nDonald Trump once said that if he failed, then \"China\" would own the United States.  There're some mistakes in Donald Trump's outlook on the world, which should better be rectified, so as to fight back the Unrestricted War more efficiently.  \n\nAs can be seen by many people, in East Asia, the so-called \"People's Republic of China\" is NOT a republic at all, it treated Chinese people like ants, and poisoned American people like mice. It should better be defined as an atheism dictatorship jungle, but **NEVER as a republic**. The traditional sense of \"China\" often refers to Republic of China, as represented by Taiwan.  **The \"Republic of China\" never keeps any vicious purpose to own, occupy the territory of America's land, or to  poison American people or pollute America's society**. \n\nSo there's no way to retreat for American people. Instead, they'd fight back, by uniting up both ordinary citizens and military people, since it's a **special war — an Unrestricted War**, NOT just a small domestic political dispute on the 2020 Election! \n\nBoth Donald Trump and Joe Biden are speculative politicians, not perfect choices as president candidates.  \nCompared with other politicians for the time being, the best advantage of Donald Trump is that there're **no treason crimes against America**, despite so many faults and mistakes committed by Trump. \n\n\nIvanka Trump once boasted that her father Donald Trump was a great warrior. \n\n**If they don't want to insult the honor of a warrior, or humiliate the centuries-long glory of America's Constitution, an effective counterattack should be launched in January, to punish those betrayers of the federal republic. **\n\n[50 K limit to be avoided! & code to enhance Browsing … ](http://127.0.0.1:43110/zybbs.bit/?Topic:6_1PUkWFbzkD4dyRZ2vH3G8WeQw4m2UVPA2p/a+Special+code+related+to+trackers)\n",
