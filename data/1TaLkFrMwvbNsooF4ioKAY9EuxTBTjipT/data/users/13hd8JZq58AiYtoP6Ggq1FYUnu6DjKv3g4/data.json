The same strategy that is being implemented in US is being implemented here. Journalists that are exposing this are being banned from social media and some of them are being arrested. These are journalist that did not commit any crime, they simply exposed the communist strategies. Most people don’t understand this. They are losing their ability to think. Here in Brazil is much worst than in the US. Our most important journalist has left our country last week so he could share some information about our Supreme Court, which is one the most powerful arms of the communist China in Latin America.\n\nI just have to say that this virus send from China was a very successful move for them.\n\nhttps://criticanacional.com.br/2020/08/02/journalist-allan-dos-santos-reports-brazilian-supreme-court-coup-detat-against-president-jair-bolsonaro/",
