But, my feeling is that governments should have the power to restrain people to save lives.  That's why we lock up murders.  I wish I lived in a country where people were intelligent enough to quarantine themselves, but I don't.  I know it's not my decision to make, but personally, I would very much prefer to be under house arrest for the next six months that to face a risk of dieing of as high as 8%.\n\nOh, common, the risk is realistically like 0.1% And by the way, for example, in Germany, every day 2600 people die. And this is completely normal. Germany's population is roughly 80 million, humans live on average like 80 years, therefore, every year a million people die in Germany. This makes about 2700 every day! There is in fact no reason for house arrest.",
