There have been reported issues with the old Firefox forks (icecat/iceweasel and similar).Can you post a thread/board that doesn't work?\n\nIt used to work months ago.  Just within past few months the boards just show up as grey.  I'll post a screenshot now.  1: https: //anonymousfiles.io/Kvbucy8J/   2: https: //anonymousfiles.io/tWYjAmM3/  Like even if I seed an entire board nothing will show.  If I click catalogue I can see what recent threads that have been started but not ever be able to see them.",

I don't normally boot into zeronet but when I do I have to wait like around 4-8 hours to see all posts from large volume sites like millchan. (mind you I go offline for months at a time and load zeronet off a usb portable hard drive on a machine that is 8 years old) [...]\n\nI've left my computer on for 2 days and still same thing.  :(",
