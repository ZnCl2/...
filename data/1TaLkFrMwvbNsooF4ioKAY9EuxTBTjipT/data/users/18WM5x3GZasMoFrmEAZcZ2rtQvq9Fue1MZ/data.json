In the first film Joker is a sadic guy without any objective apart bring pain and death to Gotham City. In my opinion the two versions of Joker reflect how USA see his enemies in 2008 (terrorist that attacked the Twin Towers \"without a reason\" apart religion) and in 2019 (Paris and other Europe and USA terrorist attacks caused by muslims that lived in degradated suburbs)",
