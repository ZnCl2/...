If these countries refuse to cooperate they get sanctions or political destablization like what happened in Belarus. Despite all that regular people are trying to live free... but then the compromised government sends out the covid police and treat them inhumanely to force them back in. Unfortunately we are dealing with real tyranny and this way of life is being imposed regardless of what anyone thinks.",
