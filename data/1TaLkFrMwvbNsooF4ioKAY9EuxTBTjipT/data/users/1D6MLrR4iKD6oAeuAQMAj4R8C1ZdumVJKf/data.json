You can install apps like wordpress,peertube,mastodon,nextcloud,etc(there are lot more, see the complete list here https://yunohost.org/#/apps). If you want to learn to host your own server, then also YunoHost is better way to learn and experiment.\n\nDidn't know about this before. Thanks. I'll try it out on a virtual env.",
