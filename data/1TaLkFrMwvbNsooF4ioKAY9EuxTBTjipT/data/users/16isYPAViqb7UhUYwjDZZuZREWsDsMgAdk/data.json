				"body": "You say,\n\n\"[Tutanota] does not encrypt subject lines because that hasn't been standardized yet (standardization or privacy - which is more important?)\"\n\nsorry dude that's **incorrect**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom: https://tutanota.com/security/\n\nEncrypted emails to anyone.\n\nTutanota uses symmetric (AES 128) and asymmetric encryption (AES 128 / RSA 2048) to encrypt emails end-to-end. When both parties use Tutanota, all emails are automatically end-to-end encrypted (asymmetric encryption). For an encrypted email to an external recipient, a password for encrypting & decrypting the email (symmetric encryption) must be exchanged once.\n\nTutanota’s automatic encryption works easily on all devices, even mobile. Tutanota automatically encrypts\n\n    **subject line, content and all attachments of an email,**\n    address book,\n    inbox rules / filters,\n    and the search index.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nsee also,\n\n\"https://securityheaders.com/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.tutanota.com%2F\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd...\n\nTLS encryption\n\nHighest level of TLS encryption with STARTTLS, PFS, DNSSEC, DANE, DMARC, and DKIM.\n\nOn top of its automatic end-to-end encryption, Tutanota uses STARTTLS with an extended validation certificate, Perfect Forward Secrecy, DNSSEC, DANE, DMARC, and DKIM to secure your connection to Tutanota to the maximum.\n\nCheck here for more info on Tutanota’s TLS encryption.\n\nTutanota uses strict CSP (Content Security Policy), an HTML sanitizer for showing unknown content (in emails) to prevent XSS-attacks, and, by default, does not load external content from other servers (pictures and videos in emails).\n\nCheck here to see how Tutanota scores on SSL Labs and on Securityheaders.io.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd...\n\n\"Privacy made in Germany\n\nGermany has one of the strictest data protection laws.\n\nData privacy regulations in the European Union (EU) are among the strictest in the world, and among all European member states, Germany has one of the strongest policies: the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz). The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was in large parts designed based on the German Federal Data Protection Act.\n\nThis law protects users of Internet services. It puts the user in charge of what should be done with their data: Companies (=we) are not allowed to collect any personal information without express permission from an individual (=you), (e.g. name, date of birth, IP address).\n\nIn addition, in Germany there is no law that could force us to submit to a gag order or to implement a backdoor.\n\nYou can find details about German data protection laws on our blog and in our Transparency Report.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd...\n\nData stored in Germany\n\nTutanota stores all data encrypted in highly secure data centers in Germany.\n\nAll data in Tutanota is stored end-to-end encrypted on our own servers in ISO 27001 certified data centers in Germany. No one has access to our servers except our permanent administrators, who need to pass multiple-factor-authentication before gaining access. All productive systems are monitored 24/7 for unauthorized access and extraordinary activity.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd...\n\nCommitted to open source\n\nFree and open source emails for everyone.\n\nTutanota focuses on security and privacy. To us, open source is essential to achieve both. We have published the Tutanota web client and both Android and iOS Apps as open source software on GitHub.\n\nThis way everyone can check the code and verify that there are no bugs in the code base. By being open source potential bugs can be noticed and fixed much faster than it is the case with closed source applications.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you're going to start a thread you should at least start by knowing the *facts* & base your point of view or criticism of something on what you *know* to be facts rather than what you *think* or *feel* otherwise you will make yourself look ignorant.\n\nIf it matters to you so much you could setup your *own* mail server to use with PGP.\n\nAlso, there was a comment about self-hosted email servers being difficult to setup. That's only partly true. Again, all the information is available at your finger tips, if you've got the inclination,\n\nHow to Easily Set Up a Full-Featured Mail Server on Ubuntu 18.04 with iRedMail\n\nhttps://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/ubuntu-18-04-iredmail-email-server\n\nYou title your thread \"There is no good e-mail option\" but you don't state the criteria for what you consider to be a technically *good* email service. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis reply isn't intended to harm yours or anyone else's rep here on 0net. \n\nIt's *not* a personal attack. \n\nI'm not shooting you down or trying to start beef with you, I'm only encouraging you to be informed before making baseless statements. \n\nTherefore I won't reply to any shit posting or any other BS replies just because people feel a little bit high on censorship-free communication. Have a nice day. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
