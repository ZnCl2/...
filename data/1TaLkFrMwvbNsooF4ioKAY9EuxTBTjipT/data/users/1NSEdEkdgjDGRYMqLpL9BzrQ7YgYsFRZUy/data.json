			"body": "#Article11\n\nArticle 11 – the #linktax is an effort of corporate lobbing. It gives extra copyrights to press, requiring a license from the publisher for anyone who would like to use even the shortest fragment from a press relies or an article – this also refers to link snippets (the title, description and picture in a link). In effect Article 11 will kill all independent media and online polemic.\n#Article13\n\nArticle 13 – the #uploadfilters dumps the responsibility for posts & comments from the authors to the owners of the websites. It offers a tool to help the owners of website to filter the content – a filtering IT infrastructure that all website will need to connect to. This filter will censor all content which will consider that violate copyrights before the post or comment will go public. \n\nSource: https://www.stopacta2.org/en/\n \nHELP TO STOP ACTA 2 !!!!!",
