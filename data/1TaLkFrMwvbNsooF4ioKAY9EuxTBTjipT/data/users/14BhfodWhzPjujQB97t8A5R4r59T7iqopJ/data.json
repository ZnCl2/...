They want you to post there so they can collect your IP address. Why do you think they banned most VPNs?\n/b/ is off-limits to janitor positions.. and people wonder why? ;)\n>And why do you think they hated 8chan so much? Because the owners are free speech absolutists, collaborated with authorities only when strictly necessary and allowed most VPNs and Torposting. That's a big no-no for glowies.\n\nit's amazing how so-called democratic countries **hate** freedom of speech.",
