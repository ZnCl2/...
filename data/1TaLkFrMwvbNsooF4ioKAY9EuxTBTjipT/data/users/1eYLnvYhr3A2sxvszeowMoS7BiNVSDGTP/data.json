			"body": "Hey everybody, I just finished deploying my ethershuffle game to the ethereum main network. The decentralized app is located at https://ethershuffle.com. What's more, the first game has completed! You can read the smart contract here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6d69fcb28c9fcc9e9d39e3608190b24f4df295e7 and even see the 4 lucky winners (yes 4 players win each game!) get their winnings on this transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfb0127df8e33f1034ee52e7bb9615e0c600fd370f78a95276cc84533730cb3b3. The Dapp works on MetaMask, Cipher Browser, Toshi, Trust Wallet and Mist. But you can still use other wallets like MyEtherWallet by sending 0.1 ETH to the contract address while increasing the gas limit to 200,000. The contract observers do a pretty good job of processing each game and distributing the winnings back to players automatically (that's right, you don't have to pay gas for withdraws like in other blockchain games/exchanges).",
