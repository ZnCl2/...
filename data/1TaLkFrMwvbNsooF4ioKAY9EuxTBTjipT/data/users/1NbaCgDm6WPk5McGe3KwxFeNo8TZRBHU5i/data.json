Looks like Iran was so embarrassed that this happened that they stopped the rocket launches. And that's not to mention the stampedes that occurred during Solemanis funeral.Â This isn't even the first time a plane like that gets shot down while flying over a war zone. 2014 with Malaysia Airlines.\n\nLike this ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSSwt9YeDHY",
