Some people come and don't care for it.\n\nThere are numerous ways of getting in trouble in China.  A lot of people resent westeners a hatred which is fed by almost every movie that the government produces.\n\nIn the nightclub scene a lot of Chinese hate westeners for taking the prettiest women.  They'll approach you offer to buy you drinks and when you are quite drunk, then they'll kick the shit out of you.\n\nThen there is the government and the police themselves.  They're behind most of the crimes.  If you displease somebody in government, for any reason, they can make life very hard for you.  The authorities themselves will vandalize your property, kill your pet, etc.  The Communist system has no feedback mechanism so there is no where to complain.\n\nIf you want to communicate with others, all communications are heavily monitored by state agencies.  If you go to church and make friends there, the government will be deciding who you are allowed to be friends with and what you can talk about.  If they don't like who you are talking to they'll block all telephone or chat communication.\n\nChina is not a good place.  If you stay there long enough, you'll realize that.",

Anyone can watch them, even you youtube.  Always shitting on westeners and Japanese.\n\n>Do your part to make the world a better place and jump off a high place.\n\nWhy would you be so upset by what I said? Maybe because what I said is true and you are a shill.  I hope you choke on the 垃圾油 which you have with every single meal you eat.",
