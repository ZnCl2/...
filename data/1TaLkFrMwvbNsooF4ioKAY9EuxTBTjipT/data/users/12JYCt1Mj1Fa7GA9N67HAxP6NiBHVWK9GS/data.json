Any kind of payment that is only processed via a single company creates a monopoly, as a result policies end up hurting the end users.  Crypto is a decentralized idea and method allowing freedom of users away from a centralized banking system...  Q would be self contained, like a company offering a product / service, at any point the policies can change to reflect a new direction of the company which the end users MUST follow...  If anyone argues with a company they are often simply kicked off the service or charged very high fees.   Decentralized systems is the future and in my opinion a system like Q is a huge step backward...  Crypto solves a very real problem, however decentralized systems often are the enemy of the standard business model as resources, services, and future planing are basically nullified...",

One of the issues is that once a wallet is created and you use such to except payments anyone can see all the transactions if viewed on the Block chain. \n\nCreating new crypto wallets per transaction requires a program like Python to process all the data.\nThe other main issue is that you need to have a way to receive a form to except order and payment data.\n\nA person can easily scan a QR code and pay you... however you have to still receive the order data to fill any orders which means everything must go to a data base / spreadsheet...  Also you need to associate the crypto payment with a specific individual along with their order data...\n\nA database / JSON file can be used to except form data...  But the next issue is preventing individuals from spamming you...

EVERY aspect you touched on I have considered; FURTHERMORE, I have NOT explained HOW I am going about developing my program and payment method.\n\nBefore you jump to conclusions and make an issue of a persons ability understand everything about the subject...\n\nI do NOT have the energy to explain every step on how a person can except crypto payments...\n\nIn theory anyone can setup a store on Zeronet...   however there would be restrictions...\n\n1.)

The complexity is actually what stops a great many from developing a store.\n\nAnytime you have an anonymous service that has a form submission there is NO way to prevent spamming to that submission form...   A third party form processing method that prevents spamming abuse is required... some only allow individuals to submit 1 time per form...\n\nYou can put an image of anything you wish to sell with a QR code with the proper amount of crypto right beside what you are selling...  The problem is keeping track of order information...  You can have people pay you but there is no way other then using a form submission method to keep track of content and shipping information...

No I am not creating a plugin, but the issues are very similar.\n\nZeroNet allows a command line line option to create and update a website...  Create a Zeronet site then place your files and folders within such...  the do a command line update to see your files...\n\nBasically a block chain is a ledger and such does not actually hold much data...  it is NOT a file system, simply a pointer to the files...  The block chain is distributed but not the files...  For instance you can use IPFS and pin your data for up to 24 hours but after that the data is deleted...  the ledger still remains but the data is no longer...\n\nCrypto payments really only hold the value and some allow for a very limited amount of text, but it is NOT a file system to store data...   The storage of data issue is currently being worked on by companies...  You can store some data to the block chain using bitcoin, I have seen an example but it is only a paragraph or less of text.\n\nZeroNet if they allow visitors to host their own data bas(es) of bought items / services running a python script in the background for processing purposes and share their .onion address with the seller...  The seller could simply get that data base and process their order(s)...  Seller has items, ZeroNet users visits their site clicks a link and copies their requested items / services via a data base from the seller with current prices etc...  ZeroNet user's script then creates a unique data base via their command line ZeroNet create function with it freshly created QR codes and cold wallet(s)...  If a web page with a form is pointing to the newly created data base it can be filled out and no one will spam their own data base...  So security issues is really not an issue...  The Seller would need to know the .onion address of the buyer to collect the order... makes sense?  ... perhaps the Seller would have to find a way for the buyer to submit their .onion address to reach their ZeroNet account...\n\nAlternatively a python program can be created to handle all the processing like what I am working on currently.\n.",

To be clear the program I am writing is completely independent from ZeroNet.  I am however using ZeroNet to promote.\n\nMy program actually will create cold storage wallets for Bitcoin, Litcoin, and Ethereum and the end user funds those wallets...   The wallets are generated on their computer / cell phone and the private key for the wallets are sent to me via a standard web form allowing only 1 submission per person.  The individual uses their cell phone and scans the QR code and pays for the produce and or service...  Mainly paying for Twitter lists in my case...\n\nMost of the program code I already have...\n\nIn regards to excepting payment via ZeroNet a Python script or complete program can be created ... BUT... anything that requires processing that for example that would be done by .php is much harder under ZeroNet...\n\nIf ZeroNet could run .py scripts then security issues would be a big sticking point...  Anyone can include a .py or .pyc file within their ZeroNet account directory but running such means the individual has to call python.exe from the browser if that is even possible to run the program...   I don't know if that is even possible.\n\nZeroNet as a static website works but anything dynamic requires either PHP or Python hosted elsewhere...",

				"body": "I have been working on this problem...\n\n\nDistributing a file / program is fairly easy, but having the PEERS and SEED is another issue.\n\n\nIntergalactic File Server can host your file and create a link to that file from ZeroNet as it will be required!\n\n\nThe problem with the distributed applications is excepting payment...  If you attach your program to any 3rd party you HAVE to follow their rules and regulations as well as any rules an regulations that 3rd party service has imposed on it by other companies / governments.\n\n\nAs long as you have to depend on another service there will ALWAYS be problems!\n\n\n1.  Sharing files and programs is fairly easy...  host file and link to such\n2.   Excepting Crypto payment is fairly easy...  Create a QR code with the amount expected.\n3.   Displaying an image of an item or service is fairly easy with the QR code beside it...\n4.   Creating a JAVA script shopping cart is not too hard\n\n\n*** Processing the order is the hard part, you need to associate the amount you receive in crypto to what is being sold and the quantity...  Essentially you would need an HTML form that submits your order data to a NON-decentralized server...  This becomes problematic as you would need to follow 3rd party rules and regulations. \n\n\nHackers WILL spam HTML forms, this is a HUGE problem!...   What this means is that a 3rd party / company has to be used.   Unless you use TOR hidden service (web server) AND some way to reduce or prevent your HTML form from being spammed you have a REAL issue.\n\n\nIf you are using a program written in Python for example you can create a self contained order system RATHER then using a typical web page to take and process orders...  Also you can generate UNIQUE crypto wallets for every order...  All data get encrypted and made into a block of text that gets sent... perhaps via EMAIL ...  Protonmail seems the best way...  There will be a manual component for the processing of orders...\n\n\nI was initially thinking using Google Forms would be a good solution... but buyers wound NEED a gmail account to prevent spamming to a google form...   Some people do NOT like Google!  ...  I thought if #Mentions could be sent with 280 chars to my Twitter account then that would be fine, but the problem is that Twitter is a BS company who disables accounts for BS reasons and tells long term users to F off...   As well as requiring everyone to submit their cellular phone numbers...  Talking about PUSHY!\n\n\nPerhaps sending data to a ZeroNet  ZeroTalk cloned site that gets \"scraped\" by a Python program is an alternative.  For a PC user this could be done but the sending of data from the program / app would need a reverse API to be created or at lest access to the web form through ZeroTalk clone.\n\n\nIn my opinion I think that the above 1. - 3.  is the BEST METHOD FOR SELLING...  Use a static website with static QR codes ... use a 3rd party website to process the form data...  Only share the PUBLIC ADDRESS(es) to sell products and or services...\n\n\nSometimes SIMPLE is better!\n\n\nLater,  :)",

				"body": "A came across ZeroNet about 2 years ago but there was not enough nodes available to mirror my site...  I didn't get the overall idea but I get it now!   1 ZeroNet address can point to MANY different locations, if a single node (computer) is down that address still points to the correct data on another persons computer.\n\n\nIPFS for instance does not work the same way as ZeroNet does...  To run IPFS for example you need to run a dedicated server that can be reached, if that server goes down you will not be able to get to the data or website.\n\n\nThe old issue of DNS is actually the REAL issue in question...  How do I know where to connect and will that connection still remain solid and not change on me...\n\n\nDNS = pointer to webserver\n\n\nA DNS or Dynamic DNS allows for the IP of a computer / network system keep a domain attached...   Also for individuals who setup a personal server a Dynamic DNS simply updates your current IP address if and when it changes...   This method of tracking where a server location is centralized.\n\n\nSo the idea of using a ledger / block chain was used to keep track of where a computer was located...  It is intended to replace DNS to some extent...  However domain names depend on a centralized network + DNS to function...\n\n\nSo logically the fist thought is using IPFS, this is fine if you have a stable and dedicated server / network...  But if you are an individual this is NOT good enough...  If your server goes down that data is NOT reachable!  ...  A corporation can mirror and redirect traffic but again this is temporary...  24 hours is the maximum you can pin data to the IPFS block chain... after that it gets purged.   So if you think you can upload a website or files to the IPFS and think you will be able to reach it beyond a day or two you would be wrong...\n\n\nBlock chain is only a ledger functioning similarly to a DNS server were everyone simply by default views the same ledger to locate a file or website...  the ledger is distributed amount those who use it...  but keep in mind that ledger / block chain that everyone shares has a limit on its size...  So storing data on it simply is not realistic... \n\n\nA lot of people do not understand that you do NOT store data to a ledger / block chain such is only a pointer to where your files are stored on a standard web server, distributed or not...\n\n\nZeroNet fixes a great many issues...   A distributed system to mirror sites and files...  Share my site by visiting and I will visit your site and we can mirror each other content...  If you don't like my content for any number of reasons delete such...  If you have 20 visitors who like your content they will mirror your site and you will have your content almost always available to any one who visits your site...  That is cool...   Even more cool then IPFS by itself!\n  \nLater,",

This is problematic if there is no one hosting your required files for your website.  There is a seed option available for the .Dat websites, but it is a commercially controlled service...  They pick and choose what THEY feel is except able...   You could create a .dat website and share it or have the files made available and tell people to point their browser to a URL hosting your file...  OR... have a computer acting like a server, keeping a node available...  Due to the general lack of people the Beakerbrowser concept breaks down...  On the other hand if you wanted to make a truly private market place you could create a very simple list of items each with a QR code for a Bitcoin wallet with the amount of the item in Bitcoin...  You would need to calculate the amount of Bitcoin from USD to Bitcoin for example...   Image of item for sale along with a simple write up and to the right of that a single QR code...  and repeat the process... You get the idea... :)  ... It is not a perfect solution but it can work...  Monthly change your .Dat website and use unique QR codes / wallets... You WILL need to have a html form to process the order data, but NOT the actual receiving of payment...   A person can use their cellphone to scan the QR code for each item and pay manually... OR... if they are viewing your .data website on their cellphone they can click on the URL of the QR code and let their cellphone crypto app handle their payment...   Yet again you need the data from the html form for the processing of the order but not to accept payment if you are looking to create a secret market place...  ;)\n\nYou can do the very same thing using ZeroNet, a simple program can be easily created using Python to process order data...  Creating PRIVATE crypto wallets and having your buyers fund those wallets THEN send you the private key(s) to pay for their orders seem an alternative way to do private transactions...

ZeroNet has a community of people who are continually being introduced to your ZeroNet site and once they visit they also host your site...   Beaker by default does not have a seed, rather you need to go to a commercially controlled site where THEY deiced if they will act as the super seed to make your .dat site available...

If you introduce running a Blog website on a regular style website and point people to your .dat website then the whole process is self defeating... why use the .dat website...   So then you say well I have just created a website and need to host it because once I'm off line my site is not available...

				"body": "np, I thought initially that Beakerbrowser was an excellent idea as well as IPFS...  I have looked at how I could host a simple website that was either on a blockchain or distributed via a network...  I had learned that such was not nearly as simple as what a great many people claim.\n\nI REALLY like the idea of Beakerbrowser and it certainly has its place...  Suppose you want to sell an item or items to an individual that was targeted to that person...  In theory if you knew how to create crypto wallets and QR codes for such you in theory could if you had buyers for a product and or service send them a different copy of your website so that purchases could be made easily...  But that means individuals would need to contact you directly and leave their contact information...  Then perhaps you could generate from a template a unique .dat website using something like Python...  What that means is that every item could have a unique Bitcoin, Litecoin, and or Etherium wallet for every item...  A QR code can be created...  They simply send the PRIVATE KEY of the wallet to the seller via a web form or perhaps an email address...  protonmail or throw away email address is perhaps useful...  If you require your buyers to download a small registration software displaying items within such you would not need to have a website to sell from rather a Python program / frozen binary..\n\nMore and more I had looked at both Beakerbrowser and ZeroNet more I saw that form processing was lacking...  It is not that you cannot create web forms for both, rather all data would be public to see...   Suppose I wanted to create a web form on either one and I tell you to fill out a web from, without server side processing using PHP you could NOT send me data...  It would mean that you would need to be authorized to change a file or database on my end...  If you wanted to publish something using ZeroNet you NEED to sign for it...   But you could NOT sign for data which was sent to me for example, such is NOT possible...   I could create a forum on ZeroNet and you and I could send data via such, BUT that would NOT be private...  Perhaps if you and I encrypted the data in a private folder within a ZeroNet data folder and we both used something like Python / Pycryptodome to read the URL(s) you and I could for example simply update our own file(s) which the other person reads...  Yet again you could NOT sign to publish content on my end, or could I do the same on my end...   There is a fair amount of complexity...\n\nIn my opinion both Beakerbrower and ZeroNet should simple be a jump point to introduce content with the viewers downloading a signup program.  There would be no requirement for PHP to run if you are using something like Python...   There is a web portal for ZeroNet for example my site....\n\nhttps://0net.io/1FUZX5q3YshUGRT95WzCCLrhwFqS3pdPSx/\n\nSo if you wanted to have a decentralized website open to the regular web you could...  Download a registration software seems useful...   The PHP and server side BS can end and a more decentralized method can go more common place...\n\n\nWhat do you think?",

Or is there a fundamental difference?\n\nYes there is a fundamental difference...  Traffic of people who would initially come across your content.  If no one see your .dat website as there is NO community of people who are simple just checking out new stuff it becomes a REAL issue...  With a .dat website the other people who visit do not automatically mirror / seed your site...  Your computer needs to be on 24/7...  \n\nHashBase acts like a SUPER SEED, but keep in mind that is a COMMERCIALLY controlled setup...  You need to follow a VERY strict set of rules and regulations...  HashBase basically is acting like a web server which also seeds the .dat files of your website.   If HashBase deciedes that you BROKE their rules, terms, arbitrary decisions, and data limits your MAIN seed goes down...  This means NO one will be able to get to your website UNLESS you have a dedicated seed...  Even then, for what I understand, the seeding of .dat files is .torrent based meaning even if you have seeds such may not be enough for everyone to see / access your .dat website...\n\nZeroNet handles the above issues by simply making all viewers of a ZeroNet website a server / seed and if someone does not want to follow they simply delete / remove that visited site....  It is not perfect but solves the above issues...  \n\nZeroNet strictly speaking does NOT use Blockchain...   But does use a ledger system and in may way is superior in file management and easy of usage.   The main problem with ZeroNet is that you cannot create PRIVATE accounts where the data is safe...  You can include a .py file within your ZeroNet folder of your site then update your site and get the url / address and download then run it if you have python installed on your computer...  But that is a potential security issue even if you have a really good virus software as developers can put nearly anything into that code.\n\nEven a virtual machine running software in not fully safe...

				"body": "Yes, I am running into that issue bringing my Gab bot into the market place.\n\n\nWhen we talk about decentralized systems like ZeroNet but exclude the freedom of using custom coding a quick realization comes very quickly that we have limits set on us...   ZeroNet does have an API but to a Python programmer such is EXTREMELY limiting.   On the other hand ZeroNet needs to protect it's user base and a wide open Python environment is also not a good idea as misc dangerous code can be ran, also not good!   ...  ZeroNet would take on a huge liability and trust in the overall ZeroNet system would be greatly limited or even totally lost...\n\n\nUltimately creating modular systems is required along with something like ZeroNet...  A module or independence program / app can be installed separately pointing the the correct file location within a ZeroNet user folder...   The benefit of this is that a user can un install such from their computer, cell phone, and or tablet.  Such can also be scanned by a virus / security scanner.\n\n\nEven the PRIVATE KEY can be scanned in by the software but signing such is required under the ZeroNet system.  It is actually fairly complex...\n\n\nDynamic content that can except a web form needs PHP processing which is server side.  If you are trying to take orders for a product or service this is VERY problematic. \n\n\nTry creating a simple shopping cart under ZeroNet...  You can create a simple one using Javascript but submitting such requires PHP or server side scripting, such does not work for client end processing...  Perhaps the ONLY way I know how such can be down is having orders sent to an email address...  Providing the email servers allow for an un secure connection.... Spam can be an issue. \n\n\nMy program when completed will generate a cold storage wallet to be funded via the PUBLIC KEY (QR Code) and the buyer would simply scan in the QR code and allow their cell phone software, most likely coinbase account to fund the proper amount...   Then my program will send me the PRIVATE KEY so I can receive payment...  After payment has been received the product or service can be processed, mailed out, or a software link can be provided.\n\n\nKeep in mind suppose you want to sell stuff excepting crypto as payment is actually a good concept! ... Hosting a site on ZeroNet makes it much harder for someone to arbitrarily shut down your site for either political or for commercial interests that are hostile to your product and or service...   Setting up a \"Black Market Place\" to sell standard legal items and services is in my opinion a good idea as the Sellers have a stable market place that is very hard to shut down...   If you were selling t-shirts and a competitor complained or got trolls and or black hat hackers to damage your rep or attack your website such is a very bad thing...  Try doing that with ZeroNet and the ability to generate cold storage wallets to sell items...  Coinbase will only see unique crypto wallets per every transaction and nothing else plus onlookers to the PUBLIC wallet address would not see very much transactions...  Excepting payments MUST also be accompanied by a web form's shopping cart data to define items, quantities, and misc data to complete an order...   sending an email with such data is fairly easy...  Proton mail and throw away email accounts could also be used, but knowing the throw away email address would need to be collected first if that option was picked...\n\n\nThis was my conclusion in setting up a business website...  Show images of my program and allow the individual to register via my program...  After they register via my program a QR code to Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Etherium would be generated so the buyer could scan such with their cell phone OR simply click on a hyperlink if they are using a PC so their PC crypto software could fund one of those accounts...  A wait of up to 12 hours will happen but both the payment and order data can be received fairly easily,  even if only by email to retrieve the order data by a html or txt file.\n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\nLater,  :)",

The core team has a special FR granted distributed co-op legal entity (SCIC). It's legit. Both ways.\n\nVery Cool, is there a way for me to use Python to read and write data to the blockchain...  Also every blockchain to register an address requires some crypto backing it, is this so?  ...  Also blockchains being digital ledgers usually do not hold much data and point to file locations hosted on distributed servers, does Ark embed its data directly on the blockchain?   If not does the data services associated with the blockchain use standard file systems.   IPFS can pin data for 12 hours, but after that even though the address is registered the content is not available...  At least 1 seed needs to be on 24/7 pointing to the data...   Does Ark work differently?\n\nThanks,  :)",

If all the blockchain nodes run the IPFS plugin, it will have plenty of seeds by default. Which brings to mind sharing of those hashes across projects for extra distribution.\n\nSince freedom of speech seems to be an issue and corporation are pulling content from people for random and sometimes made up reasons, what assurance does users have that Ark would not be pressured to close accounts created on their systems???  ...  Was under the impression a decentralized system meant protection of data / freedom of expression (which seems to be under attack) so why is the term blockchain used to express such when it is actually as centralized as what a system can be?  ... I understand the crypto usage but controlling data seems some what pointless...   I can create a Bitcoin address and fund such and add funds to it for next to no expense, however the TRUE expense is when a company BUNDLES a ftp/sftp server along with a blockchain...  A company does NOT really need to use other blockchain solutions...  It is the name conflict issues as being the real reason for generating a random string of numbers and text as seen in standard PUBLIC / PRIVATE KEYS...\n\nDistributed systems using a digital ledger having a blockchain address to prevent name conflicts for tracking makes perfect sense...  But consider this ZeroNet is currently doing the same thing...  3rd party programs seem the next logical step for ZeroNet...  I am NOT anti corporation, however for the purpose of securing data and real freedom of expression anyone can complain about anything and corporations don't want to have legal action taken against them so content is pulled and excuses are made to cover corporations asses!\n\nZeroNet yet again is NOT perfect but addressing problems and understanding such completely will help users and developers further the ZeroNet identity and interests...\n\nJust some random thoughts, thanks :)",

There is no way to 'close accounts'.Plus you get Ark shares simply by voting with your balance for a delegate, all while you sleep with computer off.\n\nrobione to you fully decentralized means the servers and service is using a distributed sever network using a block chain to provide a digital ledger to where the data is located.  Actual data locations are pointed to via the digital ledger, that data resides on the Ark servers...  <<< NOT fully decentralized, nice try!... \n\n\nTo someone who is concerned with freedom of expression and corporation pulling content unjustly, companies that offering services like Ark sound nice...  HOWEVER, a single company still holds your data and users MUST follow their terms of usage...  Anyone for any reason can complain and get accounts suspended and banned for a great many vague reason...  Twitter, Facebook, and a wide range of other social media companies sell out their users daily IF there is enough money involved.\n\n\nTo me Ark being a company mouthing the words seems a little late when people's TRUST in companies are being called into question!",

If it's original, then starting from BitTorrent might be the worst choice, but with movies, it is the best choice because of the seeders already present.\n\nPopular files stay reliant and thus they are seeded by more people...\n\n\nGoogle Drive could be used to have a centralized file share system...  Create a Google Drive and make your files available by generating a PUBLIC URL to your files...  This will work just fine if you are the owner of the content or you can get banned! \n\n\nYou could try uploading your files / videos to Intergalactic File Server on ZeroNet, but keep in mind 2GB files are VERY large...  ZeroNet users mirror content because site are fairly small and not overly complex.  Asking people to host 2GB files means that they use up valuable space on their hard drive(s) or SSD(s)...  PLUS the bandwidth that they pay for to their Internet provider...\n\n\nWorst choice comment regarding .torrent files seems a little weak to me...   You can create a ZeroNet site for every 2GB file and ask people to help seed your content per file...   You would need to indicate the huge file size that needs to be hosted.\n\n\nLater,",
