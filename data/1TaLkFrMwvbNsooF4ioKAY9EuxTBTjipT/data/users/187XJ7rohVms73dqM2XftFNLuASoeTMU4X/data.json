The company is asking you to do this cuz USDT is a stable coin. This way they deposit money into an exchange and simply transfer it globally without worrying about volatility in the market. But... I you find yourself in a posistion where you have the ability to decide other payments. Then personally i would consider NANO over btc. I buy ASSETS not junk! And NANO is 100% far superior to BTC in every way. Its also free and instant transfers whereas BTC has mining costs. [...]\n\nI've been always getting paid in crypto (BTC), i started 2 months ago with them.\nThey're offering the USDT option recenlty but they've not pressed me to accept it, it's a second crypto option (BTC/USDT).\nSo yeah, no NANO either obviously.. i would've probably taken it too. Maybe if i try exchanges (buy/sell things, with a fee obviously)\n\nSooo.. i guess from your point of view, it's better if i take the payment in USDT (you really don't seem to like BTC, and i somehow understand it).\n\n(And i'm not a hosting company, but looking for one accepting this form of payment, most of my websites are hosted at OVH and don't know if they'll ever accept crypto)",
