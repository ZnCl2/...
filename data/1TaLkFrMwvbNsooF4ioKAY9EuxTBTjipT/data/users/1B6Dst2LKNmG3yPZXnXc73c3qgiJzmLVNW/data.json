			"body": "Our team is interested in electronic art/hack/social activity and blockchain/decentralized technology and other technologies. We are aimed at promoting blockchain technology among people. Our team creates various libraries, websites, artwork and other projects in the field of blockchain technologies. We also help blockchain projects. We believe that blockchain technology is the future.\n\nOur projects:\nhttps://keys.cipherdogs.net/\nhttps://torrent.cipherdogs.net/\nhttps://allnero.cipherdogs.net/\nhttps://cyber.cipherdogs.net/\nhttps://github.com/CipherDogs\n\nWe are an independent and non-profit project that believes in decentralization and is ready to promote and develop this technology with all our strengths. But without you, we canâ€™t do it.\n\nWe ask you to send a donation in support of the project. Any help, especially regular one, helps us work better, concentrate on current tasks and not go to stuffy offices, selling our time to corporations for nothing.\n\nhttps://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1q0a7hm3hdxhsv6mc50zsel2x9809tny2ck3ghpl\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xD12Dd8aEb8F96D0bFF6aA9C74bDf92009741d3Aa\nhttps://donate.cipherdogs.net/?address=4A5cX5VRHSmitG2fyZZqJu1hTFR53aKpPD9GjnBi6D3p5qVNA8c3gFxB7Q8E1aJQiHNt2EBjjviUTMNWmX4f4V8RSE3JX9f",
