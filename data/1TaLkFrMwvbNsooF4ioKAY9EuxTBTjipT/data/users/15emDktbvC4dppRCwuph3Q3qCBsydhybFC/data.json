I thought the issue might be due to other aps not being able to read orbits data folder so I tried modifying the cookie location \n\nCookieAuthFile /mnt/sdcard/control_auth_cookie\n\nand giving both orbit and zeronet permission to access internal storage but that didn't help. I think I'll need to root my phone and give zeronet super user premission for this to work. I won't be doing that on this device though since it is still under warranty.\n\nNot that using tor as a proxy for the trackers works on my android and I could also proxy all connections through tor If I wanted.",
