A common filebase for data sharing, filehandling, filtering and deduplication is far more importand and missing at this point than current approach of a centralized, IP based user control system, which is controlled by a clearnet service one man show, which goes against anything ZN tries to solve in the first place.\n\nI'm considering to rewrite zeronet in node.js, with your mentioned features, any part of the client can be redesigned and implemented in whatever way as long as it is compatible to the zeronet network protocol.",
