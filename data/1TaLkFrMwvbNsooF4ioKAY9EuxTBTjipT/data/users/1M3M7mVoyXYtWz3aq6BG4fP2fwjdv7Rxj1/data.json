People who don't think much of it usually just tells you to \"STAY POSITIVE\" and other inspirational BS, but I know it's not that simple (honestly those only makes matters worst since my mom gets pressured lol). \n\nalcohol is definitely a no-no. keeping your mind occupied is a big help. Quite frankly i've been living with mom and her condition all my life and she is normal 90% of the time until she gets depressed or forget to take her sleeping pills from there things gets triggered that leads to anxiety/sleep deprivation/depression.  But here's the important bit, we know what to do to keep her calm (usually she's mostly afraid of doing things that may hurt herself or hurt her so we do stuffs like showing her there's no sharp objects or whatever it is that makes her feel depressed)\n\nThat's why It is also super important to tell your loved ones so they'd know what to do to keep you sane, when hallucination happens, they're the ones who will snap you back to reality.",
