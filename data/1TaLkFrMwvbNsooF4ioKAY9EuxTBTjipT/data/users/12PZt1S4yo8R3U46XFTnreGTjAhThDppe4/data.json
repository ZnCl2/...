Smh...\n\nIf we don't ask those questions, someone else will just silently implement the censorship on top of ZeroNet.\n\nZeroTalk was designed on the basis of the P2P network, but with a centralized mindset. Maybe, it is because we don't yet know how to build full stack P2P applications. So my approach is to discover all possible ways: how to build as much centralized and controlled system as possible and how to avoid it.\n\nAs I said multiple times, the actual freedom of speech in the network is based on the fact that one cannot, in any way, ban, delete, hide or modify your messages and not on your beliefs that one just doesn't do it. For example, if you run your own copy of ZeroBlog, your freedom of speech is guaranteed by the math. It's not the case when you post to ZeroTalk.\n",

That's the question...\n\nWhat we can do is to improve the user experience without breaking the existing use cases as much as possible. If we succeed at this, we will be able to introduce some necessary breaking changes some time in the future. And while we just talk about nofish'es choices and write no code, we can do nothing.\n\nI think we can start from the idea I talked you about at RuZT.",

I run ZeroNet in Docker using the docker file from the repo. I guess my code should run just as a drop in replacement for the original py3 sources. \n\nIn a few days, I'll upload the image to Docker Hub, and also going to try combining pre-built binaries for Windows with python code from my repo.
