This is similar to domain name ownership and multi-signature, with one exception - here the future trusted owners are pre-recorded.\n\nIn case of confirmation 1 time per year, there is no need to transfer the key to the second owner. \nAlthough both cases make sense.\n\nThis option is also good at losing the first key when the second key is registered.",

The best solution is to get involved in the development, but is very difficult to understand the code of others, it takes time.",

Need a solution suitable for ZeroNet. Ipfs tests are beautiful and good, but in the working mode everything is not so rosy. \n\nIt is worth remembering that in some countries the dedic server with ipfs will be disconnected without warning (verified). May be if run a private network (clusters) associated + ZeroNet, but this may not apply to this topic.\n\nI can be wrong and not know some information. Maybe someone else tested in combat mode IPFS?\nHow effective is it possible to integrate dht from ipfs or is it better to write from scratch?\n\nNevertheless, DHT is a very attractive mechanism.",
