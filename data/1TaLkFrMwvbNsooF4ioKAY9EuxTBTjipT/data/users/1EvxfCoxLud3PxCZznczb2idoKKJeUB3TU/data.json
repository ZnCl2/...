And you get it after several minutes after posting gist. Maybe they implemented some kind of auto ban system recently and it banned ValdikSS?",

If this bille will pass into a law(and I think it will) then it can create single point of failure of entire russian network as there is paragraph about creating internet traffic flow control center under Roskomnadzor's control(it is russian internet watchdog which is famous for it's attempts of blocking Telegram by banning millions of ip adresses, mostly AWS and Digitalocean). Internet here will get unstable, expensive and slow because lawmakers don't know how it works.\nSecond problem is something russians are getting used to. It will create yet another hole in national budget. Interesting thing, there was a statement from authors of bill \"there will be no costs from national budget\", but according to experts it will cost tens of millions of dollars. They broke the law, but will not be punished for that.\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-internet-bill/russian-lawmakers-approve-second-reading-of-sovereign-internet-bill-idUSKCN1RN0UX",
