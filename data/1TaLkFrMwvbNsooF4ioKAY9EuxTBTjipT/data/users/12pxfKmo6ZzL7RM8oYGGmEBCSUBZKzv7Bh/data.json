The current corporate conglomerates that make up the mainstream sources of today consists of multi-national groups of copyright holders who wish to clamp down on their various forms of forbidden knowledge, being it matters of unrestricted discussion, News articles, educational studies, or the many forms of entertainment while advocating the  practices of rampant censorship, geographical selective pay walls,  and malicious forms of DRM for the financial benefit of themselves and their partners. [...]\n\nIt's possible for mainstream unwanted technologies to reach people, and Bitcoin is an example. It's possible but it is very hard, however. When a new technology offers unprecedented benefits, I guess the bottleneck for mass adoption is more a matter of convenience of use than anything else. \n\nThings like Having to install and configure ZeroNet Client, operating with a new form of address encoding that isn't human readable, new flows of data and authentication, little availability of content in local languages, no mobile access.... They all turn ZeroNet inconvenient for the masses, just like Bitcoin was before the option of using exchanges - whether they were good or not, it's not the question, but they really helped Bitcoin to spread.\n\nI believe in the spreading of ZeroNet as long as they ease the use of the tool.",
