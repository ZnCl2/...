			"title": "DuckDuckGo's privacy abuses-- current, historic, and by proxy",
			"body": "There are substantial privacy and civil liberty issues with DuckDuckGo. Here they are spot-lighted:\n\nNefarious History of DDG founder & CEO:\n\nDDG’s founder (Gabriel Weinberg) has a history of privacy abuse, starting with his founding of Names DB, a surveillance capitalist service designed to coerce naive users to submit sensitive information about their friends. (2006)\n\nWeinberg’s motivation for creating DDG was not actually to “spread privacy”; it was to create something big, something that would compete with big players. As a privacy abuser during the conception of DDG (Names Database), Weinberg sought to become a big-name legacy. Privacy is Weinberg’s means (not ends) in that endeavor. Clearly he doesn’t value privacy – he values perception of privacy.\n\nDirect Privacy Abuse:\n\nDDG was caught violating its own privacy policy by issuing tracker cookies.\n\nDDG’s app sends every URL you visit to DDG servers. (reaction).\n\nDDG is currently collecting users’ operating systems and everything they highlight in the search results. (to verify this, simply hit F12 in your browser and select the “network” tab. Do a search with javascript enabled. Highlight some text on the screen. Mouseover the traffic rows and see that your highlighted text, operating system, and other details relating to geolocation are sent to DDG. Then change the query and submit. Notice that the previous query is being transmitted with the new query to link the queries together)\n\nDDG is accused of fingerprinting users’ browsers.\n\nWhen clicking an ad on the DDG results page, all data available in your session is sent to the advertiser, which is why the Epic browser project refuses to set DDG as the default browser.\n\nDDG blacklisted Framabee, a search engine for the highly respected framasoft.org consortium.\n\nCensorship:\n\nSome people replace Google with DDG in order to avoid censorship. DDG is not the answer. \n\nDDG is complying with the “celebrity threesome injunction”.\n\nCloudFlare:\n\nDDG promotes one of the largest privacy abusing tech giants and adversary to the Tor community: CloudFlare Inc. DDG results give high rankings to CloudFlare sites, which consequently compromises privacy, net neutrality, and anonymity: \n\nAnonymity: CloudFlare DoS attacks Tor users, causing substantial damage to the Tor network.\n\nPrivacy: All CloudFlare sites are surreptitiously MitM’d by design.\n\nNet neutrality: CloudFlare’s attack on Tor users causes access inequality, the centerpiece to net neutrality.\n\nDDG T-shirts are sold using a CloudFlare site, thus surreptitiously sharing all order information (name, address, credit card, etc) with CloudFlare despite their statement at the bottom of the page saying “DuckDuckGo is an Internet privacy company that empowers you to seamlessly take control of your personal information online, without any tradeoffs.” (2019)\n\nDDG hired CloudFlare to host spreadprivacy.com (2019)\n\nHarmful Partnerships with Adversaries of Privacy Seekers:\n\nDDG patronizes privacy-abuser Amazon, using AWS for hosting.\n\nAmazon is making an astronomical investment in facial recognition which will destroy physical travel privacy worldwide.\n\nAmazon uses Ring and Alexa to surveil neighborhoods and the inside of homes.\n\nAmazon paid $195k to fight privacy in CA. (also see http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1401518&view=late1)\n\nAmazon runs sweat shops, invests in climate denial, etc… the list of non-privacy related harms is too long to list here.\n\nDDG feeds privacy-abuser Microsoft by patronizing the Bing API for search results and uses Outlook email service.\n\nMicrosoft Office products violate the GDPR (the Dutch government discovered numerous violations)\n\nMicrosoft finances AnyVision to equip the Israeli military with facial recognition to be used against the Palestinians who they oppress.\n\nMicrosoft paid $195k to fight privacy in CA. (also see http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1401518&view=late1)\n\nDDG hires Microsoft for email service: torsocks dig @8.8.8.8 mx duckduckgo.com +tcp | grep -E '^\\w' ==> “…duckduckgo-com.mail.protection.outlook.com”\n\nDDG is partnered with Yahoo (aka Oath; plus Verizon and AOL by extension). DDG helps Yahoo profit by patronizing Yahoo’s API for search results, and also through advertising. The Verizon corporate conglomerate is evil in many ways: \n\nYahoo, Verizon, and AOL all supported CISPA (unwarranted surveillance bills)\n\nYahoo, Verizon, and AOL all use DNSBLs to block individuals from running their own mail servers, thus forcing an over-share of e-mail metadata with a relay.\n\nVerizon and AOL both drug test their employees, thus intruding on their privacy outside of the workplace.\n\nVerizon supports the TTP treaty.\n\nYahoo voluntarily ratted out a human rights journalist (Shi Tao) to the Chinese gov w/out warrant, leading to his incarceration.\n\nYahoo recently recovered “deleted” e-mail to convict a criminal. The deleted e-mail was not expected to be recoverable per the Yahoo Privacy Policy.\n\nVerizon received $16.8 billion in Trump tax breaks, then immediately laid off thousands of workers.\n\n(2014) Verizon fined $7.4 million for violating customers’ privacy\n\n(2016) Verizon fined $1.35 million for violating customers’ privacy\n\n(2018) Verizon paid $200k to fight privacy in CA. See also this page\n \n(2018) Verizon caught taking voice prints?\n\nmore dirt (scroll down to Verizon)\n\n(2016) Yahoo caught surreptitiously monitoring Yahoo Mail messages for the NSA.\n\nAdvertising Abuses & Corruption:\n\nDDG consumed a room at FOSDEM 2018 to deliver a sales pitch despite its proprietary non-free server code, then dashed out without taking questions. Shame on FOSDEM organizers for allowing this corrupt abuse of precious resources.\n\nTor Project accepted a $25k “contribution” (read: bribe) from DDG, so you’ll find that DDG problems are down-played. This is why Tor Browser defaults to using DDG and why Tor Project endorses DDG over Ss – and against the interests of the privacy-seeking Tor community. The EFF also pimps DDG – a likely consequence of EFF’s close ties to Tor Project.\n\nFor the record, this is how Tor Project responds to criticism about their loyalty toward DuckDuckGo (their benefactor) in IRC:\n\n\n\n    18:20 < psychil> if torbrowser is going to be recommended, it should also be open to scrutiny. in the absence of that transparency, you create an untrustworthy forum.\n\n    18:20 < psychil> we’ve seen a loyalty from TB toward duckduckgo, but DDG is in partnership with Verizon, Yahoo, AOL et. al.\n\n    18:21 < psychil> all CISPA-sponsoring companies\n\n    18:22 < psychil> if ppl choose to trust them fair enough, but this trust shouldn’t be pushed on every user weighing their choice of browsers\n\n    18:26 -!- mode/#tor [-b psychil@!@*] by ChanServ\n\n    18:27 < YY_Bozhinsky> psychil: i am using Tor (thanks to Tor Devs)… PLUS brain - good bundle. I am happy. And please, don’t rush to change Reality (do it slowly with love and respect). Because it’s home for many ppl. They construct their lives in it. Think twice before ruining that. Please.\n\n    18:27 -!- mode/#tor [+b psychil!@] by ChanServ\n\n    18:27 -!- psychil was kicked from #tor by ChanServ [wont stop the FUD]\n\nIndeed, Tor Project is notoriously fast to censor any discourse (no matter how civil) when it supports a narrative that doesn’t align with their view / propaganda.",

This continues my on-going exploration of 1) lesser-known places on the Internet, 2) computer networks that can be reached via the Internet with additional software (e.g. darknets), and 3) networks that may someday evolve into the next Internet or Internets. This week's topic is the Gemini Project. Although the \"network\" or \"space\" defined by the Gemini Internet protocol may meet the definition of a darknet, I have not seen anyone refer to it as such. Perhaps that is because its primary goal is not to hide the identity of the user but to provide a useful network for accessing predominantly text-based content. Gemini's purpose is to present text more efficiently and aesthetically than the regular (or \"open\") Internet.\n\nRead more: https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/gemini.html\n\nGemini clients: https://gemini.circumlunar.space/clients.html",

Unzip and run it in-place anywhere. It’s also entirely offline. It will never automatically update, or even touch the network. In mere seconds any Windows system can become a reliable development machine. (To further increase reliability, disconnect it from the internet.) Despite its simple nature and small packaging, w64devkit is almost everything you need to develop any professional desktop application, from a command line utility to a AAA game.\n...\n\nOffline and reliable\n\nSoftware development has increasingly become dependent on a constant internet connection. Robust, offline tooling and development is undervalued.\n\nConsider: Does your current project depend on an external service? Do you pay for this service to ensure that it remains up? If you pull your dependencies from a repository, how much do you trust those who maintain the packages? Do you even know their names? What would be your project’s fate if that service went down permanently? It will someday, though hopefully only after your project is dead and forgotten. If you have the ability to work permanently offline, then you already have happy answers to all these questions.\n\nRead more: https://nullprogram.com/blog/2020/09/25/",

			"title": "Handshake - A Namespace For The Decentralized Web",
			"body": "Namespaces\n\nNames are the most valuable assets on the internet, but we don’t own our own names. All of the crucial namespaces belong to centralized entities who control the namespaces and take that control away from you. This is true for all significant namespaces today - the ICANN namespace, Facebook, Twitter, and Google.\n\nAs a result, your name on the internet does not belong to you, but rather to the owners of these centralized namespaces. With a stroke of the keyboard, they can remove anyone from existence. If your name lives on a centralized namespace, your right to exist effectively belongs to someone else.\n\nCentralized namespaces also determine much more than a user’s ability to exist. They also decree a user’s ability to search, match, and communicate with others. They unilaterally set the framework for what protocols can be used, which use cases are permitted, and what information can flow.\n\nThe power to enforce monopolies with little consequence also makes these centralized namespaces some of the most valuable properties on the internet today. Verisign makes billions a year controlling .com with practically zero innovation, while ICANN has the power to arbitrarily raise price caps of entire TLDs with their pet cartel companies. Facebook and Twitter controls exactly how users can use their names/accounts, and can heedlessly cancel pages and remove identities for barely specified reasons.\n\nEverywhere we see, we are seeing the serious dangers of depending on centralized entities to exist and be found by others. The Internet is supposed to be kingless, but the ability to strike away one’s existence and control exactly how the name is to be used makes the owners of these namespaces the de-facto kings/governors of the internet.\n\nThe World Needs a Decentralized Namespace\n\nOf course, the ability of these centralized namespace owners to control digital existence, lockout access, and enforce monopolistic economics is the complete opposite goal of the decentralized web, which is the ability to exist, innovate, and create their own business models without the need for centralized control or systems.\n\nWhether it’s decentralized currencies, decentralized file systems, or decentralized servers - if these decentralized entities do not live on a widely used namespace, they simply do not exist to the vast majority of users on the internet.\n\nWithout a decentralized namespace widely readable by humans and resolvable by machines, it is impossible for the decentralized world to be widely adopted by users.\n\nRead more: https://meowis.ms/handshake.html",

SQLite is implemented as a C library. The PHP stdlib includes that C library, meaning, SQLite is supported by PHP by default without any database drivers. SQLite is supported by many, if not all, programming languages and an SQLite database size can be multiple GiB, although the SQLite file based approach is totally unsuitable for a situation, when a lot of threads tries to access the database at once, as is the case with web sites with lots of simultaneous visitors. The SQLite supports almost all of the standard SQL. That being said, a \"back end\" is still an oxymoron in the ZeroNet world. What might be done is that the browser side JavaScript might usehttps://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/wikito run a console application that is written in C and that console application might run the SQLite, which might read in the SQLite database, but that unnecessarily complicates things, because then the option might already be the use of thehttps://javascript.info/indexeddbcombined with thehttps://jsstore.net/ [...]\n\nSounds good. To address the problem of parallel access to SQLite databases, you could use several SQL databases for one project and link them together. This would probably increase the number of parallel accesses to a website running on SQLite.",

				"body": "Black Male Privilege Checklist\n\nLeadership & Politics\n\n    I don't have to choose my race over my sex in political matters.\n    When I read African American History textbooks, I will learn mainly about black men.\n    When I learn about the Civil Rights Movement & the Black Power Movements, most of the leaders that I will learn about will be black men.\n    I can rely on the fact that in the near 100-year history of national civil rights organizations such as the NAACP and the Urban League, virtually all of the executive directors have been male.\n    I will be taken more seriously as a political leader than black women.\n    Despite the substantial role that black women played in the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power Movement, currently there is no black female that is considered a \"race leader\".\n    I can live my life without ever having read black feminist authors, or knowing about black women's history, or black women's issues.\n    I can be a part of a black liberation organization like the Black Panther Party where an \"out\" rapist Eldridge Cleaver can assume leadership position.\n    I will make more money than black women at equal levels of education and occupation.\n    Most of the national \"opinion framers\" in Black America including talk show hosts and politicians are men.\n\n    Beauty \n    I have the ability to define black women's beauty by European standards in terms of skin tone, hair, and body size. In comparison, black women rarely define me by European standards of beauty in terms of skin tone, hair, or body size.\n    I do not have to worry about the daily hassles of having my hair conforming to any standard image of beauty the way black women do.\n    I do not have to worry about the daily hassles of being terrorized by the fear of gaining weight. In fact, in many instances bigger is better for my sex.\n    My looks will not be the central standard by which my worth is valued by members of the opposite sex.\n\n    Sex & Sexuality\n    I can purchase pornography that typically shows men defile women by the common practice of the \"money shot.”\n    I can believe that causing pain during sex is connected with a woman's pleasure without ever asking her.\n    I have the privilege of not wanting to be a virgin, but preferring that my wife or significant other be a virgin.\n    When it comes to sex if I say \"No\", chances are that it will not be mistaken for “Yes\".\n    If I am raped, no one will assume that \"I should have known better\" or suggest that my being raped had something to do with how I was dressed.\n    I can use sexist language like bonin’, laying the pipe, hittin-it, and banging that convey images of sexual acts based on dominance and performance.\n    I can live in a world where polygamy is still an option for men in the United States as well as around the world.\n    In general, I prefer being involved with younger women socially and sexually\n    In general, the more sexual partners that I have the more stature I receive among my peers.\n    I have easy access to pornography that involves virtually any category of sex where men degrade women, often young women.\n    I have the privilege of being a part of a sex where \"purity balls\" apply to girls but not to boys.\n    When I consume pornography, I can gain pleasure from images and sounds of men causing women pain.\n\n    Popular Culture\n    I come from a tradition of humor that is based largely on insulting and disrespecting women; especially mothers.\n    I have the privilege of not having black women, dress up and play funny characters- often overweight- that are supposed to look like me for the entire nation to laugh.\n    When I go to the movies, I know that most of the leads in black films are men. I also know that all of the action heroes in black film are men.\n    I can easily imagine that most of the artists in Hip Hop are members of my sex.\n    I can easily imagine that most of the women that appear in Hip Hop videos are there solely to please men\n    Most of lyrics I listen to in hip-hop perpetuate the ideas of males dominating women, sexually and socially.\n    I have the privilege of consuming and popularizing the word pimp, which is based on the exploitation of women with virtually no opposition from other men.\n    I can hear and use language bitches and hoes that demean women, with virtually no opposition from men.\n    I can wear a shirt that others and I commonly refer to as a \"wife beater\" and never have the language challenged.\n    Many of my favorite movies include images of strength that do not include members of the opposite sex and often are based on violence.\n    Many of my favorite genres of films, such as martial arts, are based on violence.\n    I have the privilege of popularizing or consuming the idea of a thug, which is based on the violence and victimization of others with virtually no opposition from other men.\n\n    Attitudes/Ideology\n    I have the privilege to define black women as having \"an attitude\" without referencing the range of attitudes that black women have.\n    I have the privilege of defining black women's attitudes without defining my attitudes as a black man.\n    I can believe that the success of the black family is dependent on returning men to their historical place within the family, rather than in promoting policies that strengthen black women's independence, or that provide social benefits to black children.\n    I have the privilege of believing that a woman cannot raise a son to be a man.\n    I have the privilege of believing that a woman must submit to her man.\n    I have the privilege of believing that before slavery gender relationships between black men and women were perfect.\n    I have the privilege of believing that feminism is anti-black.\n    I have the privilege of believing that the failure of the black family is due to the black matriarchy.\n    I have the privilege of believing that household responsibilities are women's roles.\n    I have the privilege of believing that black women are different sexually than other women and judging them negatively based on this belief.\n\n    Sports\n    I will make significantly more money as a professional athlete than members of the opposite sex will.\n    In school, girls are cheerleaders for male athletes, but there is no such role for males to cheerlead for women athletes.\n    My financial success or popularity as a professional athlete will not be associated with my looks.\n    I can talk about sports or spend large portions of the day playing video games while women are most likely involved with household or childcare duties.\n    I can spend endless hours watching sports TV and have it considered natural.\n    I can touch, hug, or be emotionally expressive with other men while watching sports without observers perceiving this behavior as sexual.\n    I know that most sports analysts are male.\n    If I am a coach, I can motivate, punish, or embarrass a player by saying that the player plays like a girl.\n    Most sports talk show hosts that are members of my race are men.\n    I can rest assured that most of the coaches -even in predominately-female sports within my race are male.\n    I am able to play sports outside without my shirt on and it not be considered a problem.\n    I am essentially able to do anything inside or outside without my shirt on, whereas women are always required to cover up.\n\n    Diaspora/Global\n    I have the privilege of being a part of a sex where the mutilation and disfigurement of a girl’s genitalia is used to deny her sexual sensations or to protect her virginity for males.\n    I have the privilege of not having rape be used as a primary tactic or tool to terrorize my sex during war and times of conflict.\n    I have the privilege of not being able to name one female leader in Africa or Asia, past or present, that I pay homage to the way I do male leaders in Africa and/or Asia.\n    I have the ability to travel around the world and have access to women in developing countries both sexually and socially.\n    I have the privilege of being a part of the sex that starts wars and that wields control of almost all the existing weapons of war and mass destruction.\n\n    College\n    In college, I will have the opportunity to date outside of the race at a much higher rate than black women will.\n    I have the privilege of having the phrase \"sewing my wild oats\" apply to my sex as if it were natural.\n    I know that the further I go in education the more success I will have with women.\n    In college, black male professors will be involved in interracial marriages at much higher rates than members of the opposite sex will.\n    By the time I enter college, and even through college, I have the privilege of not having to worry whether I will be able to marry a black woman.\n    In college, I will experience a level of status and prestige that is not offered to black women even though black women may outnumber me and out perform me academically.\n    If I go to an HBCU, I will have incredible opportunities to exploit black women\n\n    Communication/Language\n    What is defined as \"News\" in Black America is defined by men.\n    I can choose to be emotionally withdrawn and not communicate in a relationships and it be considered unfortunate but normal.\n    I can dismissively refer to another persons grievances as ^*ing.\n    I have the privilege of not knowing what words and concepts like patriarchy, phallocentric, complicity, colluding, and obfuscation mean.\n\n    Relationships\n    I have the privilege of marrying outside of the race at a much higher rate than black women marry.\n    My \"strength\" as a man is never connected with the failure of the black family, whereas the strength of black women is routinely associated with the failure of the black family.\n    If I am considering a divorce, I know that I have substantially more marriage, and cohabitation options than my spouse.\n    Chances are I will be defined as a \"good man\" by things I do not do as much as what I do. If I don't beat, cheat, or lie, then I am a considered a \"good man\". In comparison, women are rarely defined as \"good women\" based on what they do not do.\n    I have the privilege of not having to assume most of the household or child-care responsibilities.\n    I have the privilege of having not been raised with domestic responsibilities of cooking, cleaning, and washing that takes up disproportionately more time as adults.\n\n    Church & Religious Traditions\n    In the Black Church, the majority of the pastoral leadership is male.\n    In the Black Church Tradition, most of the theology has a male point of view. For example, most will assume that the man is the head of household.\n\n    Physical Safety\n    I do not have to worry about being considered a traitor to my race if I call the police on a member of the opposite sex.\n    I have the privilege of knowing men who are physically or sexually abusive to women and yet I still call them friends.\n    I can video tape women in public- often without their consent - with male complicity.\n    I can be courteous to a person of the opposite sex that I do not know and say \"Hello\" or \"Hi\" and not fear that it will be taken as a come-on or fear being stalked because of it.\n    I can use physical violence or the threat of physical violence to get what I want when other tactics fail in a relationship.\n    If I get into a physical altercation with a person of the opposite sex, I will most likely be able to impose my will physically on that person\n    I can go to parades or other public events and not worry about being physically and sexually molested by persons of the opposite sex.\n    I can touch and physically grope women's bodies in public- often without their consent- with male complicity.\n    In general, I have the freedom to travel in the night without fear.\n    I am able to be out in public without fear of being sexually harassed by individuals or groups of the opposite sex.\n\nSource:  http://jewelwoods.com/node/9",
