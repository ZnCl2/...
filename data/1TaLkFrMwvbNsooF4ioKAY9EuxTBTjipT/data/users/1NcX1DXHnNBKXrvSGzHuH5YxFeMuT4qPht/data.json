Zeronet can use Tor to improve anonymity. And using Zeronet on Tails would increase anonymity by eliminating the factor of an possible compromised operating system. It also could prevent leaks by some malicious java script due to its strict firewall which tunnels everything through Tor. And even more, it prevents from configuring errors since everyone can use Tails safely with just a little bit of common sense and you don't have to be a linux /  computer / security / expert.\n\nPlease stop LOLing if you don't know what you talk about",
