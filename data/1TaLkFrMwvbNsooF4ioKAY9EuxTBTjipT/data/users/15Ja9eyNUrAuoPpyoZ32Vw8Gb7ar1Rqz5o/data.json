While it may seem like a bad idea at first you may forget that if they work with MOBA developers they could have millions of data from previous games on the get go. Millions of players everyday and a very complex game make it ideal for research. These games record a lot of data and they could accelerate the research faster than in other fields. But this does not mean that the application is only limited to that game.",
