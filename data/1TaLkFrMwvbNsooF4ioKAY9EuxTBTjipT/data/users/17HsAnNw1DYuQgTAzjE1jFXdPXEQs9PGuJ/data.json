Personally I know a few people who started studying IT at a later age with less skills than you have gained already.\nRegarding your uncertainty: There will always be somebody who's better at programming than you are and that's okay. They might be pros when it comes to technology, but you can have a better understanding of algorithms (or vice versa) for example. Last but not least: It's a great chance for you to learn from others.\nProgramming is a lot about curiosity and the desire of learning new things. Which is also necessary to keep up with new technologies, frameworks and so on.",
