				"body": "Edit: for me i am here because i believe this is the place for communities that was outcasted from the clearnet, i found this by searching for alternative internet where a community cant be easily censored\ni like it because of the features it offer, like having no central server, and no one have to pay for the bills(unlike tor sites) and you can contribute to a community just by seeding/viewing the site thus making a community sustainable just by having people who are interested in it\n\n> [cyanide](#comment_9_12VGJtaehSU7t6j4iWy5KxDEwxGDBNSLci): I found out about Zeronet almost two weeks ago. I was on a Discord server named 'Sanctioned!' where people discussed about suicide. A person on that server told me that he made a Zeronet site called Sanctioned Suicide so I downloaded Zeronet's app to try it out.  [...]\n\n(the site runner here) wow i am surprised how people are here, i honestly thought(and still believe) it will flop due to lack of public interest in the project itself to move away from clearnet due to censorship, but mainly technical difficulties in installing it makes it a hurdle to even begin with getting on Zeronet",
