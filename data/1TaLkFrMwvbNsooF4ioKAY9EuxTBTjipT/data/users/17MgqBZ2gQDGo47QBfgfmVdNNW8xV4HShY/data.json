I have ear in usa is take less of 2 years to Be in the police.. Stupid contries, Stupid people who kill poor innocent children and familly in irak ,afghan etc .. with her drone ,etc.. They are Friend with other poor contries and They sell Weapon to Certain contries and This contries Use the weapon to kill civilian and usa know that and continue ...  [...]\n\nThe people in the state are not stupid indeed, but they keep ignorance on the population through several means like poor education or allowing media manipulation. Politicians shut up because they were put by the rich rulers in the first place  (and they share benefits with the rich rulers), they wage the wars to enrich the ruling class of the USA. Otherwise their system would collapse without the benefits of invasions and people knowing the truth without fear would overthrow the system, united.\nThe solution is expropriating the businesses and establishing a planned economy to prevent exploitation, no more crises, rich or poor;  and go together all the people as 1 single interest in production, thus ending the need or appeal to invasions.",
