But when they see how cool it is, they are more likely to install it, and start using it.\nWith ipfs it is so painless. There is a clearnet address that always works, and the browser plugin redirects from there.\nWith Zeronet in contrast, the proxies are failing one after another. A link I post on cleanet might work anywhere between an hour and a few months at max.",
