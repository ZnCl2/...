(getit?)\nIt will be a map editor and a simple platformer at the same time. Where one can make/edit a level, save it and if desired upload it onto ZeroNet.\nOf course one can also check for uploaded maps on ZeroNet and download any that are found.",

Once the leaderboards are up, adding more such as user profiles, game related info, mini games, event information, rewards, marketplace for in game items. Basically a really tight link. So many possibilities there. If it worked well I'd even tell my players to check out ZN for extra free content.\n\nThis will also lead to other developers seeing the potential as I've talked to a few about the idea and although they were inclined to liking it they weren't interested as they hadn't seen it work yet. There are hurdles, I'm sure, on this course, however pretty certain there's a way though.",
