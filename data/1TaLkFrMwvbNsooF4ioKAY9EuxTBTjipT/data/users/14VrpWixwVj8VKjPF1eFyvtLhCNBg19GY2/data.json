Unfortunately Millions are going to end up dieing indirectly from these communist policies, maybe thats the purpose. \n\nIt might be a good idea to get used to taking the battery out of your phone or blocking cell signals since thats probably how they'll track you if you are on the run. I can imagine depending on your jurisdiction they will block  roads and arrest anyone outside to box as many people in their homes. In this case you will have to move during the night in dense forest. Its going to get increasingly difficult to escape civilization overtime. Once your boxed in that will be it, hopefully you've prepared the right tools and know the methods to meet your fate once that happens. At this point its taking a bet on how serious its actually going to get, but I would be preparing for the worst.",
