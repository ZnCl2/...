You can also drag the 0 button on the top right to the left, scroll down, and there's a delete button there.\n\nI didn't know the scroll down thing, thanks!",

Until now, I've been trying to make it work thinking it was a coding mistake, but the only thing I had to do was move it to img folder and put the path on the css file. Take a look! :D http://127.0.0.1:43110/1E3x1bMj78DVgX5QoAYHc8ofEJbjX6LZ4o/\n\nAnd thanks styromaniac for your message! Good to know that such nice people exist on this side of the internet. I'll keep learning as much as I can.\n\nCheers! \n\nPD: That thing about the link tag is pretty useful and interesting. It made things easier for me when I was making some changes in the code.",

I just work around it if I have to, but I don't use a large background image anymore. Did your background image get near or exceed 1MB?\n\nIt's weird, because the picture is only 52,8KB and I didn't get any error about the size of the background. Maybe I was doing something else wrong back then.",

My supposition is that for some unknown reason the picture weren't uploaded to the ZeroNet network and when I moved it to the img folder, worked.",
