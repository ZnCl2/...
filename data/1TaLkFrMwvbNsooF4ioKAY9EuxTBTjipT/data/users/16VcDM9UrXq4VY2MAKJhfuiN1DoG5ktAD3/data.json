Once I do, wouldn't this mean I'd have a difficult time porting those cookies back into the users.json file?Cookies aren't exactly the way I'd like to manage identities, since they're easily (irrevocably) deleted during common cleaning tasks (i.e.: CCleaner & etc).\n\nYeah it's easy to just manage them through the json file.

Because if you are, I'd agree with you. Last time I tried firefox on Android it was pretty stuttery and felt unrefined. That's why I switched to Lightning which was crazy fast and a lot simpler so there weren't many things to refine at all.

I try to stay excited with the future because everything is unknown.  Things may seem like a train wreck but how will it all play out?  The wonder keeps me going. We are alive so we are doing ok and there is always a chance something amazing could happen. Excitement and fresh new experiences are always outside of our comfort zone.\n\nHey, I'd like to chime in and ask - what if someone doesn't care about the future? I feel like I'm in that boat since I am aware of how big the universe is and how oh so special/complex life is, but I just can't bring myself to care about that really. I don't even know how to put it into words, it's hard to describe how little I care about that.\n\nIt's the environment I was born in and my choice is to either live in it or kill myself. It's not like \"oh wow this universe is so cool compared to that old shitty one\". As far as I know, this is the only one I can inhabit and that's why I really don't care about how complex or simple it is. If I may say, it is what it is.

If your environment sucks an obvious goal would be to better it. How do you know the universe is soo big? Is it because that's what people say? What do you know as fact based on your own experience disregarding all you have been told? The universe can be as big or as small as you like it to be, if its so big that you feel meaningless then you might want to zoom the scope in so you can see yourself and your surroundings and focus on that.  To a certain degree happiness is a choice and could be a goal.  Figure out what you would want and go for it.  Waiting for something brings nothing.  The comfort zone is like as tar pit.  It goes nowhere.  Do you have goals or dreams?\n\nWell yeah, I do lack goals. I thought I had some sound goals, but once I started achieving them I realized they definitely do not justify this existence. I'm trying to figure out why should I keep getting out of my bed every morning. I do because I need to hold a job so I can pay for food and rent, but why do all that stuff? That's the question which has been stuck in my head for some time now.\n\n> If your environment sucks an obvious goal would be to better it. How do you know the universe is soo big?

The universe can be as big or as small as you like it to be, if its so big that you feel meaningless then you might want to zoom the scope in so you can see yourself and your surroundings and focus on that.\n\nI'm just citing what people say, I don't really care either way. This universe can be as big or small as it wants, I doubt I could care less. You're right about the scoping in bit which is probably how most people give themselves purpose, but I don't think it's a proper solution or an answer, it's just blocking everything that's not immediately around you. What about \"the bigger picture\"?\n\n> To a certain degree happiness is a choice and could be a goal. Figure out what you would want and go for it. Waiting for something brings nothing. The comfort zone is like as tar pit. It goes nowhere. Do you have goals or dreams?\n\nYou're unfortunately right, I have a very small comfort zone that I cherish more than everything. I despise new experiences and I just stick to what works. It's such a bother even trying out new video games. Why would I do that if I can just play this same one and have fun with it. Getting new experiences is such a bother, man.\n\nRegarding happiness, I don't think it's a choice but it definitely is a goal, or at least should be. And about the goals, I did have some very stupid and superficial goals but as I've said, I have recently found them completely inadequate as they do not justify dealing with various stuff in life. It all seems so stupid, man. The human condition kinda deal, you get born, you experience shit and you die. All that for what? Why not just skip all the experience and jump straight into death? You don't get to experience positive things but at least you don't get to experience the negative things either.\n\nSorry if I rambled but you touched on so many things that I'd like to talk about so it's a mess.",

It's a challange to get to this point as i am not there myself. but it's something i find interesting.  If i had like three or four rental units i wouldn't need to work, but if i did work that be better.  It's a goal cause i hate the grind.\n\nRent was just an example, even if I had my own place where I didn't need to pay rent, I still need to pay for other necessities. My point was, why put in any work into anything? It's possible that this is a very stupid question, but when you go with the mindset of \"nothing matters and we'll all die\", that question starts sounding a lot more reasonable hopefully.\n\n> [bigbadbob](#comment_769_1CLhLYdMKjXtium9yjuRkSnFvPfdoUTXAj): There is nothing wrong with observing the big picture so long as you do not loose focus on yourself. I struggle with this all the time.\n\nYeah but when you start observing the big picture, you inevitably start seeing yourself as smaller and smaller in comparison. Yeah I can paint the walls of my room or help my friend fix his car, but it's all completely pointless once you zoom out. Why bother with all of that stuff?\n\n> [bigbadbob](#comment_769_1CLhLYdMKjXtium9yjuRkSnFvPfdoUTXAj): The comfort zone is comfy but it's depressing. Time goes by and still doing the same thing. It's adventurous to take risks and wing it. Everytime i go out of my comfort zone and take a risk i'm am usually glad i did, You only live once and if you are not afraid of death... what the worst that can happen?\n\nYeah I kinda have to agree about this. I do get a thrill out of succeeding at something new and risky that's out of my comfort zone, but I also get extremely frustrated and sad when I fail. Interestingly enough, for some reason the thrill lasts a lot less compared to the emptiness and frustration which really makes me think all this work and stress is for nothing. What's the worst that can happen you ask? A lot of things come to mind, actually.\n\nI could end up wasting my whole life searching for some meaning but eventually I just become old, alone and even more confused. Maybe I'll subconsciously lie myself into having some really stupid goal so I end up living my life like a suburban dad, where everything is kinda okay but deep down inside he's just counting the minutes until the time where he can finally be free from this prison he ended up in.\n\nWhat if there's life after death, and that life is in hell? That means you waste all of your life here just to end up being tortured for eternity. What if there's no afterlife at all? That makes this life absolutely pointless. Why exist for 7-8 dozen years and then just stop existing completely? It all seems stupid and pointless and it's fucking driving me nuts. The more I talk to people about this the less clear everything fucking becomes. Everyone has some superficial faggy goals like \"oh I want as much enjoyment as possible\" or \"I want to help as many people as possible\" or \"I want to save the planet from x, y, z\"... Fucking why?!\n\nI wish I could just return to not existing for an eternity. Not feeling or experiencing or thinking about anything for an eternity, because anything else is just a waste of time and energy.",

What do you get out of it if you've never seen this person before?\n\nHe's not seeking destruction, he's just answering the question. Also, in your previous reply you were wondering why would anyone want to jump to their life's end. Maybe I didn't read your reply correctly, but I think a pretty obvious answer is hardships in life. People have various problems that they don't know how to overcome, and they feel like giving up is a better or easier option. They choose the option to feel nothing instead of feeling both sadness and joy (in differing ratios, of course). I don't see anything wrong with that, and I fully support people giving up on life since I think it's kind of a pointless game. What am I missing here?",

I don't even wanna consider \"doing crazy shit\" given how much pain that can bring me.
