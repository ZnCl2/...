				"body": "Agree. Modern liberalism is void. People on meds and killing themselves because they lack meaning, yet have everything. Traditionalists must find a way. Likely it will not merely mean finding, but forging. Money will be needed for land. I say somewhere out of the range of a nuclear war that this mad modern world will inevitably wage if it stays on it's current trajectory. The NWO doesn't care how many people die so long as they are safe within bunkers. Atlantis vs Hyperborea as the flawed nutcase Dugin says, but he has a point in, \"Liberalism must die!\"",
