Or Outhernet https://othernet.is/ same free internet satelitte. You can buy the kit from the website it is around 100$ or you can build yourself, they made public the plan of contruction on the website. Also SpaceX and Elon Musk will send internet satelitte for free internet access world wide. And if you have the equipment to receive/send the signal from satelitte you your terminal (laptop, PC etc) and from your terminal (laptop, pc etc) back to satelitte, I don`t see how this Russian cut from the world wide internet will affect Russian population. Only maybe if Russian goverment will nuke the internet satelitte in the space, but then will start war.\nRead more about that subject so when the \"cut from internet\" will come to be prepared! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Internet_access",
