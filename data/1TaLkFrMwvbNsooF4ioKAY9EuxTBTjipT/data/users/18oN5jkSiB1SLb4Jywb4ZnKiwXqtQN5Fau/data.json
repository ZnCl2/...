ZeroNet is essentially useless if an out of date version will not work as the programmer or the terrorist could shut it down by making an updated version that becomes unusable...?",

It happened to me multiple times now when deleting and then downloading the site again.\n\nYes I just figured it out myself as well. I just had to wait a little while until it downloaded.
