No way to scale, too large load on hardware. It's a good toy to play around a bit. But just that. It needs a complete rewrite from scratch with new technologies and solutions to help scale up.",

But zeronet is not ready for such services, it won't handle page with millions of videos. Can you imagine downloading few terabytes of data to get all the way from first revision to current up to date revision of \"YouTube\"? That's how current zeronet works. If it's good for some geeks, not for everyday use as replacement for centralized net.\n\nI think it will never be, if you want security you won't be able to have such great experience as in centralized network. I believe I is impossible to marry this two things.",

Lets say you visited some imageboard and it was okay but after some time other users posted CP. You wanted to help zeronet and host page with bigfiles and boom - you don't know that but you own and distribute CP. \n\nLegislation and courts/judges are lacking behind technology and would not understand explanation \"there is decentralized network where everyone is hosting distributed pages and this CP appeared on my PC from 'nowhere' and I did distribute it because the principle of operation of 0net\".",
