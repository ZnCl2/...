				"body": "Hi from russia :)\nSo far everything is \"normal\"...\nBut \"normal\" for couple of years is:\n* More than 20 millions of IPv4 banned\n* Some torrents sites, online casinos and crimial ones\n* A lot of non related sites are banned to, some random chess clubs, 7-zip.org, elite dangerous gaming servers... millions of them\n* Some times big sites gets banned, than unbanned like google, amazon. Even main goverment banhamer owner banned it self couple of times\n\nThere are rumors or plans to ban all VPN traffic. But... I bet goverment does not understand that it is it self relyes on VPN... That is why before banning all VPN traffic it should be separated from citizens traffic... witch is hard / utopic idea...\nBut they still building DPI on the border\n\nStarting from 1 Nov the law says that Russia must run private internet. \nCurrent status is \"experimental\". Two monthes ago they started to test it in two regions.\nThe were huge network outages. \nI think experiment were failed... and they in a search for better solutions...\n",
