			"body": "ZeroNet or something similar will be very necessary and in high demand very soon. The banning of Gab has proven there is no alternative for free speech sites except to go somewhere like this. If only we could mesh it with the clearnet more easily. Can't use domain names because registrars are unreliable and can ban any domain on a whim.\n\nIt's important to make the experience seamless from normal websites for the purpose of getting more users and making it accessible to as many people as possible, even less tech savvy people. One way I could think of would be to allow linking to ZeroNet sites through a subdomain: https://Talk.zeronet.io. Upon visiting this page in a normal browser it would prompt you to download a browser extension or if you already have it downloaded open the ZeroNet site directly. That way we could easily link to and from the clearnet from here.\n\nAlso I think a browser extension which prettyfies ZeroNet URLs is important, so we could have Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit without 127.0.0.1 + port number before. This would help to make the experience more seamless.",
