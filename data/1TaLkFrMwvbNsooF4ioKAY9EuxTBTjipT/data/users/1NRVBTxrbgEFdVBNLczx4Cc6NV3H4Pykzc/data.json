And Bernie is \"leftist\". This is totally false. I would argue that Bernie is a centrist and Biden is Left. Please put your pitchforks and torches down and let me explain what I am trying to say.\n\nThe one who agrees with most people is actually centrist. Most of American people want:\n* Medicare for all\n* Tuition Free colleges\n* Housing Rights\netc.\n\nNow my boy Bernie is someone who *actually* fights for these things. So you see, he is an actual centrist. As in, he agrees with most of the population.\n\nOn the other hand Biden is a Leftist, he is pro-corporations and his views are extremists views (or at-least, that is how it should be treated. I mean he is Joe \"Nothing Will Fundamentally Change\" Biden). If there is a miracle and the labels gets interchanged, then I guess Bernie would have a better chance of winning.\n\nBut why is Bernie called leftist? The party is center-right. Bernie is center. So from their POV, Bernie is towards their left. So they label him leftist. But he is centrist in terms of what people need. \n\nFuck Trump, Fuck Joe Biden. Both are more or less the same.",

If you think you can become \"gods\" you are wrong - no one except God is God and no one else can be Him (or Her if you are that way inclined) You can follow the prophets all you like, but they all (every single one) talked about Jesus and what He means in the grand scheme of things.  There is no one who is perfect enough to be God (I don't have my bible handy or I'd give you a verse)(for everything I say here) and the only way to get into heaven - no matter how you scheme or plan - is through the blood of Jesus Christ.  I know no one likes to admit that, but if you do some real research into heaven and how to get there, Jesus will come up.  He will forgive your sin - we all sin, and fall short of God, so we have to be forgiven of the sin by Jesus' grace - then we can meet God and enjoy Heaven with Him - it's gonna be so cool, Heaven, I can't wait!! But saying that - I have to finish my mission here on earth, and He will call me home to Heaven to be with Him when my time comes, because I believe in Him and trust Him to do what He said He will do :)\n\nJesus Christ, Allah, Siva, Krishna, Thor, etc -  these are nothing more than mere human imagination & inventions.",

You see these things are born when a member of the a species impregnates the female of the same species. That is just how reality works. The same thing applies to resurrection.

It is already made up of multiple nations with each nation having a majority religion and multiple minority religions. Also, India is already a part of of south asia, so no Idea why you would say \"south asia AND india\" 😕. \n\nAlso there are already enough religious baboons. All religions are a virus to humanity. Some religions are more harmful than others. I hope, maybe one day, that humanity stops indulging in these mass delusions.",
