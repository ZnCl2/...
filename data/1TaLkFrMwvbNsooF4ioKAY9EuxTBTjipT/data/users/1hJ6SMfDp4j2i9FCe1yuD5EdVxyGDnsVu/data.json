WWI started from the growing need for territory and the ethnical tensions on europe, none of that is true now, WWII started from the resentment of the defeated on WWI and the expansionist plans of Japan... none of that exists now. US and Russia will keep on fighting each other thru dummy states, like Syria, for a long time. The only affected will be those living on US or Russia (or the countries they use to play)...",
