Why should I sit here cultivating a mile-long blocklist to filter out the hateful people when I can simply not wallow in the filth in the first place?\n\nIt makes me sad because I truly believe that ZeroNet is the \"last chance\" of the internet in a sense thanks to its low software requirements and ability to share sites offline.\n\nI came back since I missed three or four people, but everything seems to be a lot quieter now.\n\n(I still have my old users.json just in case.)",

Right after the first run wizard, the twenty or so gigabytes that I let it have were immediately filled. With what? I don't know. The file system is so convoluted that it's near impossible to know. There are no blocklists that I've come across. I don't even know if there is such a functionality.\n\nZeroNet has blocklists and an open file system. I don't have to seed anything I don't want to.\n\nThe only thing I have to commend Freenet for is that the primary interface works without Javascript. ZeroNet has the /raw/ workaround, but not everything can be handled from the CLI/TUI (yet).",
