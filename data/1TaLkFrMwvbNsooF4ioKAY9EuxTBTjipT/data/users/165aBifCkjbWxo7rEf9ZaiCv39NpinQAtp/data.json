We know we can set optional files however  we do not leave this computer running for log period of times (Old hardware).  So some less popular file might not get distributed. \n\nEven going to the above link does it download the files for you?,  Just want to test that part of the site is working..?\n\nI know large 0Site don't normally do well...\n\nWould a good alternative be to upload the file to mega and share them from there? even if they get wiped from mega we still would have the file to upload, or put on the site as optional. Or does some one know of a better service?\n\nThoughts?",
