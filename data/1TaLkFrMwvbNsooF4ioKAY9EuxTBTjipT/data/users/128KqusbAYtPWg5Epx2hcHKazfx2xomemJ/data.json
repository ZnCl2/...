You need the owner's permission at the very least for that.  If the city is complaining then you're probably screwed, but can try to fight it.  Maybe a judge will agree with you.",

				"body": "I'm a bit interested in this too and it does seem seem like their has been a lot of Holocaust exaggerations and sketchy claims taken at face value while all skepticism is met with ad hominem attacks against the skeptic.  \n\nI don't necessarily doubt that there was a mass slaughter of Jews by Nazis in some shape and form, but the lies should be called out, context given, the Nazi point-of-view represented.  The way the Nazis and Hitler are talked about by the establishment is as one-sided as the way they talk about Trump.  I've read enough to know that Hitler had a lot of good points in the government he was trying to (and did for awhile) establish.  Very pro-family, anti-degeneracy, etc.\n\nPerhaps the best way to tackle this would be just to take a list of Holocaust claims and evaluate them one by one.",
