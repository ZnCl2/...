Like memes, if something can deliver .. and doesn't mislead or disappoint the user ... then it'll have widespread adoption. ZeroNet so far delivers pretty well. There's still a lot of work to be done.. filling it up with content should be the priority, I'd say .. now that we've hacked the shit out of everything. These days I actually feel far less motivated by financial gain, donations, blah blah blah.. and far more motivated by becoming a part of history. Fighting for a cause. ..to the point where I kinda regret the ideas I had in the past of introducing financial motives and crypto-mining into ZeroNet. I've grown to hate money over the years. It's about time we became a post-scarcity civilization. Money is only a motivator when you're starving and need to put food on the table .. but if all of your basic needs are met, then you'll likely work and create stuff just to feel a sense of belonging .. a sense of community. To be noticed.\n\nI agree that ZeroNet needs lots of content.\nI also suggest a cookie based ZeroNet technology that normal sites can use. So their server costs would be at least 10 times smaller, or even hundreds of times less costly.\nWhat do you think?",

Currently i think the site owner can give out the site private signing key to other trusted people so they can also update the site or delete existing entries. But giving out such key means full ownership/editting of the site. Other option is that you send the links to site owner and he add them for you after checking.\n\nIt is useful to have filtering networks of people.\nhttps://alternativeTo.net came to my mind. It's not totally related, but it's a useful crowdsourced method.\n\n\n> [styromaniac](#comment_170_16NS3rBdW9zpLmLSQoD8nLTtNVsRFtVBhd): It appears to be very easy to clone, edit and publish. I didn't get to the publish part yet because I can't open a port on cellular data.\n\nBut it would be extra work. I suggest we make collaboration easy, and build local networks of trust.\nLocality here means a bunch of people who mind the same cause.",

If 60% of authors agree to a change and sign it, the update will be injected to the network.\nIn this way if more than 40% of the authors discontinue their work the site would die.\nProblem of disagreement amongst owners exists. It'll be like a senate.\nThe link would be hash0 for the whole time.\nOwners list can be updated during a voting.\nI call this method senateHash.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis gives meaning to the life of Data, instead of Data being dependent on Authors keys.\nData will evolve to a BlockTree.\n\nWhat do you think?",
