So not only NSA catches you, but you even don't know why. \nIPFS has nothing to do with this, but you can decentralize and pin your legit files. All can see each others' ip and stuff, but who cares.\nTOR: NSA control entry nodes, so they catch you.\nVPN: they log even if they say they don't, and give all to NSA. They catch you.\nCARRIER PIGEONS: usefull, but not during hunting season.\n\nSo, what do we do? Get back to clearnet?",
