				"body": "Zeronet is kind of like a torrent tracker...  A person uploads a torrent to a server and others can see that torrent, when they click on it they become the down loader and up loader via a torrent client...  Zeronet creates a similar system on your computer, but you do not upload anything to a server because you become a server and Zeronet handles the rest in the background...  When you visit a Zeronet website and view it you become a server for that website... if you create a website on Zeronet you host it until you have other people also visit you... they by visiting you will also host your website...  There is always a version of your website available... even when you turn off your computer...  Do you understand?",
