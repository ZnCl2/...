If it is true, though:\n>beatup by police\nSupposedly, your actions (too aggressive/inadequate) led to this kind of situation. It is none of their interest, to setup a fight, unless you do not own something they would really want\n>held in the hospital against my will\nMedicine rarely feels good, so it is not something to mention\n>given drugged food\nAre you sure, that there is no placebo effect? Or maybe you did something you don't remember",
