				"body": "ZeroMe hubs, that is one hard thing to change:\n- First you only download the users Text, you don't download any images (You have to opt in the images to be able to do that on that specific user).\nSecond: A social media is somewhere you have to see other users, the way ZeroNet work is by downloading and seeing the contents of the entire website, there is no Temporary folder like modern browsers do, so you kinda need to download all the text at least for a website to work.\nIf you did the User own Hub thing, there is a problem that if the user creates a hub and the user gets offline, no one will ever see what they posted. (I think you can mute users so that they don't appear and you don't download their content).\n\nThe way ZeroNet is done, without any central servers, it is quite hard for things to be done. Think about a social media with 100 people using, you can do what you said, but now think about a future where ZNet have a huge boom and then 100k people are using the Social Media ZeroMe... how are you gonna keep an eye out for lets say, 100 hubs, or even more, if every single one is it's own thing (But with that said, i think if 100k people use ZeroMe the site is gonna be dead by the amount of text being sent/received being way too much).\n\nOne thing i think should be done, is the possibility to download images thumbnails only when requested by the user (So if i wanna see a thumb, i should allow that specifc page to) and if i don't wanna see the thumb, it should not re-download itself if i enter that image board. That way some problems with illegal content can be mitigated (not eliminated, sadly)",
