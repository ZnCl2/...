				"body": "My guess is that you need to change the mode of your /var/run/tor folder to include the SetGID bit. In octal that's 2755. Now since /var/run is just a symlink to /run which is created on boot by tmpfs, the best way to accomplish this is to create a tor.conf file in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/ so that the folder gets created with the correct permissions each time it starts. The tor.conf file needs the following contents:\n\n#Type Path              Mode UID             GID             Age Argument\nd          /var/run/tor 2755  debian-tor debian-tor  0      -\n\nBest of luck to you, I went through a similar tribulation getting ZeroNet to work with the tor daemon myself.",
