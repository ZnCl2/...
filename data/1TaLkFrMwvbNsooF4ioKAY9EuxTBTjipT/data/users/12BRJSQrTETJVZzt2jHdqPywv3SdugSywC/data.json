			"body": "Google uses an algorithm in their searches affecting all the engines like YouTube, web search and the way it recommends content.\n\nIt is called machine learned fairness, but it is far from a naturally learned system. Google has biased the system with intersectional social justices, for example the algorithms will bring up minorities in an image search for white family or fire fighter will show you equal amounts of men and women regardless of reality.\n\nThe purpose is unclear but social engineering comes to mind, infact you can probably draw parallels to the Cambridge analytica scandal where it is clear weapons grade social engineering was used on the public to engineer election outcomes.\n\nThe part that eludes me is the end result doesn't seem to reflect the assumed outcome, if the intention is to engineer leftist social ideaology then why strike a divide pushing both left and right extremism? One strange thing I have witnessed is searching Family shows you mostly accurate results that represents the country you are in but searching white family shows mostly minorities, another example is Facebook has purposely designed allot of its functionality around atomisation of groups and mostly just like twitter banned the milk toast people while leaving the extreme personalities on the platforms.\n\nThe endgame cannot end well. They are engineering a civil war, it's the only logical conclusion.",

CPU encryption extension's will drastically improve performance for Tor and VPN alike. You can use CPUz to check your CPU features.\n3. Tor runs over TCP and this has many performance drawbacks.\n\nA. TCP requires packets be responded to with acknowledgement packets before more packets are sent. This causes a 2x latency increase that stacks over time depending on the size and length of the data been transferred.\nB. TCP connections running over TCP tunnels can and often do suffer from acknowledgement of acknowledgement effects. The connection in the tunnel sends an acknowledgement reply and the tunnel itself has to send an acknowledgement of the packet that carried the acknowledgement inside the tunnel 🤔🤔 maybe it would be easier to understand temporal theory of time travel.\n\n4. The more individual number of connections increases the number of packets per second so you would see more speed performing a single large file download vs running a torrent downloading pieces from many peers. This is due to an increase in acknowledgement packets and protocol overhead.\n\n5. TCP tunnels use allot more upload, this is due to the TCP protocol overheads compared to UDP and the acknowledgement packets. Also VPN tunnels carry encryption overhead and so tiny TCP protocol packets will all carry the encryption baggage.\n\nAs an example, an average UDP OpenVPN tunnel using high levels of encryption will use around 1mbit of upload for every 10mbit of download. TCP usually triples this. 2x for the TCP tunnel and 1x more for TCP over TCP effects.",
