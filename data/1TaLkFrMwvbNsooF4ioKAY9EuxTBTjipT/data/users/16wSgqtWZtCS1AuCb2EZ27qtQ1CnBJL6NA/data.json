The speed of \"gathering\" new torrents seem to me like is the speed of new torrents submitted on the internet (so i will never reach really all torrents at this speed), though unsure how significant benefit it is to reach that point.Btw. my \"database\" folder is 135MB. In data folder is also file named \"binlog.001\" (whatever purpose this file has) and it is 20MB - this file is constantly updated.\n\n\ncan be achieved in a year\n\nbut you will always know which torrents are popular on the Internet",
