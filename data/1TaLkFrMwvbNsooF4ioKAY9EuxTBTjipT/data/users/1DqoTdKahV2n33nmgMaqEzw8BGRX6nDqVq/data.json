Then just copy the files to your new site. Make sure to remove user data and maybe databases.\n\nThanks for the reply. It pointed me in the right direction to copy the site and move its content to newly created site.\nThe key was to edit the `content.json`.\n\nThis is the site i tested cloning.\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1yUji4qPD7GAog8XkP3EDMEfrL995S4Xd/\n\nFound a useful site that describes the basics.\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/DevCenter.bit/?/tutorials/static_zite",
