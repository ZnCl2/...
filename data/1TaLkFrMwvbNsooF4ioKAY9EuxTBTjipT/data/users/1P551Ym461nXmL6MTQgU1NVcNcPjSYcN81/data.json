You can also get 2 dots (iirc) if you're spamming but ZeroID detects that you're not real.\n\nI have a different theory. I think the dots might represent the subnet level that is being blocked. I found this when trying to create another account after resetting my dynamic address and being offered two dots.\nSince a lot of Tor exit nodes live in the same subnet because of being run from a cluster of servers, it would make sense that if subnets are blocked after a few individual IPs being blocked, in a short amount of time all the exit nodes would be blocked.",
