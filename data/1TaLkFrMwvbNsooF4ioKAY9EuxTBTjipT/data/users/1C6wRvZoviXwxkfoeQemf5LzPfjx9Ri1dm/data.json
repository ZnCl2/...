			"body": "I have a blog that has conservative views and I've been trying to sign up to Google Adsense for like... 10 times, and I'm always getting rejected, then adjusting the site's content, then getting rejected again. My site is fully compliant with W3C and other crap like GDPR, yet I'm not being able to get approved in Google's Adsense. I'd like to ask if you guys know a solution for this, any affiliate network that is fine displaying banners in a place that talks about Jesus, Bible and Texas?",
