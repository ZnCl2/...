Which is likely why it works in Nordic countries. I think even then it would fall apart after a while due to human nature being to collect into groups. Gotta find out how you are better than your neighbor somehow. In a monoculture society though I can see how that could last for a few generations. Likely quite a well for at first. I think this is why we are starting to see resistance or tension in those idealized Nordic countries due to new cultures being introduced through mass migrations.\n\nThoughts?",

We've seen some demos of scanning construction sites and such. I wonder what other applications people are trying to use the Spot Mini. Maybe private security stuff like patrolling a building or land day/night? Short distance deliveries as well. That could replace an internal mail handler or similar low wage logistical job.\n\nThoughts?",
