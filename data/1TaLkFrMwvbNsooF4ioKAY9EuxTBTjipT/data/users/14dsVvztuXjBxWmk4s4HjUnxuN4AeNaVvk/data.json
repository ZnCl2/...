			"title": "Tutorial: how to autostart zeronet on Debian with forced Tor mode",
			"body": "First install tor with 'sudo apt install tor'.\nThen you have to make some modifications to tor config files, mainly uncomment two lines. Just run this:\n\n```sudo sed -i -e 's/#\\s*ControlPort 9051/ControlPort 9051/' /etc/tor/torrc```\n```sudo sed -i -e 's/#\\s*CookieAuthentication 1/CookieAuthentication 1/' /etc/tor/torrc```\n```sudo service tor restart```\n```sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor (user)```\n\nwhere (user) is your linux username.\n\n\nThen in Tor Browser Bundle (download from https://www.torproject.org/download/ and unpack, then run it), enter in URL bar 'about:config', search for 'network.proxy.no_proxies' and change its value to '127.0.0.1'\n\nThen what I do is create a 'zeronet.desktop' file with contents:\n\n\n\n**[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=zeronet\nExec=path/to/zeronet/ZeroNet.sh --tor always --open_browser asjkdjad893e893jdas\nTerminal=false**\n\n\nAnd place this file in ~/.config/autostart/\n\n\nReplace path with where your ZeroNet.sh is. --tor always forces tor mode, and --open_browser (nonsense) is only there because script won't start without this argument, and nonsense prevents any browser from actually running on its own. Then when you reboot, just go to http://127.0.0.1:43110 in Tor Browser Bundle and bookmark it. Now you can always access already-started ZeroNet from there whenever you start your PC, with Tor mode forced.\n\nIf you disable javascript in Tor Browser, zeronet will whine that it needs it to run. In that case, you have to add the NoScript icon to your interface next to URL bar (just like addons in firefox) and manually allow '127.0.0.1' then refresh the page.",

			"body": "Today I was watching a known gamer's channel where he was bragging about his new PC, audio setup, filmmaking, TV, etc. Of course Windows 10 on that PC in the background, as this is gaming PC, but he claims he uses it for serious work too (dumb fuck). Now, this is considered \"cool\"  among boomers, to have latest hardware and games and whatnot. \n\nWhat if we tried to spread the word so that those who spread such trends, spread ideas about digital privacy & security which is still relevant to what they usually record after all? For example, they start uploading videos saying like \"guess what guys, today I found this addon for firefox that blocks even more garbage on websites\" or \"this VPN has a builtin killswitch which is a killer feature\" or \"wow, this distro named (something) is the best I used, and works OOTB without any binary blobs!\".\n\nThe kiddos and smartphone addicts would then start competing for privacy, because actually once you get into it it's a very interesting journey of learning new stuff and self-improvement (something like sharing your setups on r/privacy, those guys can be competitive to the point of masturbating to the fact that my setup is 1% more private than the others).\n\nWe need more influential people to see the light, the rest will then follow.",

			"body": "Once I got into privacy it became increasingly difficult to game since Linux is not as good as Windows for that, and even so, I wanted to avoid any and all proprietary software, which means no Steam and almost no games. Gradually I've been losing interest in gaming at all, and AAA gaming is pure cancer, with analytics, microtransactions, exclusive preorder bonuses, horrible DRMs and generally big publishers being douchebags.\n\nGames are made so that they are as addictive as possible and ultimately you gain NOTHING of value by playing them. Looking back on it all, I wasted an extreme time on gaming when I could have been studying to get a good job, for example. And games gave me absolutely NOTHING I can be proud of or even find useful today. I think it's time to focus on more productive entertainment, such as reading, music, movies, sports, coding etc. \n\nDo you guys game? Do you use a separate device for it, like a console or windows laptop? Do you keep it airgapped? And what do you think about gaming generally?",

Nearly any distro nowadays will secure you well enough that you do not have to worry too much...  Unless you are contending with hackers who are attacking your computer / system you should be fairly secure.\n\nSoftware is the easy part, but hardware is a real issue. If his threat model contains government, then Intel ME/AMD PSP is out of the question, as they are gov backdoors. They can also be compromised by hackers anytime. AMD not wanting to release PSP source code makes me think it relies on security-through-obscurity, so yeah, very insecure.\n\nTo OP: if you don't need modern rig, buy a used Thinkpad and flash libreboot, or buy a laptop with disabled IME from Purism or System76. Otherwise, just use a Thinkpad with Tails for internet browsing and then build a second PC however you want, and airgap it, and do everything else there. Then you can even use Win10 safely.",

Officially, it's meant to enable admins remotely manage machines in an organization. But for a consumer, it serves no purpose at all apart from being a security, privacy and freedom risk.\n\nYou can't just desolder or overwrite it because PC will refuse to even boot if it doesn't detect ME.\n\nOld intel CPUs didn't yet have ME, that's why libreboot only supports them and why you can only use very old hardware to be safe.
