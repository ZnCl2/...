Never. And besides, as I said, calling out someone for preferring one of two evils is retarded and disruptive on your part. The REAL issue is every accessed URL is sent to Google for malware detection purposes. THAT is the real issue, not some lefty PR they did or whatever.\n>and why they should not be supproted.\nI never said they should be supported (as in donations). Other kinds of \"support\" are irrelevant.\n>They also kicked out Brendan Eich for a decade old donation \"against gay marriage\" during a time where even Obama was against it.\n>All I am doing is calling you guys out for your bullshit. I cannot support companies that also bring up decades old shit against somebody.\nYou have no idea how things work, do you? The executives at Mozilla aren't going to change their policies because of some nobody calling them out on some random message board. Almost all of the money they're getting is from big tech companies donating to them. It's surprising they are making a usable browser at all. It's sad that there are people posting on here who don't have the IQ required to realize that and behave pragmatically rather than throw an autistic fit for no reason.",

Zeroid in today's form si (closed source) bullshit and weakness.Do you have solution?\n\nI don't know what he thinks is the solution, but to me the solution is to extend ZeroNet's authentication related functionality in the API so additional authentication methods can be built on top of ZeroNet, and to allow sites to ask the user to install plugins to extend the client's functionality. nofish has mentioned working on some kind of index system that would allow generating anonymous auth_addresses from the master seed, which would cover the first point I mentioned to some extent.",

Whitelists would be extremely impractical. Not to mention any semblance of anonymity would be lost if everyone is required to have a stable ID to have any hope of being read by other people.\n>Posts/comments from those users rise up.

Otherwise I could say it's hopeless since those same people could be paid to storm datacenters and ISPs with guns until they track down every ZeroNet client and cut it off from the Internet.\n>Hehe. Haha. Cough-cough. It took me several days to register accounts, and nofish counterattacked all my attempts to leave the script running at night when I'm sleeping.\nReally? What did he do, other than the regular throttling of IPs?\n>Being anonymous means that you can break everything anonymously. If you have several accounts, that's rather easy to do.\nBut it doesn't mean you can break everything anonymously forever.\nMaybe some ideas from anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero could be borrowed, as in those systems it's possible to prove the originator of a transaction has some resources without revealing who the originator is. So people could prove they are upstanding members of the community without revealing their identity.\nBut for this to be possible at all we need a way for ZeroNet users not to always identify themselves in the first place without having to fiddle around with user.json files.",
