The former means that ZeroNet sites that use this CA can be DOSed, and the latter means that users can be possibly confused (though this is less critical).\n\nOh, I thought you meant something more subtle.\nI've tried Kxonet and it hanged in creating the user showing a spinning icon for more than 15 minutes, any idea why? Granted this was on a cheap laptop, I don't know if it's based on proof of work or what.",

And also the phone number is from a cheap company, probably a prepaid card.\n\nwhat's the scam about?",
