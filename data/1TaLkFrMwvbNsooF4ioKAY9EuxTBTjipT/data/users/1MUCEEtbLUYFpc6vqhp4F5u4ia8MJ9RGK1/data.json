				"body": "> [dv1](#comment_34_1GvDe5pkKGgM4ZXSge4CwhekmWCjpVsDMA): well , you are not browsing the \"dark web\", gazillion adds are not .onion adds. You are surfing normal clearnet but hiding your IP through Tor (theoretically as everyone in the darkweb knows Tor is a CIA/NSA honeypot). Therefore, the adds you see are the adds triggered by the IP you are out to the internet. Darkweb sites are .i2p, .onion, zeronet, and freenet sites among others, I do not see money on adds coming from visiting those sites.\n\nhttp://submarhglcl66nz6.onion/\nhttp://gdarku42fzpyrfra.onion/gdark/search.php\nhttp://3bbaaaccczcbdddz.onion/\nhttp://visitorfi5kl7q7i.onion/search/\nhttp://xmh57jrknzkhv6y3ls3ubitzfqnkrwxhopf5aygthi7d6rplyvk3noyd.onion/cgi-bin/omega/omega\n\nAll of these are plastered with ads. All of these are also on Tor.\n\nBut please, explain to me like I'm three years old again how I am \"browsing the clearnet\".",
