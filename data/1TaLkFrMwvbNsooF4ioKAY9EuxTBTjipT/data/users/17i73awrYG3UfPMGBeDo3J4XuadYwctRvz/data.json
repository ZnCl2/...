I have learned that making others unhappy to make myself happy is unfulfilling and empty. I feel like we are going too far in sacrificing personal liberties and the only ideology that seems to describe the world accurately is the one I have picked up over time.\n\nI want to live in a world where we don't take advantage of one another, where we can live in peace. I don't need god, its just something I've always returned to, I have sinned and been burned again and again, always returning to my inner peace\n\n\ngood ideas, I am not religions fanatik and respect atheism and non religion philosophical theories",
