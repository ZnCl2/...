[...]\n\nCurrently I'm backing up to SD for on-site given they're cheap and portable. For off-site it's still a toss-up but I'd like to combine tooling and run some scripts for ease of maintenance. I'll duck the 3-2-1. Thanks for sharing.",

No google microsoft dropbox.. Mega is a maybe although I lost access to my account because the site could never load my drive.. if you want to go the long and lasting and most secure route then get a raid storage system or download a automatic fileback up program with atleast 2 drives...\n\nAgreed cloud as a last resort. But I also want 3 copies always. If I back-up online all data will be locally encrypted inside a container of some sort prior to upload. I'm curious to know more about what happened with MEGA? Were you using their API or a GUI client when you lost your account? Note I'm familiar with the MegaUpload story and Dotcom's suggestion not to trust MEGA a couple of years ago due to the Chinese investor.",

But I don't see it in any way aiding privacy.  As for Brave, they've been leaking trackers to Fakebook and Critter for well over two years using a short whitelist. To me that's worse than not blocking anything. Add BAT token to the mix and I'd expect deceptive tracking most've never even seen before.",

At that point you enable Bluetooth and start distributing the Manyverse app to your friends. You rely on off-the-grid communication for a time as infrastructure is restored and Bluetooth Mesh networks are established. The end result is a more fault-tolerant and resilient Web.",
