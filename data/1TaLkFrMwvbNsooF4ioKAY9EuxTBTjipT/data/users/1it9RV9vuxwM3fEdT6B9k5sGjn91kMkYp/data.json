I am currently working on shrinking down the size of the site, and seeing if that works. It is hard for me to believe this 10MB limitation of site size is intentional considering the size of images now these days is about 1MB. Regardless, I just wonder what could be causing this limitation? If it was intentional, what was the reasoning for this? If not, then what factors could be causing this limitation?",

It protects the visitor from accidentally downloading a huge site. Someone could create a 1TB zite and flood your hard drive with garbage.\n\nTrue, but every website I have visited on ZeroNet so far is well above 10MBs in size. \n\nNow, there might be a limitation on the size allowed per site signing. This might be a possibility, and a variable that could be playing a part in this limitation is system processing power and ram amount. Since signing certificates is processor intensive. This is what I am beginning to think might be the situation. But, it still does not make much sense because, the overall load on my system is actually relatively low.",

I scrapped my original site and started completely over, with a completely different webpage, bare as bones, that was under 10MB and, viola! It uploaded without a hitch. Now, I am going to see if I can expand the size of the site now it is signed.",
