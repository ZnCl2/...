You get a lot of truth and then suddenly the hate/blame train rolls in, on YouTube of course. A lot of truth met with spicy hate for whatever dumb reason.\n>The truth gets buried this way.\n\nYou are completely right, this is what is allowed to stay up on YouTube because it is effective at shooing people away from the truth and I'm 100% certain much of these people use it intentionally as a tactic.\n\nOnce you start the notice the tactics you'll see it everywhere, for example: Children are being tortured and raped and THE EARTH IS FLAT! the world is in the hands of a select few people, LIZARD PEOPLE! Governments are poisoning the well (your water) and UFOs EXIST! Ancient people have been far more advanced than we've been told THEY WERE ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS!\n\nIt's up to the viewer to either figure out what is the truth and what is the lie or dismiss both of them. Most people dismiss both I assume.",
