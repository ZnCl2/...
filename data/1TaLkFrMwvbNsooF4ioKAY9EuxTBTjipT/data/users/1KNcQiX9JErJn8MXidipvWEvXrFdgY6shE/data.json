They provide the labor that they deem important and valuable. So if a \"hot chick\" wanted to provide that service, there's nothing stopping her from doing so. But you can't force people to work for you. That's capitalism, not communism.\n\nNot sure if seriously retarded or trolling.\nUSSR was a literal tyranny. A lot of shit happened at gunpoint including forced labor at gulags. Even ignoring all of that, it was a crime to be a bum that just didn't want to work and you could end up in an institution for mental disabilities after some thorough questioning by secret police. Farmers were forced to work in large collective farms instead of working on their own land for themselves and the entire population was permanently stuck in poverty with barely enough to survive.\n\nThe only good commie is a dead one.",

There is nothing more absurd than the \"it wasn't real communism/socialism\" argument.\nHowever few they may be, truly free Americans will understand how to start anew as the urban liberal degenerate hellholes slowly decay and fail. And all of your left vs right theater crap will become clear for all to see as the irrelevant distraction that it is.",

If nothing else I can guarantee that yet more useful idiots like you will lead millions away from natural competition and towards cattle like existence and eventual slaughter. And from the perspective of the cattle it won't matter if the butcher ends up being true free men claiming what they can or the kikes that promised you a communist utopia which ends up in Babylon 2.0 and an overproduction of slaves that need culling once in a while.",
