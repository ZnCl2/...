Though it is closed network (can not be easily utilised by normal clearnet users who do not have it installed), hardly it can be somehow used by all internet users. I think IPFS having javascript (in browser) implementation which should allow (if i am not wrong) utilising IPFS even regular website visitor will not install IPFS software. Unlike IPFS, the ZeroNet is complete package for decentral. website hosting. I do not know better, though there needs to be more developers for the core Zeronet features and fixing already existing bugs. I am surprised why there is only one or very few developers for Zeronet core.\n\nBuild it already!",
