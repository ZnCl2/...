It might not fix the problem, but its a good starting point to get out of the way.\n\n> [nicehat](#comment_1_1LPjWhB47YZwaWoSQH1d2tnj2E3JnMU2cw): It is working for me as well. I do know that they were having problems w/ spam and it got reset or something. You might want to get rid of all the old data that you had for it and start over. Just a though.\n\nnah didn't work cheers for the help though, gonna see if i can connect to it on tor",

I was just pretending\" ?\n\ni think what he is trying to say we have to much time to think about small shit that makes us depressed, someone else made a comment on how we had not evolved to live like the way we do now a days, witch is true a lot of people are depressed because we have disconnected ourselfs with the natural world, we are not suppose to be sitting in massive building watching shit movies and sitting on computers,",
