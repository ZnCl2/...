			"body": "Over the last few days the advertised bandwidth of the tor network has skyrocketed from 400Gbits's to 500Gbits's, which coincides with the appearance of a lot of new people to this interesting piece of tech, me included.\n\nNow I wonder if we are all running a full tor node, a middle node or if there is something else going on, unfortunately I could not find anything anywhere about that, so I decided to ask here, especially since many sites block tor exit nodes, and even middle ones.",
