If you live in the west, black or white or Asian , you got it good.\nYou say slavery is bad, yet you have slave markets in Africa as we speak. Selling black people as slaves.\nChina, well. ask a Uyghur how bad the west is compared to the very lovely Chinese government.\nOr in any country in the middle east. Woman rights, What are those.\n\nSo yeah. I don't care about a criminal who was killed by police. Even if he was black.\nI'm more concerned about china concentration camps and the slave markets that are actually going on en mass.",

Officer Chauvin knew exactly what he was doing, killing George Floyd. [...]\n\nI agree the cop was in the wrong. We have due process for a damn good reason. I am just sick and tried of all this, BURN IT ALL DOWN. over a criminal who was killed.\nShould the cops be better trained, yes. Can improvement be made, yes. Should we idolize criminals and impose polices (disband police) that would only cause endless more harm, DAMN WELL NO.",
