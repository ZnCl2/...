[...]\n\nYour proxy host a lot of zites, so it is a super peer.\nUpdate to the newest zeronet client, other user can use `zeronet_peers= your proxy ip :port` , they can open all zites you proxy host without other tracker. So it is a tracker.\nIn mainland China, all default trackers are blocked. we can easily open zites by use `zeronet_peers` parameter.\nBy the way, what is your proxy's IP, is it a pubilc and  fixed IP ?",
