Back when the country was founded, it was common for people to bring a wooden box into the public square, hop up onto it so that they could be above the crowd and speak their piece. No. It wasn't always great to listen to, but it was the person's right to say it. Over time, that freedom was eroded. Now a person can be arrested for speaking an unpopular thing in public - disturbing the peace, you know. [...]\n\nI think you're an AnCom, communism is normally a very authoritarian system. Not that I dislike authoritarianism as a Fascist, but it just doesn't fit with constitutionalism normally.",
