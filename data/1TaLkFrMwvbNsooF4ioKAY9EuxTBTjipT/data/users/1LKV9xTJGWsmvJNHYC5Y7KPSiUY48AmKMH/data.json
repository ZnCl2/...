Yes, COVID is REAL, but it is also NOT SCARY if you are strictly in the government rules and take recommendations. Wearing mask, social distancing, sanitizing, and being healthy. All of these, you'll still have a normal life. Don't be a dunce just be cause the word 'freedom' or 'liberty' if you don't know how the world works (if you know, please tell me), and you still wanna be alive.\n\nSomeone also have said that COVID is just another flu, and yes it is. But COVID is more dangerous because the infected can widely spread the virus without any symtoms for around 14 days, and vaccines are not widely available yet, even worse now UK had a new type of virus that is more effective the the original one. These are the reason why COVID have killed millons.",
