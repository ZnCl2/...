			"body": "Używam ZeroNet w wersji windowsowej na maszynie Windows 10 x64. Włączyłem autorun w aplikacji by uruchamiał ZeroNet wraz z startem Windowsa. Problem, który dostrzegłem to dodatek tor tak jakby nie ładuje się poprawnie ponieważ mam ciągle Tor:oczekiwanie. Dopiero po zabiciu procesu tor.exe i ponownym uruchomieniu zeronet.exe tor jest otwarty. Czy ktoś zna sposób rozwiązania tego błędu ?\n\nI am using ZeroNet in Windows version on Windows 10 x64 (don't have 7 or ubuntu). I just enabled autorun in zeronet app to run it automaticly with windows. Problem is that the tor addon is not loading correctly. There is somethink like tor:waiting all the time on main site. When I kill the process tor.exe and rerun zeronet.exe manually tor is working correctly. Anyone know the resolution to correct this issue ?\n\nSorry for PL - it suppose to be in polish forum but in some way it comes in english forum. ",
