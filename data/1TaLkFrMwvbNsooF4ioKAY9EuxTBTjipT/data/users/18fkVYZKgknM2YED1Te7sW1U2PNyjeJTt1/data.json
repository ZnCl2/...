There are sections of Zeronet which do move lots of traffic. they don't need much help from anyone. But I'd argue that one of the things holding Zeronet back with the lesser used sites is that it lacks a single \"I want to seed everything\" button. The decision to omit that function was insane.\n\nOpen the right-side panel to seed all optional files.",
