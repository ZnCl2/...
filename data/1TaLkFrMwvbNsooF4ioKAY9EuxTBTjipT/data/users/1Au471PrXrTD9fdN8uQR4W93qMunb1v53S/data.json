For example, can i submit date of  new topic at zeroNet to any time before implementation of zeroNet platform?, if i change source code of zero net or zerotalk? Why, If can not?\n2. Related to last question, can i use random function? Can i validate generated random number at other nodes? For example i have an random coin generator at a game and dont wanna they change coins manually. I know its not client-server, but i need a way. \nAt other example: imagine you have a random movement at a game and your clinet should be move base on this random movement.\n3. Can i make websocket connection between peers? Can i have peers ip by ZeroFrame.js?\n\nSry for my English and thank you.",

But the problem is security of the list. \nidea 2 : ZeroNet owners can handle this list because they are controlling current blacklist plugin. And they are only checking websites that peaple voting.\nIdea 3 : each ZeroNet client can define content controller service before Hello page. for example we have government content controller service, ZeroNet Content Controller service and peaple made controller service. So, the user can choose one of them to continue browsing zites.\nThere is many other ways.  They can fix problem if they talk about that. ZeroNet is free to use in any way, but should be controlled on default settings. Like some websites that asking peaple are you +18 and how old are you, for example.",
