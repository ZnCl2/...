At first in my opinion we should create different forks of zerohello with more zites. These forks must be included in different installers created for different usages. The Second things to to is to fix the zites already online (for example ifs needs the features to seed specific Channel or the ability to Switch from download and streaming) and lastly we should also fork the core of the project, but i my opinion we must keep the retrocompatibility with the original project (for example using plugin). When an user Will want to access a zite that require a specific plugin (like streamz) a specific webpage must inviate him to download the specific plugin/installers.
