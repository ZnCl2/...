			"body": "Hello all, I'm new to ZeroNet, so pardon if this question has already been answered. I've tried Googling and searching on here, but can't find anything so far. \n\nI was thinking about one potential problem that I see for spreading ZeroNet is the accessibility of websites. Typing out extremely long public keys, or even simple .bit domain after 127.0.0.1 I think to some people might get annoying. \n\nHas anyone tried to simplify this by creating a browser extension that removes the localhost ip? Further more, would there be a way to realistically create a free DNS using a decentralized network that ultimately ran through a third party browser\n\nThe idea would be:\n\nThird Party Browser (TPB) -> User inputs domain, ie (google.zero, google.randomdomainhere) -> TPB queries something like 127.0.0.1/long-public-key-pointing-to-DNS/place-where-DNS-lookup-is-performed -> if the domain has been registered in the free DNS, you are redirected to the localhost/public-key/ but what the user sees is the domain they typed.",
