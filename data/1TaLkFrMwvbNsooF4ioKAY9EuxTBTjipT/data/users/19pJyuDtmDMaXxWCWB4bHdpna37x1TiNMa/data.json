			"title": "Taking ZeroNet a step further",
			"body": "If adoption of ZeroNet ever seriously kicks off by the masses, I think it would be amazing if we could eliminate the internet connection all together.\n\nProjects like Broadband-Hamnet use WiFi routers to connect amateur radio operators together, and I'm unable to find it now but I distinctly remember an Android app that used mesh WiFi and Bluetooth to create a twitter-like social network without an internet connection.\n\nOf course, you'd have to be in range of another person running the app or someone with a modified router. But if you're using an app on your phone, it could run in the background and connect to another phone to synchronize content between them, that device will later see another device running ZeroNet and synchronize content, and so on.\n\nThis is just a dream of mine, we'd need many people to adopt ZeroNet for this to actually be viable. A few years ago I ran that app I mentioned non-stop for months as I traveled and not once did it find another device to connect to.\n\nBut maybe someday",

You need either fido-like system or something like LoRaWAN but fast enough. It is essential to make communication at least in scale about 10-100km.\nThat's a good idea! Use something like that as a backbone AND use WiFi or something near field for \"legacy\" devices to synchronize with each other.",
