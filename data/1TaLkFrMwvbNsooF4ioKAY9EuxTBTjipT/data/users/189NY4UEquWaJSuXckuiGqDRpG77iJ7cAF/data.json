But if it's not for something to do with time critical job u'd better not take advantage of its INPUT(write) performance since SSD wears off whenever INPUT access (writing to SSD) being triggered. [...]\n\nI have never had an SSD fail due to writing. If SSD should fail, it will do so in short time from purchase. I still have my first 60GB SSD, another set 2x128GB as cache running sometime a few TB/day of writes. Trust me, that small writes from web cache will not kill it. Keep your eye on media wearout and you will be fine.",

Neither did even with SD cards of mine) [...]\n\nI only have one TLC SSD, 128GB after writing 2.5TB still has 98% of lifespan according to smart. So even small TLC drives can ingest hundreds of TB before failing. However, I do not consider buying QLC SSD, but not due to their much worse write endurance but low sequential write speed after filling pseudo-SLC cache (writing to QLC directly can be as low as 50-70MB/s so worse than HDD).",
