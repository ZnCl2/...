				"body": "one can also doubt his own existence because the only mean to prove it is his subjective feelings, that are not rational.\nSo the world can only be viewed by subjective feelings and we as species tried to rationalize it with a subjective tool named the brain\n\nMaybe the brain is also a common delusion to make us feel there is a world and us whereas there is nothing but a magnificent optical, sensory, logical hallucination of senses.\n\nmaybe right now time, energy, physics, all of human perceptions are only an entertainment for logical and sensible mind to divert them that there is more than this game ,and in order to see the other level ,one must not reject but not absorb like a dogma any knowledge even it's not proven to only stimulate his creativity and see the escape of this maze trough reflexion, empathy, logic , philosophy, art\n\nThe only desirable exit of the maze is with imagination\n\nIf you end of natural death = reincarnation\nif you suicide you = reincarnation\nif you think and study, play, don't restrain your imagination= maybe you will find a way out of this magnificient conceptual maze\n\nSo is there any god exist or not,I think: my sensory perception by my brain can trick me to think there is.\n\nbrain is not reliable because of optical illusion, sensory bias, human logic, limited capacity in data volume input, short term vision\n\nany person that are in a system can only make speculation of what is to be like out of their system. We are in this universe to know his rules and to go outside of it if it is possible. The universe is like an egg who is waiting to be cracked to let creatures move freely once and for all.\n\nMy vision engage only me but if it inspire you to have good thoughts, help others, find beauty in the imagination and the universe take it at your own.\n\nEven a prisoner can be outside of his cage if  he imagine outside the bondaries of human perception, logic, rules, dogma and social bdsm.\n\nSome genious are crazy because they let enter the light of creativity.\n\nLife rise into the void, triumphant, evolving, filing any void she can, So if there is god it's life because life win every battle.",
