			"body": "Wanna know how to make god laugh? Tell him about your plans.. :)\n&nbsp;\n.. I'm still planning on dropping out for good this time. Nothing has changed with this year's classes, even with the new teachers. The classes are of no use to me .. I'm still merely borrowing time and money to survive.\n&nbsp;\nI'd have to find some way to live on 200NZD a week (145USD). Then just live on the absolute bare minimum .. growing vegetables, canning food. Mine cryptocurrency as a supplement. Grow and sell cannabis, if I have to. Hunt down online scammers and fraudsters for sport .. infect their servers with cryptocurrency miners. Just do absolutely anything that it takes to get the free time that I need to pursue my passion projects.. well, except ask for donations. I don't want to become a criminal .. my aspiration is to be more of an innovator, pioneer .. but yeeaahhh, being a pioneer doesn't pay the bills .. so this would be one way of funding my leisure time.\n&nbsp;\n..I don't know .. I guess I'd rather sell some sacks and hunt down mobsters, than ask for donations. Donations don't seem to give you that same 'breadwinner buzz', so to speak. They can also be somewhat influencing .. I'd hate to think that I have to 100% live up to a donor's expectations. I like to give and contribute, but I don't wanna be a people-pleaser. \n&nbsp;\nMy original plan of living off the grid may have sounded far-fetched .. but that doesn't mean you can't find a sweet spot in the middle.. and just slowly withdraw from this suckass society, like coming off of an opiate. Getting out of the comfort zone. \n&nbsp;\nOf course, the only way to abandon the comfort zone is to realize that it's no longer a comfort zone. I've already tried fitting in with the corporate, full-time 9-5 life .. about a dozen times .. for about 7 years now .. and it didn't pan out. I've tried college .. and that, too .. is slowly beginning to eat me up, despite having felt excited about it for the first couple of months. Living in this society has become like a crippling terminal disease, and I have to act quickly.\n&nbsp;\nMy high school friend just came to visit me yesterday, too. It was his weekend off. He was wearing pajamas in his car .. driving around aimlessly, ordering takeaways. All I could remember coming out of this mouth were the words: 'I hate my job'. \n&nbsp;\nFrom that moment, I thought to myself  .. man, I don't ever wanna be like that. Work 9-5, come home .. be all tired as fuck, have no energy to work on the things you love. Eat takeaway, drink beer. Fall asleep. Rinse and repeat. Fuck that shit. \n&nbsp;\nNow that I already have a good enough PC, I can continue working on my deep learning projects. Build robots. Build drones. Buy a 3d printer. That's all I wanna do .. and I wanna do it 100% my way. Without anybody watching my back or telling me what time I need to get out of bed, what operating system I should use, how I should dress, how I should talk to customers, etc. My way.",

I can understand being pissed off at the state of the world, but this is just whiny. \n&nbsp;\nGun control will not solve the problem of US shootings - the world needs Self Control. \n&nbsp;\nI would have hoped that Generation Z would turn out to be more conservative and level-headed than us sad millennials, but it seems like it .. ... could actually be even worse. lol\n&nbsp;\nApparently, she admitted to bullying the boy who committed the shooting. This could just be right-wing conspiracy though, but I wouldn't be surprised. She seems to be hiding something.\n&nbsp;\nHopefully, once robots take over all jobs .. and once a Basic Income is introduced .. we can all just calm our tits and chillax to cat videos and dank memes, instead of doing all this embarrassing extremist shit.",

			"body": "Sometimes I wish I could have been born in the US. You guys should consider yourselves lucky. \n&nbsp;\nThe minute you criticize Jacinda Ardern for raising taxes on fuel (supposedly as an attempt to save the environment..) .. you get treated like a misogynistic, sexist monster. You get called a racist for even suggesting that English should be the official language.\n&nbsp;\n.. this likely means that the conservatives will have the 2020 election in the bag. Labour will fail to provide the change that this country needs, and we will be back to square zero. Back to the way things were in 2010. And the minute you warn them of this, you take an even harder beating .. and they downvote the fuck out of you.\n&nbsp;\nThis actually really hurts to see. Maybe this could be my motivation to get the fuck out of this country, and maybe apply for IT jobs in America .. start over. I hate the 9-5 corporate world, but I'd be willing to grind it out with clenching teeth .. if it means not having to be here in this depressing backwater. I know you guys have Trump .. but trust me .. Trump is a gift in disguise. Trump will pave the way for better politicians in future. If we had a Trump here in New Zealand, I'd vote for him any time. \n&nbsp;\nI agree with Julian Assange now.. sorry that it took me a while. It looks like he did have a valid point. Establishment politics needs to die, first and foremost. If it means electing some jackass just to spark the flame of revolution, then so be it.\n&nbsp;\nHaving said that, I'm not making any immediate plans. I'll keep doing what I'm doing, keep smuggin'. Just live in the moment, lead by example. Adopt anarchism as a way of life. Work hard on the things that matter to me. You gotta work hard, even if you hate the idea of having a job. You gotta have sickening work ethic to get anything done, especially the things you are passionate about.\n&nbsp;\nI still love this country, but man .. these people need to have some cold water dropped on them.",

I skipped college today, and have mainly been browsing twitter.. but I feel just as unenthusiastic as yesterday, although nowhere near as bad.\n&nbsp;\nThe political sphere seems to be so disintegrated and chaotic right now, it no longer makes sense to pick a side. You can, however, side with individuals - and in my eyes, Assange represents Revolution. I wouldn't care if he were secretly a Trump supporter, or a Putin supporter .. Putin and Trump are merely political tricksters, and we kinda need them in order to call out the hypocrisies of neoliberalism .. as awful and tyrannical as they may seem. Putin has also recently spoken out against the shooting of protestors at Gaza.\n&nbsp;\nI seem to be addicted to energy drinks, too. My caffeine tolerance is through the roof. ^^\n&nbsp;\nAnywhoo..\n&nbsp;\nI'm ready to bomb Israel, and force Ecuador to unblock Julian Assange.
