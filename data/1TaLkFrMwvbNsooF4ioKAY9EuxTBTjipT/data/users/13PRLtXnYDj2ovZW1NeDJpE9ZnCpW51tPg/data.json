The only books actually banned are books that contain illegal things like perverted crap.This \"they're banning books!\" is mixing up Cancel Culture with Banning.Cancel Culture is when people decide as a group not to support something.That's just people exercising their rights.Some may even protest to companies, which is also their right.But it's not law.Anyway, it's Conservatives that have a history of banning books.Liberals just point to harmful media. How is that \"hiding\" anything if they're pointing to it as an example of destructive media?\n\nwrong cancel culture or wokism is a front for the take over of the usa... rather than wanting to not be exposed to something (mute user) they want to ban to have full control of discourse, speech, and then liberty and then your assets and even body (specially the one of your children).",
