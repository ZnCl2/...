			"body": "The more compromise is made, the more dangerous it can be!\n\nSome policy adjustments can embolden the expansion of terrorism.  The description of China as the most dangerous rival of America is now adjusted to be a strategic competitor. \n\nTherefore, terrorism activities increase rapidly on the planet. Taliban regime rose again in Afghanistan, while millions of illegal immigrants pour into America, which \n##further accelerates the spread of coronavirus mutations. \n\nIn order to curb own over-crazy conflicts, mutual deterrence strategy has to be strengthened, with the emergence of Australia as a nuclear power after the Aukus deal was done. \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/09/17/australia/nuclear-submarines-aukus-explainer-intl-hnk-ml/index.html \n\nSmaller nations have to unite up and act in concert.   \nThe China-Lithuania Rift Is a Wake-Up Call for Europe \nhttps://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/22/china-lithuania-taiwan-eu-nato/   \n\nMore and more people see the necessity to enhance relationships with Taiwan. At the same time, it’s also clear that no one would like to see a crazy nuclear war occur between a few nuclear powers. \n\nSo some flexible tactics should be adopted. \n\nDuring the cold war time, in order to better fight against the former Soviet Union, an **ambiguous strategy** was adopted by the USA on the definition of China — it's not an important matter whether it'd be represented by Republic of China (Min Guo) that respects the modern civilization based on Three Principles Of The People as advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, or by Communism Dictatorship China which boasted itself to be a \"People's Republic of China\", but in fact tramped upon human rights like ants, and should better be defined as an atheism dictatorship jungle, or at least **NOT a republic**, as could be seen by more and more people.\n\nAt this unusual stage of history, all nations who seek to enhance relationships with Taiwan may adopt a flexible policy to promote the good.  During the process to resume the diplomatic relationships, a clear statement can be made as follows: \n**(The statement is a draft, the bilingual edition will be more powerful.)**\n\n##Statement on Taiwan Relations and One China Policy \n\nTaiwan represents the Republic of China. All the civilized nations on the planet **respect One China Policy** as much as they cherish the reality of **only One Planet suitable for human civilization in the Milky Way**, and therefore all the people over the world encourage a peaceful **reunification of China** based on the Three Principles Of The People as represented by Republic of China. The Constitutional Democracy inherited by ROC was also firmly pursued by many Red Noblemen. One prominent example is Xi Zhong Xun, who was the father of Emperor Xi Ji Pin. \n\nIn the past, many people in the West attached importance to trade and economic cooperation with the CCP regime.  Those activities were mainly triggered by Westerners’ respect of Emperor Xi's father Mr Xi Zhong Xun who fought bravely against the brutal persecution by the Cultural Revolution in China and made great contribution to the Reform and Opening revolution in the 1980's. \n\nTo keep the Reform and Opening policy will help keep better transparency, and fight better against the Coronavirus. \n####It complies with the glorious history of Xi's family legacy.  \nIt deserves nationwide support by the whole Chinese nation, by all Chinese netizens and soldiers.  \n\nThe Global Coronavirus needs global efforts by all countries on the planet. For the emergence of a new civilization, when necessary, the civilized nations may resume efforts on promotion of the special relationships with mainland, China. \n\nSimplified Chinese Version:\n...\n\nTraditional Chinese Version:\n...\n[Special Tactics —  bilingual edition ](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HMLvnRWViMnuvZc5LK4Dm86sZNcSH1jdh/?Topic:1632475029_1DXZmTjSE5xjmyx2NiH3jpbKQ3UTCuu9gY/Special+Tactics)\n\n##Remarks: \nThe spread of Coronavirus all over the world has proven that \nif there's no freedom of speech in East Asia, there's no freedom of breath for people in Europe or America either! \n\nTo secure free expansion of Christendom in East Asia has become a mission for our generation. It concerns the living environment of the global civilization, as the Covid19 affects the freedom of breath by all people on the planet, whether they are senior tycoons or young children!  \n\nAs the atheism regime doesn’t allow any physical organization by civilians in mainland China, Pearl Peace sees some special ways to launch a Peaceful Revolution in China. \n\nThere's a huge number of population on the vast land of China, among whom quite some people are still brainwashed by the atheism regime. The Peace Revolution in China will be a little different from other countries. \n\nTraditional Confucius culture often emphasizes loyalty to the country (to the emperor in the past).  Many people made mistakes to support CCP leader Xi Jin Ping, due to their respect of Xi Jin Ping’s father Xi Zhong Xun who did fight bravely against the Oppression by the Atheism Regime itself, and for the Reform and Opening revolution in the 1980's.  \n\nMany people’s mindset is still limited by the Confucius medieval theory of loyalty. In order to reduce the scale of potential conflicts to the minimum level, the best way to launch Peace Revolution is to appeal to all Chinese people to protect the glorious history of Xi's family legacy left by Xi Zhong Xun, as Xi Zhong Xun himself supports Constitutional Democracy with freedom of speech, freedom to worship God.  \n\nIn short, Peace Revolution in the name of protection of Emperor Xi’s glorious family legacy can avoid large scale bloody massacre in the potential conflicts, since many military people’s mindset is still limited by the medieval Confucius loyalty. \n\n\n\n## Additional information: \nJust like the mistaken judgement by some Second-generation Red Aristocrats, it’s really unimaginable that the glorious honor of Xi Jin Ping's family legacy left by his father Xi Zhong Xun could be so brutally destroyed!!  \nIn order to remediate the severe situation, Civilized Nations appeal righteous people all over the world, including Chinese people, Chinese army, and those grassroot CCP members who still admire Xi Zhong Xun’s bravery in fighting against dictatorship, to stand up together, restore Constitutional Democracy in China, which was promised and pursued by the first-generation Red Aristocrats, many of whom respect Xi Zhong Xun’s special efforts in fighting against the Cultural Destruction!!\n\nThe above will be enough to launch a special Propaganda War, which will accelerate the collapse of the Atheism Gang of the FAKE CCP. \n\nWith the acceleration of the CCP’s collapse, sustainable development of human civilization can be kept for many generations!  \n\nSome details are discussed by cyberspace activists on ZeroNet (https://zeronet.io/), a highly-encrypted platform based on Bitcoin technology.",

So after brainwashing hundreds of millions of people in East Asia, ** if they can govern the whole world by terrorism dictatorship, the result will be that they will NOT be punished by anyone, instead, the whole planet will belong to them, with global slavery system in place of the Democratic System, and American culture perished on Earth!  **\n\nThis is the most fundamental reason why after Coronavirus kills many people in the world, the atheism gang doesn't repent at all, but becomes more crazy instead, openly threatening the whole mankind by nuclear suicide war. \n\nThere're many other details to be presented step by step. \n\nHowever, before those detailed jobs are done. \nAnyone who doubts the viciousness of the Atheism Gang of the FAKE CCP in China, will agree to the above logic of the deadly criminal or not? \n\nIf you don't agree, and hope to give some arguments that'd benefit those criminals, please put forward your argument.",
