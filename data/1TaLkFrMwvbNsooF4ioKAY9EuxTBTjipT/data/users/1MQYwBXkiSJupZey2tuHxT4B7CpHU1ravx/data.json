If you're running a server then you might want to check out RHEL or CentOS... maybe even OpenSUSE Leap or Debian Stable... however if you wish to have a good stable end-user experience on desktop then perhaps something like Ubuntu or Fedora are more of your thing or maybe... openSUSE Leap. Also don't try running KDE Plasma as your desktop since it has some issues even if it looks pretty decent. Gnome is more stable. Same with XFCE.",
