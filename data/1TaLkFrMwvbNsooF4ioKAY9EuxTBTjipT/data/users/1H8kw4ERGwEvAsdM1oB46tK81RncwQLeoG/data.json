Because they don't go looking for it.\n\nThis is a board. One of many on 08chan. Any of which can be mirrored INDEPENDENTLY. True, there is a risk that someone will post something objectionable even to this board....because Zeronet has no moderation. \n\nMANY believe that's a feature - not a defect. And they tire of prissy clearnet fools like yourself trying to bring their diseases here.\n\nGo back to Reddit dipshit. You don't belong here.",

Existing copies are still out there.\n\nFor a time being bid up to ridiculous prices on Ebay - until Ebay stopped it. You do see the merit of offering his complete works for free as a means of punishing this company?\n\nAnything posted to ZeroNet is potentially forever - especially if you break your signing key.",
