Even if oil was seriously going to run out, it would make the economic incentive for new energy sources so tremendous that we'd see amazing innovations in energy production. We already have nuclear power and electromagnetic engines anyway, we could run out of oil this decade and handle it just fine, but we won't run out.\n\nIm afraid its not so easy. Uranium is running out as well...",
