				"body": "Trump and his supporters don't care who you love or hate, who you worship or not, who you have sex with, what race you are and other things. As compared to Democrats, its their way or they hate you. Hitler was a \"socialist\". How did that work out?? No form of socialism as ever worked except in the Garden of Eden and man screwed that up.\n\nTrump did not slip on a banana peel. He gave the order to kill the bastard. He did not make the plan, he did not carry out the action but, he did have the balls to give the order unlike the 3 presidents before him. Iraq did not order to remove US special forces. Their parliament voted to remove ALL US forces out of Iraq. A vote that has no teeth.  So, from what you are saying you support the fact that the dead general has over saw/ordered the deaths of hundreds of people and you are ok with it. Move to Iran..Good luck over there.",
