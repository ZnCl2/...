			"body": "Hello,\n\nif i decide to share/seed some of my files (example on ZeroUp, KopyKate, ZeroLSTN), the files will be copied over to the zeronet directory which means it will be on two spots on the HDD which is not effective, especially when one want to share large amount of data. I know Windows has some symbolic linking software like mklink https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc753194(v=ws.10).aspx or [Dirlinker](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=dirlinker)\nBut more automation is needed, i found http://rayburnsoft.net/dc.html which may find same files and replace duplicate files with symbolic/hard links, but in my case it not worked.\n\nWhat is hard link:\n\"Hard link: a mirrored copy of a target file that does not take up additional space on the hard drive. Cannot span across partitions or drives. Will still work if the original file is moved or deleted.\"\n\nAnyone tried some de-duplication/symlinking SW it or know about other (preferably automatic) solution to this issue?\n\nFor Linux, there are certainly scripts/commands to do the linking and automate it: https://superuser.com/a/969355/590209\n\n-------------------\nUpdate: I have some news,\n\n[Duplicate commander](http://rayburnsoft.net/dc.html) worked good, except when i checked KopyKate, videos shown unrecognized MIME type, apparently ZeroNet or KopyKate does not work with resulting .symlink files. It does not follow windows links (.symlink files) and hardlinks are not possible between different HDDs though both have NTFS system. So if you have duplicates across one drive only, you may try to use this app and create hard links, maybe ZeroNet will \"follow them\".\n\n[NoClone](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1GNTAKCimBv5xEnt7QvkDn8sTkEPj7ZYTL/?NoClone) is paid SW and it works good to find and auto-replace duplicity with shortcuts or hardlinks, but only hardlinks works in zeronet.\n\n[jdupes](https://github.com/jbruchon/jdupes/releases) Windows command line tool should also be working if your duplicate files are both on one drive, not across multiple drives.\nCopy jdupes.exe to C:\\Windows\nThen open command line: Win.+R or click start menu and then type cmd\n\nShow duplicates:\njdupes --recurse --size C:\\ZeroNet\\data\\18Pfr2oswXvD352BbJvo59gZ3GbdbipSzh C:\\Videa\n\nReplace them with hard links:\njdupes --recurse --linkhard C:\\ZeroNet\\data\\18Pfr2oswXvD352BbJvo59gZ3GbdbipSzh C:\\Videa\n\n(Backup the source folder (C:\\ZeroNet... one) before executing. Check --noprompt flag.)\n\n----\nEven if ZeroNet/KopyKate follow .symlink, there later can be problem once you move destination files to different location. How to bulk [update many symlinks](https://www.google.com/search?q=symlink+editor+OR+manager) burried deep in ZeroNet folder structures?! I think i will have to keep Zeronet on same drive on which are original files and then try hardlinks or get a NAS that features some automatic file de-duplication. FreeNAS that is using ZSF filesystem does it or Rockstor, but these require machine with at least 8GB of free RAM in order for deduplication mechanism to work.",

The tutorial on how to:\n- discover zeronet address of the site of which we know only its .bit address\n- discover address of the original site from which the clone (cloned site) was made/created\n- discover where some site's files are stored on PC\n\nQuick video tutorial: http://127.0.0.1:43110/big.kopykate.bit/?Video=1516319766_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS\n\nIn text mode, it is like this:\n\n--Discover real zeronet address of the .bit--\nWhen you visit .bit site, right click somewhere and select to show source code. There on the bottom you will find real zeronet address. Another way is under zite menu (the \"0\" button in right top corner)\n\n--Discover real zeronet address of the expired .bit domain--\nIf the .bit domain was not renewed, you probably can no longer access the zite via .bit address, but despite that, zite can be accessible under its zeronet address if you know it. To discover this address, you can access [ZeroHello](http://127.0.0.1:43110) and search there for the .bit domain name if you can find its real address. If can not and you know you already visited this .bit domain (and thus have the zite stored on your PC) then on ZeroHello next to the zeronet logo (top left corner) click dots. Click \"Show data directory\" and then use the search function of your file manager/your OS to search for \"domainnamehere.bit\" inside all files in that zeronet data directory and its subdirectories. Better to refine search to look only in .json or content.json files. You should find a directory that match the zite address. On Linux: maybe try command: grep -Ri \"domainname.bit\" /path/to/zeronet/data/*/content.json\n\n--Discover cloned site original--\nGo to [ZeroHello](http://127.0.0.1:43110) and next to the zeronet logo (top left corner) click dots. Click \"Show data directory\" and then use the search function of your file manager/your OS to search for the zite address in that directory.

			"body": "Hello,\n\nwhen i register on a ZeroTalk cloned site and after a few months i reach 50kB quota on published content. Once the zite gets abandoned by its owner, i can no longer post unless i delete my old content which makes no solution, also creating new user account somehow will make me loose track of a responses to my old account posts. Being unable to post new content because of reached limit on admin abandoned zites i see as a serious problem. Am i wrong?\n\nOn ZeroTalk i am almost reaching the quota and even site is not abandoned, i waited some time to have my limit slightly increased manually by @nofish . I do not think this is clever to leave quota increasing and spam management only to one person who will die (everyone will). Instead there should be some mechanism (enabled by default) where established users will be UNable or hardly be able to reach posting quota on sites where admin abandoned it.\n\nI propose following solutions:\n\nA) Automatically increase user/s quota as time goes. Example increase to be equal to one or two average comments daily.\nB) zeroid.bit will introduce functions that will allow zites to evaluate if user is a bot or quality user (age of account, daily post count, up/down votes ratio, number of flagged/reported posts) to determine if the user's quota should be automatically increased. Users rated as high quality may approve other users request to increase quota or even help clean the zite from spam.\nC) introduce anti-bot system (series of questions/antibot tasks to confirm certain actions like muting user, flagging post as inappropriate/SPAM) based on this, some users can be identified as a likely spammer, other user can be rated as a not spammer and qualify for automatic or half automatic quota increase.",

And i got helpful advices that worked to setup new ID providers. I set new ID provider name as \"nanasi\" (because many zites mention this name) and the authorization menu on my zite shown an option to register new username with this provider. The destination zite that was opened was: http://127.0.0.1:43110/nanasi (invalid, does not contain .bit extension)\n\nSo in my zite code i changed ID provider name to \"nanasi.bit\".\n\nWhen searching other zites, i found that many people mention \"nanasi\" (not nanasi.bit) as an ID provider. So my question if that is problem when i use nanasi.bit and other zites use nanasi ? What issues it can cause? Will it mean that my username that i will register with nanasi.bit will be incompatible with other zites that are using .bit less ID provider name (nanasi)?\n\nWhen i changed ID provider name in my zite code, from nanasi to nanasi.bit, i no longer can switch to this identity provider (the menu item with my registered username@nanasi is grayed out as a result of changing nanasi to nanasi.bit in zite config.). (That may seem like [an issue](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1272) )\n\nWhich makes me doubt about my login compatibility between zites when ID provider name on one zite is nanasi and on other is nanasi.bit\nMy concern is that when someone @mention me, i should be in all cases notified to ZeroHello.\nAnother thing i do not understand is when same username is used by multiple people across different ID providers. When someone mention that username (@username), then all these people will get notified via ZeroHello?\n\nRelated reading from docs:\nhttps://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/cert_authority/#usage-in-contentjson\nhttps://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/#certselect-accepted_domains",

There should be some field for the filtering whole list of files by file name. But i have sorted files by size on ZeroHello/Files tab and not found such file so i have suspection i may be having file that no one knows i have (is not \"indexed\") and it is just wasting my disk space. Maybe because of the bug in the zite or \"rebuild\" database of the zite, do not know.\n\nin the content.db file which is ~70MB i found the file, though it is hard to discover something from that file because of its size and being not human friendly and so i can not delete anything from this file. So while i found the file in that content.db, does it mean ZeroNet is aware of the file and it will offer it to the peers?\n\nWhen i delete it just from my HDD and do \"Recheck\" files of the site (KopyKate in this case), will it remove the file from sharing or how to remove these files properly?\n\nIf i want to delete/unpin/unshare the file, i am stuck as it is not easy to be found on ZeroHello/Files tab.",

Make sure to:\n\n1. update zeronet ([ZeroHello](/), three dots menu next to logo and click zeronet version number menu entry)\n2. visit all important sites on which you participated during November and do some update action like updating your post, upvote, posting new content.\nEspecialy important sites like ZeroTalk, ZeroMe or others where you published alot of content.\n3. If you modified your own site (Sign and publish) then the bug may caused you published \"empty\" content.json which indicate no site files. Your site may work locally, but others see no index.html error. So after updating zeronet to latest revision, go and again \"Sign and publish\" your site (example from its (0) menu).\n4. Also this bug appears to caused others being unable to send you message on ZeroMail (they see error: \"No publickey for user *\"), so try to send [someone an e-mail](/Mail.ZeroNetwork.bit/?to=SSDifnskdjfnsdjk) or delete some e-mails causing site to update your profile. That should allow others to contact you again :)\n\nBug details: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1790",

Though it is complicated and not easy for GUI user.\n\n(1) find zeronet directory and its \"data\" sub-folder, enter the data folder and backup users.json file (contains sensitive important information regarding ones identities and also followed topics on various sites including zerotalk.\n\n> cd /path/to/ZeroNet/data;cp -p users.json users.json_$(date --rfc-3339=date)\n\n(2) then open original users.json file in graphical editor, find your identity section by searching your identity masterseed (on [ZeroHello](/) top bar buttons, click username button and show & copy masterseed)\n\n(3) once masterseed found, search down the site address on which you want to follow all topics. In my case ZeroTalk: 1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT\n\nit may be like second occurrence, where you see the section like:\n\n     \"1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT\": {\n        \"auth_address\": \"***\", \n        \"auth_privatekey\": \"***\", \n        \"cert\": \"zeroid.bit\", \n        \"follow\": {\n          \"Comments in this topic\": [\n            \"SELECT 'comment' AS type, comment.added AS date_added, topic.title, commenter_user.value || ': ' || comment.body AS body, topic_creator_json.directory AS topic_creator_address, topic.topic_id $\n            [\n              \"1_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS\", \n              \"1514096881_19WW28sn46rz9h15xf6NCELPdzxZ2YhbyB\", \n              \"1514127848_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS\", \n              \"1514146919_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS\", \n\nlast 4 lines is the list of topics we are currently following on ZeroTalk site. It contains also other people topics. The format can be different (all at one line).\n\n(4) Remove occurrences that contain your public key (find yours in the URL of one of your topics). In next step we append complete list of your topics instead.\n\n(5) Run Linux command:\n\n> for i in $(grep -Rihs \"_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS\\\\\": \\\\[\" /path/to/ZeroNet/data/1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT/data/|cut -d '\"' -f2|grep '.\\\\{34\\\\}'|sort -u|grep -v Binary);do echo \"\\\"$i\\\",\";done\n\n(can take some time, output should be all my topics)\n\n_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS = my public key, find yours in the URL of one of your topics\n1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT - address of the site for which i want to extract my topics_\n\n(6) add the output to the place where we deleted own topics in step 3. Make sure all lines ends by comma (some will not end!!), except last line, example:\n\n        \"follow\": {\n          \"Comments in this topic\": [\n            \"SELECT 'comment' AS type, comment.added AS date_added, topic.title, commenter_user.value || ': ' || comment.body AS body, topic_creator_json.directory AS topic_creator_address, topic.topic_id $\n            [\n              \"1_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS\", \n              \"1514096881_19WW28sn46rz9h15xf6NCELPdzxZ2YhbyB\", \n             \"1548336532_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS\", \n              \"1548241961_153dW34Ng5fVUZ5D5NcZRfAbvRQS1jYC1k\"  <- HERE\n            ]\n          ], \n\nyou can paste 1 topic/1 line or all at one line, just keep syntax:\nA) [\"number_pubkey\",\"number_pubkey\"]\nor B)\n[\"number_pubkey\",\n\"number_pubkey\",\n\"number_pubkey\"]\nor combination\n\n(7) Restart zeronet (on [ZeroHello](/) next to the logo is three dots menu where you click zeronet version)\nI think publishing changes is not needed.

They could accomplish this goal by adding domains such as privateinternetaccess.com to the Unified Register of Prohibited Information – where the domains of over 100 VPN services already sit – and having ISPs, telecoms, and compliant VPN services, block access to the URL. The law does not prohibit personal VPN use and doesn’t specify use of any of the DPI techniques used by the Great Firewall of China – and Putin himself has indicated earlier this year at the G20 Summit that Russia will take a separate path from China in terms of internet censorship.\"\n\n[2 years back, @ZAlex posted](/1MeFqFfFFGQfa1J3gJyYYUvb5Lksczq7nH/?Post/1RedkCkVaXuVXrqCMpoXQS29bwaqsuFdL/1LWuc6JBhUGrKEAh1aPrPU85dEMcKmg3pS/1492419881) following on his ZeroMe: \"Roskomnadzor (the Russian Federal Agency responsible for censorship of the Internet) [asked](https://geektimes.ru/post/288166/) VPN providers to block sites that are banned in Russia.\"\n\nSo does Russia already enforced blocking of the domestic/foreign VPN providers sites who does not want to apply russia site blacklist?

			"body": "When one post on the zeronet site which does not feature edit button and want to edit or remove the comment, here is what to do:\n\n1. open that site and mouse drag & drop the (0) corner button to the left to open menu\n2. scroll down to find IDENTITY ADDRESS and copy it\n3. scroll up and click \"OPEN SITE DIRECTORY\" (or open the site directory manually zeronet/data/siteaddress/)\n4. once you are in that directory, go to subdirectory data/users/YOURIDENTITYADDRESS/ and check content.json and data.json files\n5. you will find your text which you want to edit or delete.\n\nBefore you do any modification, copy all the text in that file into clipboard (memory) and paste it to a safe place so you can restore if something go wrong!!\n\n**A) DELETING**\n\nRegarding deleting, here is example part of the data.json content:\n\n```{\n\t\"file\": {},\n\t\"comment\": {\n\t\t\"123456_abcdefgh\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"body\": \"your comment text 1\",\n\t\t\t\t\"date_added\": 123456\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"body\": \"your comment text 2\",\n\t\t\t\t\"date_added\": 123456\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"body\": \"your comment text 3\",\n\t\t\t\t\"date_added\": 123456\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t]\n\t}\n}```\n\nwhen you want to delete comment \"your comment text 2\". you will remove:\n```\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"body\": \"your comment text 2\",\n\t\t\t\t\"date_added\": 123456\n\t\t\t},\n```\nwhen you want to delete \"your comment text 3\", you will remove:\n```\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"body\": \"your comment text 3\",\n\t\t\t\t\"date_added\": 123456\n\t\t\t}\n```\n\nDo you see the diference? comment 3 block of code does NOT end by comma \",\" symbol, because it is last block of code in comments section. This is important to know, because if you remove last block of code (comment 3), you have to adjust previous block code by removing ending comma \",\" from it turning:\n\n```\n{\n\t\"file\": {},\n\t\"comment\": {\n\t\t\"123456_abcdefgh\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"body\": \"your comment text 1\",\n\t\t\t\t\"date_added\": 123456\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"body\": \"your comment text 2\",\n\t\t\t\t\"date_added\": 123456\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"body\": \"your comment text 3\",\n\t\t\t\t\"date_added\": 123456\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t]\n\t}\n}\n```\n\ninto:\n\n```\n{\n\t\"file\": {},\n\t\"comment\": {\n\t\t\"123456_abcdefgh\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"body\": \"your comment text 1\",\n\t\t\t\t\"date_added\": 123456\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"body\": \"your comment text 2\",\n\t\t\t\t\"date_added\": 123456\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t]\n\t}\n}\n```\n(in short: making sure that after last \"block\" of code is not a comma ,)\n\n**B) EDITING**\n\ndeleting of the comment/post is hard to explain, but editing is simple, just edit the comment text between the quotation marks. Make sure not to add any \" into the text, because it may break the code i guess.\n\n6 . Save the file and go back to the site where you do some action like a upvoting or adding new comment. Once you do that zeronet should show that it published content to several peers. It means the content.json and data.json files you have eddited should have been signed and published (including your modifications) to other peers. The modification should be visible also for you (maybe after reloading page, or rebuilding database from within site menu?).",

Or we will just have to wait for some new developers who will create such a site? I think curently popular ZN media sites (IFS, KopyKate, Youtube, ZeroUp) annoy ZN users when they see too big portion of unseeded content and wasting time just to find the content is not downloading for them - i think this is bad approach to let unseeded content indefinately polute the sites.  :-)",

			"title": "How can ZeroTalk admin move/turn discussion topic into a group",
			"body": "ZeroTalk unfortunately does not yet allow ( https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroTalk/issues ) site owner to easily (via GUI) move topics into/between groups.\nGroup is something like a sub-forum. There is a selector for making new groups when creating new discussion topic.\n\nSo you being a zerotalk site clone owner, want to move one or more topics into or between groups. Here is how i did it:\n\n1. open your zerotalk site's menu by moving top right corner button to the left and scroll down a bit clicking OPEN SITE DIRECTORY\n2. in newly opened file manager, browse into data/users/ and go to directory of the user which topics/content you want to manage. You find the string when you mouse hover over the user name or topic title (in URL address)\n3. in that user directory edit data.json file using some good editor (maybe you want to first backup original file).\n4. in the file find the topic you want to move into a group. You will see the block of code like for example:\n\n>\t\t\t\"topic_id\": 1550302854,\n>\t\t\t\"title\": \"...\",\n>\t\t\t\"body\": \"...\",\n>\t\t\t\"added\": 1550302840\n\nthat is a code of the topic that does not belong to any group. You should turn it into example:\n\n>\t\t\t\"topic_id\": 1550302854,\n>\t\t\t\"title\": \"...\",\n>\t\t\t\"body\": \"...\",\n>\t\t\t\"added\": 1550302840,\n>\t\t\t\"parent_topic_uri\": \"1578848017_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS\"\n\nwe added parent_topic_uri which means we added it to the group. You can find correct group uri in the data.json which you are editting. Important is to notice that the previous line \"added\" must have new comma \",\" added at the end as it is no longer last line of the code block!\n\nYou can save the file and in the site's menu (corner button) click to \"Rebuild\" site database. Then reload the page (F5) to see if changes was made properly.\n\nIf everything is all right, you can sign and publish changes to other people (button should appear or do it from site's menu signing data/users/content.json)\n\nPS: it seems to me that the group that has no topic is not visible (can be confusing)",

My debug.log contains 2177 of these lines, /Config i set to log Only important message.\n\nNot sure if i can do something about this. If i somehow delete these users directories, their content will be lost.\n\n**Update**: it seems that the directories are deleted, site files ZeroHello recheck, verify, content.db rebuilt, but still these errors, ideas?\n\nAt this point i think i should submit an issue on bug tracker.. no one have this issue for this particular site (1DdPHe... 8chan)? In the meantime i have [switched](/Config) to logging only errors.",

The protocol itself is not yet \"blocking resistant,\" as Wiley puts. Without Tor, ZeroNet does not make you anonymous, either. There are a lot of research and programming to be done. I believe Tamas does not have the funding or resources to implement Pluggable Transports or to make ZeroNet protocol indistinguishable. The community do not ignore this issue, but for the time being, the community always recommend you use Tor Always mode.\"\n\n\"An increasing number of censoring countries are using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to classify Internet traffic flows by protocol. While Tor uses bridge relays to get around a censor that blocks by IP address, the censor can use DPI to recognize and filter Tor traffic flows even when they connect to unexpected IP addresses. ... Pluggable Transports (PT) transform the Tor traffic flow between the client and the bridge. This way, censors who monitor traffic between the client and the bridge will see innocent-looking transformed traffic instead of the actual Tor traffic.\"\nSource: https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en\n\nCan China's GFW block the zeronet ? https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/506\nWhen Tor is blocked by goverment https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/717",

I do not know if/how it is doable, but see a few quotations:\n\n> \"The bottom line is that the exit node can see traffic from some tor user to the clearnet site, and if it's not https/SSL then it's in the clear.\"\n\n> \"Exit nodes are like ISPs they can see your unencrypted traffic too.\"\n\n> \"In the past, some exit relays were documented to have sniffed and tampered with relayed traffic. The exposed attacks included mostly HTTPS man-in-the-middle (MitM) and SSL stripping. ...  Since September 2013, we discovered 65 malicious or misconfigured exit relays which are listed in Table 1 and Table 2 in our research paper. These exit relays engaged in various attacks such as SSH and HTTPS MitM, HTML injection, SSL stripping, and traffic sniffing.\" [source](https://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/)\n -\nSo i got impression it is not secure to freely use TorBrowser for clearnet browsing, but instead use it for anonymization and be careful about HTTP only sites (sites without HTTPS) so one do not submit too sensitive data (login data) there, fortunately it seems to be very rare case when some site do not offer HTTPS (even self signed certificate).\n\nIf anyone want to react, [here is](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1LfvE91ZF18jdG3wW62Dw7NtfTZh737KPL/?Topic:1518526043_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS/Are+the+risks+of+malicious+Tor+exit+nodes+too+big+to+use+Tor+for+clearnet+browsing) also the topic about this security issue.",

Question was under which conditions ZeroNet will download SunHub (and its users and their content) in case i am on a different zerome hub. The answer was:\n\nThere's two ways zeronet will download sun hub and it's content.\n\n1. You visit a sunhub user's zerome profile, and there's a button to click to download it.\n\n2. You visit the sunhub zite directly and it'll download like any other zite.\n\nEach zerome hub contains: user profiles+posts+followed users (the stuff you see when you visit someone's profile), and then the comments on posts that were posted to that hub. So for instance if you check the sunhub moonhub folder you'll see all of these comments are in there. That way people only need sunhub moonhub to see the entire conversation here, rather than needing several different hubs.\n\n[src](/1MeFqFfFFGQfa1J3gJyYYUvb5Lksczq7nH/?Post/1MoonP8t4rk9QamBUPh5Aspkwa1Xhf5ux2/1KkQmWnbZatijrNzgs4qtyyYcAXyEt3qgr/1551040809#)",

Zeronet is distributed so it do not use PHP, it use its own CMS's built using [HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, Zeronet API](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/getting_started/).

ZN traffic is also not anyonymous (unless your set Tor Always on [ZeroHello](/) or use VPN/anonymous proxy to hide your real IP). But thanks to VPNs located in free countries, i think it is prety safe, one have to use VPN killswitch so it prevent unencrypted data (usually low importance data) leaking and the making sure the DNS lookups are done by the VPN server not client located in restricted country.

If you mean torrent tracker server (defined in [/Config](/Config) then answer is YES, they should be able to interconnect if they share one or more same & working torrent trackers in their client configuration linked above.

Then rechecking less often offline trackers if they can be automaticaly re-added to the main list.

You can then check the ZeroNet/log/debug.log to see what Zeronet was doing. If computers are in same LAN, you may disconnect internet to remove clutter out of the log. The peers propagation may fail due to several reasons, i remember these (i may be wrong):\n- other device was not a direct peer when you published a content so it needs more time to receive the update from other peers\n- both pc have closed port and one or both does not have tor enabled (these facts can be discovered on the top of ZeroHello page) - propagation of content in such case can be delayed\n- you are using a VPN on both devices which have same IP\nIf you are interested in testing the issue, [here is my post](/1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT/?Topic:1534145930_16dEowtNbV89NxPcDrAKkmnuXtiJVoVcDm#comment_449_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS) where i written how i did it\n\n**Regarding how to get latest ZeroNet version**, open [ZeroHello](/) and next to the logo are three dots, click it to open menu where you click the version number to update.

ZeroNet will make all connections thru the Tor i guess and that should keep you anonymous, but still people can \"connect\" your content and give them image about you.\n- On various sites you can use various ID providers to appear under multiple identities. For example ZeroVoat generates own identity, Millchan also.\n- you can use [multiuser_local switch](/1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT/?Topic:1521308711_128dbVaHobAMsFW25rUVyFxwdCvvfkidzT#comment_217_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS) which will allow you to switch various identities via ZeroHello page. I am using it and you just add the \"multiuser_local\" line into zeronet.conf. Then on ZeroHello, you can switch identity. Example one ID you use for serious content, other for questionable.\nPS: @Krixano started some decentralized ID authority site http://127.0.0.1:43110/1GTVetvjTEriCMzKzWSP9FahYoMPy6BG1P/?/create-id using custom PeerMessage plugin (though nothing like that is bundled into ZeroNet by default).\n\n> inject arbitrary images and videos at any time, force other clients to make requests to arbitrary addresses on the clearnet by injecting <img> tags, etc.\n\n- [Lola](/1MeFqFfFFGQfa1J3gJyYYUvb5Lksczq7nH/?Profile/1BLueGvui1GdbtsjcKqCf4F67uKfritG49/1KuwwnkAtVrfnyhv8pyGRxLqzNZbEkJt2u/lola@zeroid.bit) is creating [Zeronet Browser](https://github.com/rllola/ZeronetBrowser) that may block clearnet traffic in the future\n- I am guessing there may already be plugins that would do the same for Firefox, Chrome.\n- Or one can use Tor Browser to keep some anonymity.\n- Or use any browser and enable above-mentioned TOR: Always mode may fix it also maybe.\n\n> any site on which you can submit any content needs to log your ID, meaning that you can track someone by ID across posts, across sites ... and as we've already established, you can tie that all to an IP.\n\nI would be interested if you can describe how exactly to do, it because no one yet explained that - [check this topic](/1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT/?Topic:1526907663_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS), i think researcher may work with posibility or probability of an IP matching to an identity (if he track some ID habits and pair it with debug.log connections), but can not be be sure about someone's IP.

I think it is Zeronet lag caused by many files optional files download on other zite. I see KxoVid was clever to show even a video that not contained the search phrase anywhere except in its tag (partial match where the the tag was two word phrase), that is nice. Though i think the category, channel display sorted by relevance to my favorite tags is something that can come handy in the future once there will be too many categories/channels.\n\n> channels/categories/videos that match my tags of interest ... why you would want to limit the content you see that much\n\ni think it can become useful starting a few thousand of videos. my tags of interest can be for example: game, games, zeronet, programming, linux, space, politics. When there is an option to show (single click or active by default) only new channels, categories, videos that match mentioned \"tags of interest\" - it can be useful for me to see only relevant new content without bothering to constantly repeat my searches to find which new content relevant to my interest was added. For example watching(subscribbing) music category is not so useful, because i am not interested in most of the music genres. Youtube.com can track user browsing habits and show relevant videos, ZeroNet not doing this as it would not be eficient or possible. So there on the list of channels and categories and new videos from all users can help if user can turn on filtering only ones that match his defined tags of interest. Then when i see nothing interesting was added, i can close the site and return later.",

Same way NSFW rated videos can be voted as safe for work. 2-3 votes change the category no matter how many votes are submitted in favor of some category\n- seed all videos of the user, all future user videos automaticaly, seed/preload all videos in current playlist\n- manager for seeded videos allowing to sort the list by date added, name, number of peers and also field to instantly filter out videos matching name. Then tickbox to tick all filtered out videos and button to delete them ot PIN/UNPIN them.\n- i easily add videos in my custom categories (maybe can be called playlist), and the video manager section will allow to filter the videos that match for example certain playlist",

Some users runs firewalls that blocks all traffic except allowed one, so they need to whitelist this port in firewall. (indication if this port is whitelisted/open is on the top of [ZeroHello](/)). This port can be defined in zeronet.conf or in [/Config](/Config).\n\n> \"peers ... only a tiny number from un-free places, like China\"\n\nsometimes i see China to be top country regarding peer count, yes i am also using custom tr@cker list as mentioned by klu9 earlier. You can find tr@cker lists searching on [ZeroHello](/).\n\n> \"how do you know the true top three countries that peers are located in\"\n\nwe can not, because people are using proxies located in different countries than they live in\n\n> \"we probably don't know how many people are currently connected to ZeroNet, because there could be many trackers that we don't know about. But there must be a master list of trackers somewhere?\"\n\ni have same understanding. we can find big lists of tr@ckers in the clearnet, use duck.com i think these will be compatible with zeronet But i think only minority of ZN users are using custom trackers, so the connectable peer count may not increase significantly after adding these.\n\n> \"this tracker-peer hybrid mesh network makes ZeroNet a lot more subject to governmental control than I was thinking\"\n\nmaybe not as much as one may think, because zeronet has nice 2 features i call peer exchange and tracker exchange. i do not know details, but you can search the zerotalk & zerome via [zerohello](/) Search in connected sites. In short zeronet makes sure that limitted amount of peers and trackers are automatically exchanged between zeronet users which should significantly limit problem that some government/ISP block all trackers and peers can not interconnect.

You define your HDD path (for example C:\\) and search inside the files for \"VBScript\" or other unique string found in the malicious code. It will find potential bad files, you may check its modification time and see how many other files are modified around that time, check other such files contents. You can also use mentioned SW to do actual replacement in the files. You should firs try the search and replace function on single file that you will first backup. You should first remobe the trojan (search symptoms and you may find removal instructions on the internet). If you are unsure that you removed it, then you should possibly backup all data and install clean OS. And then install only verified open source software and suspicious run in the sandbox (there are apps for that). Do not forget Antivirus SW and scaning software binaries before you first run these using virustotal.com (they have desktop app for scanning).\n\n**Regarding removal of bad code in your zites**, you can find it using mentioned software and remove bad code. Save changes and then publish changes from within your site 0 menu (drag the top right corner button to the left) and scroll down and sign both content.json files using the private key which you can find in your zeronet/data/users.json file near your site address...",
