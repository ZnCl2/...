There needs to be a way to pay for reliable long term hosting of content and people need to be willing to actually pay. Youtube wouldn't work either without money flowing through it in the form of advertisers and ads.\n\nSo the solution to censorship in paid hosting services is to make a P2P internet where you have to pay for hosting services? What kind of reasoning is that? No, you don't need paid hosting to have videos, torrenting already proved that.",
