Before, it played in entirety and I've checked this weekly over many months.\n\nCould it be due to the slow loading and constant buffering of the video? I only suggest this because after I read this discussion on my local machine with Firefox and Win10, I went to 4Kave, clicked on Big Buck Bunny, and after some slow loading and streaming, it was able to load and play the video to completion without any video errors appearing during playback.  So could the corruption be occurring locally somehow? I am going to place the video temporarily on my Zeroboxes to help with the loading time and buffering to see if your error goes away. \n\nAt the time of writing this and having the stream download, the stats page shows a count of 2 peers so if there was any corruption, I would believe I would be getting at least some of it. If I had to take a best guess, it is error'ing out on you because of the slow loading mixed with the large video playback size. 4K video over any peer network is not going to be ideal unless there are plenty of seeders or upload bandwidth which is usually lower for residential users. (hence having multiple vps helps as the faster upload pipe by multiple peers can sometimes fill the download consumption of one person.)",
