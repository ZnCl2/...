Currently, there is no way to implement alternative runtime on ZeroNet remotely, unless you create an extension and invite others to install and use it.\n\nThere is no problem that there will be an extension. Let it use the blockchain if necessary. It is crucial that it does not violate the principles of decentralization. This should not require a central server. This should also allow to clone sites.",
