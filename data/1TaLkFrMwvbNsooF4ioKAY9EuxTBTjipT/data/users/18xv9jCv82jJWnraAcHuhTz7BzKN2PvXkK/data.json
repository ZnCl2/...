Opera I dumped because it is owned by China. The list goes on and on..  I really think there is an active group out there that is hitting the browser developers on purpose to control content that you are using. I am basing this on statistical analysis of the same problems that users are having. It is always _ user doesn't like _ content and want it all banned because of _ reason. Its like a re occurring script file. Users need to make there own choices as to what they are using and running on there system. And never let the scumbags start dictating what you should or should not say about anything. Every day I am offended by someones online post. And I love it that way.  SJW are nothing more than velvet glove Nazi's. Treat them as such and this problem will go away very quickly.\n\nI know what you mean, I will be working on a project to create a whole new kind of browser / app / website thing. Stay tuned!
