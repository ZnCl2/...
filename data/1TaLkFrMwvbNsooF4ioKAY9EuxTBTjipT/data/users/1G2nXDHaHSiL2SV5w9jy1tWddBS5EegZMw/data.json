If old ZeroTalk data can't be removed, that will render ZeroNet nearly unusable.  It's the same problem that we see with the bitcoin blockchain now taking up a few hundred Gigabytes.\n\nLightning Network may help",

As you can confirm by looking at the history of pretty much all communist countries in human history)• Communism is by definition IMPERIALISTIC(the goal of abanoning nations is on top priority, you can't abandon all nations without first conquering all, they want the whole world, not just a country)• Communism is by implication AUTHORITARIAN(having a central authority telling you what to work as and what to produce and then how the goods you produce will be used and who gets them — of course there is that fairy tale story that once the people are brainwashed enough you can abandon the state and the system will keep itself afloat, but thats unrealistic thinking and no communist country was ever even close — in reality, we know how communist countries look like — North Korea)\n\ncopy and paste is so boring",
