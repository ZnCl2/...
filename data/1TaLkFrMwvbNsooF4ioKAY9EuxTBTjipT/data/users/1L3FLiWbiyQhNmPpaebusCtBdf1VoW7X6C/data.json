The upside to this one is that some people are using it, for now.\n\nI personally hope 8ch can get back up, but now we know what can happen and we should know that other platforms are important.\n\nPersonally I would like if this zeronet thing was a bit more transparent. Sure, it's convenient, but it would also be nice to maybe have some more control over how it runs. Also, I think that rewriting it in something faster than python, of all languages, would be nice. I don't know much about computer programming, though.",
