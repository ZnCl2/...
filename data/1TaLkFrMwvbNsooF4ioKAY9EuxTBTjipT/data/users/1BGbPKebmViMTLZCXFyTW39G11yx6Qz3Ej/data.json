				"body": "ZeroTalk++, no doubt. I don't know about the technical aspects of ZN so I can only talk from a user perspective - But ZN sorely needs de facto standard and cloneable zites so users can easily start creating their own content and spaces.\n\nLook at ZeroBlog++, straight up working out of the box. Now I have a blog!\n\nRegular ZeroTalk is a rudimentary proof-of-concept forum. Get the karma-voting up and running on ZT++ and we're nearly at a working competitor to reddit-style social media aggregators - Which I would call a ZN killer zite!\n\nIf there weren't a warning on ZT++ I would have started using it as soon as I found it as it is seemingly the best forum platform on ZN.\n\n> [styromaniac](#comment_2650_16NS3rBdW9zpLmLSQoD8nLTtNVsRFtVBhd): Secondarily, an improved ZeroMe, ZeroMe++, if you will.[...]\n\nZM have a lot of viable replacements already, with ZeroMe Reloaded and Sakana being my two favorites. IMO the twitter clone system works well as is, it would be nice to have a \"suite\" of ++ apps, ZM++ included but why not focus on the nearly complete ZT++ first?",
