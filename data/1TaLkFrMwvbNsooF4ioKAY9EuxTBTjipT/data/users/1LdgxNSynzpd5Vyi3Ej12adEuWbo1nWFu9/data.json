And I think we are going to be part of the throes of that transformation, which must take place. Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies that they once were in the last century. Jews are going to be at the center of that. It's a huge transformation for Europe to make. They are now going into a multicultural mode, and Jews will be resented because of our leading role. But without that leading role, and without that transformation, Europe will not survive.\" \n\nWestern people, white people, native europeans, whatever term you may use are actively genocided.

Game addicts are classified when they disregard sleep, eat, sit for so long that their leg's tissue starts to die.

Rise yourself up and bring those around you with you.\n\n-increased bone density\n-improved heart health\n-decreased injury rate\n-increases insulin sensivity\n-reduces risk of cancer.\n\nAsking for a purpose to be healthy, is a problem in and of itself.\nI know the difference between being overweight, depressed and generally feeling like shit, to being fit, vigorious and having all the energy to do whatever I want to achive.\n\nSuch thoughts are only a negative force on yourself and the people around you. They only show how little you care about the state of yourself and the people around yourself.\nComfort and complacency are the causes for such thoughts. Another extension of depression and other wellness diseases.\nBut I cannot convince you to get out of the mental hole you dug yourself in, you need to realise yourself that you are wrong.",
