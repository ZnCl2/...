And I think we are going to be part of the throes of that transformation, which must take place. Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies that they once were in the last century. Jews are going to be at the center of that. It's a huge transformation for Europe to make. They are now going into a multicultural mode, and Jews will be resented because of our leading role. But without that leading role, and without that transformation, Europe will not survive.\" \n\nWestern people, white people, native europeans, whatever term you may use are actively genocided.

Game addicts are classified when they disregard sleep, eat, sit for so long that their leg's tissue starts to die.

You have the same risk with any closed source third party application you install.  You could have CP on your mobile phone with just the apps you installed from the legit apps store, because many of those contain malware and may be doing who knows what.  There are apps secretly mining crypto, stealing your data, hosting files you don't want.  There's no lack of malicious attacks your devices are under just from the innocent looking apps you install.\n\nYes, but this is spooky scary esoteric h4XX0rman territory and therefore you are misogynist 9/11 truther baby killer incel nazi, so extra care will be given to that exact thing, just to get you.\nThey don't give a shit about a normie's bix nood smartphone's content, as they have no impact.\nAlso a potential argument would be \"Yes but judge, this man downloaded this app from a trusted™ source, so therefore it is the distributing company's fault and not my client's for this illegal content\" \n\nMeanwhile, zeronet is decrentalized and that argument will not work.",
