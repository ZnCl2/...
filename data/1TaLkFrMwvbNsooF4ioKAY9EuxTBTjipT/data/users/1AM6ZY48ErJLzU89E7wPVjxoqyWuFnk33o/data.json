President Mauricio Macri's government had been implementing austerity measures (that inflation rate was previously 58%!)  and he was seen as a stable choice by the markets (that's people and companies buying currency and stocks and bonds nationally and internationally). \n\nAll this has changed with the Argentinian primaries where President Mauricio Macri was looking for a second term. The primaries are the first hurdle where the potential candidates are selected to run against each other. President Macri has performed badly against Señor Alberto Fernández, who is running with ex-President Cristina Fernández as leaders of a left wing coalition party Frente de Todos.\n\nThat Frente de Todos gains power and Cristina comes back to govern Argentinian politics really upset the markets and the drop in the Peso's value was dramatic. From 42 peso to buy a dollar, not anymore it was last at 53 ARS to a USD. Share prices in some Argentinian companies have also dropped by nearly 50%. Do you want to buy Argentinian?",

No wonder the markets made like they had an aneurysm. President Macri who was elected in 2015 was slowly getting the economy together and had brought the eye-watering 50%+ inflation down to a quite high 22% , it is not good enough and the people seemingly want chaos instead.\n\nArgentina's economic minister Nicolas Dujovne has resigned because of the crisis from the drop in value of the Peso after the first presidential run. Paradoxically that drop was caused by the possibility of Dujovne and his government losing the election. Maybe his resignation will help to keep President Macri in power. \n\nIf not the international financial world is expecting disaster.",
