There's just one thing that keeps me slightly worried: a zite that I pass by might seem innocuous so I don't explicitly delete it. Maybe it was at that time and later they added illegal content - or maybe it always had illegal content and I didn't know about it. Anyways, because I would now be sharing illegal content, I'd be liable.I wish sharing was opt-in, rather than opt-out, and that the UI neatly displayed all files the zite has before you choose to host it.\n\nThis is a very valid point and it worries me too. I'm not sure how to solve the problem of illegal / amoral content but perhaps some kind of warning system that would allow users to flag bad content.",
