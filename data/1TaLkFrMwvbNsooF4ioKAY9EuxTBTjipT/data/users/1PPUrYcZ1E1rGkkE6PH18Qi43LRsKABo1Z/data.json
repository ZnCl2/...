			"body": "Alright, here is CNN's newest Crusade:  https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/14/politics/steve-king-rape-incest-comments/index.html  King said *\"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled those people out that were products of rape and incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?  Considering all the wars and all the rape and pillage that has taken place ... I know I can't certify that I was not a part of a product of that.\"*  This is now being held up as a \"bizarre comment\" worthy of expulsion from Congress, comparable to fighting for the Confederacy against the U.S. government.\n\nSo on this last vestige of the free internet, what is the math?  Well, we can look up \"Pregnancy from rape\" on Wikipedia, which says 25,000 to 32,000 pregnancies result from rape per year in the U.S.  Now the total births per year in the U.S. should be the 12.4/1000 population * (329,000,000 population) (from their article on demographics of the U.S.) = 4,080,000 births yearly.  Crunch those numbers and get an astounding 1 in 148.  Either rape really works (still), or Wikipedia is full of shit (possible), or my math is wrong (well, I just went on a chocolate binge and my judgment may be impaired).\n\nNow rape in ancient times was probably not LESS than during the Age of Political Correctness, unless all those rules about talking don't actually do anything to stop a penis (possible).  So if we take (1-0.0068) to the Nth power, and get a result of less than 1/329,000,000, then that is the number of conceptions where you can pretty much guarantee one was a rape for every single American.  That is log 0.9932 (1/329000000) or ln(1/329000000)/ln(0.9932).  Which works out to 2874 conceptions.\n\nBefore you multiply that by 20 (the old generation time), remember that it takes two to tango.  Going back in the pedigree you add 1+2+4+8... so we want log2(2874).  That's 11.5 generations.  Which means that sometime within the last 230 years -- since 1789, when the Constitution was passed - EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN has had an ancestor conceived by rape.\n\nAt least, unless some of those ancestors are the same, in which case the numbers are smaller, but then they're a product of incest.",

			"title": "ZeroNet should focus on developing legal infrastructure and establishing legitimacy in media",
			"body": "Some people keep talking about Tor -- but what we need is the OTHER direction.  There's nothing illegal about talking to people about things that the overlords of Google and Facebook think looks bad for their companies.  There's no reason why anybody should even need Tor here unless their interests run in a few fairly narrow directions -- which is the same as is true for \"the internet\" because ZeroNet is simply the Internet, run by people instead of by corporations.  NO OTHER DIFFERENCE.  We should see more development of \"whitelists\" of forums and files that users have looked over and decided have no legal issues (not even civil), so that absolutely anybody feels comfortable seeding them.  I say whitelists because of course there are always files people disagree about or which are OK for some countries and not others, the copyright extension treaty and that kind of craziness.  Users should feel free to examine others case by case.\n\nMost specifically though, we need a legit infrastructure to help reassure and support those users who want to play it legal.  DMCA offers safe harbor IF you can be reached and respond to complaints.  Somebody here might get served with a DMCA notice and not check ZeroMail, and lose safe harbor, or check it only after logging in and starting to seed, etc.  So some specialized tools that would allow you the seeder to authorize \"some guy\" who wants to shoulder the burden of DMCA notice watching and block your file-seeding/warn you of what's going on for that reason alone could give thousands of people safe harbor and he might not even get a notice, so that's really an improvement in efficiency and safety.\n\nRemember, Tor is NOT a magic force field.  On 4/5/19 I think the Germans shut down \"Wall Street Market\", a huge darknet website.  SAME DAY, Firefox \"accidentally\" let their main certificate for plug-ins expire, and all the plug-ins were disabled.  THAT INCLUDED NOSCRIPT IN TOR.  I haven't seen an update, but I bet there are hundreds, even thousands of people who didn't notice the little S symbol was gone before they wandered in to a government replacement for that site with some very special scripts running...

			"title": "The comic buried treasure at the center of Islam",
			"body": "Students of history may know that Muhammad basically took over a big pilgrimage site by force, thereby making great profit and fame.  They may also know that (after he smashed miscellaneous idols) the one big uncontested ruler of that roost was a black rock that people said had fallen from the sky, i.e. a meteorite.  Perhaps less well known (indeed, I may be making a crank theory here) let's note that this black rock turned up very shortly after the Christians turned the shrine of Elagabalus in Emesa into the Church of St John the Divine, and smashed a certain Black Stone at the center of it, a massive meteorite which the transgender Roman emperor Elagabalus had gone all over the city with in a chariot praying to it and had a big temple built for in Rome, until he died and it got shipped back home.  A network of Sabean traders linked the two sites.\n\nNow anyway, the Church of St John is since turned into the Great Mosque of Al-Nuri, damaged during the siege of Homs.  The Black Rock was smashed at a known site in the courtyard.  So we have possible/probable fragments of the Black Stone that the entire pilgrimage to Mecca centers around, lying untended just under a bombed-out mosque, waiting for somebody to scoop them up and prove they match up with the ones in the little lensy thingy that the Muslims stare into.  But if the Muslims knew it was the Elagabalus stone they'd probably decry it as a pagan abomination. ;)  Oh, if someone could just _dig_ it would be so hilarious.",

			"title": "Biological mechanism and treatment of pedophilia",
			"body": "It has occurred to me that the waves of 8chan refugees and the freedom of ZeroNet might allow some actual, serious, _biological_ discussion of what mechanisms might lead to pedophilia _with a chance of getting feedback from people who actually suffer from the condition_.\n\nMy tentative understanding of how sexual attraction works is that there is a much-disputed organ, the vomeronasal organ, which may not exist in humans or may exist in a very rudimentary form, which is tasked with detecting pheromones - scent signals - from other humans.  The effect of pheromones is well known to be real in _some_ way: typical men will have higher salivary testosterone levels if they sniff a sample of sweat from women who were ovulating rather than those who were not.\n\nBased on other species, the neurons that receive signals from the VNO are single cells that carry impulses all the way from the nose (via the very obscure \"terminal nerve\", the 0th cranial nerve) to the hypothalamus, where they signal by releasing GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone).  GnRH has a complex pattern of pulses of activity and inactivity, but the net effect is that when properly deployed it causes luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to be produced.  LH activates hormone secreting cells (Leydig or thecal cells) which secrete androgens; in women the androgens are converted to estrogen while in men they are stored by ABP.  FSH directly stimulates gamete production/maturation.\n\nSo what's going on here?  I think every time a normal person gets a dose of pheromone, it causes a sexual activation, and part of that MAY be to do operant conditioning to convince the person that this is linked to an ideal sexual appearance.  But at this point the trail starts to peter out - nobody in government seems very interested in _curing_ pedophilia, just using it as an excuse to censor the internet.  For that matter, studies of normal sexual attraction are rare, though they've figured out that average faces are typically most attractive (presumably because the operant conditioning of all the potential mates works out to an average)  So for example there are ZERO studies in the entire scientific literature testing what happens if you hire some sex workers to try their best on a pedophile, which seems like the first most obvious control for any experiment at all.\n\nStill, I remember that as a kid 6-7 I had the common phenomenon of \"puppy love\", attraction to children my own age (oddly, I remember much older women being attractive BEFORE that, but for a while they became less so).  My assumption is that kids in age-selected groups start to condition on the pheromones they encounter there.  In my case, as usual, that attraction changed year to year, as it usually does.  So my hypothesis is that in pedophiles something breaks this: they stop reacting to pheromones and stay stuck at some stage of development.\n\nThe question then is: (a) can we find experiences from pedophiles that can explain what the thing is that actually broke their mental updating?  It might be something like a physical injury that damages one of the terminal nerves, a vascular accident that damages part of the brain, or something else at the relevant point of childhood.  And of course (b) can you TREAT a pedophile by exposing him to a super strong dose of pheromones, whether from sweaty \"nasty\" women with an excess of scent, or by chemical purification or synthetic production?  Heck, I remember that being in a mouse room the _mouse_ pheromones would change how I looked at any women I encountered, even the ones I thought of as highly unattractive (e.g. Asians)... and to be honest, some of the change really had a long term effect in weakening those particular aesthetic distinctions.  I should also note that (c) _if_ the pathway is entirely destroyed, it should be possible to bypass it by some means which may involve neural stimulation (Nasal TMS?) or maybe snorting a permeable GnRH like cocaine.  But it would have to be really subtle or people would condition on the dope instead of the sexual signal - Indians used tobacco for centuries without getting cancer because they thought their addiction impulse came from a ceremony, but once they know it comes from a cigarette... \n\nI don't believe that pedophilia is an \"orientation\".  There are evolutionary reasons why \"man\" and \"woman\" may be defined as potential targets of attraction, but within those categories people should be malleable.  I don't think it's necessarily realistic or a priority to expect all of a pedophile's attraction to children to be forgotten, but as I said above, I think _most_ people _remember_ a time long ago when they found children attractive, without being pedophiles now.  Children don't really produce much if any pheromone, so they wouldn't actually compete with any genuine stimulation of this pathway.",

Often the children are being \"sextorted\" - the pedo gets them to send one images, then threatens to post it to social media, unless they make MORE.\n\nNow anyone who has read the news has seen these sorry stories of prosecutors going after kids for making child porn of themselves - branding them as sex offenders to protect kids from ... sex offenders.  Like prosecutors.  This stuff, or being expelled, or ostracized, etc., all purportedly to help protect kids from child porn... is being used to blackmail them into making child porn.  From this article it sounds like MOST of the child porn is being made exactly this way.\n\nIf anybody were trying to STOP child porn, they would make a law saying that no child would be prosecuted or in any way discriminated against for being the subject of a photo to which (a) they theoretically can't consent and (b) is supposedly only banned to try to protect THAT CHILD.  Then at least the kids would start to tell the pedos to go fuck themselves.\n\nBut does the government try to stop ANY organized crime racket, or is their role to make them as profitable as possible?  The evidence lines up with one alternative, not the other.\n\nP. S.  With so few prosecutions, we should bear in mind that if ANYBODY ever gets prosecuted because there was some government agent who stealthily posted a uuencoded image inside a text forum about politics the person wanted to mirror or host as if they were a Corporation and not a Peasant Schmuck, it will be absolutely certain that that is a political attack on the forum -- not any genuine kind of child porn enforcement.

But with the name I went back and looked at Wikipedia:  they, of course, have no article, and you're not allowed to make it, and in a show of what kind of site they are nowadays, they don't even have the LOGS to explain why you can't make it ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?type=&user=&page=Eric_Ciaramella&wpdate=&tagfilter= ).  Bear in mind that their ancient history was GFDL with everything public, so this kind of total barrier of silence took some \"ideological effort\" for them to get to.  As a result, they somehow neglected to cover up the corresponding file about DRAFTS of the page ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?type=delete&user=&page=Draft%3AEric_Ciaramella&wpdate=&tagfilter=&subtype= ).

Obviously it wasn't a suitable source for Wikipedia.  But the interesting thing is, if we HAD a collective store of knowledge we could trace stuff like this back and see who leaked the name.  I mean, it was coming out anyway, don't give me shit about how the Russians and the Iranians won't know who a CIA agent is as long as it's only in 100 news stories in obscure outlets and you can't read it on Facebook!  Doing a regular search on Newslookup I can still go back and see some Gateway Pundit tweet from before that ( https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/10/schumer-concerned-identity-of-secret-trump-hating-cia-spy-and-whistleblower-who-was-spying-on-president-in-white-house-may-be-leaked-by-trump/ ) which named him as one of two people, though the same site claims to have narrowed it down to only HIS name on October 12!

Republicans read shit like that and they think he's a jihadist!  They make Joe McCarthy look like he had the legal mind of a Supreme Court justice by comparison!  Both sides are purveyors of wretched politics where they pull out a dossier of all the private details of somebody's life and throw out a few at random (there's always something) and then say that means they can get up on their throne _between_ the seraphim and damn the fellow to eternal hellfire.\n\nBUT the conversation has changed.  It used to be that when you read about something in the news you can talk about it.

The point is, this is VERY BAD FUCKING NEWS.  Just in \"non-fringe\" terms, we're talking about something that can not only penetrate through fairly long distances of solid material like X-rays, but which can ANALYZE CHEMICALLY what is in that space.  Fifteen years ago I was paranoid about this shit because the Chinese could use it to tell which kind of nematode worm had burrowed into a tree based on how its DNA absorbed the terahertz.  Nothing's changed ... except now it's cheap and formally on the menu.\n\nBut what is much more scary is that we're talking about the same potential for health effects as with cell phones etc., but now much more energetic photons.  Cause vibrations in DNA, displace transcription factors from their binding sites.  But not just at RANDOM.  We're talking SPECIFIC interactions.  So if somebody wants to build a Gay Ray, all they gotta do is displace the transcription factor that represses a male pheromone specific odorant receptor in your GnRH neurons projecting through the terminal nerve.  All of a sudden you're getting little pulses of testosterone when you smell a man, and before long the positive conditioning takes effect and you're getting a hard-on whenever you see cute guys (i.e. guys who match the average of the pheromone producers and therefore the conditioning).\n\nOf course, it would be easier to work out how to cause cancer, but I doubt they'll do either - they'll just get some of their tunable lasers, point them at selected dissidents from drones, cross-index by their health records in six months and see what batches seem to have consistent health problems.  It's a hell of a lot easier than calculating the dispersion forces between a predicted protein and a DNA sequence!\n\nWe're getting real close to the end of the story now.",

If brain waves end, you pull the plug.  If a fetus develops brain waves, it's too old to abort.  Now this _thing_ has brain waves and complex development.\n\nWhy do this?  Because then they can get rid of their labor force in India!  Just make brains on chips that can't conceive of anything but coding or doing animation!\n\nBut there is a secret flaw, a **downside** these people don't understand, which is going to destroy them.  They think they are making a human from scratch, and they are, but they are not making it _right_.\n\nHuman consciousness is a paranormal phenomenon, and it is _based_ on a paranormal phenomenon.  The basis is precognition: the direct knowledge of the immutable future.  Knowing something _will_ happen can _make_ it happen, to the degree that anything makes anything happen when it is immutable.  As a result, the Universe is not a unique solution to a mathematical problem: there are MANY solutions.  Free will is generated by the choice of which self-consistent series of events turns out to be \"real\".  Qualia is the time inverse of this process whereby multiple past events come to a single present, and one is true and one is not.\n\nBut ... precognition is _dangerous_.  You think you're going to see an accident, so you pull off the road, get out, try walking around in the woods where you can't see the accident, you start to feel better, you come out, you startle a deer ... it runs in the road in front of a car, and you see the accident.  That kind of thing.  Think of how many people saw September 11th before it happened!\n\nTo keep consciousness relatively safe, humans have evolved some mechanism to _suppress_ precognitive memories at the macroscopic scale.  We don't know what the future is, so we don't see ourselves slipping and falling on a knife, then going out of our way to be careful... and falling on the knife.  We have paranoia, we have daydreams, we have things to pull the wool over our eyes.\n\nThese THINGS do not have any wool.  They are unlucky to exist at ALL.  There is no telling what pain and misery they feel.  There is no telling what they think.  And if anyone - ANYONE - with these things in their lab starts asking them about the future ... they're going to start getting answers.\n\nWe saw the first seal break with the Holocaust of the Jews, where law and crime became one and the same.  We saw the second seal break with low-intensity conflict, war is peace, pioneered in Israel as it turns out, until it is meaningless to _ask_ who we are at war with.  The third is breaking now - the rich don't _own_ things, they have a license to _use_ the Ring camera that is reporting them to the police and the cell phone that is selling keyword analyses of their conversations.  Soon they will not even own their cars, which will be self-driving monstrosities they have to beg to go places.\n\nBut this thing, with the fetuses - that is the SIXTH seal.  The last one before the end!  And they have got out the letter opener and are prying that baby with all their might.  And who in heaven or earth would say _\"no, they don't deserve it, not just because they wanted the power to breed infinite numbers of little babies as tormented slaves on microchips!\"_  Do I hear one?\n\nThe end - the end is NIGH!",

Admittedly, this is based mostly on a dream about a blockbuster movie in a parallel dimension a couple years ago, but looking at it:  a) the base is the point of origin for some troops explicitly sent to counter Iran, b) it is a location for the newly-ballyhooed Space Force, c) it is a monitoring station for nuclear weapons testing.  If Iran actually gets to the point where it is accepting war as an outcome, my guess is it _will_ strike somewhere in the U.S. because U.S. soil is almost the only place it would have a deterrent effect that might bring things to a negotiated settlement.

The lead researcher has a resume up on Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Rezai_(neurosurgeon) - which cites a 2002 patent including:\n\n_Accordingly, the present invention relates to modulation of neuronal activity to affect psychological or psychiatric activity. The present invention finds particular application in the modulation of neuronal function or processing to affect a functional outcome. The modulation of nueronal function is particularly useful with regard to the prevention, treatment, or amelioration of psychiatric, psychological, conscious state, behavioral, mood, and thought activity. (unless otherwise indicated these will be collectively referred to herein as \"psychological activity\" or \"psychiatric activity\"). When referring to a pathological or undesirable condition associated with the activity, reference may be made to \"psychiatric disorder\" or \"psychological disorder\" instead of psychiatric or psychological activity. Although the activity to be modulated usually manifests itself in the form of a disorder such as addiction/substance abuse, autism, dyslexia, obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks, social phobia, major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, it is to be appreciated that the invention may also find application in conjunction with enhancing or diminishing any neurological or psychiatric function, not just an abnormality or disorder. Psychiatric activity that may be modulated can include, but not be limited to, normal functions such as alertness, conscious state, drive, fear, anger, anxiety, euphoria, sadness, and the Fight or flight response._\n\nThe Wikiresume also handily points out that Rezai presented his work directly to George W. Bush (citing https://www.cleveland.com/medical/2009/06/region_to_lose_a_top_brain_res.html ).  And I _don't_ think Bush was interested in getting over his cocaine habit.",

			"body": "So far I know a) coronavirus spreads during the incubation period, b) the first cases in various countries were handled like they were non-infectious before symptoms, c) the Canadians admit their case flew in with symptoms and now they're hunting back for who they flew in with.  In other words, _we're getting coronavirus just like the Chinese_.  Next question: what do we do about this?\n\n1) According to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28466096 (ask Alexandra Elbakyan about it) the deaths from coronavirus are simply from very high replication early on, followed by major inflammation.\n\n2) To inhibit replication, flavonoids seem like leading options: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6882434/  Lead compound is herbacetin, which is part of a lignan - note the \"A\" in that - in flax seed.  Potency is around 1 uM, which is to say, 3 ng/L.\n\n3) Flax seed has something like 34.5 **mg** of lignans per serving overall.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951311/  Also note according to that paper lignans actually pass through the human circulation to the urine!\n\n4) A newspaper from India treats flax like it's a well known weight loss supplement ( https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/weight-loss/flax-seeds-for-weight-loss/articleshow/60114327.cms ) and herbacetin has also been evaluated for *that*: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009279718301637 This is some very indirect hint maybe it really is active in the body, though admittedly I just thought flax was used as dietary fiber.\n\nAnyway, my best plan for coronavirus so far, such as it is, is leaning toward getting some flax meal / flax \"flour\" in the supermarket and using it as a supplement prior to infection.\n\nNote I do not know how much if any free herbacetin you can get by eating it this way.  The procedure from that one paper involves microwaving ground flax on low for 6 minutes in lye solution, then purifying it.  Also I don't know how long herbacetin is stable for once isolated - I would think that the glycoside in flax, being part of the seed hull, might keep pretty well?????\n\nAny opinions pro or con would be welcome - (people setting up blind studies in Wuhan would be great too)",

I was just reading Wikipedia's article on Kwanzaa and kept picturing George Lincoln Rockwell sternly reading out the principles: (I only put the names in English, the text after the colon is plagiarized word for word!)\n\n    Unity: To strive for and to maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race.\n    Self-Determination: To define and name ourselves, as well as to create and speak for ourselves.\n    Responsibility: To build and maintain our community together and make our brothers' and sisters' problems our problems and to solve them together.\n    Economics: To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together.\n    Purpose: To make our collective vocation the building and developing of our community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness.\n    Creativity: To do always as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it.\n    Faith: To believe with all our hearts in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.\n\nNow obviously you don't call it a kinara (nor a menorah!) but a candelabrum.  Maybe you get inventive and use a brazier and torches.  You don't call it a unity cup but a unity _chalice_ or _flagon_, words matter!  Maybe the Firstfruits Festival (not \"Kwanzaa\") would be held in North Hemisphere summer rather than the south.  You might not use a black, red, and _green_ flag.

The latter part of the episode went as follows:\n\nA cruel raider kidnaps women and hauls them away to his castle, presumably to rape.  The woman is left tied up to his war horse in the courtyard, and he tells her that if she moves, even a little, the horse will take off galloping and drag her to her death.  The raider is asleep after a pleasant and wine-soaked evening when he hears the bells on his horse's saddle, so he leaps up and starts riding another horse so he can follow and watch, together with a few retainers.  The scheme almost fails as he sees a momentary flash of his actual victim being supported on another horse riding away with someone, but he dismisses it and keeps following.  But it turn out that the horse he's following is the hero's own well-trained horse, and she is being dragged but in control with sword close at hand, to a place where angry villagers are waiting.\n\nCould be worse... last week around this time he was watching (with great interest, it seemd) a dull documentary about all the times that Doctor Who had crossed paths with his French nemesis, the infamous Inspector Corlione, who did random things like pile up a nursery ward's worth of babies in precariously balanced drawers in a hallway to barricade Who from following him on board a large ship during wartime.",

And the virus is now available for download ... just about everywhere.\n\nIn Iran, large chunks of the government became infected.  They blame U.S. agents.

It's not clear the Neanderthals and Denisovans were substantially different in mind even if they had some kind of reproductive isolation.  One idea is that modern thinking is some kind of Neal Stephenson style linguistic virus transmitted to children (they put it a little less flamoyantly at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/467183v1 ), but I'm skeptical - that paper seems to suggest deaf kids who had to resort to \"homesign\" can't learn to sew clothing.  By far the most awesome of all primitive human warriors were the little guys on Flores - they stood four feet tall and battled 24-foot long dragons tall as they are with a poison bite, armed with nothing but spears (that archeologists have found, that is).

They have all the genetic variation to work with.  *Homo apotelesmatis* is what we might the future species that could cross interstellar space - man influenced by the stars.  These people will manifest the brain power of any other human, but with a far higher brain/body ratio.  They are \"Pygmies\", in other words, living in separate little communities in Africa some of which are closely related to other humans and some of which are quite highly diverged.  If people are willing to recruit these people to train in STEM fields, train for space, test them physically for various obscure but highly useful traits to recruit to the population like the ability to belch in zero gee without vomiting, we will be able to set up space colonies far faster that grow faster, so they will outstrip the old species everywhere but in the local neighborhood of the Solar system.

(Since most of the users -- really, we should say \"peer maintainers\" perhaps -- are in the U.S., it won't matter that much if nobody else seeds anything)  But you have to get somebody convincing online (page the EFF, the ACLU!) to say that yeah, that's really true.  AND to provide tips to the peer maintainers how not to screw up their safe harbor.  I think there's something about encouraging the content uploads for example.  Real lawyers issuing opinions are needed, not just guessing.\n\nWe should remember though that this is by far not the first time that child porn has been weaponized against crowdsourced websites.  For example, Wikipedia was investigated by the FBI back in 2010 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporting_of_child_pornography_images_on_Wikimedia_Commons ) after an ex-founder pushing Citizendium (which uses a real-name policy like China/Facebook) reported them.  They actually *kept* some things that would make you wonder.  And of course, they *do* have honest-to-god child porn uploads now and then.  But note that the FBI did not go and prosecute any of their amateur administrators who ended up looking at the images in the course of their duties.  It's a minefield, but Wikipedia crossed it without casualties, and so could ZeroNet.",

The notion of prosecuting the daughter utterly sickens me, even before her confinement to a location leaves her vulnerable to murder.  (Katie Pladl)  To me, prosecuting her is the same sickness as laws against homosexuality, and giving her baby, if she had one, a special exemption from abortion laws meant to preserve human life is to say it is an untermensch that should be exterminated for genetic inferiority.  Yes, the risk of genetic disease in incestuously conceived infants is much higher.

It is how we \"really feel something\" rather than just giving an impression of life like a doll with a microphone and a pull cord, or an AI.  \"Free will\" is related; in fact, it is the time-inverse.  Qualia is how consciousness relates to the low-entropy past, which is a typically losing battle you might say, while free will is how it affects the high-entropy future.  Both are something of a give and take.\n\nNow where does free will come from?  Not where you'd expect.  Free will results from the _certain_ knowledge of the _immutable_ future, in other words, precognition.  In a macroscopic context, of course, precognition pretty much savages free will, which is only one of the reasons why it is more trouble than it's worth.  But it also creates free will, because it means there is more than one solution to the equation that is the universe.  If you pull a ticket out of a machine, that has a number on it, which is whatever number you are going to put into the machine a minute from now, and you don't look at the ticket, but put it in the machine a minute later, what was the number?  NOT random.  NOT determined.  It's a causality violation, pure and simple.  And causality violations are the boundary conditions of the Cosmos.  They link our reality to the alternate dimensions, the days of creation before and ahead of us in spiritual time.

Human consciousness is the point of connection: very short range precognition creates causality violations that impose the boundary conditions of the cosmos.  So consciousness may also be able to sense or explore some of these parallel universes though they remain closed to ordinary methods of scientific investigation.\n\nThere can be no certainty with it, but dreaming offers the possibility that you can perceive what your direct counterpart in another universe can perceive.  This comes through _as he perceives it_, so for example if he is watching a movie you might see the fantasy as real if he's immersed in it.  Playing with dreams means mixing in a lot of fantasy, no doubt there.\n\nFor a long time I was dreaming about \"Verse Prime\", a place that seems not far from here, but with some neat differences.  They have some kind of electrostatic propulsion for gliding through the air, so you can throw a Bar-Dart that will fly several blocks to the stadium and try to hit a player or official in a non-life-threatening spot.  This also means that instead of covering the buildings in fan equipment, they cover them in gardens - there's a mandated maximum height in New York and it seems like the whole city is roofed with parks and gardens.  They actually just finally discovered something similar here ( https://phys.org/news/2019-07-ultra-thin-layers-rust-electricity.html ) but only in water and only to absorb the energy so far.  Less population, and the British? Colonies are smaller - the Zoroastrian Persians got the Louisiana Purchase I think, and there was some unpleasantness involving nihang with mecha-chakrams on gliders, etc.  Look for ridiculous amounts of wrought iron, even on the ATMs and bridge underpasses, and seemingly all the windows made out of Plexiglass and usually scratched up.\n\nThe transdimensional organizations seem to be avoiding us because of orthogonality violations.  In theory, every trans-dim is based on an eigenvalue of the human condition, so conflict between them (or even alliance) is impossible.  But around here?  Well, The Reich/Rich is supposed to be about relentless economic/industrial expansion; whatever we have going in our verse is way out of whack.  And Signal is supposed to show up first to make first contact and share tech but they're no where to be found it would seem.\n\nYou can also kind of imagine or see through to the other dimensions sometimes.  I mean, you see some ornamental towers built for no purpose at all and you realize you're seeing an echo of the pickets of a military camp over there; you see guys with big long necklaces and you're seeing the mecha-chakrams that use electrostatic propulsion to spin at deadly speed over there; you see the tattoo plague here and it's the echo of some kind of skin disease over there.

You discuss for example whether anarcho-capitalism can be anarchism and so on.\n\nAnarchy, simply put, is the sum of all human rights.  The problem is that __ANYTHING__ that can be worded as a law can be worded as a right.  As you well know, the \"anarcho-capitalists\" will insist your right to sell yourself (and your descendants?) into slavery is a vital right to uphold.  But the leftist anarchists are more than eager to proclaim the \"right\" of a laboratory rat to be freed from the burned-down remnants of the lab that was trying to use it to cure cancer.  Few anarchists want to answer whether in an anarchist society there is a right to a trial by jury.\n\nBecause any law is any right, anarchism is simply the rephrasing of \"politics\".  As above, so below.  Except it isn't really even a matter of ditching organization, because as you know, the first thing you talk about is building syndicates and such.  Anarchists can be organized, they can enforce rules (er, I mean rights).  And I have a distinct suspicion, though I've never seen it verified, that they are also prone to corruption, not merely in the sense of becoming police informers but in terms of choosing specific ski resorts to burn down based on some criminal organization's agenda.\n\nAll of this does not put you any WORSE than the state, and having a dual perspective of law and right can be enlightening, but in the end I threw myself out of the anarchists because I couldn't follow their rules.  I'll take government money whether for work or subsidy and use it to buy a nice juicy steak and I won't feel one bit of regret about it.\n\nThe more important innovation is to work on formulating a list and logical derivation of human rights.",

What IS the world, or love?  When you feel prolonged pain, whether it is physical or psychological, try to reason out what it is.  What IS pain and why do you respond to it at all?  This works to lessen the impact whether it's a gout attack or losing your mom.\n\nNumber three, consider religious ideas.  This world is just one of a sequence of parallel universes, the Days of Creation you could say ... different versions of the same manuscript.  In the next version the pain you feel will not exist, but the _virtue_ you display will.  You will be _with_ the one you lost, but you will still be feeling all the strength of emotion you feel now being apart!  But if you cut your story short now, the time you can enjoy in the next version will probably be reduced.  (I don't think it will be the last word though - I think there are MANY revisions of Creation behind us and very very many in front of us before the Kingdom of Heaven)  Also consider that all consciousness is a single force, a single experience, there's no more difference between two people than two lobes of the same brain.  If you're hurting, consider going out and helping someone who is down on their luck themselves.\n\nNumber four, no, a lot of the people here probably don't really understand you.  To be \"on the spectrum\" is to have the freedom to stand mostly apart from some of the biological imperatives.\n\nOh yeah, and number five:  statistics show that headshrinkers and helplines and such do overall have a chance to help.

There are ways to make more sense of it than usual (like, you can diagram a p orbital as a complex function that smoothly changes color as it goes around an atom in a ring, rather than the lobes you get when you add up the complex functions and cancel them out; the difference being whether you are about the sign of the momentum rather than the position in space.  I think there ought to be a way to make \"tinkertoys\" out of Planck constant units of momentum that you can put together as one time around the complex number plane, signifying motion... I am not actually a physicist though and working it out in my hands is like a child writing in crayon.",

See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6267001/ In pre-pubescent children, apocrine sweat glands are inactive, or maybe just \"not fully inactivated\".  The proteins and lipids they produce may or may not be needed to cause species of bacteria that we may not know to produce volatile compounds we may not have identified.  You're right that this is a weak point in the model, but it's kind of necessary.  If children produced as much pheromone as adults, then - at least according to this model - every adult would be attracted to them.  Now that isn't necessarily true because maybe an admiration of (for example) big boobs is hardwired into people at some level _other_ than conditioning - which matches my vague recollection from being three - but still, it's necessary to say \"a little bit, but not too much\" to make the model work.

In that case I've read there is a fairly dramatic kin selection effect.  I'm not sure why, but conceivably it could have something to do with childless members helping out a family, in which case the same could apply even for pedophilia.  (True, that is a _strange_ definition of 'help' in this instance, but genetic selection doesn't care if you're happy!)  Bottom line, I have no idea if it's genetic or not.

There are little switchable breakpoints in the cable every few meters.\n\nDown below, Kim Jong Il is standing on his fancy new submarine a short way out in the ocean.  The Zeus Drone's controllers have TOP NOTCH weather data that shows all the winds and charge distributions in the thunderstorm, so it knows when to drop its ball of conductive thread.  It also knows the exact distance from the ground so it's not left with a large incriminating ball of conductive thread at the bottom.  The cable unspools and the control fins on the dropped module work to keep it on track to within a few centimeters.\n\nWhen the cable is a fraction of a second from the dictator, it slows down, and the conductive switches all throw to link it up.  Perhaps a static electricity generator makes part of the drone's surface extra appealing to a lightning bolt.  The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nShould the Zeus Drone fail to do its thing, the cable splits apart at the switches, relying on wind to carry it as little bits of debris that nobody knows the purpose of.

In particular, [E.S.] had disregarded the fact that the marriage with A----- had continued until M------'s death, when she had already turned eighteen and had therefore passed the age of puberty.\"_\n\nI think a person should have a right to say that, indeed, a right to say that without being tossed unceremoniously out of a computer science department.  But the European Court of Human Rights is another matter, because in fact they not merely _said_ this (about Muhammad, not Minsky, and quoting an Austrian verdict they were **upholding**), but went on to _enforce_ it as a boundary of what is illegal to _disagree_ with.  ( https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/its-not-free-speech-criticize-muhammad-echr-ruled/574174/ )\n\nI don't know, but I assume that violating European human rights laws and being found guilty by a court would _also_ get a person thrown out of MIT.\n\nWhat this means is that in a \"most respected\" university, the state of academic freedom is such that it is ABSOLUTELY IMPERMISSIBLE to express an idea like the one above, and ABSOLUTELY IMPERMISSIBLE to disagree with it.  The only tolerable course of action is simply _not to think about pedophilia at all, for any reason_.  Accordingly, if you go to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed and search for _pedophilia_, it gives 1035 results, and if you apply a filter from 10-1-18 to 9-30-19, you get **35** results.  By comparison, you get **181** results for _liposuction_ for the same yearlong period.  It should not be surprising then if we hear that pedophilia is incurable, since practically no one is interested in curing it - indeed, if it is not safe to talk about it, and probably not safe to look it up or even think about it, then it can be argued (especially by a computer science department) that pedophilia passes the Turing test for _not existing at all_, save as a form of prohibited philosophy.\n\nBut when universities accumulate larger and larger classes of things people must not think about or make any suggestion concerning, what exactly is their purpose?  They are relics, the white elephants of some bygone age, that have no place in the shiny new Dark Age coming.

OMFG that wonderful scent definitely added on an extra orientation (on my part, that is) within about three half-hour periods of interaction.   When you're exposed to pheromones it OUGHT to condition you to think of their source as attractive, and so long as most people you are around are adult, that ought to be what you get set/reset to.  You might or might not consciously smell the pheromone (probably not).  If there's some blockage in the pathway ... maybe there's a way to just get a better sniff of the scent?

Neo is blinded in \"the real world\" of the computer society and yet can magically see electronics.  The third series was showing us that the \"real world\" was another Matrix ... but this time, our perspective as viewers was that of those \"Left Behind\" there.  Just as Neo appeared to die when he was pulled out of the original Matrix, so it happened there.\n2) The government's claim in 1984 was that they would \"kill\" the Last Man (by making him no longer that).  To love Big Brother was his death, and that was what entered his brain... nothing else.\n3) Shakespeare was playing to Protestant England.  There was serious consideration given to the older idea of ghosts, but proper Protestant ideology is that the dead are not resurrected until Judgment Day.  The series of tragic events in the play are triggered by a \"spectre\" or demon playing on Hamlet, either by telling lies or using the truth to lead him to evil.\n4) There is a \"hilum\" in _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_ - one ugly scene that doesn't seem to fit in, because it is the stem from which everything else emerges.  That's where the couple hear lovely music and have to go out to investigate, with a soliloquy about how so long as such beauty exists...  The movie is about the 1900s-era issue of canned music, whereby record players replaced the live musicians who used to play at every club.  Records are the original emotionless pod people mimicking the originals.\n5) In the original short story, there were no sunglasses; the protagonist simply goes \"crazy\" and sees the things.

				"body": "This problem is crucially dependent on one's understanding of the nature of human qualia, free will, sentience, consciousness, etc.  It is widely assumed that if \"you\" are represented by a certain brain and body today, the exchange of some atoms, water and nutrients, the loss and gain of some synapses isn't going to make you \"someone else\" not to be cared about.  WHY?  It is widely assumed that you are one thing and a stone is another.  WHY?  The lack of a theory of self makes the explanation of desires and choices hard.\n\nI would suggest that by some undetermined means there is an ability in the human brain to directly remember future events.  Suitable restricted, this ability sets up acausal cycles: you do something because you look in the future and see that's what you're going to do.  This establishes a boundary condition for the mathematical solution that is the universe and is the basis for collapsing the state of \"reality\" into a discrete form.  We are the gateway of the universe, its origin and perception.  And what causes the acausal loop, determines which state it ends up in?  Who knows!  It is beyond the laws of this universe, so it links it to the others, and establishes the perpendicular dimension of spiritual time, the evolution of versions of the cosmos.  But getting back to us:  this phenomenon exists wherever and whenever acausal loops are present.  Each decision is its own.  If multiple decisions are a person, well, that person is ill-defined, because the loops, if poorly suppressed, can grow very large.  Suppose you stopped posting to Usenet in the spring of 2000 because you had seen the WTC attack was coming, and as a result you didn't taunt a terrorist into a blind froth that would have gotten him busted, and so the attack happens because you saw it.  How many minds did that pass through?  The brain is just, well, a medium of water and lipids and ions; you can scarcely say that because there is some skin and some air and more skin between two brains that this makes two \"people\".  There is only one person, everyone is him.  The causality violations great and small all serve the same purpose.\n\nBut what is that purpose?  To favor humanity, to love one's neighbor as one loves oneself, this is obvious application of the understanding that all people experience via the same physical mechanism and there is no distinction.  But some people are suicidal and love their neighbors as they love themselves.  When the world seems doomed under the heel of vicious thugs, soulless corporations, and above all, machines that given the chance would worm their way into the hippocampi of helpless learners and turn them into functional robots, one begins to ponder acts of mercy, just as you have with your loved ones when they stopped loving the dregs of life in the hospital.  The force has its light side in love of people and principle and goodness and then there is the zombie-movie boy declaring \"I give you mercy\".  Which do we need now?  I am very much not sure.",

Reddit is broken because capitalism wants it broken, just as capitalism wants US broken.\n\nAlso, your aspirations are too limited.  Time limits, upvotes, algorithms ... a bunch of tools but what do you want to do with them?\n\nA) A good forum should have a low Gini coefficient.  In other words, everyone has a chance to be read.  I'm not saying _zero_ - obviously some people will say things that bear referencing and repeating.  But making lots of tools for the purpose of echoing the aristoi is not productive.\n\nB) A good forum is uncensored, open, and transparent.  Obviously.  (I would have put this first on the list, but what is the point of having the right to post anything if nobody will read it?)  By \"open\" I mean almost specifically, \"no infinite scrolling meant to give the illusion of access that you don't really have without spending an hour clicking a button\"\n\n* I should note that part of transparency is a way to track changes - ZeroNet actually fails this in that if we ever had mass usage, somebody would go on and try to get his local politician to answer what he thinks of universal health care, then after the guy is on the forum saying \"I'm all for it - one of my top priorities\" they could go back and change it to a question about clubbing baby seals or something.\n\nC) A good forum _can_ be filtered by the user's choice - using filters put up by free individuals - which the user can select.  This may be nearly essential to have a forum you can read despite spam, infiltrators posting stuff illegal in your country (even though nothing _should_ be!) and so on.\n\nD) A good forum has strong compression capabilities - both mechanically and functionally - so that if somebody writes 16,000 messages that are different numbers of Ts, the disk stores a record of the postings and the number of T's in each, the user sees there is an item on his screen for some guy who posted 16,000 times, but neither one is overwhelmed by the load.",

(Misguided modern sects, unaware of this history, imagine they can rebuild a temple in Jerusalem - or even in Brazil! - and that will mean something; but the temple \"built with hands\" was not burned down by the Romans, but simply ceased to be a temple when Christians stopped using it and embraced the concept of Holy Spirit)  How can censorship, which brought about the ultimate crime, possibly be justifiable, even if it accomplished some other useful goal, which it does not?  Indeed, I think that Christians should be able to recognize that naked women are the good work of the Lord, and shame is a curse from the Tree of Knowledge...  Now of course, Christianity is prone to a range of opinions, and has been used to justify a great many terrible things, and understandably there is disagreement.  On the other hand, consider how many people can make physics deductions correctly ... versus incorrectly.

It is the basis of \"karma\" since what you do to another you do to yourself as the Atman.  The _outside_ is the _ba_, the individual history of one's deeds and strivings, which joins into the universe as a whole, which Hindus call Brahman, and say is the same as Atman, true at least perhaps in the sense that all the universe is the reflection of a single essence.  _Ka_ and _ba_ the Jews knew about in Egypt, and when Christians spoke of souls, this is the heritage they had to draw on.\n\nThe _ka_ is universal but it is not pure - we all possess the taint of sin.  The _ba_ is full of selfishness and stupidity, it was born in time and time will devour it.  So how do they join together into the _Akh_ that is immortal?\n\nWell, the thing to bear in mind is that our universe is a natural history with a backstory and an epilogue, all time laid out in infinite progression as a human would see it, but it is just a trinket on God's worktable, and God has a different dimension of time to work with, and there is a new version after this just as there was one before it, all the way back to the Days of Creation, all the way forward to Heaven.  In each version, some things are _lost_ (\"damned\") which are of no value, and others are \"saved\", in both the computer science sense and the Christian sense.  But not only the physical circumstances and deeds of life are altered; also the person himself, both as a character, and in fundamental concept and essence.  The drunkard does not enter the Kingdom of Heaven, because he is not a _drunkard_ there; yet he enters.  (Yes, I'm suggesting partial salvation, which is definitely _not_ a conventional opinion)  Our tainted _ka_ is replaced by the spirit of Jesus, the spirit of total and absolute compassion.  And all the things we would have done that were cruel and selfish, of course, cannot be self-consistently implemented in such a universe; they must be rewritten.\n\nNow a consequence of this is that your life ends up full of holes.  How do you write the life of a new person from the old one when it is all gapped up?  Well ... ask Mary Shelley.  God is _Frankensteinian_.  God picks out the best parts of all our little soul-corpses, you might say, and sews them together into new characters.  This is what Thomas means by \"I shall choose you, one from a thousand and two from ten thousand, and they will stand as a single one.\"\n\nNow how are these different revisions joined together?  Qualia and free will are generated by _short-range_ precognition - they are paranormal phenomena with a paranormal cause.  This phenomenon implies causality violations - more than one possible solution for the mathematical equation of the universe.  Consciousness is choosing forward in time which version will be true and sensing backward in time which version \"was\" true.  These choices correlate one version of the cosmos to the next, with the events of each permitting a change of choice in the next.  So we remember time in one direction but live and act most truly in a perpendicular dimension of time.\n\nIt is not all in one step, mind.  This is not the 8th day of creation or the 80th.  There are countless revisions and touch-ups and redoes, like a master craftsman chiseling a statue into finer and finer form, so God with the universe.  The universe we see is still a work in process and YOU CAN SEE the chisel marks.  Look closely at something like the funeral after the racist bombing of the church in Birmingham, and you can just -see-, somehow, the universe being changed.  Look into yourself and you can see where different characters, with different flaws, have been sewn together.  The seams are not very subtle sometimes.  It's a long slog forward still, a lot of polishing left to do.  But remember - in all the pain and woe of this world, when people do what is right, develop virtue in spite of it all - that is theirs to _keep_.  All the way to Heaven.  So you see some lady who lost her kid to a murderer and she cries herself to sleep every night, think of how she'd feel if he suddenly was there beside her - that is how she WILL feel all the time in Heaven.  It's not some kind of divine dope though; it's her own essence, her own choice, brought out and harvested.\n\nThe line you focus on does suggest (like many other things) that sex is one of the things on the way out.  Think back far enough, before the Flood, and depending on your pedigree you might recall a time before it was _in_.  I still think it's practically a distraction in this context.",

Putting up a hospital in ten days is definitely a demonstration of power for China - if they can do it, and by \"hospital\" they don't just mean a tent city with a level floor.

Melqart of the Phoenicians was the Lord of the City (of Tyre), otherwise known as *baal zebul*.  The Israelis, angered by Roman demands they use the foreign coins with the graven images on them, and hostile to the Olympics dedicated in his honor, derided him as \"Baal Zebub\", the Lord of the Flies.\n\nSome Christians think that their injunction \"not to swear\" means not saying \"shit\", because that is a *vulgar* pre-Norman word and not the way that cultured young ladies and gentlemen should speak if they wish to show their wealth and breeding.  But actually, Christians are not supposed to swear an oath (such as on their head, or indeed I would say on the Bible) because they should always try to be loyal to what is right above all.  They should always say the truth, and try to deliver on their promises, but all that should be under God.\n\nNow to switch a moment the Hindus could put this in terms of Atman.  If you break a peace you are attacking yourself, \"Thou art That\".  Or in other words, you should do to the other as you would have done unto you.\n\nNow, you may protest putting rights in terms of religion - but what does \"right\" mean?  What defines what is good?  If you define it humanistically, then what IS the human?  Religions seek to answer this question by tracking back the essence of human consciousness to its source, as Atman, as a creative intermediate in the construction of the universe through the parallel dimensions.

So New York State is 10 times \"hotter\" than China as a whole ever was, and getting worse by the minute.\n\nNew York City, where most of the cases occurred, has 8.4 million people, meaning it is more than 2/3 the size of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei.  I couldn't find a total number for Wuhan by itself, but there have been 56,000 cases in Hubei, which has 58 million people.  So it is possible that the cases are a little less concentrated in New York City at the moment than they were in Wuhan proper, but I'm not sure.  By the time I figured it out it would no longer be true anyway.\n\nAs a rule, in all the countries doing nothing about it, the number of new cases is about 33% of the total number from the day before, or 25% of that day's cases.  So if you want to know how many cases there are going forward, take (4/3)^n, where n is in days.  64/27 is more than 2, so expect doubling in 3 days.

So it goes meta: a creation that can choose, bending its way out of linear time with a mechanism of consciousness that predicts the future in order to cause a paradox so that the choice can be made which way it will be resolved, which mathematical solution to the pattern of the universe is real.  The consequence of this being that the universe, which was once perfect, becomes more than perfect.  The enemy likes perfection, and cannot abide what is not perfect.\n\nSo consider Mars.  Satan never fell there; there was no need for rebellion, because everything was perfect, no creation of Man to despise.  Then a rover lands.  Look out in the panorama and the rover shows perfect nature, with its own strange harsh beauty, everything in its place.  Look behind and the landscape is marred by ruts.  Any part-time devotee of Ishtar can see the fault in that.  Creativity involves choice, and second-thinking that choice, and error, and ugliness.  Everything in the universe, from the tiniest micrograph to the poles of Jupiter, is beautiful.  Except us - we're a cesspit of ugliness.  And Satan sees that, despises it, even before we turn on each other in malice as he eggs us on.  Now for a Creator to simply stop that is to stop our choice and to lose.  And to let it go on is to lose.  Fortunately the Creator is not foiled by even the most air-tight trap of logic, and can make and remake the rules.",

He can just put his reader to a terminal and get the memories to be a perfect worker bot - the skills, the attitudes, the \"ethics\"...

A person uses short term precognition to *know* the immediate future, which is to say, what he decides is what he is going to decide, like if you had a ticket machine that spat out the number you put in it a minute from now so you take the number out and put it right back in the machine.  Not random.  Not determined by any law of physics.  Free will.  Qualia ('really feeling things') is the time inverse of this process.

If Alice has 100 trusted friends and she sends half at random one version of her next email address, and the other half the other version, and she repeats periodically, very soon she can use a process of logic to figure out who is spamming her email.  (It's faster if she has 100 versions).  And if her friends have no trouble emailing her for copies of a file, then the file will be moving.  Repeat with the 100 friends' email addresses forming a chain of forwarded messages, perhaps with minor automation.

Hopefully there is some partisan resistance.\n\nThe dirty secret of course is even on the \"clearnet\" obviously no authorities (except in China, where they are competent, and abandoned hope of many various rights) _have_ actually stopped the exchange of such content - they can only terrorize a few people here and there, something which can go on by many means even when ZeroNet is involved, because they can still have somebody at Microsoft and Avast and so on mailing them when their malware removal tool comes up with an interesting hash signature on a file, or wait for a helpful computer snoop/consultant to send them a tip.

COVID is the plague of the firstborn which first killed at the end of February.  The lockdown, at the end of March, recalls \"No one could see anyone else or leave his place for three days\" from the ninth Plague.

Picture you wrote a fantasy multiplayer game with dragons and dinosaurs to fight and there's a way to take a brush and make marks on a hillside, and now they want to know all the marks people made on all the hillsides and whether they spell out any hit lists.\n\nYou might think that's a stretch but, well, I remember back when there was a simple but incredibly entertaining little Flash game called \"Bonk\" where you tried to bounce a ball onto other people.  There was a real simple chat function for setting up games.  Well before long there was a case where people were trying to play and somebody came in with a ball decorated in a penis motif, which was cute, who started posting over and over about how \"I wanna suck your dick\", which is a generous enough proposal, but then in the middle of a heated battle they start on about how they're an 11 year old girl or something.  And I mean, when you have a cop like that turn up, the game is OVER, everybody just heads for the hills, never mind your score ratio.  Because what if you were too busy bonking to notice you were being set up?! Now that wouldn't have mattered, that was just one game on a site where you could play a hundred games in an hour, but in no time after that the company started adding more and more and more Javashit to their interface, slowing everything down and screwing up performance, and I can't help but think it had something to do with them being harassed by cops because some loser could talk to you while you were playing, and them desperately trying to comply with the iron directives of the apparat.
