'Listen to me!' they scream in desperation. 'Fuck you' we respond, and happily mute them. Next you'll be insisting that the mute function be removed, so we are forced to listen to the drivel of assholes. Not going to happen.\n\n> Exposing yourself to banned viewpoints is part of the reason to leave censored platforms, isn't it?\nNot everyone is here for the same reason. Some are here because they've been steadily banned everywhere else. And sadly, there are a few people who probably follow those people to different platforms. But I'm here because this is an interesting platform, and I'm evaluating it for potential use by clients, for non-asshole purposes.",
