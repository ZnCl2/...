				"body": "You can apply to leave with the existing exemption process if you arent vaxxed. This is current govt policy.\n\nSince you want to leave permanently, you would qualify. \n\nThey want a 'compelling reason' and for you to be leaving for more than 3 months. I assume the latter is the case and you have the former covered.\n\nAny proof of residence abroad, your relationship, whatever you can submit as proof, give them these things.\n\nThey also want a statuatory declaration signed, to assure you are leaving for more than 3 months and what you say is truthful. Im guessing this is so they can fine/prosecute people who go back on their word. If you arent going to do that, not a problem.\n\nCheck out this facebook page for more info and to get ideas on what works. Even if you dont use fb id sign up just to talk with others in that group, and they can help.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/217915689638972/\n\nMany people tried more than once to get their exemption and got it. You can also contact an immigration lawyer if your applications get rejected and try go through them.",
