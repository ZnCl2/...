Use Wire, or XMPP with otr if you want to actually be secure. If people used a secure platform this would never have happened since there would be no server side keys to ask for in the first place.",

In theory, though, it's better than wire or signal due to being decentralized.",

Telegram doesn't really win on any level other than advertising.",
