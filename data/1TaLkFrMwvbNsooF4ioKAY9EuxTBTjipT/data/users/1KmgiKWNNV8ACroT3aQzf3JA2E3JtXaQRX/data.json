			"title": "why drinking at work makes sense.",
			"body": "i used to wonder why some people do this, but now i think i understand. \nwhen a potential employer asks me if i work well in a team, my answer is \"it depends on the team\" - it has happened before, but usually its just me doing most of the work while the rest of the team is along for the ride. 80-20 principle. these weasels spend large amounts of time developing advanced and innovative techniques in the art of standing around. im sure it must add up to 1-2 hours out of each shift of just standing about chatting shit. they will then complain that they dont have enough time to get all their work done, before going home early.\nand then you have the 20% who are doing 80% of the work. what do you suppose the 80% weasels make of that? well, the nail that sticks up gets hammered down. they resent you for going against their bullshit narratives, you glitch in the matrix, you. \nand it do be like that. they are in the matrix- the matrix of their own bullshit. they believe the crap that comes out their mouths. \nthis brings us to the fundamental problem preventing a cohesive team- the iq gap. \nhonestly, these weasels would probably get more work done if they wherent using so much of their precious little intelligence weaving up new excuses for their bullshit narrative every time i come along and punch holes in it by getting shit done. \nwhile i cannot increase other peoples iq, what i CAN do, is reduce my own iq to match. \nusing alcohol to reduce my productivity, and reduce the number of fucks i give, creates a more cohesive team and less stressful work enviroment.",
