[...]\n\nThis ‚òù\n\nWars, dictatorships, kingdoms, etc have been the norm throughout most of our history. A free society has never been the \"normal\" state of affairs. Living in a free society is something that we have to fight for, it's not a \"right\", it's a privilege that we must defend if we wish to continue enjoying it.\n\nIt is up to each one of us to decide whether to fight for freedom or surrender and live under tyranny.\n\nLike Emiliano Zapata said (although I don't necessarily agree with his political views):\n\"Prefiero morir de pie que vivir de rodillas\"",
