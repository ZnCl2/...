				"body": "> [tnytuqsgqnywmecj](#comment_33_19y1ZG2DVeRM65kYxKcLz7MLGTfTfoUWSm): You would expect illegal content to be on the DARKNET, yet you can find search engines linking to such! ...\n\nThe primary goal with this kind of content should always be to find the producers and bring them to justice. It is hard to do that if you're in the US and the creator is in Russia. I'm not sure about Trump talking to the Russians about it but it wouldn't surprise me if it did come up at some point. Another problem the west faces is that they (presumably) know blocking it would be a waste of time and resources, this is because almost anyone could get past it and no one is likely to find it by accident. The final reason they can't just block the content is that if they block it, it will just be hosted elsewhere. You would either have to automate the process entirely which would not be a good idea (https://gizmodo.com/british-cops-want-to-use-ai-to-spot-porn-but-it-keeps-m-1821384511), or ban everything except for a select few sites (which is also bad, for obvious reasons).",
