It has been the only place where users and companies had the same voice.\n\nNew EU law involves that big internet companies will have to have more caution with copyright content because they could pay high fines. In order to avoid it, content filters will be harder than now. Small webs will not have the same restrictions, but it's just an excuse because all of us know that most of traffic are from big internet companies.\n\nI think we won't be as affected as some people say, but I think we will lose our Internet slowly step by step.",
