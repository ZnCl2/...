			"body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQSYdAX_9JY\n\nWho is Bill Gates? A software developer? A businessman? A philanthropist? A global health expert? This question, once merely academic, is becoming a very real question for those who are beginning to realize that Gates' unimaginable wealth has been used to gain control over every corner of the fields of public health, medical research and vaccine development. And now that we are presented with the very problem that Gates has been talking about for years, we will soon find that this software developer with no medical training is going to leverage that wealth into control over the fates of billions of people.",

			"body": "Renegade Film - A Feature Documentary, featuring David Icke The 'mad man' who has been proved right again and again and again David Icke has been warning for nearly 30 years of a coming global Orwellian state in which a tiny few would enslave humanity through control of finance, government, media and a military-police Gestapo overseeing 24/7 surveillance of a micro-chipped population. He has said that 'physical' reality is an illusion and what we think is the 'world' is a holographic simulation or 'Matrix' created by a non-human force to entrap human perception in ongoing servitude. They called him 'crazy', 'insane', a 'lunatic', and he was subjected to decades of ridicule, dismissal and abuse. Oh, but how things change. Today his books are read all over the world and his speaking events are watched by thousands on every continent. Why? Because what he has been so derided for saying is now happening in world events and even mainstream scientists are concluding that reality is indeed a simulation. Almost every day something that David Icke said long ago is supported by happenings and evidence. As Mahatma Gandhi said: 'First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.' David Icke's time has come.\n\n\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt9715646/\n\nhttps://www./watch?v=TJUw2s3Wgi8\n\n\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:F5D7DC2BA43D0C48F2FA8F4844F95CD38BFBA939&dn=Renegade.The.Life.Story.of.David.Icke.2019.1080p.WEBRip.x264-RAR&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2F9.rarbg.me%3A2850%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2F9.rarbg.to%3A2920%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969%2Fannounce",

			"body": "According to former intelligence officer Steve Pieczenik, President Trump assumed Democrat tomfoolery would be needed to prevent him from securing a second term via the 2020 election.\n\nIn order to ensure the election remained fair, POTUS devised an advanced trap.\n\nHidden, trackable watermarks were allegedly put onto ballots so they could be verified if necessary.\n\n“This is really a sting operation, contrary to what everyone else said,” Pieczenik explained. “We watermarked every ballot with QFS blockchain encryption code. In other words, we know pretty well where every ballot is, where it went and who has it, so this is not a stolen election.”\n\nSteve also said President Trump has been out of the spotlight of the media over the past few days in order to let the Deep State dig its own grave, politically.\n\nUpon investigating QFS blockchain technology, Infowars found an application for a patent filed by the United States Postal Service on February 7, 2020 which involved blockchain tracking tech embedded into mail-in ballots.\n\n\nhttps://www.infowars.com/posts/groundbreaking-claim-trump-set-up-democrats-in-sophisticated-sting-operation-caught-stealing-election-red-handed/",

It's designed for huge servers with 10-s of GiB of RAM to spare, not laptops or desktop computers. Basically, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE YACY IS CRAP AND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CRAP FROM THE VERY START! But the ideas there are good, just that good ideas without a proper implementation are almost worthless. Also, when someone thinks of implementing their own P2P search engine, then please take to account the fact that there will be malicious nodes on the P2P-network and not that many people are willing to spend money on hosting  other people's data.

				"body": "Why use Beaker?\n\nTraditionally on the Web, servers host websites and manage user data. With Beaker, users host websites and manage user data. Beaker is a new approach to the Web and to online applications.\nNo backend, no DevOps\n\nBeaker connects users with a peer-to-peer mesh. Applications run as client-side SPAs and store their data in networked folders.\n\nFor many applications, this means that no server or backend is needed. You create your app from the browser and then share its URL with your audience – and that's it! They'll fetch the application from you and use their own device to run the software.\nView & edit source\n\nBecause Beaker applications run on the client, the entire source of the app is available in the browser. Beaker includes a builtin editor so you can access this source code immediately.\n\nHyperdrive is a complete filesystem and so Beaker's editor can edit the files with no problem. You can build your entire application without ever using another tool.\nDistributed (and reduced) costs\n\nWhen you don't have to set up a server, you don't have to pay for a server. Effectively every user is contributing their own bandwidth, compute, and storage to run the application. That means that you, as a developer, are no longer shouldering the hosting costs alone.\nA global hypermedia filesystem\n\nHyperdrive is a filesystem where every folder and file has a URL. Everything is linkable, and everything is accessible over the Internet (pursuant to access controls, of course).\n\nApplications use this linkability to join data across users and apps. There are no data siloes on the Beaker Web.\nVersioned data\n\nHyperdrive is a versioned filesystem. You can access old revisions of files and link to pinned versions. This is helpful for referencing specific copies, viewing changes over time, and recovering from bad writes or deletes.",

The ability for customer or self made skins was just the cake icing. Sadly, It all went downhill when the AA's started to crackdown on the Streaming agent of winamp that would let anyone host a podcast with video or music (remember those Simpsons, Stargate, StarTrek, SouthPark, FamilyGuy, Porn, and etc marathon streams that could be found in the Winamp Media Library under audio/video podcasts? I do!). Eventually, the US government went after Nullsoft for not carrying a broadcaster license which caused the company to break the podcast portion of the client, abandon 98% of the audio and visual plugin developers, branch Shoutcast to an orphaned company, and abandon the development of Winamp in which it later got sold to the company that holds it now, who hasn't done much of anything with the once open sourced asset other than enforce the trademarks of it. [...]\n\n100% accurate they turned shoutcast into a paid cloud service vs being something you can setup yourself and broadcast",
