It makes people even starve to death. And when your mind works with the fuel of an extreme ideology, you will proceed to destroy every single thing that is trying to oppose it. Currently, the opposing ideology against this, is liberalism of the west. As someone who is living under a religious totalitarian dictatorship, I  can tell you a true believer will do anything to defend this mindset, from backstabbing its best friend, to killing its own people, even applying something cruel like scorched earth policy.Another thing is that an extremist ideology doesn't die off and decay over time, unless with the light of wisdom. Because of the poor education, bad infrastructure, and horrible economy, it's a very unlikely thing to happen. something like renaissance should happen in the middle east in order to eradicate the extremist mindset, just exactly like something that happened at the end of the medieval ages in Europe.But there's a problem. Due to geopolitical reasons, the world doesn't really want this renaissance to happen. It's good to have a poor middle east, drowning in war and economic crisis. It brings them cheap oil, arms sales and it also makes China's development programs harder.Don't underestimate strong ideology and geopolitics.\n\nthere are no poor in the liberal west and the education is of such high quality that ivermectine is a dangerous product like the mortal HCQ, or the even more dangerous zinc, vit c or d. of course, I don't defend anything nor anyone. have fun in your utopia, it's gonna be great. and btw poor doesn't mean uneducated, or uncertifited educated.... common sense, a thing you can't teach, like kindmess, humility, modesty, careing, sharing, or even loving. but me me me... have fun.",
