Issue is that it's not the best idea modtly cause if you use tor package installed from APT you will get outdated package (about 1 years old). What I recomend is to update Ubuntu to 21.10 and update Tor. That makes my tracker run very stable and always 100% sucess. PS: You can check Tor version by using ```apt install nyx``` , after running nyx it should show you on top if you have recomended version. Thank you.",
