Too many people go to jail for nothing. A few years back, going to jail was bad, You had to be bad. Now You go to jail just like that,  for being good. You can't even predict when You go to jail. EU is really really way to deep in this shit.  Some crazy ass fucks say something like \"new world order\" (those from ufos and aliens and shit), but there is a New World Order which is: we put in prison everyone. We need changes. We need freedom. And we will have to fight for it.",
