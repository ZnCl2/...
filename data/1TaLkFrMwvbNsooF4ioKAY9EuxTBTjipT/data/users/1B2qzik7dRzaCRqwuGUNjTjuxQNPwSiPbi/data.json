				"body": "The opposite, actually. Society is becoming more atomized and real connections between people are becoming weaker. As a result people are instead being fed a manufactured \"consciousness\" and being pressured into it via manipulated social proof. The end result is diversity in ideas being drown out by a wave of monopolized, manufactured ideas that at surface value seems benevolent, but are actually intended to force you to think in self defeating ways to ensure you can never be a threat to those who currently hold power.\n\nAll you have to do is look at the result of current monopolies in our society to see how destructive they are. Companies never have to concern themselves with having their status and power tested, meaning they no longer truly grow. They stagnate and just become worse, as there is no pressure to advance and improve in order to maintain that power. This is now happening on a global scale with \"ideas\" in the common human being's mind. It's nothing but tragic.",
