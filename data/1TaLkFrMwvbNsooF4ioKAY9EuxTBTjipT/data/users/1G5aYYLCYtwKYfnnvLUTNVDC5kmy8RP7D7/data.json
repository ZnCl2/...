			"body": "Here's the Wikipedia link:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_anti-extradition_bill_protests#Storming_of_Legislative_Council_Complex\n\nI'm very upset about what they did. I admit that the rule of the election in Hong Kong is not democratic. But it is still the rule. \nThe rule, we call it constitution, which is the protection of individual rights. It can't be perfect.\nFreedom is the ultimate goal. Democracy is the way. The constitution is the guarantee of democracy. \nNow, they have stormed the legislature. They abandoned the constitution. Then where to place democracy they pursued? Some of them already have become criminals.\nMany of them don't want to be involved in the investigation. They totally screwed up.\nIf China Mainland has democracy today, people have the real right to protest. What happened in Hong Kong would be \nthousands of times in China Mainland.\nDo you know how many people in China? More than a billion. I can't imagine if several billion people don't agree with the result of an election and they are about to storm the Congress. That's horrible.\nIf there is no respect for the Constitution, democracy would be dangerous.",
