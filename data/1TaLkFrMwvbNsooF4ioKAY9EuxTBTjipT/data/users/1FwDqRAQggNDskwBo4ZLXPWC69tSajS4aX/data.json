			"body": "@Nofish\n\nIm chinese, in China, when you open ZeroNet for the first time, you will always receive the \"TRACKER CONNECTION ERROR DETECTED\" prompt right now. And then an \"Use Tor meek bridges for tracker connections\" button will appear.\n\nThese prompts may confuse Chinese users who do not understand English. If you change these prompts from English to Chinese, it will bring convenience to Chinese users.\n\nThe following is the Chinese translation that I provide corresponding to these prompts.\n\n> **TRACKER CONNECTION ERROR DETECTED** = **检测到TRACKER连接出错**\n\n> **Use Tor meek bridges for tracker connections** = **点此使用Tor meek网桥进行Tracker连接**\n\n\nIn the translation of this button, I added two more words: **点此**. It means \"Click here\", The complete meaning is \"Click here to use Tor meek bridges for tracker connections\". I did this because when I first saw this button, I didn't even think it was a button but just a prompt message. Of course, you can also ignore these two words.\n\nAlso the \"CONFIG\" in the upper left corner of the page can also be translated into Chinese. \n\n> **CONFIG** = **配置**",

But unfortunately I am not a programmer, I can not create these features.",
