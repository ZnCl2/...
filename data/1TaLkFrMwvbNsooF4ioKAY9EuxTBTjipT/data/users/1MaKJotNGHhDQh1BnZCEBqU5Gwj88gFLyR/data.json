The sqLite db is more a handy way to read values stored in your data json and in your user jsons.\nThe intended way of 'write' data in your zite is somehow changing these jsons and sign/publish them again. The zeronet engine will then rebuild the DB and the data you have changed will be now there.\nIt's hard to explain because I don't really get it honestly ;) Just grab some code and read it!",
