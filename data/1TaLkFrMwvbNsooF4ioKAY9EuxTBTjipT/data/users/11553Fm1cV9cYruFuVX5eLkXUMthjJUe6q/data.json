The web was mostly text, people talking, blogging, etc. It took 4 hours to download some shitty gif with titties as late as 1994/5. So it was decentralized, open, wild west...and you werent tracked every second, and there wasn't shitloads of data grabbing and insane code that you had to wait to load. I like this place for this reason, the fluff is taken out. There are many many things I like about the modern web, but the lack of ideas and pure anonymous text, and the fact that youre tracked every second makes me sad.",
