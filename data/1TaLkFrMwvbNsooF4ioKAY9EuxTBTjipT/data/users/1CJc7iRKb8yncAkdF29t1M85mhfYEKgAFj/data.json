And other pages may also have similar problems.\n\nI have no idea why wget only fails to convert some links. There are just over one hundred which failed to convert, which exist in both http and https urls, and other links that are apparently just like them are converted (i.e. the [french version of that article](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1XinYeo9fCjP5VrayvR6iBMzyyWWq963J/docs/fr-fr/python-fr/index.html)). Do you know of good software to programmatically change these links for me?",
