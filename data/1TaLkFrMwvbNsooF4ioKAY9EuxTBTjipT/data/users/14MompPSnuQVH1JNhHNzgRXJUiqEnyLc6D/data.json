			"title": "Question About ZeroNet Gateways",
			"body": "So I realize there are already some ZeroNet gateways/proxies available on the clearnet and a few on Tor. Unfortunately, it seems many of these gateways limit which sites can be viewed and how much space they will allow a site to use. I was wondering if anyone could point me to some info on how to set up an HTTPS gateway, preferably as an onion service, and especially any info on how to set one up on a cloud computing platform such as Google Cloud. I think it would help free speech on the internet as well as make it even easier for regular people to access from the clearnet or Tor without having ZeroNet installed. I of course think people should run it themselves, but I think it would also be good to have a larger network of gateways, kind of like IPFS seems to have.",
