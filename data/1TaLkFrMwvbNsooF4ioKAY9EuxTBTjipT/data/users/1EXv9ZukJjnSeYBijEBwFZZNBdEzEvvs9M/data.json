It seems to only show when you have stuff in your news feed like this photo: https://thetinhat.com/tutorials/images/zeronet-interface.jpg\n\nWhen there's nothing in the news feed then it looks like this: https://bluishcoder.co.nz/images/zeronet1.png",

If I understand correctly once one of those sites displays a notification in my feed all the sites become connected sites?  Is there a way for me to put something fake in my feed to activate the search bar for when I need it? The pictures above are ones I found on google cause i'm not sure how to upload images here.",
