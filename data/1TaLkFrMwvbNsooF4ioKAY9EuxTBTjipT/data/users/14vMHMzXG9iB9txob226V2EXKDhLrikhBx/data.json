I know gold has some uses but you can't eat it if you are starving.\n\nAnd yet it is still returned to as a means of exchange whenever society collapses, as recent as the Serbian war. Often you can't even FIND food, let alone trade with it - it decays too quick to make any investment in it worth it beyond the span of a few days. The reason as to why society keeps going back to gold is that it is useful in a barter economy due to its rarity, ability to withstand the elements, etc. It will never rot or decay like food or wood, and it can be easily verified by just measuring it. Ironically enough in the era where our economy is defined by what is effectively monopoly money, nobody knows what defines something as 'valuable' anymore.",
