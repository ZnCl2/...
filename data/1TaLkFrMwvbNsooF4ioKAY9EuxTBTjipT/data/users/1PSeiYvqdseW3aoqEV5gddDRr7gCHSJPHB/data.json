That kind of terminology is half the problem surrounding the scientific and medical fields today and stems from a gross misunderstanding of both fields and the philosophy underlying them.\n\nThe mail error of the moderna societ√† Is thinking that science Is a religion. Science Is based on proofs at contrary of religion that Is based on Beliefs",

				"body": "i'm sure that zeronet userbase is growing fast due to how clearnet is becoming, but we need a less buggy sync code and more trackers. today i opened a new tracker by using the VPS that OVH give to me after the fire at Strasbourg, but Galactichan node finding is very slow and less shared files often go dead share! (also my dedicated server seedbox is hard to find...) we should fix sync problems and also port the TOR code to the new version of hidden service if we want zeronet to survive and be useful. Geekless some time ago started a fork of this project. anyone know how this is going?",
