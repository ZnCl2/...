				"body": "It depends on your definition of \"too sketchy\". Millchan gives you plenty of tools to easily manage the content you're seeding and whom are you seeding it from (e.g., allowing to mute users, blacklist boards, disable thumbnails, open user directories). The choice of using those tools is up to you. If you want moderators randomly deciding the things you're allowed to say and see you can literally use any other imageboard on earth.\n\nThat being said I can confidently say I've seen more illegal content in clearnet imageboards than I've seen in Millchan. As of the time of this post I'd classify less than 1% (0.83% to be more precise) of its content as \"sketchy\". Nonetheless, the risk of hosting nonsense will always be there but that also applies to any zite that allows for user submitted content.\nTaking care of your OPSEC with encryption and Tor is probably the best thing you can do if you're interested in hosting anything in ZeroNet at all.",
