				"body": "all homelessness could be solved if we designated a certain amount of land per county basically free from zoning laws/ highly relaxed zoning for the poor. Poor people could afford roughly 30-50k mortgage over 10 years for just a plot of land with septic+outhouse, and then live in their car or something on the land. With a PHEV poors could live in them and use a small power hookup to run a/c 24/7.\n counties get bitchy if you even want to set up a trailer in the wrong place, so this will never happen.",
