I'll still use it though since hiro hasn't gone evil (yet), /a/ and /g/ have been pretty entertaining.",

I'm guessing gevent is a class?  That wouldn't be in a data file.  It would be in a standard library in python or in a python file that is missing?  Just guessing.  Anyway, so I can't get the python 3 version of ZeroNet to run.\n\ngevent is probably an installable package. try `pip3 install gevent`",
