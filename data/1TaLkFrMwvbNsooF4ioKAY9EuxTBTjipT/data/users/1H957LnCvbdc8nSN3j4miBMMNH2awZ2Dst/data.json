			"body": "Hi everyone, I'm from Turkey and this is my first post. I did some research and I really surprised how zeronet works. There is less community but efficient. Maybe we can open Turkish forum also. It will be great. Bcs our country seems a bit governed by a monarchy. Even it's not certain but netflix could even be shut down anytime soon. There are rumors that way. I'm sure if I could share this place with more people, we'd be a huge community.",
