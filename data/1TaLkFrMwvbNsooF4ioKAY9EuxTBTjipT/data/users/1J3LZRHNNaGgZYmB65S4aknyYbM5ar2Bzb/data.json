			"body": "Hi guys. I find a bug/problem in many zites engine (ZeroTalk, ZeroBlog). If I use an alternative cert for publishing posts/comments - KaffieID, I has a kind of problem in which the username doesn't change near my posts in my web-forum after I changed it in KaffieID cert provider. If you want try to reproduce it, you should do following:\n\n1. Go to the related zites which support KaffieID authorization method (like [this](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1G56gcfMzp7695tpSHJN8qRR5N2pfTe7fw/) one)\n2. Login with KaffieID (or other clone of that)\n3. Post a comment/post.\n4. Change your username in KaffieID homepage.\n5. Return to the zite in which you posted before.\n\nNow you can see that name **doesn't change** and even if you post a new comment/post or even update the zite, it **still remain** the same.",
