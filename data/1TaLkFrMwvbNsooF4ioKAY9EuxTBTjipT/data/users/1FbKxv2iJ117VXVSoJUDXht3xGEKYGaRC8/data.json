The people all held some nice views. \nBut what the for the love of god do the millennials have to do with this? \nThey are just going along their business, developing their own views, own interests, own generation.\nI wouldn't start accusing someone for ruining my life simply because they are from different times and have different perspectives.\nI think you might need to accept that people are simply passing away, freeing the stage for new performances and potentials, even if at first sight it simply looks like they are throwing crap at the wall or even hidden under a sea of irrelevance, which, is as much of a shame.\nI have no issue with anyone disliking it, but the way  you're generalizing is actually rather counter productive. \nIf you want the millennials to have respect for these people, then I would have to suggest you try and actually expose that generation to some remnants from the time without being invasive and judgmental about their generation, after all, they are humans too.",

Found that I didn't really care for most of the people or activities in my life when alcohol wasn't involved. You'll find yourself again :) Just give it time\n\nThis.",
