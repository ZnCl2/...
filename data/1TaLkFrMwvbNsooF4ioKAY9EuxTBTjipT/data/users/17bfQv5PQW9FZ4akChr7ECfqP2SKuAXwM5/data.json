[...]\n\nSomeone made a post about using a thumb drive for ZeroNet and it thrashed it. Those, like SD cards, have a more limited read/write lifespan than SSD/HDD.\n\nIf you're going to do any investment, and you already have a spare external drive, you could simply buy a Raspberry Pi (~$50) and plug in the external drive to it and access it over the network (which will also give you a cheap solution to test out using Linux.) \n\nFrom that you could also set up a media center / torrent box so you won't have to mess with your main system. It becomes a pain to reformat, resize, etc. unless you know exactly what you're going to use your system for and it's not going to change (not to discourage you from experimenting, just a heads up!) \n\nIf you're not doing anything serious on Linux yet, you could always just load up a Live USB and use it when you need it to play around without having to modify your system and find a distro you like. You can then mount your Windows drive and access your files without having to partition anything.\n\nLots of roads you can take, just depends on what you're willing to work on and what you have available :)",

I guess I was thinking of the SD card maybe for running an OS as an alternative to a Live USB or internal HDD install (and to save a USB port). IIRC Puppy loads into RAM and only reads/writes to the card on boot and quit. I wonder how much other live versions can do that. [...]\n\nRunning the OS from a SD probably wouldn't be an issue, as long as no programs are reading / writing to it heavily. \n\n\"Persistence\" or \"Persistent Live\" would probably be good search term to find one that saves to the USB.",

I could HEAR when it paused itself, based on the 'ultrasound' coming from the laptop.  (It doesn't come from the speaker, it's like the motherboard or something making the sound)  To be sure, that didn't work on the next two laptops, which only go through their ultrasound pulse for a short time once in a blue moon - that was after the story came out in the press, so I suppose they must have modified it.\n\nYou have sensitive ears and can her electronics, congratulations.",

Microsoft has special, secret ways to try to punish you for your blasphemy.  Text boxes just barely scroll over to the next line.  Underlines turn up in white so you don't notice they're gone.  Tables in Word spill out to the next page when you go to print them and so on.  LibreOffice IS by all means the go-to program for your own use, or use with sensible people who run it. [...]\n\nNope. Haven't used that since high school many moons ago. I know MicroShaft dorks all their malware, but I thought I might offer a suggestion (for anyone else reading along as well.) \n\n\"the synaptics drivers are included out of the box in pretty much every linux distro... And I've found them to be very good. One of the reasons I started using linux on my laptop over windows was that touchpads are just so atrocious to use under windows, regardless of what touchpad hardware and driver I used in windows (super buggy two finger scrolling, often impossible to configure two finger/three finger tap etc...), while the same touchpad hardware always works wonderfully out of the box in linux distros. I don't know how anyone can stand using a touchpad under windows. /rant\n\nWhat touchpad do you have? Have you run into any particular problems when trying to use it under linux?\"\n\n~Post 6yrs ago https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1d9yzf/what_are_the_best_laptop_touchpad_drivers_for/\n\nI've never had an issue with touchpads that I can recall.",
