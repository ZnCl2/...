You'll also want to make sure your webserver's (e.g nginx) file upload limit isn't too small either.\n\nIf you're not running your own server, then you'll need to consult the person/people who are.\n\nBut Riot *itself* does not impose a limit.",

Yes, (other than the Riot mobile clients), I believe so.\n\nHowever if you're talking about Jitsi calls, those can just be taken from any browser - just navigate to the https://jitsi.riot.im/xxx URL.\n\nYou can also download and run your own copy of Riot, or build it [from source](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web) to avoid what you consider insecure js :)",
