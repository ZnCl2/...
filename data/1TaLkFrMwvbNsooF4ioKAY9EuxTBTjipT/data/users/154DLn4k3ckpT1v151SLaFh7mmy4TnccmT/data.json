			"body": "Many lottery players do secretly hope and very often even believe that they will hit the jackpot, telling themselves that if they do not play there is zero chance, but if they do there is a miniscule chance, thinking that they are special and deserve a better life.\n\nAt the same time they leave their house on a thunderstorm, constantly use public transportation, driving daily with their cars without being afraid at all, when chances of dying in an accident or getting hit by a lightning are many many times higher.",
