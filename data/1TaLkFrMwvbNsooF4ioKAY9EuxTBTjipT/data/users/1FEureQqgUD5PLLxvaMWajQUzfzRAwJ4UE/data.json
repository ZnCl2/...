My guess is it'd be a mix of nanobots building and/or supporting bigger structures, using either drugs or more nanobots to fight the body's rejection of them. Maybe after that we'll be able to organically grow silicon/metal structures that are more integrated with the body itself, then have human/vehicle integration that grow together, etc.\n\nI'm just not sure if we as a civilization are ready for all that yet, with abuse and corruption at a peak these days. Maybe by the time the tech is here, we'll have outgrown some (hopefully all) of that? It's either that or total destruction, but that's a tangent I'll leave alone atm.",

Average viewership on one of his shows is about 9 million or more. Also the founder of zeronet would be a great guest on his show.(I Have Friends In High Places!).. I bet I can swing this one..\n\nI would like to see that. We really could use some big names around here. Infowars, PJW, etc. are on other sites like Gab and Minds so I'm sure they'd be really open to 0net.",
