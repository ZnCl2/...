				"body": "check out this paper from WACV 2016, \"Can we still avoid automatic face detection?\"\n\nit's a bit tricky, because the several parts of modern recognition models (detection, embedding, similarity metric; not to mention gallery enrollment/template storage) work independently and each have their own weaknesses.\n\nthis work shows how to avoid face *detection* to begin with. as a case study on Facebook, they try doing things like adding Gaussian noise to the image, blurring the face, adjusting brightness, etc. the thing that seemed most effective was covering the periocular (eye) region in white, because most face detectors look for shadows around the eyes.\n\nsee a short 5-minute talk by the author: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGs5jNcFH4M&t=35s\n\nread PDF on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04504",
