In that sense we (in most Western countries) are to a certain extent free. My blog Red Liberty is all about growing the tree of Liberty so I understand the limitations of the status quo. But to say there is no freedom, that there is no difference between the US and China or Stalin's Russia is madness.\n\nHey redliberal, just move to China, it should be \"Red\" enough for you!",
