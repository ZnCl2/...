Do you think it'll take that long before it gets into national law?\n\nAnyway, I'd say do what Aaron Swartz did, no, not kill yourself (though he could've been murdered), but download everything you consider to be important or prone to censorship.\n\nI'm mostly downloading books right now, Library Genesis provides torrents for all the books published by them (this is ~30 terabytes for all languages, and roughly half that for the English language only), and https://archive.org is an awesome resource as well and I don't think the Internet Archive will exist for very long.",
