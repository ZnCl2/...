We called it BBS avatar?It's like this.You go out of home and take a picture of the scenery in front of u and post it on the forum such as reddit or humoruniv.com . thousands of people read it and order u what next to do. In about a few minutes the votes chose one and u follow that order. Of course it's not serious game u can choose whatever u want to perform. Anyway u do the job and take another picture and some explanation what happened to u.Do this till u're sick of playing it. lol.A kind of real time real movie or first person viewpoint video game.PS. some people were brought to an uninhibited island at the end. lol\n\nwow haha",
