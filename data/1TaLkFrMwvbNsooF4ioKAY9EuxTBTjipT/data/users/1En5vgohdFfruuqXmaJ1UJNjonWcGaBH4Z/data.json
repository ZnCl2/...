That would be really helpful and it would bring a lot more people to it. Most are just sutck on using the deadnet(facebook, twitter etc.) because they are turned off by how raw the alternatives are. \n\nI guarantee the moment this becomes more user friendly and has more functions you'll see people coming in droves :D",
