The West brought the iPhone and if you dig in further you will see that not only has this device put the power back in the hands of the people in the West, it put power in all the people around the world that haven't had it before (at least for a long time). So what we are witnessing is the old school power structure doing two things;  1) Flood the internet with so much data that you can't distinguish what is true (even though if you pay attention it is obvious what is and isn't) and 2) an old school method, but moving at a higher momentum than the past, create narratives to divide and create camps/sides for people to fight with each other that isn't real (and unsolvable)—all the while we are distracted so they continue their power hungry and controlling moves (right under our noses).

However, I think this list still allows room for confirmation bias and manipulation by false sources of information.  But, there may be no better methods. [...]\n\n(about 5 min read)\n\nI agree getting at the truth seems impossible at times because it takes work to not just believe the click bate headlines or listen to something that is more than 4 mins long or read something that actually takes time to research.\n\nI always consider the source BEFORE getting entangled in the content that I am reading or listening to or what is being forced upon me.\n\nStart with identifying the author, then the company they work for, then who runs the company, then who owns the company, what other companies do they own, then who are they connected with—who is making donations or out right funding these people.\n\nI scan across the seven channels of cultural influence to find them to connect the dots:\n\nBusiness (e.g., corporations, technology, advertising, commerce)\nMedia (e.g., publishing, television, Internet)\nArts and Entertainment (e.g., film, music, sports, classical arts)\nSocial Sector (e.g., nonprofits and civic organizations, foundations)\nGovernment (e.g., judicial, executive, and legislative branches, military)\nEducation (e.g., schools, sciences, medicine, research)\nChurch (e.g., churches, para-church and religious organizations)\n\nand search up their speeches, listen to their podcast, or read their written declarations, to see where they stand on issues/topics. NOT commentary of other people's analysis of them but hearing directly from them WITHOUT commentary and MORE importantly paying attention to what they DO over what they SAY. Then to cross the finish line paying close attention to what the results/impact are because of what they are doing or did.\n\nThis approach has proven to me that I will find what is false, what is true, or what is a manufactured debate purposely intended to divide, distract, and disillusion people.\n\nWhen putting the source of the content, over the debate of the content first, whether it is regarding UFOs being real or UFOs are fake and is a Globalists' plan to take over the world or the anti-vaxx vs pro-vaxx— whatever pick your topic—considering the source is the key to determining the truth of what I am reading/listening to.\n\n\"WHO & WHY is making this argument and HOW did I get exposed to it?\" \n\nRather than just trusting google.com, bing.com, & yahoo.com to genuinely & authentically present me with trustworthy sources. They own it, they decide what their product displays. That is a variable also to finding the truth.\n\nHowever I tip my hat to them for brand recognition & consumer trust BUT that doesn't make them trustworthy. Google.com isn't a person but the person running google is and they have my attention more then what their product spits back out to me (even though I pay attention to that as well).\n\nYou are absolutely correct if someone with strongly-held beliefs is NOT open to asking questions that challenges their current views and beliefs then they are going to fall for whatever they are wanting to reinforce with their current beliefs.\n\nI wasn't suggesting, in my previous response, that list to be for that type of person. It can work for that person but they have to voluntarily \"unplug themselves from the Matrix.\" In America today you can still do that. In China their people can't (at least not on a mass scale).\n\nTo use one of your examples further:\n\nWhen I search duckduckgo.com with \"are UFOs real.\" The first 3 articles are written to prove they are. Now on the flip side when I search duckduckgo.com with \"are UFOs a Globalist' plan to take over the world,\" well you betcha, the top 3 articles are written to support that view.\n\nSo yes the way we are asking the question during our search matters. What our baseline or starting point on the topic matters.\n\nFor that list to be effective I must ALREADY be disconnected from the echo chambers of the propagandist no matter the side of the debate ANNND be open to the idea I might be WRONG and that there is more to the story or WHO is behind the story.\n\n*** Objectivity is key to finding the truth. ***\n\nOnce we allow our personal stories and emotions to influence our discernment then we are just seeking to hear whatever our itching ears want to hear but not actually be concerned with the truth.\n\nYou nailed it in your response between the two sides of the coin.\n\nI then point that fruit as a weaponization of psychographic and demographic marketing.\n\nPeople are now able to create specific content to be so custom tailored for us AND put it directly in our faces that are designed to be SO PERSONAL that it makes it harder to ignore.\n\nAgain, because it is so custom tailored for us it has a opportunity to reinforce our own biases—by design—this why Facebook sells so many ads and other companies alike. It's effective. Because it is so personal and targeted that is why so many people can't find up from down. Especially the ones not questioning the data or asking how it got in front of them.\n\nThe key is not giving up saying, \"I don't give a F'\" but instead find out what you do \"Give a F' about\" and only focus on those things. We are a generation that has so much data thrown at us and no one seems to be able to stick to a topic these days—so only do a deep dive on the topics that matter most to you and silence and ignore the others.\n\nHumans want certainty and predictability and we have lives we are living and most people don't have time or care to even stop to ask the question that you did more or less even take the time to talk about.\n\n-LD",

Freedom. ***\n\nA means of communicating that puts the power back in OUR hands.\n\nIf it is \"dead\" it's because WE are not using it correctly. Maybe I am wrong? Maybe I am not.\n\nThis would be a waste if WE allow it to die. ZeroNet is a gift.\n\nIf you think ZeroNet is dying that PROVES how much we are PLUGGED into the sensationalized media that FEEDS our attention.\n\nWHEN we stop using ZeroNet like twitter & facebook ANNND also stop bickering with one another and stop just using it like a \"normal blog\" like the mainstream media has made us to be with the internet—like monkey's throwing sht at one another—and we truly understand WE are the content creators and it's OUR communication and OUR voice that matters—beyond a fking snapchat or a filter—but its a MEANS of communicating like morse code—then it WON'T die.\n\n“He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”\n\n-LD",

Let's put our egos aside shall we and not be the \"next Zuckerberg\" but be the \"we the people\" and develop & market the way they taught us:\n\nhttps://clip.cafe/hackers-1995/snoop-on-them/\n\nHe who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n-LD",

When the sentiment is made, \"I hope \"they\" do something about it.\" Well WE are \"THEY!\" We may be in agreement of the cause but now we need to put in the work and stop being commentators.
