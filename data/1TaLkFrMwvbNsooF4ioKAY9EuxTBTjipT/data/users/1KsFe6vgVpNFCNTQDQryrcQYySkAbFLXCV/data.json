			"body": "\n\nWith decentralized open source technologies. Where webpages are stored on users' computers, making the page's source code transparent to everyone. The page is not stored on a manipulable central server. We should build a system where we would bring and vote for the laws, without for the hands of politicians. Maintaining the system would be inexpensive. Modify and vote laws. Identify people on the basis of their knowledge and ideas. All this is a handful  without this parasite elite!\n.\n.\n\n#Why would this be need?\n\n.\n.\n\nBecause we live in a illusion of democracy. The media is entirely controlled by an elite layer. The politicans and the media are entirely under their control! What they do is totally against the people and humanity. They decide who can people vote.After the parliamentary elections, the political elite will bring the laws to their liking. Those who would really like to do it for the community can't do it! This state is untenable, the technology is given and it is time to move as soon as possible.\n\n.\n.\n\n#What to do?\n\n.\n.\n\n#Spread the idea!\n\nCall a referendum on the subject. Technological developments in this direction by programmers. Broadly disseminating the idea on the Internet in Facebook, YouTube, and great social media! Until the idea goes to TV. Support the program from the state budget.",

It can speak http, dat and ipfs.\n\nThe problem loot of people are can not install and setup programs like ZeroNet.If browser developpers integrate the decentralisated protocols in the browser (and they can seed the sites).Projects what include the integration will be popular.If the Zites can find the google search egnie and open the browser it will be a big breakthrough.Another way was a proxy server like TOR doo it.But this way the clearnet users never seed the zites.And this make problems.The popular programs will win this race and another will gone.The solution is a unified platform.No one can use countless platforms.One of the biggest is the Firefox,the Tor browser was firefox based.And the biggest anonymous network was TOR.In the long term, a common protocol will be the solution.The ZeroNet developpers can integrate a plugin in browser too what start the program when ZeroNet Start.And can add the program the Firefox and Tor browser too.\n\nhttps://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3025478/firefox-59-will-support-decentralised-internet-protocols",

That means snoops can seize your data no matter where it is stored, and they don't need a warrant. Additionally, content publishers are held responsible for comments users make.

Just get off the grid already, it's the only way to be safe.\n\nI'm insaide many groups. Software developers, Amateur Pyrotechnicans, Pirates, Hackers. Who realy insaide this theme. Who pro users and not idiots producing conspiracy theories. And i'm the Chemistry & Pyrotechnics forum administrator here on 0Net. Who contact and use this services and groups and see how this works. Who realy follow the goverment! And who see how this working inside see it's not paranoia. Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Facebook they are all under full control. And the goverment have direct real time access this big social media platforms. Hosting services and internet providers all full control too. This Big Brother are multinational companies, politicans, goverment. And a lot of money and energy is devoted to mainly communication softwares, popular social media platforms hold in their hands. In social media platforms there built in own people and they are silenced people in this platforms who not say what they want.\n\nThe backdoors: They are all hidden so refined to say  them that a program bug, user error. I myself met people who published current bugs. They are constantly in the current programs. Not once was this communicated to the developers. Deliberately not repaired. It is silenced on forums who currently talk the finded issues. Popular social media platforms are under control. Companies, Goverment, are built in their own people to social media platforms (paid commenters).\n\nDocumented on a XAMPP test server with a IPS suite forum software what attacked the Hungarian secret service (not the big NSA or FBI, CIA). They knew too well what to look for in the forum software and XAMPP too. The test are finded lots of back doors what help a hacker work. What the software developers have clearly set up. Not just the server but the forum software developers too! This backdoors are included in every update. Years later too! And who attacked the service they knew them too well this backdoors. So the developers are know this and tell clearly them! And all the features which has no another use for a web developers and the users. It doesn't matter if something is open source.If it is a bigger scandal happen for it, they say security issue or user error.\n\nAnother colleague are administrator the Hungarian clearnet pyro community. He can really tell us about these back doors. And this moles in forums and another social media platforms. And what a violent discusting active refined background work behind them. And all this is paid with us! So it doesn't whaste they money.\n\nThe only \"free\" media is the internet, and those who are in power+money are doing everything that the poor working people who is the majority should not endanger their power.\n\n",
