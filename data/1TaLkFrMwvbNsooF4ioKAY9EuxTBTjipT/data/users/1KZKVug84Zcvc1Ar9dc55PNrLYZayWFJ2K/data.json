Also, I thought all of our content was hosted on our own computers and those sharing/and/or seeding our site?\n\nMore or less yes, but whoever holds the private key for a particular zite can push an update to people who have previously downloaded the zite which excludes any arbitrary content or data. This is what allows a zite creator to be able to make improvements to an existing zite without having to change its address or clone it.",
