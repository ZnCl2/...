			"body": "God was the first to suffer, the first to die. God was the very one whom no one could love. God was evil. \n\nBut this wasn't about being evil, it was about the fact that he was always, forever, in opposition to all else.\n\nThe image of a person would be an absolute. A person's character and life in this world would be an absolute in terms of being their image and nature. \n\n\"For me, my image as a person is very simple: I am Jesus Christ, I am not a person, and the reason why I refuse to be identified as such is because I am not a self-designating god who could be called anything to others.\"",
