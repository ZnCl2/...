A small number of users are divided into two ways, one is vpn (so users will be marked as other countries), and the other is to use nodes that are not blocked (easily subject to government review)\nAnd zeronet is just a small tool in China (possibly because the official website is blocked). Most people don't have much demand. We use ssr to connect to foreign internet.",
