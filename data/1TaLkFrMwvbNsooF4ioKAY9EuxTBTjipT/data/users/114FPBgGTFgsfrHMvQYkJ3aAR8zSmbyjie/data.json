I replaced my Raspi 2 with the Pi 3 to make it work.\n\nPerhaps, or not. It really depends on what you're trying to serve. If you want to also use it to serve pages on Clearnet, then yes, you may want more horsepower. For serving content on Zeronet, there is almost Zero backend processing. But what if a lot of people visit the site? Then the content is shared between those visitors, and the impact is minimal.\n\nSo whether you need something more powerful really depends on if you're serving Clearnet. For Zeronet alone, it needs almost no processing. You could tuck a Pi Zero into very tiny space, running 24/7, and practically forget about it existing.\n\nThough if you have the money and available space, then I would recommend a Rpi 4 (or an Orange board), because you can always use it for multiple other tasks at the same time. I have one running as my private personal file server using Syncthing (backs up all the photos from my phone). I also have torrents running on it 24/7. I also have a Youtube-dl script running on it, so it can download youtube videos as mp4 or mp3 and feed them directly to my phone (by dropping them in Syncthing)",

While small businesses die around you everyday, you increase your shopping with Mega Corps like Amazon. Small businesses have no public stock, but Amazon does, so the economy looks to be doing good. Yet the economy is becoming more corrupt. We are seeing a mass transfer of wealth from small businesses to Mega Corporations. (Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, etc.)\n\n@zerohope\nYou're absolutely correct, and VidarReturns has been creating content on how the Virus is blown out of proportion, and we are going the wrong way. Humans are DeEvolving. Vaccines are not a cure. They are a curse. A curse that we pass on generation to generation. Last generation 10 vaccines, this generation 100 vaccines, next generation 1000 vaccines...\n\nIf we want to survive more than the next few hundred years, then we must evolve as a species.

If it goes down, you're entire system is down. No failover. No backup.-> https://ubinodes.org/portfolio/review-end-to-end-encrypted-chat-server-using-matrix-and-riot/\n\nIt appears you are confusing \"Decentralized\" with P2P. Even in the link you posted, Matrix is listed as a decentralized network. Yes, Matrix is Federated. P2P and Federated are Both types of decentralized networks. I'm sorry to hear about your group server being attacked and taken offline. While your server was compromised, the rest of the Matrix network continued to function. Matrix uses Federated decentralization.",
