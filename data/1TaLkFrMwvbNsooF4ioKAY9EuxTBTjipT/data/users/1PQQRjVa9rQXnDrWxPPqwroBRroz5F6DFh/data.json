				"body": "Tor was not designed to run with bittorrent. By using bittorent over Tor, you are hurting the Tor network.\nWhile i2p is much better suited for p2p.\nTor provides one with better anonymous access to the open internet and I2P provides one with a more robust and reliable “network within the network,” a true darknet, if you will.\nSince there is a stigma of running Java for people there could be a implementation of one of the c++ versions. Either i2pd or Kovri. \nCould possibly have it setup similar to BiglyBT where people can choose to either go full i2p connections only or be a hybrid with clearnet, Tor, i2p. \n\nCan read more comparisons here: https://geti2p.net/en/comparison/tor",
