Lots of NSFW things with an edgy feel that gets pushed off of ISPs responding to obscenity complaints. Like a person having detailed, graphic sex with an animal and the person is a politician or a religious leader. Look what happened to the person on facebook that painted naked presidential pictures in oil and pastels. Banned without notice, broke customer contacts, lost in the take down of her area.",
