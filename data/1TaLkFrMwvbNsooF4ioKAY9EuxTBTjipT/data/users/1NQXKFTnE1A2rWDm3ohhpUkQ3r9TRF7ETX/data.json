In the torrent section, you will be able to add several torrent files or a magnet link, and the site will download for you. When downloads are completed, it will give a Uptobox link. \nBehind the scene, the website stores the files already downloaded. So, when you will insert a magnet or a torrent file to download, you may not have to wait, if the same content has been downloaded before ;)\nEnjoy ;)",
