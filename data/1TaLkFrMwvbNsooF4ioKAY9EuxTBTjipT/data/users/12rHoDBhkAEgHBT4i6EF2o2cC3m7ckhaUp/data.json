Downsize is slight increase of cpu and decrease on memory speed due compression and decompression. Still quite cool tech. More modern approach source-code for linux can be found here https://github.com/Nefelim4ag/systemd-swap .  \n\nThis benefits mostly machines whit limited ram(less than 3 gb) or some weird usage, I didn't find much difference on performance when using it.",
