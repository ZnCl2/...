This prevents people from accidentally clicking it twice, which will post the response twice.\n* Images that are uploaded will have the date uploaded appended to the filename. This ensures that there are no collisions with image names.\n* For images that are uploaded with non-ascii characters in the filename, the non-ascii characters are removed - this is to prevent a ZeroNet bug with non-latin characters. Spaces are also replaced by underscores and quotes (double and single) are removed.\n* The registration will not continue until you select a primary language and enter a username.\n* When posting edited story, if title is same as before, no need to add date to end of it\n* When interests is empty and you click to follow an interest, do not start the interests string with a comma ','.

			"title": "Moving from GitHub to GitCenter",
			"body": "With the recent Microsoft acquisition of GitHub, some people may be wanting to move their GitHub repos to Git Center. This will show as a guide (in addition to the guide within GitCenter) on how you can push your existing repos to Git Center. Any questions regarding the move and any problems during it can be asked here.\n\n**If you want to keep GitHub remote and add remote for GitCenter alongside**\n\n1.) Create a new GitCenter repo\n\n2.) `git remote add gitcenter [path to merger zite folder/name.git]` - Add GitCenter as a remote.\nYou can get the name and address of the folder by clicking the clone button on your repo page. This clone button should give something like:\n`git clone $path_to_data\\1BEPbMfV8QtaZCD2cPNbabfDKnmhTAZRPx/zeromedium.git`.\n\nThe part you need is `$path_to_data\\1BEPbMfV8QtaZCD2cPNbabfDKnmhTAZRPx/zeromedium.git`. You just need to replace `$path_to_data` with the path to the ZeroNet data folder (for people who use my ZeroNet installer, it should be something similar to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ZeroNet\\ZeroNet\\data`).\n\n3.) `git push gitcenter --force` - Force push to GitCenter repo. This will overwrite what's in the git center repo with your repo. This is needed if the two repos are different (which they are if you created new GitCenter repo and your pushing an existing repo to it). You'll only need to do this the first push. All subsequent pushes will work without `--force`.\n\n---\n**If you want to replace GitHub remote with GitCenter (just one additional step)**\n\n1.) Create a new GitCenter repo\n\n2.) `git remote remove origin` - Remove the GitHub origin remote\n\n3.) `git remote add origin [path to merger zite folder/name.git]` - Add GitCenter as the origin remote.\nYou can get the name and address of the folder by clicking the clone button on your repo page. This clone button should give something like:\n`git clone $path_to_data\\1BEPbMfV8QtaZCD2cPNbabfDKnmhTAZRPx/zeromedium.git`. \n\nThe part you need is `$path_to_data\\1BEPbMfV8QtaZCD2cPNbabfDKnmhTAZRPx/zeromedium.git`.

To go a step further, Mozilla promotes *Free Choice*, Open Source and Open Internet, Net Neutrality, and Decentralization (as in spreading the market out) - the first of which seems to conflict with your argument about Mozilla.\n\nYou are also presupposing that CTR and ADL are liars, slanderers, and communists. Obviously I don't know about the first two, however, I don't think that wanting to stop hate speech and terrorism are related to communism - I may be wrong.\n\nIf you are not going to argue using *facts* and *reputable **and direct** sources*, then I am going to be done with this argument.

[...]\n\nI just read the article you linked. I do agree that you shouldn't have to think about diversity, you should just have to think about who are good programmers, etc. If they end up being diverse, then so be it - but it isn't necessarily racists when there's a person of color or different sexual orientation that you didn't think did a good job with the code, etc. However, I'm not sure that there are or aren't biased people who hire certain people as programmers over others because of their biases. It'd be something that I'd have to research further.\n\nI've also never heard of anything like what was detailed in the article (with the github message about not accepting pull requests from people of color). I just can't believe that that has actually happened. It's sad that people just automatically jump to conclusions with no substantial proof, just imagining a pattern from something they observed. And the thing is, these patterns that people assume out of observations are often wrong - This is precisely why Scientists don't just look at patterns.

I just can't believe that that has actually happened. It's sad that people just automatically jump to conclusions with no substantial proof, just imagining a pattern from something they observed.\nHere, I was clearly (or at least I thought) talking about what was detailed in the article. The person who made the comment on github \"jump[ed] to conclusions with no substantial proof\". I wasn't talking about you (or the person who wrote the article)! And when I said `I just can't believe that that has actually happened.`, I wasn't being literal. `I just can't believe` is a figure of speech meaning I *was surprised* to hear that something like this happened. It's used all the time like this.\n\nNow, I realize in hindsight that it was a little ambiguous, but guess what? How about you ask what I meant instead of *jumping to the conclusion* that I was talking about you! \n\nAlso, you can be a little bit more polite considering not everyone is going to agree with you, and you have to deal with that. Opinions are what make people different, there isn't necessarily anything wrong with that. Notice how I was much more polite considering I didn't necessarily agree with some of your arguments, etc. Life is too short to be spewing hateful speech about or being rude to other people who may have very good reasons for their opinions.

Can you share a reference?  I'm particularly curious about things like: [...]\n\nAccording to the study described, Esperanto helps you learn many languages faster. Why, because you already learned one language: Esperanto. It is very well know that learning a third language is faster than learning the second because you have already learned a language before (the second). This, in fact, extends to many other things besides languages.\n\nNext, Esperanto borrows *many* words from European and slavic, languages as well as Greek and Latin, meaning words are very similar (libro in Esperanto is book, libro in Spanish is book). You can then more easily learn these words in Esperanto if the language in which the word was borrowed from is your native language, or a language you learned previously. These are called *cognates*. Esperanto has many with many other languages, including English (). Again, very well know as this exists in other languages, but I would say less so in languages that come from different language families (English as an exception because a lot of Latin came into English around the time of Middle English, and then again after that - I haven't read on this for a while, so I may be wrong about the *times* that latin came into English).\n\nEsperanto has a pretty consistent grammar. This means there are less exceptions, decreasing the time you must take to learn these exceptions, and the ease in which you can learn and remember the grammar of the language. Languages, including Esperanto, that have pretty consistens grammars take less time to learn and are generally (at least slightly) easier to learn because of less exceptions and \"weirdness\" within the language.\n\nWhat I was mainly saying was that the amount of speakers isn't a limiting factor because even the amount of Esperanto speakers is enough to be able to read a lot of material and speak to a lot of people. You aren't going to speak to more than 10 million people in your lifetime. Same goes to literature but less so, of course (also dependent on how much you read).\n\nLearning Esperanto is also useful for people who want to study constructed languages, their cultures, their people, beliefs. It's also might be useful for Linguists and conlangers (me being one myself).\n\nLanguages have many cognitive benefits, yes. Not necessarily with the vocab. They strengthen your brain. They allow you to more easily learn another language. They allow you to learn how to learn a language more effectively, which will improve how you learn your third language. They let you become more exposed to a more variety of cultures, ideas, etc. It improves memory, your native-language skills, etc. It makes you more aware about the specifics of languages (grammar - all languages more or less have very similar things within them, there's also different types of languages, for example inflectional, isolating - each having similar things when looking at morphology and syntax - you should look more into linguistics if you're interested in languages).\n\nBut also, there are different Semantics and Pragmatics in different langauges. Different languages categorize or differentiate between things differently. In English there is here, there, and afar - they distinguish between distance (here is closer than there). But in other languages, there may be more words with more differences in distances. Look into Semantics and Pragmatics if you want.\n\nFor the study, there were many studies done: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto#Third-language_acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto#Third-language_acquisition). I know that people don't trust Wikipedia, but it does give sources. Here's an exerpt:\n\n> Studies have been conducted in New Zealand,[75] United States,[76][77][78] Germany,[79] Italy[80] and Australia.[81] The results of these studies were favorable and demonstrated that studying Esperanto before another foreign language expedites the acquisition of the other, natural language. This appears to be because learning subsequent foreign languages is easier than learning one's first foreign language, whereas the use of a grammatically simple and culturally flexible auxiliary language like Esperanto lessens the first-language learning hurdle. In one study,[82] a group of European secondary school students studied Esperanto for one year, then French for three years, and ended up with a significantly better command of French than a control group, who studied French for all four years.\n\nThis also talks about the study I just mentioned to you in the previous post, here's the reference: \n> Williams, N.

The number of people that speak it (and for how long it's been spoken) are pretty directly related to these goals.  Esperanto is a bad bet on both counts.  If you know of any actual data on why people learn the foreign languages they do, I'd be interested to read it. [...]\n\nNow for what I like about Esperanto:\n* Very easy to learn\n* Learn more in a week than in 1 year of Spanish (based on experience, I took 3 years of Spanish in school, but only after a few weeks a learning Esperanto, I could speak more than in Spanish after 1 year)\n* Less exceptions to remember (especially compared to all those root-changing rules in Spanish, ex: o->ue; dormir -> duermo)\n* Constructed\n* Interesting way it handles grammar in a simplified way\n* Its correlatives system\n* Takes words from many languages\n* and more that I don't want to take the time to write out\n\n> [heyjude](#comment_7_1Ka5KfU2RbHEMTkHPPjAuiYCPbbxAtcoSn): I already learned english, my mother tongue is french. SO why would I want to learn esperanto? If it's to learn more languages, I'll learn Lojban, not esperanto. All you're doing is shill a shitty language hoping people will give a shit about it.\n\nNotice how I said languages like Esperanto, I would put lojban somewhat close to Esperanto, even though it's probably much harder since the grammar is very different from natural languages. But for its vocab, it is much better than Esperanto since I believe it takes words from more languages. Btw, I very much like lojban also.\n\nThe reason to learn Esperanto over Lojban - its probably easier because of the more naturalistic grammar.\nHowever, a reason to learn Esperanto over languages very similar to it (Ido, etc.), *none*.\n\nAlso remember, I didn't say before that you should learn Esperanto before natural languages, I was saying you should learn *Esperanto-like* languages first - **but only if your interested in it**.",

This also means you can explore the literature sooner since you would be knowing more sooner.\n\nI started learning Esperanto *before* Spanish. I could read and speak *way* more in Esperanto than in Spanish. In spanish, you don't even learn past verbs till 2nd year. Esperanto, you can learn them very quickly within a few weeks.\n\nYou don't think that a grammar that has consistent endings like what esperanto has (o for noun, a for adjective, etc.) is easier than trying to learn all the different conjugates of other languages, especially Spanish and Latin? Esperanto verbs don't conjugate based on person or number, but Spanish ones do, which means there are more endings for Spanish.

However, Microsoft has already started work on integrating them with their Windows Store, and firefox is also working on implementing them. The also are designed so the web app shows a screen as soon as possible, then download everything else when needed.\n\nHowever, Instant Apps are completely different. They are a refactoring of Android Apps into modules. Then, the minimum required modules to make the app work and as light as possible are downloaded quickly to make the app appear \"instantly\".

They also load progressively, meaning they show a screen instantly, then load things when needed rather than trying to load it all at startup/pageload.\n\nInstant Apps, like I said before, are Android Apps. This means they don't use web technologies, they use Java and the Android Development Kit, etc. They are also contained in APKs, just like normal Android apps. The difference between android apps and instant apps are that instant apps are android apps that have been refactored into modules. This allows google to download only the modules that are needed for the app to run in a *lightweight* mode before you need to install them. You then install them to get the full functionality.\n\nBiggest difference, PWAs use a browser and use web technologies and can be available for all platforms (Microsoft is working to get them into their store, Firefox is working on implementing them, I'm not sure what Apple is going to do with them), Instant Apps don't and are only for Android because they are Android Apps.",

Then, the only thing to solve is to have the id's increment, which can be done by storing the next_id in the json file and incrementing that whenever you add a new field to the json file.

The way it works is - users have the option to either view the proxy ad-free by donating a small amount of CPU resources for the purpose of mining Monero.. or they can disable the miner and instead enable the native ad-banners. Having a high-throttle (very low CPU usage) as well as a user consent notifications allows us to strike the right balance between monetization and quality of user experience. I'm actually gonna make a tutorial on this, so that anyone can do this with their own site. We need to make money, man.. enough with this starving artist bullshit. Stay tuned!\n\nI think I'll consider using bigcat.tk again. I just really don't like ads - they slow down machines, install malware, fake the user into clicking their ad because it looks like a download button, popup so I'm taken out of what I'm doing and have to click off the ad, and many ads don't let you close the window by doing alerts everytime you go to try to close it (thankfully browsers have fixed this by allowing you to prevent further alerts from a site).\n\nI think I will be fine with using my computer to mine, but you should be aware of computers that may have very low resources (I'm thinking like 5 year old computers, which I had to use a couple of months ago before I got a new computer with student loan money).\n\nAlso, you may want to check whether the user is using an ad blocker.",

ZeroMe asks for permission to read from ZeroMe hubs. KopyKate would also have to do this). As far as I know, I don't know if this is possible without merger zites.

I just surfed through internet  and  found  key word \"ZeroNet\" and decided to know more about it.  So I start my search from google and found that all articles finished at 2016 . Then I went  GitHub and also found that  almost all related  commits ended at 2016. So I decided to try go to inside ZerroNet and found more information here. Idea is good but from out of ZeroNet it's really looks like it is not developing any more. Also just want to notice that it is really hard to find some information inside it.So i really happy that it is not dead and it still developed.Free internet is a dream that could  become true again!\n\nNofish does commits all the time, actually. He just released a new revision today. What repo are you looking at?\nHere's the proper repo: [https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/commits/master](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/commits/master)\nAlso, make sure you're on the master branch, not \"testing\".",

Everyone learns grammar in school in the US and I'm pretty sure they do in Britain too.\n\n>  I've learnt some grammar most of the US people can't even reproduce.\n\nIf you're talking about English grammar, I seriously doubt that. The only thing that other speakers learn that people who speak English as first language don't are the technical words for certain grammatical constructs (perfect, imperfect, infinitive, etc.), however, they still learn some (subject, object, etc). But people who speak English who have learned another language do learn these words as long as they apply to the language they are learning. Btw, it's a requirement for many (I would say majority, but I'm not totally sure about that) colleges to take 2 years of a foreign language.\n\n\nFinally, it's very well known in Linguistics that speech evolves faster than writing. This is one of the main causes for why spelling doesn't evolve with changes in speech. Another reason is that when new words are brought into English, they are either not changed or barely changed. So, it isn't necessarily completely the fault of the English speakers for why the spelling is messed up. There was already one time where we tried to change the spelling for English to make it more consistent, it was somewhat successful (I believe one of the changes was using er instead of re?). I believe this was when English was standardized. What I'm mainly saying is that written language evolves slower than spoken language, and for this reason, there really isn't a way to completely get around the fact that spelling is going to either remain or become inconsistent with what is spoken. And trying to change it has it's own problems because not everyone will agree on the changes and a lot of people will forget them or just not obey them.\n\nAlso, something to note, the English spelling rules are more consistent than what people think.",

I also hope that you aren't talking about them not knowing the technical terms of these tenses.

Now I'm wondering what tense you are actually talking about.\n\nSorry if I don't believe you considering the main mistakes in your English have been how you construct verb phrases/tenses.\n\nWhat is really pissing me off is how you are looking down on native English speakers because, as you suppose, they don't learn grammar in schools. Obviously they have learned the grammar otherwise they would not know how to speak the language. It seems you are also making the assumption that learning grammar in schools is actually effective/useful. However, there have been research studies that say otherwise.\n\nAlso, I'm not completely sure if you know what grammar actually is. The grammar of a language encompasses the majority of the language, including its sounds (Phonology), word-structure/building (Morphology), word-order/sentence-structure (Syntax), word-meanings (Semantics), and everything else (Pragmatics).",

Here's a summary: People in the US and Britain are taught grammar and I don't believe what you say about you knowing a tense your acquaintance didn't know because your opinions stem from unreliable sources, and because you are clearly a racist that will say anything bad about the people you dislike, regardless of if it's actually logical. Everything that I have said has been simple and has been based on things you have said. I have not said you said anything that you didn't say, unlike you who has been constantly doing that along with making a ton of assumptions about me. I stick to the facts and to what I can see you said. You obviously don't.\n\n> But what's the point of this debate? You believe English is an easy to learn, logical, grammatically simple and \"grammatically\" (which is from phonology to syntax) logical and easy to follow for the learner, right? And you're debating the people who disagree? Then why don't you get back to that and stop bombarding me with your insane beliefs about the world you seem to know?\nmore assumptions, of course. I have never mentioned anything about how easy English is. I think you forgot what I was arguing, which was that English speakers do learn grammar. For your information, I think English is a very hard language to learn.\n\n> And as for US bashing: get the fuck outta here. If your people are stupid fucks then you are one, so debating from that position is really useless: obviously every stupid fuck will say they are not stupid fucks, and it's just propaganda from others (who you strongly believe are stupid fucks, unlike you). Your \"first-hand knowledge\" about your not-being-stupid-fuck is really meaningless outside stupidfuckland. But your opinion has been noted, thanks for sharing. You can go now.\nI don't recall saying where I'm from. Also, I didn't say anything about other people being stupid.\n\n...\n\nNo wonder why I don't believe you!",

There are all kind of things people say about other people all the time, including - but not limited to - official propaganda, subculture and specific group opinions of people and so on. You keep reiterating that there is propaganda in the world. I already told you that there is and it's not related to the topic.  [...]\n\nAre you fucking kidding me right now? Apparently you suck at reading because I have clearly never said *anything* about propaganda against the English language. Let's go over exactly everything that I have said that relates to the whole propaganda thing:\n> It's not totally unreasonable that I believe you to be a liar considering you are obviously so biased as to believe the propaganda and unprovable statements regarding the US\nThis is the *very first* time I mentioned propaganda. Did I say anything about the English language in this sentence? Obviously not.\n> I never said anything about propaganda against the education system. I'm saying propaganda against the US. You are literally saying I said stuff I didn't say. Next, this whole argument has been in reply to this:\nNext, you made up crap about me talking about the propaganda against the education system. Yet, as you can see, there was no mention about the education system or the English language in that sentence.\n> I never said anything about it being about superiority or stupidity. I was merely saying your statement was hard to believe because of the possibly unreliable sources you apparently got that information from. it's illogical to think that sources that stem from propaganda and lies are reliable - they are called lies and propaganda for a reason.\nYet again, you made up things about what I said.\n> I didn't say anything about where this propaganda comes from, especially not from \"evil people outside of the US\". I also didn't say the whole IQ thing was the propaganda that I was talking about. Also, I've never mentioned anything about conspiracy theories (it's not conspiration theories btw).\nAgain, more lies and assumptions coming from *you*.\n> I didn't say anything about the propaganda being from Evil people/countries. Propaganda can come from anywhere.\nYet again, more assumptions and lies from you.\n> You're naive if you believe there isn't propaganda against the major countries, including US, China, Russia, Britain, etc. There are always gonna be people telling lies about these countries and trying to convince other people of these lies, hence propaganda.\nNothing about propaganda against a language here!\n\nNow, in response to your `why should I care?` and `off topic` crap. Apparently you must have missed this:\n> It's not totally unreasonable that I believe you to be a liar considering you are obviously so biased as to believe the propaganda and unprovable statements regarding the US\nand this:\n>  I was merely saying your statement was hard to believe because of the possibly unreliable sources you apparently got that information from. it's illogical to think that sources that stem from propaganda and lies are reliable - they are called lies and propaganda for a reason.\nThese clearly explain how it relates to my argument.\n\nNext, you previously said:\n> No, I don't since I really don't give a flying fuck about what you believe.\nIf you didn't care, why did you respond to my, what you may call \"opinions\", in the first place?\n\nHere's the thing. You have been making crap up this whole time. You have made many false and illogical assumptions not just with your opinions, but with your \"arguments\" (if you can call them that - it's very clear they aren't very good). Yet you say I'm acting stupid. With every single argument that I've made against what you have said, I have given direct quotes from you and I have not misrepresented these quote, nor have I made assumptions about these that I did not explicitly say. You did quite the opposite. Yet you have the audacity to say I'm \"acting stupid\". Why, because I supported all of my statements with facts? Because I don't believe a person who so clearly lies and misrepresents people's arguments? You're the one looking stupid here, not me.",

The zite is a little outdated, but I think there weren't any breaking changes in newer versions released after the zite was last updated, so it still works with the latest version *I believe*.",

If you have a better one, by all means tell it instead of shooting down everything you see.

As long as the merger site has songs in it, clicking the plus downloads the site, then when you switch over to the songs or artists or albums tabs you will see the content.

It seems like being able to do that would require your own merger zite. The thing about that is people's profiles wouldn't show up instantly because you'd have to wait for their merger zite to download. Also, not completely sure how these merger zites would interact with circles exactly.\n\nHowever, without profiles owning their own merger zites, hiding comments would work because that'd be as easy as implementing something where you can add hidden comments to the database then when people look at your post, the comments listed in the database are hidden.

One of those peers decides to inject some malicious JS code into its directory which will upload each time another peer connects to that copy.  Is such an attack feasible? Is there anything in Zeronet designed to prevent this sort of attack?\n\nThe JS would have to run. I don't think any zite would knowingly run JS from one user on others' client (especially a JS file from a user's directory). Also, a user cannot modify anything about a zite except what is in their user directory.\n\nIt'd be a bit more feasible if either the attack was a file uploaded to a user directory that has a virus, or the zite owner has malicious code. For the first, that is dependent on the rules the zite owner created on which files are allowed in user directories. Any file types not listed/allowed are not transferred to other peers.",

All of the frontend stuff are created entirely by the zite's owner. This includes most of what a zite is, imo. The design of the website. Sorting, any features of that website. Even the database structure, how things are stored, etc.\n\nFor example: What I have written for ZeroMedium includes how the database is organized, functionality for adding a story, response, and upvote to the database, the searching mechanism (I had to write the SQL command for this), showing how many likes there are on a given story (again, SQL), the editor functionality (including markdown parsing), the design of the zite, etc.\n\n*ZeroMedium is 5,500 lines of my own code (**not including any libraries I've used**)*",

The client is just the program that handles how zites are shared/networked, the security of zites, etc. It then provides an API to these zites in the same way you have an API to regular websites that browsers provide. For example, there's javascript functions for opening sites in new window, for requesting information (via GET, POST, etc) from a server, etc. ZeroNet provides these same types of API procedures. \n\nAlso, ZeroNet handles all of the security of the zites. Each zite is sandboxed (which is why all zites load in an iframe), and zites can't look at other zites, etc. I don't know much about this aspect of ZeroNet.",

ZeroNet also has ways for programmers to determine how their databases should look and how data is stored and seeded, etc. JSON files are used, and each user has their own folder under the zite's folder structure where their data is stored in a data.json file. This is so these files can be seeded without conflicts. Then, the ZeroNet client aggregates this into a sqlite database that is *not* seeded. When zite's ask ZeroNet for data from the database by giving it an SQL query, the client passes the query on to sqlite and gives back the result.",

[...]\n\nYes (kinda depends. If it's a problem with just ZeroMedium, then yes) and Yes. Except for one 150 line file that provides access to the ZeroFrame API via JavaScript - written by Nofish And of course any libraries used by the zite that weren't written by the zite owner.\n\nHere's everything that the ZeroNet client handles:\n* Networking - the peer-to-peer stuff, the seeding of zite files, optional files\n* Security & Cryptography - permissions, sandboxing, merger zites and CORS (basically just allowing one zite to access the data of many other zites), addresses/keys, muting users\n* Database - goes a bit with networking and security because files need to be separated out per user to mitigate conflicts, etc.\n* News Feed - this is a special thing because it goes a bit beyond what the others do. This just allows zite's to put notification on the ZeroNet homepage/starting-page.\n* API - ways to allow zites to do things that may be insecure for them to do directly or that interact with the above ZeroNet functionalities, querying from the database, writing to files, signing and publishing zites, requesting permissions, accessing data from other zites\n  The api also provides access to procedures that are used to get around problems with the sandboxing (because of iframe problems). For example, opening a zite in a new tab, routing, etc.\n\nHere's a link to the ZeroFrame API reference: [/17Kom2G5qNDc6NaQwv445h1gFzxkY3ZtZe/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/](/17Kom2G5qNDc6NaQwv445h1gFzxkY3ZtZe/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/)",

There are plugins that you can make for ZeroNet that can provide more features built in to the client where zite's can then access them from the ZeroFrame API. In fact, the merger site feature (which allows zites to access information from other zites) and many other ZeroNet features are written as plugins.

There's a reason why they call people who can't feel emotion psychopaths. Emotion serves a purpose believe it or not.

They may have the integrity to stand up to people who are bullies - who make the internet not a good place. But it's also important that these people not judge a phrase (or long paragraph) until they've had enough information to determine exactly how something typed was meant - and even still, I personally believe it's better to give the benefit of the doubt. And by getting enough information, I mean at least having the respect to read what the other person said entirely - You can't expect to be in good wits if you don't have all the information. Of course there's always exceptions, so if that person happens to intentionally make statements that bother you, it might be better to leave them alone, but I think you better be careful on your judgement of them and be absolutely sure.\n\nPeople don't get mad at nothing. They get mad at their own interpretations of something. Which is why emotion isn't always the problem, it's the interpretation. This applies to politics as well - everyone should know about the techniques used to manipulate your emotions in propaganda.

Most brand new concepts are used to be adopted with its original pronunciation especially in tech field.\n\nSadly, korean won't work right now because ZeroNet doesn't seem to have an option for it on ZeroHello (the abbreviation is KO right?) and my zite goes off of what the client's language is.

I tried to translate it to something like Fusionable. I was wondering if it meant to be something like \"Mixed zites\". [...]\n\nWell, a merger zite in ZeroNet is a zite whose database is merged into another zite. For example, ZeroMe Hubs are merger zites. They are separate zites whose databases are merged together to form the ZeroMe database, which is the information ZeroMe shows when visiting it. By adding a hub merger zite, it get's merged in with the ZeroMe database and it's content is shown on ZeroMe. - I'm not sure how that would translate into other languages, but hopefully this helps.\n\n\"File Sharing\" would be a participle or *maybe* a verb - depending on how you look at it. In my initial view, I thought it more of a participle with how I'm using it. A participle is a verb used as an adjective, and in this case, the adjective is also a substantive (meaning the noun the adjective modifies is implied - \"File Sharing *Zites*\" - Zites is implied and not explicit - essentially, the adjective/participle is used kinda as a noun). However, I suppose it *could* maybe be a verb if the implied statement was \"[Zites that are] File Sharing\".",

However, what is going to get us that exposure? What will attract people? Will more original content? Will better usability and ease? Reducing misconceptions? or just getting the word out? From what I've read on clearnet sites about people talking about ZeroNet, people tend to make misconceptions or say that it doesn't have much on it and is evolving slowly - although, haven't read *that* much.\n\nI've also seen many people say how little activity there is on ZeroNet from within ZeroNet - typically on chat zites and ZeroMe.

It's just not automatic. You have to do it manually. And some zite owners allow the clone button, which you can find by clicking the 3 dots next to the zite name in ZeroHello. This will essentially create a new zite owned by you, with the same files as the zite you are cloning. If this button isn't allowed by the zite owner, then you can just copy the files of the zite. Almost every zite on here, that I know of, is Open Source and most likely in GitHub.\n\n> > thunder33345: tho maybe something about githistory, where peers will keep something like a gitlog of each changes, to prevent repeat saving unnecessary data, and easy reverts shall anything happen, but this relies on peers to be bothered to save the history\n> \n> I honestly thought that would happen automatically. People who just visit store up to the site storage limit, and people who mirror store the whole thing. I didn't think you can affect the mirrored copies.\n\nOptional files and the zite limit are different from git history, because there's no history for the actual files. In both these cases, you are just downloading some of the *files* rather than all of them, but the files you do download are going to *always be the latest version* because there is no patches or git history, etc.\n\nHowever, I do agree that either cloning/downloading of versions of zites should be easier (and perhaps optionally automatic) or there should be some type of dvcs history or patches. I will actually be making a tool to make it much easier to backup zites, that will be shipped with my new [ZeroNet Exe Installer](/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1526846299_12gAes6NzDS9E2q6Q1UXrpUdbPS6nvuBPu/ZeroNet+Exe+Installer+Beta+P2P+Message+Plugin+by+GitCenter).",

I said it allows you to clone/fork the zite in the sense of version control forking. Forking is *not* cloning everything including data, that'd be something else. Forking is taking the source code and using it on your own zite/server with your own data. Aside from that, it was previously suggested to copy the files / backup, so I didn't need to explain that part.\n\nI'm not sure what you are agreeing to about optional files, because I never said they were problematic. I said optional files cannot replace git history like the person I responded to said because you always get the latest version of the file, basically the file that the user has. There's no git history for any file, and optional files is in no way a replacement for some type of scm history system, that just doesn't make any sense.",

Changes to zites do not propogate to forks/clones of those zites unless the owner manually clicks \"update\" to update the *code* from the zite they cloned from.

This is what lets us grow and learn. Wishing you knew more doesn't mean that you don't already know a lot or enough.\n\nUnless you are talking about the medium-editor library I'm using. In that case, you'd be crazy to try to implement an editor like that from scratch within the time I wanted to release ZeroMedium, because the browser api's for contenteditable are terrible. The only libraries I'm using for ZeroMedium are either for visuals, moment.js for times (which pretty much every zite, even Nofish's, uses), and this medium-editor library.\n\nI have declined taking over KopyKate because if it uses coffeescript, I would not want to develop for it. I have to use a language I, firstly, know, and like at least a little bit. That is not the case for me with coffeescript.\n**However, I would accept taking it over if I can rewrite it from scratch, while of course still retaining the original name, logo, and intentions/goals of @quantumkitty.**",

Does he mean css frameworks? Vue templates/Components? libraries?\n\n1.) I use a CSS framework, because that is the quickest way to get a *very* good design that works on *all* devices without having to spend a ton of time. This is really more design than coding. I could implement my own CSS for interface stuff, I've done it before. It just takes quite a bit of time to make it work with all devices (although the newest CSS stuff helps with that).\n2.) I use Vue templates/Components, but *all* of those in ZeroMedium are templates I made. There is not one library used in ZeroMedium that creates Vue templates/Components to use.\n3.) I use only 5 libraries in ZeroMedium (a lot less than most web developers, btw). One for a css framework, one is Vue.JS (which is pretty much used for dynamically updating the page - Either way, almost all developers either use something like this or jQuery, so...). I use sanitize-html to make html safe. I use moment.js, which pretty much every single top zite on ZeroNet uses (including the official ones by @nofish). and I use medium-editor (which I have already talked about previously). The majority of these are for visuals.\n4.) I still implement everything else. I implemented the database. I implemented the search. I implemented the routing. I implemented updating/editing of the json files/database. I implemented the optional file and big file support. I even implemented making certain markdown constructs work with the medium-editor.\n5.) Everything I've implemented in ZeroMedium and all of my other zites are pretty much the only things needed to make a video sharing zite. It's really not that hard to do - it's mostly just big optional files and database storage stuff. Not to diminish what @quantumkitty has done, though. Because it certainly takes a lot of time to build this stuff.",

It is centralized because one zite has all of the links. The benefit this provides is that you only have to download one zite to explore all of the repositories. This could, however, be split up into multiple zites based on category (etc.), which would kind of reduce centralization, but not eliminate it.\n\nOf course, if there was a way to have zites where the owner can only modify the zite code, but not user files, then that would basically get rid of the need for merger zites for the case that we are talking about - because then everyone would own their own data, and that data wouldn't be able to be removed by the zite owner. This would also prevent having to find and download many merger zites just to see the data.

Although I'm using the @mentions here, how does everyone actually receive the notifications when mentioned? Thanks!\n\nA website needs to setup the NewsFeed plugin to work with their site by giving ZeroNet (or rather, the plugin) an sql query to match everything that should show up in the notifications. These notifications can technically be shown on any zite (as long as it has the admin permissions), but the main zite that everyone sees them on is the ZeroHello zite (because this acts like a homepage for ZeroNet). These sql queries are run against each corresponding zite's database every time you go to the ZeroHello page.\n\nSo, when you follow something on a zite, the zite gives an sql query to this NewsFeed plugin, which then stores it for use later on (for example, on ZeroHello). This sql query would get all of the related information for the thing you are following on the zite.\n\nI believe: When ZeroHello gets the notifications, it doesn't get every query and run it against each corresponding zite. Instead, it just runs a ZeroNet API function/command that does all of this behind the scenes and returns the list of notifications, to then be displayed by ZeroHello.\n\nThe order in which these notifications show up depends on the date value given in the sql query.",

Now, when I type math three items come up automatically. Pressing \"enter\" doesn't seem to do anything.\n\nThere are 3 types of \"Search Engines\" in ZeroNet:\n\n1. User-submitted Zites - Examples being 0list, ZeroSites, and [Important Zites](/1MiS3ud9JogSQpd1QVmM6ETHRmk5RgJn6E) (although, only Important Zites has a search function). Zite creators submit their zites to an index.\n2. Local Search Engine - Example includes Important Zites (which can search other zites that you have local to your computer) as well as [KxoNetwork](/1GTVetvjTEriCMzKzWSP9FahYoMPy6BG1P) and ZeroUp Search. These can search through zites *locally* (meaning zites you already have downloaded). These zites are able to achieve this using the ZeroNet CORS functionality - which means all of these will require you to accept the CORS permission for each zite it searches (or, in the case of Horizon and Kaffiene, enable and accept the zites you want to have locally searched).\n3. Centralized Search Engine - Examples include Horizon, Kaffiene, Zirch, EulerFinder, and other older ones. These have a backend client (usually ran by the zite owner) that run looking for links/zites in various ways from zites that it gathers. These various ways can include crawling everything visible on a page (for example using Selenium), or looking for links in user data files. Some of these, like Kaffie and Horizon, can also do Local Searching.",

Not sure how it works under the hood (perhaps the same CORS?..), but it's the most available search platform on 0net because it's a \"default\" site.\n\nZeroHello doesn't use CORS in the sense of the cors permissions. It uses two things. 1. It can search through anything that is in the News Feed 2. It can search using queries provided by the \"newsfeed\" entry in a zite's dbschema file. It can access both of these because it is an admin zite (it has the admin permission by default).\n\nAnyways, I didn't mention it because it's the most obvious, not many zites are supporting all data with it, and because I don't think it's that good. And I think promoting the defaults over everything else reduces the ability for new zites to become known and popular, especially since the \"default\" demo zites (ZeroTalk, ZeroHello, etc.) prefer the defaults over others (I don't see ZeroHello, on first run of ZeroNet, showing other zites besides these, even though some of them have become very popular and are even better than the defaults).",

They have a beta version of the plugin for Firefox that doesn't use a proxy, called [overbitenx](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/overbitenx/) (which has to communicate with another program you must install, called Onyx, which you can all find on the [github page](https://github.com/classilla/overbitenx)). For chrome, you have to deal with the proxy as I don't see a beta plugin like the firefox one.\n\n*But*, I have found that the [Lynx text-browser](https://lynx.invisible-island.net/) supports gopher natively. With Linux you'll be fine, but for Windows, you will have to use the [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) version because the other one (lynx Windows installers, etc.) doesn't come with https support, but the cygwin version does (btw, when I installed Cygwin, I had to manually check that I wanted lynx installed).\n\nI would use lynx because not only can you use it for gopher, but it's a full text web-browser (so you can use it for the web too) ... However, it doesn't have JS support. In which case, there are other text-based browsers with JavaScript support (e.g. elinks and maybe w3m?)",

Do I suddenly have all that bad content on my computer?\n\nYes. You download a zite when you visit it. You also seed the zite. **unless** the illegal content uses optional files, then you must manually \"seed\"/download that file (depending on how the zite implements it). For example: Videos on KopyKate Big are not automatically downloaded. You have to manually do it through the zite.\n\nThere are a few different ways to help with preventing you from visiting/downloading/seeding illegal content, some of them implemented some of them not.\n* Important Zites, Horizon, ZeroSites, and other indexes or search engines could have tags to tell you whether they have illegal content - this one isn't implemented very well, but Important Zites does at least notify of NSFW.\n* Blocklists - There are blocklist zites that a person can create (e.g. NopeList) which basically is a list managed by one person, and if you enable that blocklist, anything on the list will be blocked. I haven't quite used this feature and it was released when I was off ZeroNet at the time, so I don't know too much more about this.\n* You can block zites individually yourself rather than going through a blocklist.\n* You can also block users so that only a specific user's data will not be downloaded or seeded. These can also be provided by blocklists.\n* Some people who create zites will ban/remove illegal content from their zites.\n\nThere aren't very many options to help with this, as many of the things go completely against the structure of ZeroNet. You can't really not accidentally host illegal content at some point and have ZeroNet work p2p at the same time (unless you want to introduce some temporary storage system, but that makes no sense imo, and you'd still be downloading it temporarily - in this respect it's not much different from the clearnet).",

[...]\n\nTbh, I don't understand the concerns (regarding downloading illegal content) because when you visit illegal websites on the clearnet, those are also downloaded (just temporarily).\n\nAlso, optional files helps with the seeding part, but zite owners *do* have to make things optional. So, perhaps a way to make non-optional files optional per the user could be helpful. I don't know how that'd work unless you prompt the user before downloading the zite so they can select which to not be downloaded - but this'll get annoying really qucik, and doesn't work when having a zite downloaded when you \"grant+add\" the CORS or Merger permission.",

And non-cjdns clients cannot connect to cjdns ipv6 addresses.\n\nNext, cjdns ipv6 addresses *are routable on cjdns' protocol*. Cjdns uses current internet infrastructure until more people move over to mesh networks. It doesn't *need* to do this, it will work on mesh networks alone just fine.\n\nYou are playing with words. We can say that a tomato is a fruit because it has all the properties of a fruit - but people call it a vegetable. As far as I understand it, cjdns' ipv6 implements the ipv6 spec, so imo it can be considered ipv6 *regardless* of if it's routable on \"regular\" internet.\n\nThis PR works with regular IPv6 without cjdns. But it also (is supposed to) work with **cjdns** ipv6 addresses.\n\nSo, it seems the only one that looks to be **intentionally** misrepresenting is *you*.",

Then, if the user clicks \"yes\", ZeroNet will unzip the folder and place it into the plugins folder automatically.\n\nTHe only other thing that needs to be handled is restarting of zeronet, and perhaps some metadata with a signature to know where the plugin is coming from (e.g. who created it, etc.)\n\nAlso, ZeroNet is written in python, so we can have it work for all platforms, not just Linux.",

				"body": "It should be noted:\n1.) Optional/Big files are **not** counted in the normal limit. The normal limit usually only applies to your data.json file - which is where the video/file *information* (not the video/file itself) is stored (in the case of a video/files sharing zites) or comments, posts, etc. (in the case of social networking zites). I believe there may be another limiting setting zite owners can use specifically for optional/big files. But I don't think it's very needed as the optional files are never *automatically* downloaded (which is the main reason why the file size limit exists in the first place).\n\n2.) The file limit is there to make sure you don't upload a file or make your content so big as to harm other peers of the zite (by using up large amounts of space on their hard drive). And this is especially important when user updates are automatically propagated to peers. It also helps prevent spam by setting a limit to the amount of possible space (and therefore spam) allowed to be used - which then requires the admin/owner of the zite to manually increase the limit either for that user or for other users. Again, since optional files are not *automatically* downloaded by peers (they must instead manually download optional files) - it makes no sense that this normal file size limit be applied to big files.\n\n3.) The reason you get these two \"contradictory\" messages is because there's a difference between *uploading* to the zite and *signing and publishing* the zite. Zites are stored on your hard drive. You can easily \"upload\" files to a zite by just dragging and dropping files into the zite's folder. This is what the Upload feature of a zite does - it just copies the file you give it to your user's folder under the zite. **However,** while the zite will locally see/use this new information, you still have to **publish** your updates to other peers of this zite, so that they have the information also. *This* is where the file size limits come in. You can't sign and publish unless you are below the file size limit. This is to protect other peers, as stated before. So... you can upload successfully to the zite, but you cannot publish unless you are below the file size limit.\n\nOf course, it would be good that all of these zites would detect whether you are going to go over the limit *before* the upload so that we can say the upload fails and there's no contradictory message. This also happens to be the reason why we get these contradictory messages in the first place. These zites upload first, then sign and publish - where ZeroNet checks the filesize limit during publish. So we're checking filesize limit **after** you've already uploaded to the zite.",

So by \"Uploading\", all you are doing is allowing other peers to get the file from you. So, if there are no other peers, as long as you are online, then people can get it from you.

Btw, the resolution you choose is also essentially the quality of the video.
