			"title": "Store Zerosite like Freenet, with shared storage?",
			"body": "Is it possible to contribute to Zeronet with storage and bandwidth in the same fashion as Freenet, with a shared storage. As of now, unless I missed a feature, I have to  visit sites in order to become a seeder, so I have to manually visit as many sites as I can in order to help them launch/stay active. But with Freenet, I just give some storage space and then it will help the entire system stay alive. Same with blockchains, as soon as you become a node you contribute to the decentralization and resiliency. Any way to do something similar with Zeronet?",

I am assuming this is the Twister we're talking about: http://twister.net.co/ I did install it some time ago on my computer(s) but I wasn't sure the project was still alive so I was reluctant to switch to it as the main blogging platform. Is there any reason to keep using Twister instead of just using/developing a Zeronet equivalent?",
