Me muting someone else wouldn't affect anyone else's ability to see that member. Nobody gets censored, this just allows individuals to turn a deaf ear and is no different from select crowdmembers putting in headphones during a talk/seminar. The speaker is still talking, just certain people have chosen to tune them out in a way that doesn't affect others from listening.",
