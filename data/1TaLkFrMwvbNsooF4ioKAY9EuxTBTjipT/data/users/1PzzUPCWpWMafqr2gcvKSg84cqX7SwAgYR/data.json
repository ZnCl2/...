				"body": "Trackers are used to locate peers. You cannot download using the BitTorrent protocol without trackers. Trackers may be centralized (e.g. http://www.opentrackr.org/announce) or distributed (using the DHT protocol, in which case each peer is also a tracker).\nA .torrent file may contain a list of trackers, but it's optional. You can also modify the .torrent file to delete trackers or include new ones. A magnet URI (link) may also contain optional trackers - they are added to the URI as parameters using the \"&tr=\" prefix (\"&\" for appending a new parameter, and \"tr\" for specifying a tracker).\nWhile the .torrent file contains \"metadata\" (cryptographic hash data) for the actual \"content\" (files to be downloaded by the torrent client), the magnet URI for torrents specifies metadata for the .torrent file (the BitTorrent info hash).\nSo, you use the magnet URI to obtain sufficient torrent information which eventually gets you the content.\nYou need trackers to obtain the torrent from magnet and to obtain the content from the torrent (either static servers, or dynamic peers using DHT/PeX).\n\nUsing a VPN is like choosing a different ISP - what your ISP knew about your Internet activities, now your VPN knows, and besides this, your ISP also knows you're using this particular VPN, even though it does not know exactly what you're using it for, as the connection to the VPN is usually encrypted. Depending on how bad the legislation is on your part of the world in which your ISP resides, a VPN can be an improvement (especially if you can pay using a more anonymous method), not much different, or even worse (don't forget, the connection speed is the minimum between your IPS's and your VPN's and the lag is the sum of both).\n\nIf you're looking for a bit more privacy when using BitTorrent, there are a few things to mention:\n - use an up-to-date BitTorrent client (preferably an open source one).\n - use an anonymous proxy like Tor at least for everything but peer-to-peer connections (client updates, DNS resolution, static tracker connections, RSS, searches, etc.), and make sure the BitTorrent client is actually aware and working with the proxy so it doesn't accidentally leak your IP anyway.\n - enable (or even enforce) encryption in your client for the BitTorrent protocol (though your ISP may deduce you're using torrents even with encryption, it may help avoiding throttling).\n\nFor a more hands-on approach, see this:\nhttps://wiki.btguard.com/index.php/Tutorial:Proxy\nThey sell the proxy but you can replace it with your own. For example, if you already run ZeroNet over Tor, you already have a Socks5 proxy running on 127.0.0.1:49050 (to replace in the tutorial \"proxy.btguard.com\" with \"127.0.0.1\" and \"1025\" with \"49050\").\n\nIf you want to go all out, you can also proxy (like it's said in the tutorial) peer-to-peer connections, just know that it may slow the transfer to a crawl, especially if you're running over Tor. Also know that DHT and uTP work over UDP and won't be proxied, so you either disable them (along with UDP trackers) or use them directly outside the proxy.\nIn the end, don't forget that you never know who you're connecting to with BitTorrent and there have already been cases of entrapment with copyright holders seeding their own honey-potted content. You may try to mitigate this using block-lists (like iblocklist.com/lists) but it's not a foolproof solution.",

And if I were to be obligated to carry one, I would place a feature phone on the top of my list. I just didn't think it was appropriate to do it here due to the obvious lack in popularity.\n\nI wouldnâ€™t presume to actually tell anyone what is best for them, just show some options I consider interesting. It may be better than starting your search entirely from zero (no pun intended).\n\nAnd speaking of \"recommendations\", also know a bit about STDs, though never got the pleasure of having one myself (that I know of) and a bit about astronomy, though never been out there (yet).\n\nCome to think of it, most of my clients pay me to solve for them problems I've never had.",

				"body": "Some old ThinkPad laptops along with some Chromebooks and MackBooks are compatible with Libreboot. They're pretty old though, and while Libreboot may be faster and more secure than the default OEM BIOS, it comes with its own quirks because they are kept in the dark about some hardware implementation aspects.\nYou can find the supported hardware here:\nlibreboot.org/docs/hardware/\n\nThere's also Coreboot which although allows for binary blobs, it has a larger compatibility list.\ncoreboot.org/status/board-status.html\n\nSome offers from System76 and Purism may also be of interest to the privacy inclined user:\npuri.sm/learn/avoiding-intel-amt\nblog.system76.com/post/168050597573/system76-me-firmware-updates-plan\nThey apparently try to work around the issues with the Intel Management Engine.\n\nConsidering the overpricing of Intel processors and their speculative execution vulnerabilities it may be wiser to go AMD if you need a very modern system. AMD have their own Management Engine equivalent (the Platform Security Processor), but latest AGESA updates allow for (partially) disabling it (if you trust the wolf guarding the sheep). Intel doesn't even try to keep up appearances and you have to resort to undocumented procedures (like those used in unME11 or me_cleaner) that may result in bricking your hardware. AMD also suffers from Spectre vulnerabilities but not at the level of Meltdown of Intel processors and are cheaper at similar performance.\n\nAt least there are many more eyes doing static analysis nowadays (especially those with big budgets and a lot invested in \"cloud\" computing) looking for and reporting vulnerabilities that may make the manufacturers release updates for everybody, including laptop owners.\n\nIn the end, if I were to have to collaborate with my bio-weapon researcher buddies, and need the latest and greatest to run simulations, I'd air-gap a beefy modern system (maybe with the WiFi module entirely removed), saving the results on an optical disc before reading it on a secure (although older) laptop with Libreboot and a minimal Linux/BSD compiled from source and communicating the results.\n\nAnyway, if you think ME/PSP are bad now, wait to see them shine in the new generation of 5G enabled laptops.",
