It connects to a couple for you. There's a pane on the right that looks like a globe. You should see pubs appear and disappear on there without you having to do anything.\n\nManyverse is a pretty early app though. So if you can't get it to work maybe come back to it later or check out the other apps for desktop. The underlying protocol, secure scuttlebutt is pretty mature and it's been around for a couple of years now.",
