			"title": "Slave auctions were postponed if they fell on a Jewish holiday",
			"body": "The following passage is from Rabbi/Dr. Marc Lee\nRaphael’s book \"Jews and Judaism in the United States: A\nDocumentary History\" (New York: Behrman House, Inc.,\nPublished 1983), page 14:\n\n\"Jews took an active part in the Dutch colonial\nslave trade; indeed, the b ylaws of the Recife and\nMauricia congregations (1648) included an\nimposta (Jewish tax) of five soldos for each Negro\nslave a Brazilian Jew purchased from the West\nIndies Company. Slave auctions were postponed if\nthey fell on a Jewish holiday. In Curacao in the\nseventeenth century, as well as in the British\ncolonies of Barbados and Jamaica in the eighteenth\ncentury, Jewish merchants played a major role in\nthe slave trade. In fact in all of the American\ncolonies, whether French (Martinique), British, or\nDutch, Jewish merchants frequently dominated.\nThis was no less true on the North American\nmainland; where during the eighteenth century\nJews participated in the ‘triangular trade’ that\nbrought slaves from Africa to the West Indies and\nthere exchanged them for molasses, which in turn\nwas taken to New England and converted into rum\nfor sale in Africa. Isaac Da Costa of Charleston in\nthe 1750’s, David Franks of Philadelphia in the\n1760’s, and Aaron Lopez of Newport in the late\n1760’s and 1770’s dominated Jewish slave trading\non the American continent.\"\n\nProfessor Tony Martin - The Jewish Slave Trade of Africans\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bu36QjaHHM&feature=youtu.be",
