You can switch it off but it is enabled by default and the fact that it is enabled by default means that most users are keeping a copy of your IP address with other data stamps associated to it.",

But zeronet is not ready for such services, it won't handle page with millions of videos. Can you imagine downloading few terabytes of data to get all the way from first revision to current up to date revision of \"YouTube\"? That's how current zeronet works. If it's good for some geeks, not for everyday use as replacement for centralized net. [...]\n\nA decentralized service the size of Google, YouTube, Facebook, etc, would highly depend on the reliability of the people using or promoting such a service in the first place. Decentralization is only good for a couple of things.",

I guess my point is to disagree with the opinion that I heard expressed that just the fact that a piece of code is open source almost by definition means that it has been gone over with a fine-tooth comb by many knowledgeable people.   What I'm saying is that even when knowledgeable people are PAID to go over a piece of code, that doesn't mean that they do a good job.  So, I imagine that when people are not being paid they are even less interested in reviewing other peoples' code.\n\nThe motivation to look through code is either to learn something from it, improve it, or steal it and make it better. I would only make an open source tool if I knew that I could make it the best tool of its kind as someone would probably look over the source code, steal it, make it better, and then sell it. If you make something unbeatable you don't have to worry about someone stealing it.",

Forking and improving to make your own version doesn't mean shit if most people prefer keeping the original rather than switch to your improved version.\n\nNot really to what? Learn? Improve? Steal?",
