(You could add charge backs to the system, but not on the basic layer)\n\nWith how bad the current population is at digital security, this in practice results in lower security, because people use SMS as 2fa (which is a bad idea if there is profit to make from sim swapping you), store their private keys in insecure ways (largely due to lacking education), lose their private keys, and are generally not in the mindset of taking full responsibility.\n\nIn theory, the security is much higher, because if you create and store your private keys securely, you can guarantee that you, and only you have access to the bitcoin (the ability to spend the utxo), which is something very unique about bitcoin, and for me (and others) makes it a very important system for humanity as a whole.\n\nAdding to the part of losing an amount, if you make sure to not pay to the wrong address (which with a bit of knowledge is actually hard to do) you can not lose a transferred amount, rather the \"push\" may not go through (see orphaned blocks). \n\nWith lightning the system is a bit different and I could expand if you wanted to",

The video itself is (atleast in digital form) a string of bits, a pattern of current and not current. You could redefine these patterns, and make anything into a file that would require censoring (although you could then argue the encoding and decoding holds the file itself, but that is not quite right) therefore anything should be censored. And that is the problem in censoring this kind of data.\n\nI don't encourage the creation and distribution of these files, but that is what comes with free speech, and seeing Assange's case, I find the benefits of free speech outweigh these negatives far and wide.\n\nAlso you don't have to share files with people, if you don't like the files!\n\nEdit: Free Speech, but without the forms of speeches you don't like is not free speech\nEdit 2: The main thing with censoring is who decides what should and shouldn't be censored.\nEdit 3: \nFor me it's important that people have a choice. Giving the tools for whitelisting and blacklisting is good, so you can easily use and create custom filters (using RegEx and such), but forcing them not so good.\nAlso, if you don't associate and spend time with people that share these sorts of files, what's the big issue? somewhere somehow bad things will happen, if you can, help people to resolve issues, but simply censoring does not resolve them.",
