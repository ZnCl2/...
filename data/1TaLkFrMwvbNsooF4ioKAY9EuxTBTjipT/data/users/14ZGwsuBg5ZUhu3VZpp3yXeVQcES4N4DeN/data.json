When the zite become more popular, would it be no longer substable for each node (be desktop/laptop/mobile) to sync and store all the content?\n\nThe design of zerome seems more scalable, where ideally, each users can post to their own hubs, and their hub can be linked to some shared meta hub for content discovery.",
