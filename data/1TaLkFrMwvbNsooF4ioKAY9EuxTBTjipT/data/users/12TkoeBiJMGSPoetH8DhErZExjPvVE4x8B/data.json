But believing in nanodust and mind control? Are you for real? This tech doesn't exist yet and even if it did it sounds just crazy to be true. As believable as a Nazi moonbase or some other batshit crazy conspiracy theory.",

				"body": "I think I've seen ~2000 people seeding Millchan so it's far from being dead. Some games on Steam have 10 times less active players and are still not considered dead. Privacy is getting worse out there so the demand for such network will only rise. I found the UX of Zeronet way better than Tor's onion sites, primarily because said onions often go offline because the owner turned off their VPS or internet connection. Same could be said about I2P, they only provide anonymity but not resilience. Zeronet can guarantee both (if you use Tor only mode). Another good project is Freenet that also offers an encrypted storage of data chunks so you don't (and can't) know what exactly you store and distribute and those chunks aren't even complete files. However, it's way slower, has fewer apps and doesn't support any dynamic content.\n\nSo far Zeronet is the most feature rich solution out there. I hope it will get rewritten to Go/Rust/whatever fast language with true multithread support because currently it often loads one core at 100% for some reason (cryptography?) and freezes completely until it's done with whatever it's doing. Python is a really bad language for anything beside data science currently, and even that is mostly because of framework support and traditions. For networking and crypto Go/Rust is a much, much better choice, not only they're several magnitudes faster and can utilize all CPU cores with ease, they're also much safer (because of static typing), don't require a bloated runtime, consume much less RAM etc. I realize that rewriting such complex software isn't easy at all and Python was a good choice years ago but today times are different.",

I'd still suggest you to try playing at least the most praised new titles. Since they're highly rated you wouldn't be disappointed at least, and learning new things keeps your brain from aging too fast. Neuroplasticity and all that. Even if you're not that old it's better to never stop learning be it new games or practical skills.",
