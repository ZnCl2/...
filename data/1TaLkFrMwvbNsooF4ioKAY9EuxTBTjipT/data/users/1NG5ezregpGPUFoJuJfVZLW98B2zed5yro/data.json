The really annoying thing about all the conspiracy nonsense is that it typically overlaps with real problems, like corporate greed. Thankfully, there's a cure for conspiracy nuttery: formal education.\n\nOr maybe the opposite. Formal education in itself doesn't do very much and it would be true to say that formality of any kind IS a conspiracy, although not always a harmful one. The way to determine whether a conspiracy theory reflects reality or not is logic. \"If this is true, than that must also be true\" and \"If that is not true, than this must be true.\" Most of the theories I am familiar with contain some logically probable things mixed with the highly improbable, and they have to be sorted. Not that I expect everyone to do that because people believe or disbelieve based on their own ideas, and the same people who say there is no Deep State conspiracy will say that there is an oil company conspiracy, the celebrities and politicians aren't trafficking in children but the Catholic Church is,  Fox News is propaganda but CNN isn't, and so forth.",

I am sure that there are vaccines that are overused and insufficiently tested. Likewise that there are governments and people in our government  that would be OK with martial law and extermination, and I know that from history. Now only the worst crackpots are Holocaust deniers but when it was happening there were perfectly reasonable people who dismissed it as Soviet propaganda. Ten years ago Cosby, Spacey, Epstein and Weinstein were all considered fine upstanding citizens, despite that they had already done what we now know they did anyone who said so would be both dismissed as a conspiracy theorist and correct.

What even is \"Pizzagate?\" That there is a nationwide conspiracy of child molestation in pizzerias, or that there is someone who owns a pizzeria who molests children? The former is an extraordinary claim, the latter is no more extraordinary than one of a day care worker or youth sports coach molesting children. \n\nRegarding totalitarian governments, I don't need to know any more than the nature of governments, historical and present, to know that is it something we all have to be wary of. They crave power, rule by force, and those presently in charge do their best to keep it that way in every other case, and there is no reason to believe there is anything exceptional about my government and politicians. I don't need to know any more about cops to be concerned that during a traffic stop I may be beaten, shot, or have evidence planted on me, and that my neighbor walking his dog is less likely to do that to me. We have totalitarian and homicidal governments in the world now, and we like to think we could never become like them but we also know that everyone had thought that, until they were.  Germans had previously been tolerant and ethical people, until they weren't, and it didn't take a conspiracy theorist to realize what was going to happen to you after you got on the train, just someone who wasn't sure that \"The Germans are civilized, they would never do such a thing.\" \n\nAlso note that I am not coming to any conclusions. But I'm willing to let those who have make their case. The difference between Pizzagate/Qanon type theories and Trump-Russian theories is no more than the perceived authority of those making them, and I do not trust Anderson Cooper and Rachel Maddow or some gay actor on Twitter any more than I do an anon in an anon forum.

There's only one blocklist for porn in general and that's by SSD. None are for hate speech.\n\nWhy do you need to publish a list that blocks that, and why would you think it would be effective? Professional spammers generate hundreds of ID's per day. Actual practicing terrorists do not make their plans public, and the ones who are not practicing are just philosophers, no need to block them. I am sure the CP's have their own places here just like they have their own onions, I'm not going to go to them, and if someone wants to talk about pedophilia any place else I'm going to either ask him questions to satisfy my curiosity about why someone would want to do that, or just scroll on by like I do thousands of other things. None of this is necessary for users who exercise a little self-discipline.",

All socialists looking for control, they will do a lot better working together than against each other. \n\nAntifa will provoke and exploit blacks, but they don't take blacks into their inner circle because they know they have more loyalty to their race than any political cause. So if they're planning to do some bad shit involving black people and they have black members they won't accept that and they'll turn them in. Same for religious people, if you're not solid atheist they won't trust you for the same reason.\n\nTrump, Soros etc. are not directly involved. It's all about economics in the US and how these people make their money. During Obama a lot of tax dollars were transferred to non-profit organizations and the leaders are all people who work for them or something related to them making good money with bullshit degrees.  You have no idea how easy it is to make $150K-250K with a gender studies degree if you are in with the right people who can get a contract with a city. Trump has been shutting all that down financially, supporting factories and farmers instead and they are afraid of personal poverty.

People form tribes and cliques for protection/exploitation, and the leaders of those tribes (there always are, that's what primates do) start making demands of their members.\n4) They run out of money and weed. More weed is available locally, but the only thing they have to pay for it with is cunt, and only some of them have cunts. How would you like to be a girl there and some guy wants to pay for his weed with your cunt? There's rape, and the girls start to leave. They will try to prevent them from leaving. A lot of those guys are fags and males will get abused too.\n5) After a period of time you have only bitter-enders left and it takes on the character of the Jonestown cult. Lots of violence and destruction. Cops have had enough and they move in, standoff, hostage situation, people shot. The area is declared a disaster and it's declared all Trump's fault.\n6) Wait 20 years, forget the lesson, repeat.",
