It might be considered sound (though not necessarily true) that \"modeling your life or world views after\" \"certain person who died due to not wearing seatbelt\", but you also imply (without any sound proofs) that everybody who applies \"game theory to human interaction\" is following John Nash. While it may be vacuously true from historical point of view, it certainly isn't from the everyday logic (it may also be especially useless if someone would point to most likely existed person who did the similar (not necessarily called the same) thing before Nash). I'm pretty sure that most (but, in any case, at least some) people apply game theory to human interaction without any knowledge of who Nash is or what he thought and how his views developed. [...]\n\nObviously the primary reason you shouldn't be using Game Theory as a model for human behavior is that it's empirically been proven to be a terrible predictor of human behavior :P \n\nThat said, it's important to know where an idea came from in the first place, in evaluating an idea, especially for a layperson (I strongly doubt sylvaine has a math or sociology phd) who lacks most of the background information on a subject. The world is too complex and life is too short for one person to understand the totality in human knowledge, that's why experts exist.\n\nThat is why I think its relevant to someone discovering these ideas to know that they were first developed by a paranoid schizophrenic.\n\nIn a sense, anyone applying game theory to sociopolitical behavior is following John Nash, regardless of if they agree with his (since disavowed) ideas since he built the original foundation all the work that has followed is built off of or adapted from.",

And gaining that might be no simpler than generic idea criteria.\n\nDisagree. It's much simpler, though still complex, to evaluate experts in the context of the current academic context than it is to become an expert in multiple academic fields yourself, plus you still have too little time to listen to every single person who has an opinion on a particular subject.\n\n> Yeah, and in a sense anyone who draw pictures is following Hitler.

Pedophilia is still classified as a paraphilia (aberrant sexual interest). It was referred to as a sexual orientation in one paragraph due to a typo in an early version of the DSM-V but this an error and was corrected in subsequent updates to the manual. \n\nThe diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder includes having acted on pedophilic urges so any sick fuck buying and selling CP qualifies as both a pedophile AND having pedophilic disorder. Going by the DSM-V you can be a pedophile but not suffer from paraphilic or pedophilic disorders only if you are not emotionally distressed or socially impaired by your urges AND also do not have any significant risk of acting on them.\n\nAdditionally, the DSM-V's primary purpose is to assist psychiatric professionals in making diagnoses so the criteria have to be observable and quantifiable in a clinical setting.

It's all the stuff connected to it that's a slam dunk. The most damning to me (that hasn't been cleaned up by the elite yet) is the elpida pedo logo painted on their mural. Here's the pic on the official radcliffe foundation website. So some background details: the logo you see on the far left is a recognized symbol pedophiles use to communicate with one another. This has been recognized by the FBI and used to bust pedo circles. On the right of the image you can clearly see elpida's name, confirming this is indeed a mural for elpida. That pedo symbol was actually their logo, but now they changed it, killed their social media pages and websites, and removed all scraps from the internet. The radcliffe foundation site confirms this is indeed elpida's mural. [...]\n\noh my god this is so fucking stupid, listen to yourself. This is some Alex Jones shit.",

If it's been used by the FBI there should be lots of references to it on other sources. Not to mention the complete absurdity of a global, multitrillion dollar child porn ring communicating with what are essentially hobo glyphs.\n\n> Like the talks of $65,000 pizza\n\nA couple of random stratfor employees speculating about how much the whitehouse spends on food is not evidence of anything. Someone at my job made a joke about the boss spending \"like a million dollars\" on the huge overabundance of catering at the office christmas party last year. I guess we're also a secret pedophile ring according to you?\n\n> pornographic images posted by Comet Pizza\n\nCitation needed. What are these images, how are the pornographic?

Is anyone who posts pictures involving adult nudity a pedophile?\n\n> Or the literal pedophilic comments made towards children on their social media.\n\nCitation needed.
