			"body": "If two people live in Isolation and they never communicate with each other.\nIs here only two rights? The self right of the two people?\n\nAnd if they communicate and make a peace agreement, is that a creation of right between two People?\n\nAnd if so. Is the self right more worth than the right between one guy and a other.\n\nFor example: If the two guys agree on peace, but its against a agreement that you made with your self in the past, is it than it right to break the agreement with the other guy?",

You speak to yourself. \nWhy we should't call that that a agreement.\nThe reason why we define thinks is the use it of it we take.\n\nA Human is not rational.\nHumans have Instincts to.\nPlaton scripted it as Eros and Thumos.\nEros the sexual and the substantive need.\nThumos the need for pride and recognition.\nLogos is the mind.\nEvery 3 of them have here own needs.\nIf you think with the Logos you are the Logos.\nBut if the Eros or Thumos is to strong you can do things that you not want to do.\n\nIn such cases I find it useful to make agreements with oneself so that self-warning is strengthened.",
