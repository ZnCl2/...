			"body": "Hello! I am new here so I guess I should say hi! My name is Joanna and I am digital ecologist. I am education people, on how they can make their online habits, products and services environment friendly! \n\nI am here as I am looking for alternatives way to promote my latest research project I am trying to fund on Kickstarter. Aim of this publication is to to discuss in detail the physical infrastructure of Web 2.0, summarize the mistakes we made in the process of creating it and draw conclusions from them.\n\nI want to inspire people and show them how together we can work towards making Network 3.0 a space filled with empathy and diversity, with a physical dimension that respects natural resources. \n\nSo far it's going terribly hard. Any suggestion where/how I can pump it up?\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/radicalzz/the-internet-has-failed-to-liberate-us",
