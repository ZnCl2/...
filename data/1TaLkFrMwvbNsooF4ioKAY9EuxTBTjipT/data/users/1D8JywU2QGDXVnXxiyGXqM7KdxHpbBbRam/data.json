To check your mail you read from the sender's folder, and decrypt messages that are directed towards you. To send a  response, you do the same thing. [...]\n\nbut i guess that is exactly what op asked for. An independent mail hub without connection to the main zeromail hub. It makes sense to have a central hub (zeromail) for the whole community, but it makes sense to have some small private hubs for some friends. Esp. considering the fact that all mailboxes are undisclosed in the mailzero page (decentralization :D )",
