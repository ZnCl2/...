These are just bunch of lies propagated by Nikita Khrushchev in his secret speech, none of which stand  the scrutiny. Even Stalin's daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva states in her book \"Twenty Letters To A Friend.\" that her father Joseph V. Dzhugashvili thought that the doctors involved in the \"Doctor' Plot\" were innocent and were being framed. It must be remembered that Stalin was the first leader of the world who proposed the idea of a separate homeland or autnomous region for Jewish people.\"\nSource:https://www.quora.com/Was-Stalin-antisemitic",
