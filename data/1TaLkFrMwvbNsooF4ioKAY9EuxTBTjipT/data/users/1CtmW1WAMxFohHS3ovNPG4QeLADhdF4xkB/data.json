				"body": "@gitcenter what is PeerMessage & Name.YO? I searched but didn't see them on zoogle.\n\nIt seems like what we really need is an App Store (or rather an auto-updating Zite Showcase) so that good zites get more coverage/publicity. And It's seems that showcase should be the homepage (what I believe is ZeroHello). Which might require a fork of ZeroNet. And if you make a fork, I'll happily switch. I really wish I could keep the look of the original landing page, but use it as an app (zite) launcher.\n\nThe essential parts of a fork I think, would be the ability to choose your homepage (your \"App Launcher + App Store\",  encase someone makes an alternative/upgraded \"App store\") and then also the ability to add sources for zite-address resolution. \n\nAfter that though, I think it will be a matter of people building good zites.",

				"body": "> [gitcenter](#comment_1415_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di): I think there was something at https://github.com/ZeroNetPlus/ZeroNet and https://github.com/zeronet-enhanced/ZeroNet, run by daniell and geekless respectively. But I think sharing them is not worth effort, it's a chicken-and-egg problem: developers don't add incompatible features to their forks because no sites will be able to use them, and people don't use the forks because of the same reason. Updating the main repository instead is drastically different.\n\nBoth of those sites don't brand themself as something different. Despite their URL name, they just seem like forks make for PR's",

				"body": "I got back onto ZeroNet after a long hiatus because of the youtube-dl issue. I was glad to see others had already uploaded it. Don't think ZeroNet is going to explode in popularity even if all existing internet sites were copied over directly. But I do think it can carve out new killer apps, and if people only publish those new killer apps on ZeroNet, then others will join inorder to use those apps. The large mass of people are not going to join to use a knock-off YouTube and knock-off Google. They wouldn't even join to use the real Google, or something slightly better than Google.",

Also please make it an org instead of a repo. There's going to be more than one repo (android app, desktop, homepage, etc) \n\nI think you already know those things though, I'm just confirming/supporting",

Seriously, it's fine to ask people for help, including HR at your job, your doc. or advisors. Don't wait or blow it off. If you're a student in your 20-30's you absolutely should not be in doomsday mode. Even if people don't adopt your code, they serve as a reference and inspiration.\n\nThe best handoffs I've seen are sometimes one repo pointing to another \"this repo is deprecated, go see ___\" If we made a community voting system for \"successor\" repos that would be useful even outside of ZeroNet. ZeroNet could have a \"recommended successor\" system but for websites instead of repos.",
