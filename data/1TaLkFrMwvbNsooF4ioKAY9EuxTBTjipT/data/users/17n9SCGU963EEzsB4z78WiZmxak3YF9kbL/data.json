That sounds like a horrible advice...\n\nActually not at all : what's been advised here is _only_ to turn it off for 127.0.0.1. Which means it'll only stop using (or, better, attempting to use) TOR for ... your own computer.\n\nBUT if a (rogue) zite tries to redirect you to clearnet, at least you'll be reaching clearnet through TOR.",
