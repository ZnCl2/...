Not long ago they began to block Zeronet's default port (I think its 15441), and even earlier they blocked the zeronet.io website. IPFS got a similar treatment, and I believe that its restrictions on zeronet is more of a preventive procedure than an act out of fear. Zeronet never had a big impact in China.  Those who still use it and regularly visit the Chinese forum are mostly spammers, conspiracy believers, and followers of the Fa Lun Gong cult.\n\nCan't they use Tor? Doesn't it circumvent gov. censorship?Â¿",
