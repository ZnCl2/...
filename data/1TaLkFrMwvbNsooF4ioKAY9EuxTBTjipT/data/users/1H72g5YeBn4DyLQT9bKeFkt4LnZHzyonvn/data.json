It really comes down to ZeroNet not applying permissive Access Control headers for font/css files when there's a mismatch between the HTTP referrer and the content you're trying to access.\n\nThe code is [here](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/blob/7bff5f562c42a4a5f73e104c0f767c1413064aa6/src/Ui/UiRequest.py#L431-L436) and basically in some cases that regex isn't doing what we want it to.\n\nI'll send a PR later today to fix it, but with the current untested fix I'm able to get icons working on default Tor browser config.\n\nTo achieve the same result, add the following lines to `src/Ui/UiRequest.py` at line 515:\n\n```\n        if url_a.startswith(url_b) or url_b.startswith(url_a):\n            return True\n```\n\njust after `return False`. Restart ZeroNet and see if things work after that.",
