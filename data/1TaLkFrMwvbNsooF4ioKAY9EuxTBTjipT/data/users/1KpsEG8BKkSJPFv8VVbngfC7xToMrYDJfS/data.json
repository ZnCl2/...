The 2 usernames used in the sign up process are consistent, but the web accounts the person is signing me up for include:\n-Hockey\n-Birdwatching\n-Travel Agencies\n-Video Production Companies\n-Graphic Art Companies\n-Lord of the Rings Trading Cards\n-Hotel Companies\n-Restaurants in Central America\n\nNone of which I have signed up for.\n\nHave I become the victim of a strange trolling campaign?  Why would someone be using my email to sign up for accounts all day that they can't activate?\n\nAny insight is appreciated.",

			"body": "There have been an influx of shills, trolls, disinfo agents on ZeroNet. \n\nClearly this technology is a threat to anyone trying to hide a secret, to anyone that doesn't want to be exposed. There are staffing agencies all over that specialize in hiring shills for any platform you desire.\n\nI see a lot of users who don't contribute anything to ZeroNet except trying to dissuade people from gathering information or educating themselves on items that they don't want people to know about. They spread FUD and specialize in de-cohesion of communities. They utilize ad hominem in order to demotivate users.\n\n>Are you schizophrenic\n>Do you need to see a psychiatrist\nDerailing threads or linking to unrelated threads\n\nThese are the mark of the beast. List here any and all users that are shills, trolls, or disinfo agents so that we may collectively mute them. \n\nDo your part and when you spot a shill, troll, disinfo agent, put their name here so we can mute them.\n\nPlease provide fact-based evidence for why this person should be muted.",

			"title": "Policing Reform in the United States- What is your Answer?",
			"body": "My answer to this problem?\n\nIt's all about the current system's invisible hand that encourages abuse and coverups. Also, being people, there will be some good some bad. It seems, though, to be an industry that attracts knuckleheads. During the intelligence battery test for police, it is very easy to score too high and not be eligible for policework. They want grunts that are incapable of thinking for themselves.\n\nPolice are necessary, but given my life experiences, I say fuck 'em all to hell. I honestly think people could do a decent job policing themselves in certain regions. In big cities, however it would be absolute chaos.\n\nInstead of our current, deleterious to health system, create a rating-based system where if your rating drops below a certain threshold, you are barred from working and do not get your $25,000 policeman's deposit back. Every interaction gets rated.\n\nPhysical abuse/murder after swearing an oath to protect and serve should result in immediate life detainment in maximum security prison. This can bypass due process with a document that must be signed by newly hired officers.\n\nProven wrongful incarceration should result in 25 years prison time served by the presiding district attorney, with all assets gained from employment stripped and distributed to the wrongfully accused.",

I still support Freenet by having a huge datastore and having it sharing all the time. I think it is worthy of knowing about and exploring from a historical and technical standpoint. I will always love Freenet and it's use of plugins like Sone, Frost, MuWire, FMS.\n\nI2p is my favorite 'othernet', though they all have different use cases, benefits, operational models, etc.\nI2p, Tor, Freenet, Zeronet, Retroshare, OpenBazaar, DAT, IPFS, are all worthy of using and supporting, though not all for the same purposes.",

Infact, I think it leads to more balanced discussion to have opposing viewpoints.\nThe users that this thread is made for tracking are from the former group, and not the latter.\nIt is very important to make that distinction.\n\nPersons who are philosophers have no need to argue, they can respect different perspectives. It's when you can't discuss philosophy because there's so much shitposting and FUDposting that is the problem. It isn't completely rampant but I see it in every thread with even a hint of controversial topics. Personally, it turns me off from the platform and I thought that this would be a good way of helping this community that I care about and I help to seed constantly.",

And dont forget he was trying to use counterfeit money.   what the cops did wasnt right but it doesnt deserve the response its getting.\n\nYou may not be from the states, but there is such a thing as \"due process\" here, where you are entitled to a speedy trial and presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nIf you ever had a cash job, there is a good chance you took and spent fake money without knowing. It's pretty common in seedy areas.\n\nAs a police officer in the USA, you cannot just kill people for a presumed crime, which is what happened here. Preexisting medical conditions have nothing to do with murdering someone. If you have cancer and I murder you, that is still murder.\n\nYou yourself may have never had a bad experience with police, but most Americans have- many traumatic experiences.",
