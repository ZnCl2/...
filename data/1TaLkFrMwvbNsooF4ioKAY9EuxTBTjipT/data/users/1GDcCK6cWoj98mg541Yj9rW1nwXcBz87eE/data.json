			"body": "Zite at: http://127.0.0.1:43110/1PGaLLNiadMzrmw6MMMnpZnskwFcdgZoS4/\nGit Center: http://127.0.0.1:43110/191JBSmjUStVdF6zxqujN2MZUk1KaphEPe\n\nYou will need to add some ZeroGallery Hubs for any content to show up in the gallery.\n\nI will be posting the source code on Git Center soon. Would love to offer my improvements to Sorasumi Sayo, but I haven't seen any recent activity on any of his projects.\n\nIs there a feature you'd like to see in the next version of 1+Gallery? Be sure to let me know!\nIf you want to contribute but don't know how, you could start a new hub with your favorite manga, comics, paintings, photos, etc.\n\n# Known Problems\n* No Chinese translation for new strings\n* Browser back button does not work as it's supposed to (original 0-gallery had this problem as well)\n* Fullscreen focus doesn't work on all browsers\n* UI may not work on small screens\n\n# Roadmap\n* Fix known problems (duh!), ~~the List Limit should be fixed tomorrow-ish~~. As for the others, I have no idea.\n* Gallery size in GalleryList mode (easy, but hard to do efficiently)\n* Beautify tags by moving often occuring namespaces such as author, artist, photographer, etc. from tags to the metadata listing for a clearer overview\n* Gallery editing (this is a rather big one, but this should be added to the hubs, not the merger)\n* Tag proposal by viewers which hub owner can then approve or block\n* Show pinned status in GalleryList mode (easy)\n* Slideshow mode with custom timer\n* Visual feedback on preload gallery button\n* Press space to go to next page\n\n# Changelogs\n\n## Update 1+.0.4\n* Added button to settings to show new R-18 content in feed\n* Support excluding tags in search query (eg. `!:tentacles`)\n* Add Chapter support, won't do much until new hub code is developed\n* Colored query examples on filter tab for clarity\n* Made \"Back to Title\" and \"Enter Fullscreen Mode\" use the general button style\n* Lowered min-width of the zite and changed some css so that it scales to smaller screens\n* Listview will now switch to 1 column on small sizes\n\n## Update 1+.0.3\n* \"Preload All\" button know has visual feedback\n* Image view is more compact (Back to tile, nav and fullscreen are on a single line)\n* Hub tab added with a list for ~SFW hubs, **send me your hub link if you want it added!**\n* Some tags now appear in the metadata list as well as in the tag list, the metadata also has two columns now to keep things compact.\n\n## Update 1+.0.2\n* \"Preload All\" button, as requested by Thunder\n* Added some spacing in various places to make the screen look less cluttered\n* Theme consistency for interactibles\n* Made the tabs look like tabs, rather than disjointed buttons\n* Some behind-the-screens work on making the site easy to customize (CSS variables for colors), which will allow for day/night theme (why anyone would use day is a mystery to me) and other such nonsense.\n* Fixed an error where hyperlinks would return 404\n* Fixed an error where the last page would not be preloaded\n\n## Update 1+.0.1\n* Images now scale up to fill screen (keeping ratio)\n* fixed some english text\n* tags for crawlers\n* R-18 listing now works as it should (more or less) reload page after changing this setting\n* some graphical design changes to make the zite more in line with its zeronet neighbors\n\n## Initial release: 1+.0\n\n### Added QoL Improvements\n* Fullscreen view-mode\n * Click right half of page for next\n * Click left half of page for back\n * Click outside or on text to exit\n* Preloading the next page (only forwards)\n* Indicator for preload status (hides when not hovered)\n* GalleryList limit setting (default 100)\n* GalleryDetail picture status indicator and have/total metadata\n* Tags are now sorted by namespace -> name\n\n### UI Improvements\n* Tag listing looks better now\n* Removed top margin on page",

			"body": "Visit: http://127.0.0.1:43110/14NFfVBBAFbNdqX4nyGjyBF1BRSz7jn2QP/\nGit Center: http://127.0.0.1:43110/114AZoCSLsZu6Ktfnfu64Uoh8pcdVYFhSX\n\n# Upgrading to the Christmas '18 Edition\nWith the new fragmented content.json layout I'm not entirely certain what the best way to upgrade is. It might be best to manually transition your main `/content.json` to include `/galleries/content.json` (but don't forget to set `\"includes_allowed\": true`) and only clean the files+optional lists and adjust the `ignore` after that. Basically unless you know what you're doing, I recommend cloning a new gallery. The UI isn't as fancy as it should be and some hub owner documentation will be added soon to help newbs out.\n\n## Short introduction to using the new system\nThere's three types of signing:\n* Sign & Publish the site (the main `/content.json`)\n* Sign & Publish the gallerylist (`/galleries/content.json`)\n* Sign & Publish a gallery (`/galleries/path-to-gallery/content.json`)\n\nA gallery should be signed to publish any changes to it, whether those are metadata changes, chapter or image/thumbnail changes. There is a useful button to sign all galleries marked as unsigned. If you manually changed the json, or for any other reason which to sign, just click the \"Save\" button, this will mark the gallery for signing.\n\nThe list should be signed and published whenever a new gallery is added. There's currently no way to remove or move galleries from the UI, but once this is added these actions would also require signing the list.\n\nThe site itself should be signed and published only after upgrading the code, or changes to the css, etc. You should probably know whether you need to do this if you need to do this. And if you don't know whether you need to do this, you probably don't need to.\n\n# Updates\n* Content now split into smaller files per gallery\n* Can now add chapters\n* Can now create new galleries\n* Can now add images to existing galleries (only at the back, prepend doesn't work yet!)\n\n# Features\n* Refer visitors to 1+Gallery on the front page\n* Show a list of the galleries\n* A gallery editor where you can edit the title, description, type, language and tags (need to be owner, otherwise refers you to appropriate 1+Gallery page)\n* Cloneable already if you want to try it out!\n\n# Roadmap\n* ~~Add an upload wizard. I recommend using a script instead because it will be faster and less likely to fail, but no hub would be complete without the option of uploading straight from the zite.~~\n* Setting default language, type, rating\n* ~~Adding images.~~ Need to add a cover to the front? ~~Or a new chapter to the back?~~\n* ~~Define chapters in a multi-chapter gallery. Select an image and fill in the title.~~\n* Computer-suggested tags. Let the computer guess what tags you may want to add.\n* User-suggested tags. People can leave tag suggestions on galleries, the owner just has to click accept or reject.\n\n# How to use on an existing gallery\n1. Back up. No guarantees this won't mess up your manifest.json's\n2. Clone GalleryHub+\n3. Move/delete your hubs content.json, index.html, lanczos_worker.min.js, main.css, main.js and the css folder.\n4. Copy/move your new clone's content (except for galleries) to your old hub.\n5. Cross your fingers this doesn't mess up.",

This does introduce a drawback, clicking outside of the image above or below will no longer exit. I could write a fix in js, don't think css can solve this, but I'm tired and it seems a lot of work. I'll probably just rewrite the help text to reflect this. Clicking the text to exit still works as it should, so there's no risk of getting stuck in fullscreen.",

The easiest solution would be to fade the button after it has been clicked. If the user reloads the page the button would be normal again if not every image has been downloaded yet, but I don't really think there's a way to track progress across reloads.

I tried steemit, but it sucks balls.\n\nTo attract more users we'll need more content. ZeroNet offers a great userexperience: the UI is sexy, the interactions are satisfyingly swift (because they happen locally), the big zites look friendly and orderly. But what are they going to do here? [Play](http://127.0.0.1:431110/1PLAYgDQboKojowD3kwdb3CtWmWaokXvfp/) is great, but their torrents often lack seeders, [1+Gallery](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1PGaLLNiadMzrmw6MMMnpZnskwFcdgZoS4/) is great (shameful plug, I know, but check it out if you haven't!) as long as you're only looking for hentai (or a couple of big mangas)...  [KopyKate](http://127.0.0.1:43110/big.kopykate.bit/) is great, but there's not a lot on it (some good documentaries though, forgot who uploaded them), [KxoVid](http://127.0.0.1:43110/14c5LUN73J7KKMznp9LvZWkxpZFWgE1sDz/?/) has a lot of potential, sadly it could do with some UI work (e.g. show thumbnails) and has near to no content.\n\nI'd say ZeroNet has the coders, but not enough content providers. And we'll need those to attract more users. I think one of the best ways to convince users is also the ease with which one can start a blog! It's even easier than using a blogging service on the clearnet! That's a heck of a good way to convince people to use it ... except they won't have much of an audience...",
