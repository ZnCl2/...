Hitlers socialism worked and it was fantastic.\n\nSorry, not right. Hitler was implemented by the Occult Secret Society Skull & Bones from Yale, they even boast about this fact:\nQuote: \"Die Bonesmen hatten sich mit Hitler einen netten Hurensohn herangezüchtet. Schon vor der Machtübernahme hatte die US-Botschaft Anfang der 30er Jahre nach Washington Fragen nach dem finanziellen Hintergrund von Hitlers aufwendigem Wahlkampf und der Bewaffnung seiner Privatarmee von 300.000 Braunhemden gekabelt. Den Mitarbeitern war aufgefallen, dass die SA mit Waffen aus amerikanischer Produktion ausgestattet war. Der deutsche Stahlmagnat Fritz Thyssen hat später zugegeben, in das Hitler-Projekt seit 1930 investiert zu haben - seine Vermögensverwalter und Banker in dieser Zeit: Bush und Harriman.\"\nCheck it here: https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Skulls-Bones-Bush-3452704.html\n\nImportant to know: Hitler build up a totalitarian system (he added nationalist to socialisam because otherwise he would not be so pupular this time) with all elements of a totalitarian socialist state.\nThat is is the reason why the Elite backed him, because the elite wants to build up a socialist prison (totalitarian global socialist state) around us to control and to watch every move from us.",
