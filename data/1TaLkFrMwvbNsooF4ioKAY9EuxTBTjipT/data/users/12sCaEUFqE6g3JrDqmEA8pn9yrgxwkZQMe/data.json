It has a light theme and a dark theme.\n\nIt has 3 Types Clock in it.\n\nDigital Clock.\nBinary Clock.\nText Clock.\nDigital Clock will show time as normal clock, but it does not end there, digital clock has circles on it, these shows numbers in binary format, and another clock is text clock, which shows time in text format, not just that. it wishes every minute, just like other digital clocks it has weather and day details. If you are a techy, you will like the clock with binary language. It has ticker in the middle, ticker seems like climbing dots or snake animation, but they are implemented using binary digits, for unknown people they seems like an animation but for known people it will entertain meaningfully. Weather details update every 20 secs covering Avg, Min, Max temperatures as well as weather condition.\n\nBenifits :\n\nIts code is optimised for smart clocks which have less powerful chips and ram resources.\nContains both light and dark themes.\nSimple and modern design.\ndesign is familiar to most smart clocks.\n\nVideo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk-fFNvEX1E\nRepo : https://github.com/canewsin/flutter_clock/tree/master/digital_clock",

			"title": "Crypto Naming System - DNS Like Proof of Work Naming System",
			"body": "DNS is successful due to human readable naming system and their records liking with their servers in centralised source. But for decentralised network accessing, outside the network is not preferable by its users, namecoin systems exists for a reason with blockchain, which is no go users because we have store namecoin blockchain, since it is not just related to zeronet, it is huge in size and sharing huge amount of namecoin full blockchain data is not feasible. Also few services like domain data stores exists eg: name.yo etc, but outside the zeronet, we cannot verify the integrity of the domain. Other services like vanitygen exists for semi readable names, we should have DNS like Name System for cryptography area. Thus I drafted a solution for this problem, and made a software CryptoNS-gen, currently it's just a prototype, but for testing it works for now for you to test it, main idea is bitcoin addresses are random, we can produce as many as we want possibly millions in seconds if we use GPUs, user has to give a domain name. Program has predefined patterns, the goal of program is to create a bitcoin address which satisfies one of the predefined patterns, currently program runs on cpu instructions only thus is very slow but you can have 5 letter domain names, but once GPU computing is involved, speed will increase up to 100X, thus we can produce longer domain names, program will output bitcoin address and private key, pattern, domain, since we can reproduce domain from address and pattern, we will have an integrity of address. Currently like vanitygen, CryptoNS-gen is just a address gen thus it doesn't store domain names and addresses, so don't expect it store your domain linking, since domain names are verifiable we can just store in database like ZeroName like sites and retrive them, POW in this context is longer the domain, longer it can take to generate, \"DNS like\" here refers to we have to store these values by linking address and domain or username with a pattern at some place. Since domain and address are linked with pattern, we can ensure there can be only one unique domain is registered across such service provider.\n\nProgram is written using rust, if you're interested, you can hack into source code.\nSource Code : https://github.com/decentnetwork/CryptoNS-Gen\nBinary Release : https://github.com/decentnetwork/CryptoNS-Gen/releases/tag/0.0.1\n\nExample :\nwindows : \n> cryptons_gen.exe zero\n\n```\nresult : zero took : 56 secs, pattern: P\npattern : P\npublic key : 1KZeRrzouETELHti43jtCT2Xi4pqxgB6Su\nprivate key : 5KPZpcXvz3QkCAzPJM5fVapB677aTAkJM3BBFQibahTRiu8V7SM\n```\n\nv 0.0.2\n```\nresult : zero took : 1 secs, pattern: NF\nelapsed time in secs 1\npattern : NF\npublic key : 1Ld6Z5eRYoUeVinrAcrbxBZUmLCG9F88c9\nprivate key : KwsWGb7ASba8ZmNexrbuhdEtUFTH4bG212d7vneHfrzog6cgmywL\n```\n\nYour feedback is appreciated.",

While exploring resources to that project, I came across a VPS Provider Digital Oceans, which offers VPS at as low as $5/month, which is negligible when compared to others and you can host full linux server for that money. You will get 1vCPU/1GB Ram/25GB Hard Disk Space. You can also get $100 Free Credit to use within 60 days, so that you don't have to pay for first 60 days. Service needs a credit card/paypal a/c with $5, paypal users have to pay on signup, credit card users need not to pay upfront. So try your self, ping me if you have any doubts.",

Most of the ZeroNet installations are disconnecting from the network, they either don't know how to make code changes to core or loosing interest in the project. What's you thoughts on this.\n\nFirst Plans:\nFork ZeroNet, Add TOR patch.\nEducate New Users about new source.\nAllow Modified Pull Requests which are not accepted to Original Repo.\nEnable Existing Plugins which support to strengthen the network by default.\n\nFurther Improvements :\nPlugin Store to host plugins submitted by Users for Better Extension of App.\nTranslation Service Providers to provide translations for all languages. Translation Stores similar to above.\nImproved Versions of Default Sites.\nAttract more content creators into the platform.\n\n\nFuture:\nImprove Core.\nPortability to more Platforms.\n\nThese TODOs are planned few months back, but hesitated to post, there are more like these. \n@nofish @styromaniac@kxoid.bit @ssdifnskdjfnsdjk @GitCenter @geekless @lola\nI will tag more people, tag more known developers, users or contributors you know.",
