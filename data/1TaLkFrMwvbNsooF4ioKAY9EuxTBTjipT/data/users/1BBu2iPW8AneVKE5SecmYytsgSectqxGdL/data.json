				"body": "YouTube is censoring videos and Google is monitoring everything you do, this is why companies like lbry.com (video service) and Brave (browser) were created.  What makes these services unique is that they offer FREE crypto currency for using their services.  If ZERONET created their own crypto currency or token, and started giving it out to the crypto community, you would see tons of people come here to earn even more crypto. Many of them would create their own websites and stay long term, while some will just browse the content and collect coins.  This is just an idea, but one that should be considered since it's working great for Brave Browser.  They have a large amount of people using their browser, all because they give out FREE crypto.",
