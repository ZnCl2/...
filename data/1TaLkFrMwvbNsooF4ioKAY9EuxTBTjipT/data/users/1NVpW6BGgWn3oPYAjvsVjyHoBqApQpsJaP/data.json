Termux comes with a \"lite\" version that doesn't include SSL. IDK if that's why you avoided using wget. [...]\n\nI am aware of the lack of ssl support, hence i opted to take the simple route and avoid opening that can of worms. I have tried to compile wget before with openssl and it gave me a headache that im all too familiar with",
