			"body": "To quickly remove and stop sharing any content right after download, there is now a delete button on the overview or detail view of every content. Once deleted, the system will mark the content as \"deleted\" in red color and if you click on it again, it will ask to confirm to really downloading it again.\nThis should make it much easier to be confident whewn clicking on any content not properly named or maybe misnamed when someone doesnt agree with the content and doesnt want to have it local or share.\nOne can test the new functionality on the IFS here:\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/12MVkvYGcRW6u2NYbpfwVad1oQeyG4s9Er",
