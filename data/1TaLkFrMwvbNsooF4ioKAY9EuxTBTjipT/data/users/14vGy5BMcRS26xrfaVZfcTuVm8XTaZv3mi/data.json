			"body": "The love of my life was murdered two months ago and we still don't have answers as of now. I have almost no friends and no one has bothered to check up on me since the service in July. I feel extremely isolated, alone, and tired. I don't want to die or put this suffering onto my family but I can't help how horrible I am feeling and I don't want this weight on me much longer. What is your experience with suicide, suicidal thoughts, or losing someone to suicide? I don't know if it will help but I thought maybe hearing people's experiences with the subject will help me figure out if I'm really going to do this",
