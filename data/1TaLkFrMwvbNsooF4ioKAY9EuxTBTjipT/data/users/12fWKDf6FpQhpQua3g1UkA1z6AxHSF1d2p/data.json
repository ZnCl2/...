I swear, they talk about the culture war and the very real war against our governments and corporate yet run back to mommy government and corporate the moment they have a chance? What kind of pathetic behavior is that? I thought these people were more based, but apparently not. All bark, no bite, they don't actually care about freedom and privacy.",

Freenet has you host everything, but it's all encrypted, meaning you have no way to determine what you're seeding. If you use it, you're all but guaranteed to seed CP, but neither you nor the law has a way to prove it. That means that less popular content is more reliably seeded on Freenet than on ZeroNet, but it's likely illegal to just start it up.\n\nWell I have issue with ZeroNet too in terms of \"illegal\" content, just by visiting any of the chans I'm likely to have one or more of that. That's a real worry TBH. I know I'm on Tor but that's not really fair, the law isn't fair, but alas... this is where we find ourselves.",
