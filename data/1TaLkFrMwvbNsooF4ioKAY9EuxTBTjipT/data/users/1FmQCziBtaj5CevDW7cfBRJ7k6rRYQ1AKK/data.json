Hence the piles of \"How do i get my site going\" or 'please seed my site' conversations. [...]\n\nYup, I believe that was his goal, the problem is, there isn't a large enough adoption of Zeronet at the moment to justify splitting the population in different forums.",

Anything you post to your website appears in ZeroTalk, unless you take steps for it not to.  You set your own limit on your own website.\n\nThat sounds like it shouldn't work at all though?",
