One thing the CD will do is make the GAFAM monopolies even stronger in their position. How are alternative tech sites like Minds, Mastodont, Gab, Bitchute, Peertube etc. going to deal with this? Chances are some of them will be forced to outright block european IPs once the directive goes into effect.What we need to figure out is which MEPs voted for and never vote for them again or for parties that supported this directive like the scummy CDU.Sadly most people won't notice what freedoms were lost today because they don't wander off the GAFAM plantation anyway.

The manufacturer say it's for safety reason since they do degrade, but probably they make it more for commercial reason. My dad also is someone who often make makeshift power bank from disposed laptop battery cell. He said the cells are fine  but the battery as a whole is broken. Goes to show just how the manufacturer actually put artificial lifetime on the thing with counter.",
