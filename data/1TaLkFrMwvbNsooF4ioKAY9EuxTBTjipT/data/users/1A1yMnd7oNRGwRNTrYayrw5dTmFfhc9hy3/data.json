				"body": "We live in a \"witch hunt\" society, even as the toxicity of our society drives people insane or desperate for the precious few resources they need, the results of depravity (being deprived of necessities of life) get treated to even more depravity.\nPeople act like behaviors can just \"magically spring from the void\" as if terrible behaviors aren't the result of society itself (how it is ran) and so they use that ignorance as an excuse to pile on vitriol and hate upon those already screwed, it is as if someone broke their leg, went to a doctor, and the doctor looked down with hate filled eyes, and declared they deserved to have their other leg cut off as punishment for getting injured in the first place.\nIn a sane society, their wouldn't even be prisons, just mental hospitals actually trying to solve the issues.\nThat, and more willingness to look at the very structure of how society is ran and change things when it turns out things like artificial scarcity creates more damaged and desperate people just looking to survive in a society hostile to their very existence and surprise surprise they fight back (crime)\n\nNothing happens for no reason, if stuff occurs it had to have been caused by other stuff,  if people aren't willing to question long held beliefs, they may never find those causes and the problems may grow worse, until they become so bad our species goes extinct to them.",
