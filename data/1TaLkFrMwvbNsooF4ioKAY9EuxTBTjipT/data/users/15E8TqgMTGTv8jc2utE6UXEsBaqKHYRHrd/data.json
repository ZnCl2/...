Then I also lost some money on onecoin cus I was dumb but anyway that wasn't a real crypto. After that I worked for a crypto related company as a junior dev, there I learned more about the real deal. Last year I made some profit on coinbase but I'm not interested in trading anymore. More interested tot learn about p2p systems now.",
