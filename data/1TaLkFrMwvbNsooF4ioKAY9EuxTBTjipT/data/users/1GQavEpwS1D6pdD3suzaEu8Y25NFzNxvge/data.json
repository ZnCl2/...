All links must be relative. I use pictures in my blog, which are stored in the /img folder. It works.\n\nNo. It's not a file path issue. It's a filetype issue. I must find a way to register this file to be used. It's like a firewall. \n\nI've tried with \"three.js so\" too. \n\nhttps://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_skinning_morph\n\nAll the linked .js works well, except the .glb file. It must be hosted in another site to work.",

Can this collada file work \"in javascript\"? https://duckduckgo.com/?q=collada+dae+javascript\n\nSure! This is pure javascript:\n\nhttps://aframe.io/examples/showcase/anime-UI/\n\nYou can even create an emulator in javascript if you want and have the knowledge to do it.",
