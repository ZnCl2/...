			"title": "Decentralized Wifi Concept",
			"body": "So basically the core function of the Decentralized Wifi concept is still the same as zeronet, but with a twist\n\nThe DWifi software can run on any device that contains 2 or more wifi antenna's and can broadcast a AP on one of them\n\nHow it would work is by having each user download and install the software which inits their system much like how zeronet does with a bitcoin ID as the users ID. \nOne Antenna would broadcast a DWiFi AP and the other would listen for other DWiFi AP, identified by the ssid `DWiFi-<the devices public key>`\n\nUpon connection they will send a data packet between each other of other DWiFi Users as a list. < iffy, think of it like an auth into the network to make it harder to spoof a DWiFi AP >\n\nThere can be the common network users where they inter connect, hell it could work via bluetooth as well as that allows more connections\n\nbut there will need to be NODES, DWiFi AP's that are connected to the normal internet,( 2 wifi + 1ethernet, or 3 wifi minimum) allowing a DWiFi to act as a central connection node, which DWiFi client software will perfer, this will contain a data packet of all users connected to it that would be a list of Content that users Serve. And can be cached\n\n\nNow it does need work, but the concept is there and it would function ALOT like how zeronet works. but more localized as it would require users to be near each other. Hence the node boxes that talk to a Peer-list to identify other users on other nodes,\n\nNodes can be setup in places like Airports, Trainstations, Malls, schools. \nIt is still partially centralized because you need a node or two to serve as the Internet Access point, but if enough people use it (per-say, everyone in the world) you could daisy chain an internet connection several miles, \n\nOr it could function on a smaller scale such as every house in the Neighborhood has a Node that talks to each other, and has a battery backup.

			"body": "*please do note this*: the url `zero.net` is in use here because who ever actually owns the real `zero.net` domain has not done *anything* with it in years, and its been broken as well, not even showing any form of ads. so the domain is basically *fekkin useless*\n\nOkay so this is a bit complicated but here is what I have for you!\n\nPlease note I used [[clearnet] portainer](https://portainer.io) control panel for all of this\n\nYou need docker installed on your *primary pc*, the one you will be using zeronet from.\n\nInstall [[clearnet] pihole](https://pi-hole.net) into a docker container, \n- be sure to *temporarily* forward container port 80 to host port 81,\n- forward port `53` on both UDP and TCP, and `67` on UDP\n- I suggest setting the `hostname` for the container to `pihole`\n- On windows I suggest downloading and installing [[clearnet] Nirsoft's QuickSetDNS](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/quick_set_dns.html) program and using that to set your DNS server to `127.0.0.1`\n\nInstall [[dockerhub] Caddy](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/caddy) into a docker container, this one will take a few extra steps\n- I suggest setting the `hostname` for the container to `caddy`\n- Please do forward ports 80 and 443\n1. Mount `container/config` to somewhere on your PC, I perfer either `/opt/docker/caddy` or `C:/.docker/caddy`,\n2. Modify the start command to the folling\n\t- `'caddy' 'run' '--config' '/config/caddy.conf' '--adapter' 'caddyfile'`\n\t- You can use something other than caddy.conf but I reccomend it, \n3. On the Host, install this program [[github] minica](https://github.com/jsha/minica)\n\t1. once installed, navigate to where you mounted `container/config` on your host,\n\t2. `mkdir certs && minica --domains zero.net`\n\t3. This will do two things, 1, generate a CA Auth Certificate in this folder,\n\t4. Import `minica.pem` as a `Trusted Root Authority` in your PC,\n\t\t- on windows you can easily do this by renaming it to `minica.crt` and opening it, \n\t\t- I am unaware the steps on linux\n4. I highly suggest this config for your `caddy.conf` but entirely up to you\n\n```conf\n# https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile\n\nimport /config/certs/*/caddy.conf\n```\n - This makes it so when you generate the ssl cert by using `minica --domains <domain>` you can just plop a `caddy.conf` in the cert folder,\n\n5. Now, in `/config/certs/zero.net/caddy.conf` fill it with this, \n```conf\nzero.net {\n\ttls /config/certs/zero.net/cert.pem /config/certs/zero.net/key.pem\n\treverse_proxy zeronet:43110 {\n\t\theader_up Host \"127.0.0.1\"\n\t\theader_up Origin \"127.0.0.1\"\n\t}\n}\n```\nif this breaks, comment out the header lines with `#`\n6. Inside pi.hole, under `local DNS` add an entry for `zero.net` to point to `127.0.0.1`\n\n7. ***[optional]*** Give `pi.hole` its own domain!\n\t- `minica --domains pi.hole`\n\t- add an DNS entry for `pi.hole` that points to `127.0.0.1`\n\t- `/config/certs/pi.hole/caddy.conf`\n```\npi.hole {\n\ttls /config/certs/pi.hole/cert.pem /config/certs/pi.hole/key.pem\n\treverse_proxy pihole:80\n}\n```\n\nNow Install the zeronet docker container `nofish/zeronet:latest`,\n- Do not forward the `43110` port\n- I suggest mounting `container/root/data` to somewhere on your PC,\n- inorder for the previous config to even work, you need to set the hostname of this container to `zeronet` or modify the previous config so that `zeronet` is replaced with the containers hostname\n- now this is important, pi-hole will have made a new network, or atleast it should, if not, make a bridged network in docker.\n- Assign all three containers, pi-hole, caddy, and zeronet to this shared network, \n- set `--ui_ip \"*\" --ui_host \"*\"`\nAnd that should be all!",
