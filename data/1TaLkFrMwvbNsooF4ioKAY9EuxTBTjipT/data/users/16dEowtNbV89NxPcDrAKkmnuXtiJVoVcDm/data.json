That means, it didn't solve the problem in fact. Rather, the problems have been growing worse and worse. \n\nWhat does it mean? War can't be justified. It's just like that a boy is losing his shoes again and again whenever his mom buys him new ones. He doesn't deserve *WEARING SHOES*. \n\nAnd most wars committed by the countries of the power were not done in the way the war supporters desired. Rather, they were done for the profit of a small group of elites. The elites persuade people to support their plan to run a war business. And the idiot people support them. \n\nThey lose their shoes, and their children lose again, and again. \n\nThis globe is a kind of a laboratory. Human being has experimented thousands of times in wars, politics, economies and religions. And it turned out those experiments have been all failed! And they lost the shoes again! What a ridiculous situation. \n\nHumans-rule-humans system has absolutely failed.\n\nNo more experiments are justified. \n\n[sos4sos@riseup.net 2018-03-08 13-25-49](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Profile/1SunAWK2VUT9GQK32MpwRfFPVgcBSJN9a/16dEowtNbV89NxPcDrAKkmnuXtiJVoVcDm/leftside@zeroid.bit)",

Please take a minute to find out what's new:\nEncrypting the Message Subject\n\nWe developed a new method that moves the email subject into the encrypted message, and replaces the visible subject with \"Encrypted Message\". Once such a message is decrypted, the original subject is replaced automatically. Hiding the subject is on by default; there is a preference to turn it off if you don't like it. (Note: this feature requires the message to be sent with PGP/MIME.)\nChanged behavior of Encrypt and Sign Buttons\n\nThe Encrypt and Sign buttons in the message composer window now work for both the OpenPGP and S/MIME protocols. If both algorithms are possible, then Enigmail will try to prefer the one for which all keys are available.\nSupport for Autocrypt\n\nEnigmail now supports Autocrypt, a new standard to distribute keys as part of sent messages. Enigmail automatically imports keys from Autocrypt-compliant messages, such that over time more and more emails can be encrypted.\nNew p≡p Junior Mode (Pretty Easy Privacy)\n\nEnigmail now contains a p≡p Junior Mode. The p≡p Junior Mode allows you to use OpenPGP encryption as transparently as possible; you don't need to care for key management and synchronization of keys between devices anymore.\n\nPlease visit [our documentation](https://enigmail.net/home/docu.php) for help on using Enigmail.",

It would work like this: The 3rd person uploads a post with dumb questions periodically. And the programmer gives an answer to that post with a hidden pattern which was agreed between two like the number of periods in regard with the number of vowels, etc. (example: \"yes, you can do it...\" = 6 vowels and 3 periods = 2:1 per a phrase) Once this rule is compromised and confirmed by a series of checking, now the 3rd person announces that the programmer is not real, and shows the signed agreement from the programmer.

They can afford their pilot to sacrifice. \n\nWhy?\n\nAs they used to do before, this time again they need some hot issue to turn their people's eyes from the big scandals that the prime minister Abe regime was turned out to have been deceiving Japanese people by manipulating the statistics on foreign workers in Japan and textile industry. This scandal is going on like domino blocks falling one by one day by day. In fact Japanese government has been fabricating most numbers across all over their industry for more than 70 years! Some were even among those which were reported to international authorities such as OECD. Everything was lie. They even tried to import 350,000 foreign laborers to lower they native citizens' average salary based on the fabricated statistics.\n\nWhat now? \n\nAbe regime desperately requires South Korea to slap Japan's face so that agitated stupid mob of Japanese to forget what their government stole from their pockets.\n\nThis is what Japanese government has been doing for a living for 100 years to Korea and its neighboring Asian countries. \n\nJapanese rightists.

			"body": "In Korea, every new year there's a huge struggling among salary men and women to prepare documents and receipts to refund some parts of the tax they paid last year. \n\nCompany takes some of the salary of its employees according to the calculation table which National Tax Service made for various jobs and salary levels, so that the company pays the income tax of the employees in advance.\n\nBut there're a lot of discounts if the employees submit various groups of receipts they spent last year to the government, most times via their company or sometimes via themselves in http://hometax.go.kr. \n\nFor example, if u purchased items or paid for services with ur credit card more than $300, they subtract such an amount from the denominator or the reference income which is the reference value to calculate the tax. Or all the amount paid for his own education or his children's education are subtracted no matter how much it is, etc. It''s a bit complicated for normal people, so the related web sites and forums suffer a sudden jam by those people around every year-end. \n\nEvery year the calculation table changes in ratios for each criteria, people's spending pattern changes according to it. For example discount rates between the credit card and debit card change and that affects the credit card companies' income from the transaction commissions while the merchandisers get benefits by saving the credit card commission, etc. \n\nGovernment is reducing discount ratio of the credit card while increasing debit card and cash with government registered card which doesn't require any commission or paper receipt to keep in a physical storage, which also reduces the time spent in organizing and converting into the digital data.\n\nAnyway, by those efforts, most times u get refunded from $100 to $1000 or more every year from the government. If u missed submitting those documents or failed to spend money in a smart way, u will get nothing or sometimes will have to pay more tax if company used to take too small amount from ur salary for the prepaying tax last year. \n\nHow'bout other countries?",

But the bot will detect this activity and will mention this user while replying him with the link to the captcha which is generated for him as mentioned above. Of course the bot has to keep track of the pairs of the users and the captcha links in the local PC in a kind of filename `captcha.txt`.\n\n(**UPDATE** : The user will never be able to write anything on the target site without having a proper key of the captcha from the separate captcha site in advance as mentioned in my comments below. 2019-02-11 18:49:44+0900)\n\nIt'd be good if the site has a link titled \"New users, signup first!\" on the top of the front page so that every answer of the new users gathers in that post in the comment section.\n\nAnd, unless he posts the proper answer to the linked page of the captcha which was given by the bot in the previous reply, any activities of this user will be banned by the bot's deletion and by the bot's editing `data/users/content.json` to make `max_size` property of the very user to set to ZERO. The bot will sign/publish by itself the change of `content.json` so that it affects soon.\n\nThe way how the new user answers the CAPTCHA must have been described in the previous reply to the user such as: \"To enable your account, click [reply] button on the right side of my ID [zerobot] and input the correct answer for your CAPTCHA, and click [Submit comment].\"\n\nAs soon as the user makes reply to the bot, the bot checks the answer and decides to grant him the right to post or not. And the bot will set flag on this user in `captcha.txt`. If not correct answer, the bot will give him a few more chances to try. When this process ends, the HTML page for the user will be deleted on the bot's PC and sign/publish the site again to make the change effective to everybody.\n\nThis captcha method also can be used for every renewal or raising limit of the capacity of posting instead of the current manual raising by the site creator.\n\nPS: Where on earth @blurhy has gone??? He's a specialist on this field! Where's @binchan? \nI don't want to code this bot with my clumsy hands! :(\n\n**UPDATE**\nMore upgraded features are introduced in my comments below. 2019-02-09_01-31-05+0900\n\n**UPDATE**\nThis method is totally **decentralized CAPTCHA** independent from any clearnet things by the way.

The others could have their own rule as they decide what to protect, the truth or a handful of reputation. \n\nI'm just asking for the feature which could be turned on or off as needed.",

On each update you have to rewrite the actual file containing data plus the content.json for that user, and then import such changes in the database file, so the hard disk does indeed some work. [...]\n\nIn case of (for example).../ZeroNet/data/16J4mEgR5aqerfzGy2WctNV3onPQUgF2E5/data/users/16dEowtNbV89NxPcDrAKkmnuXtiJVoVcDm/data.json , it is updating by removing the contents in the middle of the text file and adding new contents again in the middle of the text file. It means, to add a single character to the somewhere near top part of the text file, SDD has to erase the entire file from the block and write again. That is, unfortunately if a group of people is commenting or voting/unvoting to a certain post very frequently and unfortunately again you're the first peer receiving all those minor updates continuously (not like receiving the final update version after hundreds of changes), your SDD must suffer a lot. \n\nRegarding data.json, I'm thinking of continuous tailing structure rather than the current in-the-middle-updating structure. For the tailing structure, it would behave like the old read-only CD-ROM's continuous tail writing mechanism by flagging DELETE for the old files if the user wants to assume it's deleted or updated. Of course this is also like mbox structure. After a certain period of time or after reaching a certain size of mbox file, zeronet could prompt 'compact user.json?' or perform auto-compaction by itself. \n\nI don't know if mbox style doesn't compromise wear-leveling or not since basically in order to write anything to the SSD you have to first erase an entire block of SSD anyway. I think updating user.json with mbox or tailing style would not compromise by means of TRIM mechanism or something? This should be studied further anyway.",

Public key encrypted msg can be only decrypted by the paird PRIVATE KEY.\nPRIVATE KEY should not be revealed to anyone except its owner, but PUBLIC KEY should be announced to as many people as possible in order to receive any msg from anybody in encrypted state.\"",

Having been born at the end of the 90s, I grew up a fairly plain life.  Porn was my go to for tech since 2006.  Steady fast internet allowed for degeneracy.  Not, I wouldn't have wanted to be born in any other country, but just be thankful for where you are from.\n\nWhen I was small My mom bought me a z-80 PC and I memorized the entire BASIC source code book.\nI was known as a computer genius among teachers and kids since there's nothing I can't solve or make in the display.\nI even made some action games but there's no way to understand why my games are so slow that they can't be compared with those of Japanese games for z-80 CPU. \nNo ones were around me to guide. No tech books I could reach even though I went to the library and bookstore every week for shopping for the tech books.\nBut around 10 years later from that time at last I could realize that in Japan and USA they'd been already enjoying computer renaissance for more than 30 years with lots of magazines and forums with essence of the real mechanism of the PC, not dumb BASIC or impractical C languages without the knowledge of any hardware and Assembly language.\n.\nWhile you guys were tilling the farm, I was collecting wild strawberries in the wildness to fill the stomach. \nWhile u guys were reading books and eating preserved crops in the cozy hut in the cold winter, I had to be busy in hunting in the snow all day long. lol\n.\nIn China Mencius said his mom changed the place of residence 3 times for his education.\nIn Korea we have a proverb saying once a man is born he has to move to Seoul, once a horse is born it has to move to Jaejudo to grow up in the best shape.",

As a result In spite of my `usermod`ing my user id to the group id tor, ./ZeroNet.sh continuously showed error msg 'permission denied' regarding /var/lib/tor/control_auth_cookie.\n\nSo I found out that I had to manually set rwx on /var/lib/tor and /var/lib/tor/control_auth_cookie before running zeronet or after restarting tor.service.\n\nWhy this happens?
