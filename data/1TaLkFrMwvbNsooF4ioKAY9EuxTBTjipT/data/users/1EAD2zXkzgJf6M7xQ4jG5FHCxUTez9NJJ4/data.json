			"body": "Am I the only one frustrated when I try to load a zite from this forum only to see NO PEERS? lol\n\nHopefully this helps.\nhttps://0net.io/\n\nOur team has been running this open proxy for a couple months now as we develop our own services. Its far from ready for any heavy usage, but we're committed to keeping it open and available to host ANY zite of ANY size. So, if you're looking for a stable host for your zite, simply load it using https://0net.io/<your-zite-address>.\n\nFYI - This is a single server, running off-shore, but we're currently working on a migration to a new host with advanced DDoS protection (which will replace Cloudflare). We'll then begin scaling the resources (ie load-balancing multiple servers, data caching, etc), which should improve performance dramatically.\n\nFeedback is always welcome\nCheers!",

			"title": "0net.io Peer Exchange (PEX)",
			"body": "A few people have recently asked to make 0net.io a Bootstrapper as its a **super peer server.** IMO its just not stable enough to be a permanent server for peer exchange *(not yet anyway).* However, I don't see why not **POINT** a DNS entry to one of our **TEST** servers *(as of today, we are no longer testing on it)* and we can always redirect later as we scale up our network.\n\n> Sooo, `pex.0net.io:10443` is now available for **permanent** peer exchange.\n\n---\n\nThis was rather inspired by a recent [post from Kaffie](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv/1NWh3WAty57FH8at1WtrZigMrdhrDkuPzh/1535778046). I really don't see any need to have to bootstrap from the Clearnet, when `zero://`'s seem to do a better job anyway. \n\nI also went ahead and enabled the `Bootstrapper` plugin. But I really don't know what this does, as PEX works just fine without it. Could someone please enlighten me as to the added value?\n\nAs always, I warmly welcome any feedback and/or suggestions as to how we can help utilize our resources to grow this wonderful community.\n\nCheers!\nd14na",

			"title": "DEVS: Is SQLite an Anti-pattern for Zite Data???",
			"body": "**TL;DR If you're a zite developer, do you think SQLite needs to be retired in favor of a NoSQL solution?**\n\n---\n\nI'd like to take just a moment to thank the community for ALL the incredible support I've received, especially from @krixano *(for his unbelievable knowledge & patience),* @ivanq *(for his [The Truth About the Zeronet](http://127.0.0.1:43110/zerocoding.bit/the-truth-about-zeronet/))* and @daniell *(for being \"pure\" awesome).*\n\nEveryday, I'm relentlessly digging deeper and deeper into the technical details that makeup the Zeronet internals *(irl people think I've died, smh). *The last big piece to this puzzle are the **\"Dynamic Zites\"** powered by SQLite. **I GET IT! and it WORKS!** but its an anti-pattern that really shouldn't be encouraged moving forward.\n\n**Simplified, it goes like this:**\n\n1. Take `/data/users/<public-key>/data.json`\n2. Inject it into a SQLite database\n3. Run your queries, make your updates, etc\n4. Extract the \"modified\" information from SQLite\n5. Update `/data/users/<public-key>/data.json`\n6. Share it!\n\n**The overhead on steps #2 & 4 is non-trivial; and as the Zeronet scales \"exponentially\" in popularity, will very likely become a serious problem.**\n\nSooo, why not just run the queries and make the updates directly on the JSON data files themselves? \n\nThere are plenty of well-developed, well-supported libraries out there today that can do that extremely efficiently. The one that I'm stuck on now is [Realm.](https://realm.io/) It suits my needs perfectly with regards to [0Explorer](http://127.0.0.1:43110/zeronetexplorer.bit), but I'm really not sure how well it would import into the Python codebase *(if at all, cause I think its Node-based).*\n\nAnyway, the question to the devs is, **\"What's the best NoSQL solution that can be used for ZeroNet today?\"** If we can come to an agreement, perhaps we can start working towards a migration. SQLite is in NO WAY designed for P2P networks *(or networks at all);* and I'm hoping to get some consensus that will provide me and others with guidance in our own efforts at developing new decentralized services.\n\nMore than happy to provide technical specs, but perhaps ZeroTalk isn't the best place for that discussion.\n\nCheers!\nd14na\n\n---\n\n**Just for completeness, here's the code I first used for testing:**\n\n```\nconst Realm = require('realm');\n\n// Define your models and their properties\nconst CarSchema = {\n    name: 'Car',\n    properties: {\n        make:  'string',\n        model: 'string',\n        miles: {type: 'int', default: 0},\n    }\n};\n\nconst PersonSchema = {\n    name: 'Person',\n    properties: {\n        name:     'string',\n        birthday: 'date',\n        cars:     'Car[]',\n        picture:  'data?' // optional property\n    }\n};\n\nRealm.open({schema: [CarSchema, PersonSchema]})\n    .then(realm => {\n        // Create Realm objects and write to local storage\n        realm.write(() => {\n            const myCar = realm.create('Car', {\n                make: 'Honda',\n                model: 'Civic',\n                miles: 1000,\n            });\n            myCar.miles += 20; // Update a property value\n        });\n\n    // Query Realm for all cars with a high mileage\n    const cars = realm.objects('Car').filtered('miles > 1000');\n\n    // Will return a Results object with our 1 car\n    console.log('# of cars', cars.length);\n\n    // Add another car\n    realm.write(() => {\n        const myCar = realm.create('Car', {\n            make: 'Ford',\n            model: 'Focus',\n            miles: 2000,\n        });\n    });\n\n    // Query results are updated in realtime\n    console.log('# of cars', cars.length);\n})\n.catch(error => {\n    console.log(error);\n});\n```",

I remember when I first started developing on Android back in '09, everyone talked about the \"killer app\" that would take out iPhone. ummm, it never happened. imo, what allowed Android to compete so successfully with Apple was its ability to iterate quickly and build things faster that Apple devs ever could (because it was an open platform). and users appreciated the bleeding edge apps. imo, Zeronet is currently missing the tools to allow developers to \"HAVE AT IT!\" and if we don't built it, THEY will never come.\n\n---\n\nI have an idea to build an [Atom plugin](https://atom.io/) that will allow building zites to be as easy as [Dreamweaver](https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html) (you know, from way back in the day). Services like Wordpress and Wix are great for allowing ANYONE to produce content, but that's not enough for \"real\" devs to build APPS (or better yet DApps).

ANYONE running one of these \"analysis\" nodes could provide a similar list (NOT necessarily via blockchain) and eventually these lists would be rated themselves by the community. aside for the addition of \"quality\" ratings, i guess it would be identical to the centralized trackers used today, but on top of a blockchain that cannot ever go off-line.\n\ni like @krixano's plan for trusted peers as a reasonable compromise to the certificate authority decentralization problem. perhaps that pure p2p solution could apply here as well.",
