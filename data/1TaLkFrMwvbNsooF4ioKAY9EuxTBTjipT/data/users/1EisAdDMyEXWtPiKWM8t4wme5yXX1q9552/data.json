He is clearly going against Twitter TOS, and Twitter isn't doing anything about it, so that's why; Twitter can close any account it deems against its TOS. Also, to the far-right guys here that are saying this is antifa, sources that aren't blogs would be appreciated. Also, I don't have Twitter; it's not worth my time; just a random idea that popped into my head.",

If you can answer that question and come out with an answer that justifies closing Trumps or anyone else's account you are part of the problem!\n\nIt's not censorship; it's removing misinformation and divisiveness that is making this country worse off. You do know that a POTUS has better things to do with his time than post 74 tweets in an hour, right? That's more than a tweet a minute. Also no president should be tweeting and justifying conspiracy theories with no evidence at all because of something he reads on a propaganda network (*cough* OANN), so yeah.",
