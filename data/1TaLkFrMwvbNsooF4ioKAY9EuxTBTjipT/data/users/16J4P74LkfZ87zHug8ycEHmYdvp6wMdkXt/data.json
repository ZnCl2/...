Blacks, hispanics, jews, etc have very large in-group preferences. Something like 90% of hispanics use \"hispanic\" as their primary identity (as opposed to democrat, american), where as whites only do it about 30% of the time.\n\nIt's pretty much the same reason why you don't see nationalistic germans....",
