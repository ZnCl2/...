			"title": "ZeroNet convenience, Achievable even by the technically retarded.",
			"body": "I've got ZeroNet set up up and spinning on a dedicated box at home. Now, I can access it from anywhere at anytime using duckdns. \n\nI have a couple questions that I think are relevant going forward. Just how much space can I expect this to take if I leave it running for months (years?) on end. It seems that it's theoretically possible for the entirety of zeronet to eventually end up hosted by me locally depending on my usage habits. If we plan to grow, then the average user will eventually need to dedicate massive amounts of space to the network. I've got 100g dedicated, but it seems that if we grow, which we must, then eventually each normal user could need terabytes in order to make the network readily accessible to everyone. \nHow is this being planned for? Is there any plan to perhaps make sure that old sites that haven't been updated for a long time (some threshold) are eventually pruned automatically? \n\nSecond: I know ZeroNet has multi-user capability, which I think is great because it allows the average user to connect via proxy and experience zeronet without having to do their own install. But it begs the question; from the perspective of a normal internet user, what benefit do they reap from being here vs clearnet? All their friends are on clearnet. Their socials are on clearnet, their banking is on clearnet, their email is on clearnet... all the interesting meme video sites are on clearnet for heavens sake. \n\nHow do we draw them? The answer I think is creative and interesting content. If zeronet is to be a place where oddballs such and me and (possibly you) congregate away from everyone else, then it will never be anything more than a bunker for the technically inclined. \n\nWhy does content blossom and grow on clearnet? The answer I think is because the clearnet exists for one reason and one reason alone: To make money. Rarely is anything done that doesn't benefit someone financially. There are rare exceptions like 4chan (it doesn't make money, but it at least breaks even). Facebook exists for advertising, google is an advertising company. Even places like redding, deviant art, etc... they MAKE MONEY by advertising. They do it on the back of content creators, but they exist for advertising nonetheless. \n\nIt seems like these things have a natural cycle to them: First people are genuinely interested in making content because it brings them joy to do so, eventually, they realize they can make money on it. They rarely do so by themselves... rather, its done through a system of advertisement, through subscription, syndication, etc. Either people get on board or they don't. Look at liveleak, it couldn't compete with youtube, it's hanging on by a thread now and it looks like a site from the late 90's. \n\nI guess my main concern is this: How to we get content creators interested in ZeroNet, how do we ensure they benefit from it , how can we drive traffic here, and ensure they stay here, and most importantly, how can we implement some kind of advertising to generate revenues that will allow the network to grow and expand, and to fund additional content creation. \n\nWe need to answer these questions or this project will only ever be a bunch of us weirdos hanging out on the secret internet.",

Unlike 802.1p Quality of Service (QoS), port-based rate limiting does not prioritize information based on type. Rate limiting simply means that the switch will slow down traffic on a port to keep it from exceeding the limit that you set. If you set the rate limit on a port too low, you might see degraded video stream quality, sluggish response times during online activity, and other problems.\n\nThe best use of rate limiting is to keep low-priority devices that are connected to your switch from using too much of your bandwidth and slowing down your other connected devices. A combination of rate limiting and QoS can help you maximize your networkâ€™s efficiency and prioritize devices and activities.",

As you pointed out, the clearnet exists to make money.  And that is what has corrupted it to the point where we are now looking for alternatives.  If ZeroNet expands rapidly and becomes enormous, the same thing will happen to it.  Then, we'll have to go somewhere else.  So, why would you want to hasten the process?  Can't you just be happy making money on the clearnet, and let ZeroNet exist uncorrupted for a while longer?\n\nIt's not a matter of me personally making money. The fact is that money (rather, the flow therof) drives progress, development, and the production of interesting content. \n\nThe question I'm interested in answering is deeper. How do we totally divorce the process of development from the thing that has always driven development throughout history? That is money. \n\nHow do you motivate people to abandon the clearnet for better alternative without something to draw them? How do you cause people to dedicate themselves to generating content when there isn't anything in it for them. In the beginning you might draw in a few people who like to make content for the sake of it, but they need to live too. Sooner or later they need to make a buck. \n\nEven me, I voluntarily seed as much as I can because I am counting on this project becoming more than just a project.

Why would people abandon the clearnet for something just like the clearnet?  What's wrong with a cool clubhouse to hang out in--something similar to the clearnet of the 1990's, before the it became corrupted by money?\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not trying to make a moral issue out of it. I'm just thinking aloud. \n\nI agree that clearnet is certainly corrupted in many ways. But I think that the corruption was caused by a finite number of individuals who used it for personal gain at the expense of everyone else's ability to think, have meaningful conversations, and express their true ideas. I don't see it as a flaw integral to the system itself; the system is merely a series of tubes and boxes to be used one way or another to put it simply. \n\nI suppose I came here because I view the internet as a tool, as opposed to a source of entertainment. It is a tool that I use to communicate, to be introduced to interesting ideas, and to try to seek the truth of the world through the noise. \n\nI can see that the question I should have asked is: What do the users of ZeroNet want this place to become?",

Is it a quote from the Bible, or from something more esoteric, like Emanuel Swedenborg or Kabbala?\n\nIt's not from the bible directly, although one could argue that it reflects an idea found in the old testament. That is that everything laid out in the old Jewish law was to serve as an earthly reflection of something spiritual or heavenly. I'm just speculating about the connection though. \n\nI stole this answer from the internet, I didn't write anything below this line: \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Some of the other answers here are pretty solid interpretations. I would offer some practical examples that illustrate the concept.\n\nIf you look at your body, you may notice the visual patterns that are reflected (in scale) outside of your body. For instance, the dendritic pattern of your veins & nerve cells is mirrored in rivers & trees (respectively specific). We can look at the number Phi, for instance, and see its role in the proportions of the body (length of fingers, space between eyes, etc). We can look at many patterns within nature and see their correspondence with the body, and to scale from the smallest patterns to the largest ones that we can perceive.\n\nI would say that this is one of my favorite parts about Hermeticism as a philosophy. It enables the interpretation of life through a poetic lens of metaphor and correspondence, and fosters the connection between phenomena across various scales, giving a sense of connection. Perhaps the \"biggie\" example here would be if we take \"As above, so below\" and apply it to the existence of consciousness and creativity, then indeed we could follow it all the way up and see that humans are a mirror of Godhead, the singular consciousness and creative potential.\n\nYou can apply this axiom in \"practice\" by considering the larger, or more abstract version of whatever it is that you might be observing or doing, and keeping sight of the implications.\"",

So it's better to get along and get to know each other over time, instead of perma-muting other people just because one thing they said rubbed you the wrong way.",

Once in a while you find a smart person who happens to know his shit, but that's just because there were lots of users on the site.Wrt to the topic, personally I bet a large portion of pedos (at least hebephiles) are just normal people with low risk aversion who happen to be fed up with their wives and decide to take a shot at seducing some teen in their lives (or download cee pee) despite the risk of going to jail. One of their students, some family member, etc. I mean, let's be honest, who wouldn't like to fuck some 14 yo prime virgin pussy? Especially now that almost every 20 yo woman is a tattooed whore with >20 past sex partners and who knows what STDs. Same thing with porn. Who wants to look at some professionally produced porn showing a 30 yo fake blond whore taking the BBC from her three nigger step fathers or whatever, or some cam whore with >100 dick count pissing (oh, sorry, \"squirting\") all over the floor while making fake moans every time one of her orbiters donates to her? All jewish shit. I'd rather watch some leaked vids of a teen masturbating with a hairbrush or whatever. [...]\n\nDon't worry undisputed, He's muted you by now.",
