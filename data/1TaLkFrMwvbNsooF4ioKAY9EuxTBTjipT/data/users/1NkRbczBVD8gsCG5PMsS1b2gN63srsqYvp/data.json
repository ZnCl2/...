If I wouldn't have shopped so much already when it tanked in spring I would buy more 😉",

In Private Browsing mode it of course worked fine, because I was not logged in so there was no privacy agreement to accept, but I was unable to log out from Instagram because I would have had to accept their agreement before I could do anything.

Most of this \"private data\" is known to the authorities, so there's no point in protecting it. The real private data has to be stored with client-side encryption, so there is no need to \"protect\" it. How to see if some company REALLY protects your data? They use end-to-end encryption, or encrypt the data directly on your side, and only you have the key. If someone gives you i.e. chat possibility without end-to-end encryption - you can be sure they will give this data to someone else. I don't care if they hand it over to police, fuck even interpol, or some lunatic adware company. Your data is yours alone and we protect it as as whole or there is no point in \"protection\". Also the GDPR with this \"be forgotten\", is trying to make you like.. \"unsee\" things. Fucked up and wicked AF. When police will send request to google, will google protect my data? FUCK NO! Thats why GDPR is just scam.\n\nWell said, brother",
