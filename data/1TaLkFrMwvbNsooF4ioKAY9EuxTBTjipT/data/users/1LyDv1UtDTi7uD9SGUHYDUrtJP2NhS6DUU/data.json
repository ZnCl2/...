			"body": "I *have* been keeping up with ZeroNet updates and have been occasionally going on ZeroNet. However, I have been busy with my new job and some other projects that I've been working on.\n\nI wanted to give a summary of what I've been working on / doing while I was away (some of it relates to ZeroNet, not all):\n* Started my internship job working for a small company\n* Learned quite a bit of ASP.NET (MVC, CORE MVC, and some of WebForms) - and learned that I think I like it more than Laravel for PHP (haven't used other PHP frameworks) - also like C# more than PHP.\n* Started building a simple CSS framework for a website I'm working on for my job - it uses the (somewhat) new CSS Grid and some of it is based off of Material Design - @styromaniac ;)\n* Started the creation of a dedicated chromium-based browser for ZeroNet - However, this may be scrapped for another project with the same goal because this one was Windows-only and didn't have Chrome plugins, etc. - got the idea originally from (private) stuff I was working on for my job.\n* A decent Idea for a Website for both Clearnet and ZeroNet - I will probably be working on this soon.",

Or just because I'm mobile focused with ideas and suggestions?\n\nI tagged you partially as a joke because you thought I couldn't write CSS styling. I also tagged you because I am planning on making this framework more mobile friendly than other frameworks (options for bottom nav bars, etc. - CSS Grid makes a bottom nav bar very easy to do - @glightstar).\n\n> I'm getting giddy thinking of the amazing things you're doing.\n\nThanks! Although, I wouldn't say what I'm doing / been doing is the most amazing thing ever.",

The biggest different, I think, is that flexbox only allowed one axis, while css grid allows both x and y. It's a little confusing at first, but once you start playing around with it and seeing for yourself, it becomes clearer how it works. It also has good support for all *modern* browsers (except for Opera Mobile and, of course, IE - IE only supports an older version of it). There might be a polyfill for it though.\n\nI'm going to be taking the CSS code I'm using at work and turning it into a full lightweight CSS (and *maybe* some javascript) framework that will be largely based on Material Design and allow for better mobile experiences (the goal is to be even better than existing frameworks at mobile and easily making your page support mobile). We'll see how it turns out.\n\nI'll post a snippet (later when I get my ZeroNet client running again) of the website I'm working on at work to show how the design is - as it's all made with CSS I wrote. I'll have to blur out parts because I'm supposed to keep stuff I doing for work private (it's proprietary I think it can be considered).",

[...]\n\nOh, sorry, I may not have been clear. CSS Grid isn't the proprietary part. I was meaning parts of the website that I was going to post a screenshot of on here are supposed to be kept private, so I was going to blur those parts out.",

It looks nice, but nothing new. [...]\n\nI've never seen very many things with something like reveal. I think reveal is one of the cooler things in Fluent Design.\nThey also have way more shadowing (more so, or just different, than Material Design I think) and animation it seems, but idk (just going off of the videos since can't see it all in action yet).\n\nAlthough, I do think Fluent Design does have quite a bit of similarities to Material Design (aside from what their \"material\" or whatever looks like, not paper). I think the main thing for me is the reveal, the bigger shadows (it seems) and acrylic all paired together look pretty nice. Also the little effect with the reveal in side navigation menus (and start menu) where the highlighted part kinda pops out a little.",
