I can see in stats some sites hold 10...20 connections opened.\nIf the site has many other peers besides me, i'd prefer to serve it as less as possible.\n- Since it is obvious, sites tend to pile up in users cache, some cleanup function should be added, with logic simple as this: if the site was not requested (remotely or by me) for some time (configurable of course, like a month or year) - delete it, IF there is enough other peers serving it. or any. or do not count this. This function may be triggered once a day and display standart message, saying \"there are some megabytes you may save, press here\" or the like",
