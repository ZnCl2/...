Everything went to shit once corporations brought millions of people in who only care about menial shit like social networks and cat videos. [...]\n\nYeah we don't need to replicate behemoth sites. I feel that Zeronet speaks for itself in providing a rich network of static sites and small communities, just like the internet used to be.\n\nI suspect Zeronet will soon have it's very own \"Eternal September\" it just needs a flashpoint.",

I recon it'll slow down once the 8chan thing simmers down a bit, but yeah it;s gonna keep steadily growing now at a pretty fast rate compared to previously.\n\nI'm more excited about it catching the attention of web developers and webmasters.
