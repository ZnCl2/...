			"body": "I want to share my condolences to all who have read Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis thinking it would be worthy. Well, I saw everyone saying how Kafka's work is strange and awesome and I thought it would have a nice story and a memorable end but it was just a time wasting stuff who made me want to jump out of the first floor window yelling at Jesus to give my time back. I think Franz Kafka did an oopsie. Don't you agree??????",
