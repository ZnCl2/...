			"body": "Hi guys, this was originally posted by me on some subreddits, but it was HEAVILY censored. So I think this is the right place for it.\n\n\nIn most countries of the world, such as those in Europe, the age of consent ranges from 14 to 16 years. Even my country (Italy) is one of those in which it is 14 years old, and in fact here it is very normal to see people in their twenties getting engaged to young people of 16 for example. Nobody complains, it's just normal, as it evidently is in all other nations with a similar age of consent. However, I notice that in the United States this is a big taboo, so much so that when this speech comes out there are people who get really angry thinking about some adult in relation to a minor, and when I happen to be involved in these discussions it happens that people who say this do not even believe that in most of the world it is normal, even when I send them the wikipedia page related to the topic. I think this situation in the United States is stupid and that these people should come out of this sort of glass bell that has been created for absurd reasons that I don't understand. However I understand that if in the United States the age of consent is among the highest in the world then there will be a reason that is bound up in their culture, but I believe that deluding oneself that in all other places in the world is like this too is harmful and disrespectful.\n\nThis post is not about the right age of consent. In fact, I have no interest in thinking about something that I live continuously and that for me and most people in this world is perfectly normal. The post is about the RELATIONSHIP between Americans and the age of consent.",
