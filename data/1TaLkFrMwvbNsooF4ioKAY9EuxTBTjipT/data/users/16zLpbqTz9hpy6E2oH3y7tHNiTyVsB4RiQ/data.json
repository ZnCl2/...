After doing it\n\n- the 3 vertical dot menu in ZeroHello lacks the option Shut down ZeroNet, so I don't know how to quit the program, except by killing its PID;\n- I went to ZeroId to register another name, it was found available but after pressing the button I got no response, the service hang indefinitely.\n\nI'm using ZeroNet from Porteus live Linux. Tor is disabled.\n\nThanks for any answer.",

				"body": "As a non-tech person, ZeroNet is the easiest darknet I managed to install and run -- uncompress the archive, copy its content into a USB key, double click the executable -- but in my opinion it is still a bit too difficult for normal people. In particular, too many things about its inner workings are unknown to an average person, and and can't be known without a specific culture. For instance:\nI run ZeroNet under Windows and continuously received messages about Tor errors, use meek bridges... Uh? And why? Sometimes it worked, sometimes didn't.\nI run it under a Linux live distribution and it works flawlessly, although without Tor that isn't included in the distro.\nI tried it under Tails and it doesn't work. What does Tails have, or lack, compared to the another live distro?\nI created this user. What data have I to backup to be able to write as the same user under another Zeronet install, or recover it in case of failure? I created it without Tor, therefore I must remember this is a public user and to never use it for evil doings :D. This is fine, I'm looking at ZeroNet as a way to host an online community without server costs, and I don't need anonymity. But those who need it?\nAssuming that the public and private key couple has been generated on my machine by my local copy of the ZeroNet script, and the public key communicated to ZeroId, what prevents a modified version of the script to communicate the private key too? Can this happen, or there is some security by design?\nThese are the questions that come to mind to someone who doesn't know how ZeroNet works in details. An average non-technical activist who looks at Zeronet as a tool for anonymous freedom of expression, may ask himself questions like these, and wonder what other issues may exist that he can't even imagine. FUD will discourage him.\n\nHowever I find ZeroNet quite promising, and hope for greater diffusion of this network.",

Some time ago I looked for a certain subdomain @ blogspot.com, wordpress.com and so on, and found a lot of blogs dead around 200X with no content other than a test post. This isn't even squatting.\n\nOn the other side, putting a bot to register a lot of dictionary words or random strings might be a way to saturate ZeroNet preventing it to work. Thus this idea about names is interesting but I see both pros and cons and can't decide if it's good or not.",

Repeat words by yourself following their pronunciation. Choose a topic or channel you are interested in, a song, a film or a documentary you really like, and watch it several times until you have almost memorized most phrases. Then repeat.\n\nFor instance, I like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmtH3nIlELc\nTheir English is easy to understand and now I can follow almost every word without subtitles. Learning to hear you will develop the ability to speak too.",

A - although not immediate - solution might be creating another system, separate from the current one, made by independent institutions. Once you have food, healthcare, housing, instruction, etc. from an independent system you don't need anymore this one.\n\nA way to start it might be factories that make products and provide services for participants. They don't sell to the public, no money involved, no taxes paid. You go there, work enough to earn some credits, that give you a right to products.\nFor instance, you spend a few days looking after a sheep herd, then get some sweaters. Someone else has spent some of his time designing the sweaters, some other into making them... Or, when the structure is more developed, you spend some time after a herd and get a computer.",

Can you tell me where you can read IPs?\nI'd feel more secure if I could run ZeroNet within Tails, where every connection is made through Tor. However, what is encrypted today may be decipherable in some future, and governments probably log every piece of traffic. Thus I wouldn't trust encryption as a means to achieve secrecy (and don't know what to trust).\n\nIMO nofish is simply saying: I provided the basis, now go on.
