Typing `z.net/` prefix on the address bar followed by the ZeroNet address will also redirect.\n\nHere is demo https://i.imgur.com/978JnpS.gifv\n\nI'm fairly new to ZeroNet as a whole so I don't know if the TLDs I supported are the only ones there.

				"body": "> [gitcenter](#comment_1042_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di): Great, this extension looks awesome! I have a few ideas: [...]\n\nOkay I'll add those TLDs, I saw it before but I wasn't sure if the name.yo service was still being kept up to date because I tried registering a domain there and it has been stuck at \"Pending...\" status since yesterday\n\nI orignally wanted to tie it to the `z://` protocol but apparently the extenson API doesn't support custom protocols other than the typical ones (http:, ftp:, mail:, etc) if I wanted to add a custom protocol, it would need to be preceeded by `web+` so for example, `web+z://` which I feel is very unwieldy to type. I made the extension with the goal of making typing ZeroNet addresses on the addressbar easier/faster.\n\nThat's also th case for custom TLDs. If I type `talk.zeronetwork.bit.zeronet/something` in the address bar, it gets automatically converted to a search query, that's why I used a non-existentbut \"valid\" domain `z.net` as prefix because it ending in `.net` makes sure it isn't converted to a search.\n\n> [filips](#comment_204_1LFu1BTScmY82HHtg3TY2jAuSrCYNsQWEY): Great extension. However, there are still some popular ways (actually ideas) how to access ZeroNet domains that aren't included in this extension. It would be good to support them until ZeroNet has standard way for accessing domains. [...]\n\nSee my response to gitcenter above for the probems I can see from that but I'll add them either way\n\n> [kusoneko](#comment_16_16PfVSZrUZuwTgs7wBt1t3ZK9rsvdskoe5): There is a likely issue with using the .bit TLD as the gif shows, the .bit TLD is also usable in clearnet using Namecoin's blockchain as a DNS, instantly redirecting all .bit domains to zeronet's makes reaching the clearnet sites difficult, as in you need to manually go through the blockchain to find the associated IP to visit it as this extension instantly redirects you to the zeronet site if it exists?\n\nIs there an easy way of determining if a `*.bit` domain is in the ZeroNet or in the Namecoin side of things?",

So instead of just typing `blog.zeronetwork.bit`, the user would have to type `blog.zeronetwork.bit.zero` or `blog.zeronetwork.bit.zeronet`. In both cases, the `*.zero` and `*.zeronet` part gets stripped on redirect. This way would give it clear distinction between ZeroNet and non-ZeroNet domains I guess.",

It only seems like an overwhelming amount of data to you because you're one person. Big companies like Google, Facebook, etc have long started developing algorithms to sort all these big data in an easy-to-peruse state. So privacy will only get worse and worse as time goes on if things stay the way they are with regards to people's mindset about them.\n\nIt's true that the average person doesn't matter to the government but with everything moving to systems run by algorithms, it will only get easier and easier to track down a person they're looking for.",
