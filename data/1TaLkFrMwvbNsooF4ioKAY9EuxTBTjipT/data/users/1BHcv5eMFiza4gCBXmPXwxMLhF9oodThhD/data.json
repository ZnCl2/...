If I can remember correctly, it took terabytes of data to train google translate to its accuracy today (actual size could be wrong, bottom line is that our casual home PCs won't be able to handle that much of data). The best solution here is to use translation apis within zites.",

IPFS got a similar treatment, and I believe that its restrictions on zeronet is more of a preventive procedure than an act out of fear. Zeronet never had a big impact in China.  Those who still use it and regularly visit the Chinese forum are mostly spammers, conspiracy believers, and followers of the Fa Lun Gong cult.",
