If you've used Napster, LimeWire, etc then you can basically relive those days with slsk. I've used it to download MANY gigabytes of music and have returned the favor by sharing some stuff I've found IRL. Surprisingly I haven't had letters in the mail from my ISP or anything, so you can probably go without a VPN.\nhttps://www.slsknet.org/news/",
