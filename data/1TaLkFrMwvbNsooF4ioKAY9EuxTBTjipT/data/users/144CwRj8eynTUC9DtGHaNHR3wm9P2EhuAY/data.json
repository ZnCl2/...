There are so many studies suggesting that exercising the sex organs is good for your health, going back to Kinsey, Masters and Johnson etc. Men live shorter lives on average then women, in every country of the world. You are suggesting that increasing daily testosterone levels contributes to health and longevity? It might increase vitality if you define vitality as being an oversexed musclebound meathead with anger management issues. Being addicted to porn might be a problem for some people, but masturbation is not the cause of that addiction. Probably it has to do with a misalignment of a person's sexual triggers and the reality they are living in. Women are consistently driven by emotional ties to people and porn doesn't often excel and portraying emotional ties between actors, thus dramatically fewer women suffer addictions to porn.\n\nwell , we , as men we much like testosterone \nmany studies showed that lower t levels in males causes too many problems , from infertility to anxiety and depression\ni was addicted to porn for some time in my life , and believe me it was horrible , just a few moments of pleasure then it's a living hell\ni suffered from depression for the last 3 or 4 years , since i stopped masturbation since last year , depression is like 80% less , and no suicidal thoughts \nand about being horny and angry , all that disappear after the first few months of abstinence , when i become horny i just go out and clear that energy in cycling or running or any sport i like , and my body automatically gets rid of semen\nmy t levels just skyrocketed since i last measured it , and it gave me a huge boost , my muscle weight and bone weight increased , my sleeping returned normal , my self confidence is very good\ni think that 90% of my problems solved it self when stopped fapping  , and i think it was not by chance",

I find sticky stuff on the hair in the drain when I clean it and it isn't snot. I get sex about every two or three days and it is awesome, he can choose when he ejaculates I think because he doesn't have all that built up sexual need. The end result is that I don't feel like I need to try to hurry my orgasm. I can have it when and where I want to. I doubt many guys who haven't had sex or masturbated for six months or longer could do that. They would expel lots of semen though with lots of sperm in it so if a woman is trying to get pregnant that is a benefit of not masturbating.\n\nlook , i will not argue any further , SEX IS DIFFERENT FROM MASTURBATION\ni have been a regular masturbator and now i stopped , it literally feels like a new life \nif your man is masturbating in a shower then you are ugly enough for him , you have a problem honey",

I just thought it might allow you some freedom to know that there are some pretty well educated people out here who disagree with you, and perhaps convice you to join the vast majority of us who have been masturbating practically since we were born. It feels good, like eating or having a healthy bowel movement.\n\nim sorry if i offended you , i felt stupid after what i wrote , i apologize\nbut you say that you are not a man , so you can't understand what im saying , you will not know what im feeling right now and what i felt back then\nnofap is real , im a doctor and i can tell you that there is some fact to it\nthere is bullshit all over the internet , i know that , but there is a some fact too\nall the benefits of nofap comes from higher dopamine levels and lower prolactin levels  \npeople think that when go on nofap you will become a violent ape that will kill and rape to have sex , it's the complete opposite\ni had some urges for the first few months , but then everything regulated itself",

It says we all derive from one organism - I mean all types of organisms derive from one initial type. Assuming life on Earth started spontaneously as it had special environment in which pure chemistry was able to spontaneously organise into life - having such conditions it's hard to believe only one type of organism appeared. As we believe in power of random actions on each other step of evolution, we should also be ready to accept many different organisms to appear which further were evolving. But theory of evolution explicitly limits this to only one organism - which is just faith of Darwin, not proved science. We have many types of organisms on earth which have it's own trees of evolution. [...]\n\ni believe there is a designer to this universe , maybe is a god , maybe it's not , maybe we are a simulation , maybe it's a simulation inside a simluation :D \ni don't give two fucks\nbut i do believe there is a smart entity who designed this , there is no way it came out of \"quarks and random mutations\"",
