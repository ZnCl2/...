However, english translations of manga are usually done by volunteers, so you may not be able to read the whole manga.",

I am unaware of this website 'indvio.us', as visiting directly reveals nothing and search results come up empty as well. PS: I've updated my comment with what direct download links that I could find to help avoid adverts.\n\nHe typed it incorrectly; the website in question is invidio.us , as in the word \"invidious\". I am not too familiar with the inner workings of the website but it does appear to avoid lots of the YouTube crap that comes along with playing the video on Youtube. Alternatively, you can try FreeTube.\n\nI posted an example link in my comment below.",
