It's stupid to obsess over productivity like a machine when you're a human, to play is part of your nature. I do use consoles since I don't like the idea of using a lot of money on a computer I will use mostly for browsing, if I were to start playing on computers then I would build a PC exclusively for games and windows software like Photoshop leaving the least personal info as possible. I don't like to mix all my stuff in a single device.",
