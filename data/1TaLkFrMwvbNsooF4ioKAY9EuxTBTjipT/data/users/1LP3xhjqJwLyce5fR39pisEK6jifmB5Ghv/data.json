I made one out of aluminium foil the other day and was surprised that it was able to block out wifi and calls from coming through. There are some saying aluminium won't work but i dont think they made it properly. I think you have to fold it neatly and make sure to overlap the seams so its like a large solid envelope. Keep going at it and eventually you'll figure it out. I could have bought special material or a faraday pouch but managed to save money doing it this way. You never know you might lose your bag and there might be shortages in the future, aluminium foil and some tape is much easier to find.",

[...]\n\nLook into what Mao did to the Chinese with the Great Leap Forward.. look at the results of all the Communist policies in the past around the world. Look at whats happening in Tibet. There are many striking similarities with those policies and what is happening currently, and with what they are proposing with the Great Reset.  Could leaders really be so misled or is it all being done on purpose?",
