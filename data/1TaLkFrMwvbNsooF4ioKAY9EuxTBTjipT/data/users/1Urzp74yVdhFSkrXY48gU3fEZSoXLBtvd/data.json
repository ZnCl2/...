I started tor service, and restarted the zeronet server.\nI opened the TBB and accessed the zeronet home from there. I am still getting the same 111 error(connection refused). All the ports are opened on my router.",

At the top, of the zeronet homepage, I see \"port:opened\" ,\"tor:error\" and \"seeders: 10/14\". it is the tor:error part that is bugging me. Online, people don't seem to be having this problem.",
