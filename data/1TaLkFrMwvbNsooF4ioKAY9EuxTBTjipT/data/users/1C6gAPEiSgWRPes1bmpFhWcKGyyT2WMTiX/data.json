We now have a LOT of information about methods the NSA uses to compromise commercial encryption software.  The bottom line is that just because development of a software package is ongoing does NOT mean that it is more secure than Truecrypt, because the NSA injects NEW compromises into code when the old ones are detected and corrected. [...]\n\nActually it means that.\nVeraCrypt is safer than TrueCrypt because it have less security issues.\nVeraCrypt fixed lots of known security problems witch still exist on TrueCrypt and not only NSA, anybody can use them to attack to you.\n\nFor example:\nVeraCrypt is secure from \"cold boot attack\" but TrueCrypt is not.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeraCrypt#Security_improvements",

A cold boot attack works because of hardware issues, not software.  And it only works when the attacker has physical access to a running computer or a computer that has been shut down just seconds before and still holds data in RAM. [...]\n\nIf NSA cannot crack the TruCrypt they should not be able to crack VeraCrypt.\nVeraCrypt uses safer encryption algorithms.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeraCrypt#Algorithms\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#Algorithms",
