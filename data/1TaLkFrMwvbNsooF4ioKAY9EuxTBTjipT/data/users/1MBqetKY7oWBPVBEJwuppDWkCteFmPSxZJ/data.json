Most recently the Chinese have been doing it to Tibetans. Faking vaccines to sterilize the population isn't anything new at least.  I'm willing to look into what seems to be the unbelievable these days since every so called \"conspiracy theory\" I've come across throughout the years have turned out to be true. Maybe we are just getting old, what we used to think of as sci-fi is quickly becoming reality and it makes it harder for us to take it seriously.",

If someone is doing a massive effort to get rid of an opinion that is just telling us their is something to hide and they are desperate/afraid of consequences when it gets looked into.",
