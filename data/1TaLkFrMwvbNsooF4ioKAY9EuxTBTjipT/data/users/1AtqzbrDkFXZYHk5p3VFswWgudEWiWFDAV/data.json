The Archive is from 2017 but the things contained in it are not too outdated but I must warn you reading it all will change your whole perspective on hackers on the darknet. \nLink: \n[English] http://127.0.0.1:43110/1N3czExZrrbynRMciezqK9E6LDRYquCdo2/\n\nIf you any suggestions, translations, bugs, etc... either email me at holy.nomad@zeromail.bit or post a comment.\n\nEdit: If anything pop up and says escaping from iframe just go back and reload the webpage and it should load.\n\n- I'm not affiliated with aediot in anyway and am not responsible for any damage caused by the knowledge provided. \n\nPeace.",
