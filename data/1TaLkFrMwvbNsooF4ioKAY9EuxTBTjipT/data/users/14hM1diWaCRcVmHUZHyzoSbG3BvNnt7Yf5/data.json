Something is wrong when years old zeronet project has 16K stars, 838 watches and just a single developer. The most important is that new project developer count increase, reported issues are fixed.",

Overpriced, but i do not want to wait 2 years and polute my environment by several HDDs noise... :-/ (not yet found time to research and come with some really good sound dampening solution, that would at same time allow airflow/cooling)\nAnother solution is to rent the server, quite easy and no noise + possibly more privacy and less bandwidth from home. @styromaniac",
