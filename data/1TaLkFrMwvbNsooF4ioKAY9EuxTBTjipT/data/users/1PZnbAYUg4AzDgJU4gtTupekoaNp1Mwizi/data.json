			"body": "I've noticed that when I put an upload on KopyKate that I won't even be able to access my own content.\nThankfully there is a solution I've found that works.\n\nYou're going to need the following things:\n•The big.kopykate.bit's current address (18Pfr2oswXvD352BbJvo59gZ3GbdbipSzh at time of writing)\n•The user folder under the certificate you uploaded the video with\n•The filename of the video that KopyKate has saved\n\nGo to the page of the video that you posted (I did this by going to \"airing now\") and then right-click \"copy video location\".\nThat will give you your user folder and the filename of the video.\n\nThen you simply copy the video to: \n{ZeroNetHome}/data/{KopyKate's Address}/users/{your user folder}/{video filename}.mp4/webm/whatever\n\nThis is where it gets fuzzy, but I'm very sure you only need to refresh the page to fix it, however I believe commenting allows is to properly show 1/1 peers when you're viewing your own fresh video.\n\nI just figured I would write this up in case anyone was having any trouble putting their videos on KopyKate because I see many videos with 0/0 peers.",

However it keeps putting zeronet data in internal storage/android rather than external storage/android.\nI have a pretty large sd card so it would be much more useful if I could configure mobile zeronet to work with the SD card.\n\n\n\nUser experience otherwise is pretty good, once things are mostly downloaded it works very well. I was impressed that you could update zeronet once installed.",
