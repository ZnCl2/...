			"title": "John F. Kennedy on secrecy, secret societies and its imminent danger [1961]",
			"body": "> [6:36] The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.\n---\n> [8:47] Today no war has been declared — and however fierce the struggle may be, it may never be declared in the traditional fashion. Our way of life is under attack. Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe. The survival of our friends is in danger. And yet no war has been declared, no borders have been crossed by marching troops, no missiles have been fired.\n---\n> [9:18] If the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self-discipline of combat conditions, then I can only say that no war ever posed a greater threat to our security. If you are awaiting a finding of \"clear and present danger,\" then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent.\n---\n> [9:42] It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics, a change in missions — by the government, by the people, by every businessman or labor leader, and by every newspaper. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence — on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.\n---\n**John F.

			"title": "Woodrow Wilson on the control of the United States and its credit [1913] [updated]",
			"body": "*Updated to add this first quote:*\n>Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, **are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.**\n---\n>We must take the selection of candidates for office, for example, out of the hands of **small groups of men**, of little coteries, out of the hands of machines working behind **closed doors.**\n---\n>However it has come about, it is more important still that the **control of credit also has become dangerously centralized.** It is the mere truth to say that the financial resources of the country are not at the command of those who do not submit to the direction and domination of **small groups of capitalists** who wish to keep the economic development of the country under their own eye and guidance. **The great monopoly in this country is the monopoly of big credits.** So long as that exists, our old variety and freedom and individual energy of development are out of the question. A great industrial nation is **controlled by its system of credit.** Our system of credit is **privately concentrated.** The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are **in the hands of a few men**\n---\n>This money trust, or, as it should be more properly called, this credit trust, of which Congress has begun an investigation, is no myth;\n---\n>We have restricted credit, we have restricted opportunity, we have controlled development, and we have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most **completely controlled and dominated**, governments in the civilized world—no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and the duress of **small groups of dominant men.**\n---\n**Woodrow Wilson, 28th US President**, 1913, The New Freedom\n`www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14811`",

I mean how could you after knowing about the dangers of centralization of credit and power, sign it? I think he wrote this book knowing that he had to sign it, as a warning (just guessing here). I mean this book is published the same year he signed the Act ...",
