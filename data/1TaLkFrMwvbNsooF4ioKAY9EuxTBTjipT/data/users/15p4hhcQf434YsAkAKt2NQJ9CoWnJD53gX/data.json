Debian.\n\nFirefox for some applications with ::\n- Ublock \n- Decentraleyes \n- Dat P2P Protocol \n- NoScript Security Suite \n\nHonestly, I read contradictory post about extension usage.\nExtensions also leave traces. The less the better is also claimed.\n\nBeaker browser. \nSurf and Share :dat//urls. Host in a view steps a local website or share files. Not anonymous.\nWith some tricks the dat//url can be translated to https. Interesting browser.\n\nWith Dat-fox extension for FF you don't need beaker-browser to visit dat//sites.\n\nQutebrowser using under a shortcut for Deepl translations. (secure translation )\nQutebrowser is keyboard oriented. GG services are banned since 2019.",
