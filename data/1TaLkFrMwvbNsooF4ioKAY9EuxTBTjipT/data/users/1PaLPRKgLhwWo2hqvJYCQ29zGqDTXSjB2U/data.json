			"body": "I set up a mini photo site from my computer, then allowed the router to see that site such that I can see the server from my computer by going to my ISP designated IP. But when I try to get to the address from my phone by disconnecting wifi and going to 4G, it just keeps spinning without ever loading. SO that means only Zeronet users can see Zeronet websites?? if not, then how can I get there?",
