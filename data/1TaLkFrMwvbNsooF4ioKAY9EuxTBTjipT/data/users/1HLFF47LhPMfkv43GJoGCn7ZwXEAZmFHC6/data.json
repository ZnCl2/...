				"body": "The Zeitgeist Movement had some ties with The Venus Project but they split apart some time ago. I'd say Zeitgeist would be more controversial today then The Venus Project. The simple reason for that is TZM challenges the status quo in ways Venus does not. \n\nMy opinion of human survival is that we first need to decide if humans belong to the Earth or if the Earth belongs to humans. I don't think there will be a successful outcome if we decide the Earth belongs to humans.\n\nI found 3 fascinating books that deals with this issue of human roles on Earth. These books do not offer solutions. \n\nBest read in this order but not necessary really. Ishmael, My Ishmael and The Story of B. By Daniel Quinn.",
