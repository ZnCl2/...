So here's a recap of the current situation, followed by a proposal for improvement for 0net sites with user-generated content (e.g. ZeroTalk, ZeroMe, blog comments) that I feel would really help new users like me.\n\n## Current\n+ The idea of \"space\" (i.e. limits for user-generated content on a site) is never really explained anywhere in ZeroNet documentation or on the sites themselves (as far as I can tell).\n+ There is some tiny text (\"USED...\") near comment boxes that gives unexplained info.\n+ That tiny text then gives a hint at the issue... ***if*** you happen to mouse over it.\n+ The error messages when a user hits their limit are meaningless *and* contradictory.\n> **! Content signing failed**.\n> Include too large 6510676B >2000000B\n\nand\n\n> **¡ File upload success**\n\nSo... success? or failure? Which is it??? And \"Include too large\" is some kind of Google Translate error. And, in contrast to everywhere else on 0net, these messages uses bytes in huge strings of digits.\n\n## Proposal\n+ Post a brief explanation of space limits for user-generated content in the ZeroNet documentation (and elsewhere, e.g. wiki).\n+ The presence of mouseover text by \"USED...\" should indicated by some kind of text or symbol, e.g. a coloured question mark, or \"Info\".\n+ When a person posts something (or does anything that uses up their allowed space), show a popup message when they click \"Submit/Upload/Post\":\n> *All your topics, comments, votes and uploads here deduct from your total space on this site, which is [...KB].*\n\nAnd provide a checkbox:\n> *Do not show this message again.*\n\n+ When a person goes over their limit for a site, error messages needs to:\n++ be meaningful not only to the developer but to the person directly affected, i.e. the user\n++ not contradict each other\n++ give the user an idea how to proceed\n\nE.g.\n\n> **!

These posts contain several large images (each all-in-one html file is between 2.5MB and 4.5MB) and the total is always increasing (new post every day); this folder is currently at 193MB after only 6 weeks of posts.\n\nBecause of those factors, I made the files optional (by putting the files in a folder called **/data/papers** and making that folder optional in my blog's **content.json**). I think making the files non-optional would not be ideal, as first time visitors would be confronted with a demand for a huge amount of space, and and existing peers would be nagged with constant requests to increase site size limit as the archive grows.\n\nBut now visitors are having difficulty getting the files (\"`download failed`\"), even though I'm online 24/7 (port opened, Tor available, connected to multiple trackers).\n\nAnother issue, maybe related: visitors can't make comments on the blog, getting `File write error: [object Object]`. When I try to post a comment, I get `Content publish failed`.\n\nAny ideas / suggestions how to deal with these issues? Thanks.",

It has the capability, once you double-click on a search result, to query DHT and find out how many seeds and peers it has. (It might take a minute or two to get results.)\n* https://www.offlinebay.com/\n* https://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Release-OfflineBay-v2-Open-source-and-No-more-Java-dependency\n\nVersion 2.x of OfflineBay is even built as an Electron app, which from my minimal (mis)understanding, is something that might be portable to a ZeroNet zite (at least in my fantasy!)\n\nAlso I've been wondering if a [Bitzi Bitpedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitzi) datadump might be handy for providing a lot of **non**-BitTorrent-specific (neutral?) metadata for files, useful for other forms of filesharing (maybe even IPFS/IFS on 0net?).

(In Shareaza, from a G2 source).

Maybe \"**ZeroNet menu**\".\n* #5: \"ZeroHello newsfeed content type switcher\" is definitely accurate, but maybe could be shortened. E.g. \"ZeroHello newsfeed tabs\"?\n* #8: It's sort of a \"Site\" and/or \"Home\" button and isn't, simultaneously. Dragging it left reveals a panel of info about the site, so \"Site button\". But clicking on it takes you to ZeroHello, so sort of \"Home button\". I wonder if there's a name that could cover both concepts, or is more neutral. The \"ZeroNet button\"??\n* #10: \"Publishing failed files\". So **that's** what the little bell means! Thanks!\n* Giving #1 & #13 the same name could be problematic. E.g. \"Click the ZeroHello menu to see the ZeroHello menu.\"\n* #14 My working title so far is \"Site panel\" as it displays a lot of info about the zite as well as offering some actions. Perhaps an alternative to \"Lateral Bar\" could be \"Sidebar\".\n\n---\n@quantumworld: I did look around on the wiki, including going through the Index but I had no luck.

Making a note of all these ideas.\n\nHere's some more info re the issues you've all raised.\n\n### HARDWARE:\n* My computer's an all-in-one, so no room for more internal HDDs. And the USB ports are 2.0, I believe, not sure if that affects using an external drive on a regular basis or for an OS.\n* RAM: 8GB, \"7,100 megabytes usable memory\"\n* I also have an external USB hard drive (1TB, about 10 years old) which I use as media storage and half-assed backup but only very occasionally connect and turn on. I don't think I want to leave it connected and turned on all the time. *Might* consider getting another external hdd (a small solid state one? or just an SD card?) if it's absolutely necessary.\n* Just remembered: with keyboard, mouse, lapboard, wireless headset taking up all my USB ports, that's another reason why I barely plug in the external HDD. Past experience of USB hubs not positive, but maybe I just had a crappy model.\n\n### USAGE:\n* Just a home PC: Web browsing, streaming media, 24/7 BitTorrent filesharing (shared files currently taking up several hundred gigs of space), office document work, and a little light (low spec) gaming. And now 0net too, running 24/7.\n* I expect once I get a Linux installed and tweaked that I will probably use that all the time, with Windows still installed \"just in case\". (And I paid for Windows so I don't want to throw it away just yet.)\n* Maybe some distrohopping in addition to installed Linux, but I can probably do that via Live USB.",

				"body": "TLDR:\n+ For translating files, have a look at https://www.matecat.com/ , which is online but also offers [self-installation](https://www.matecat.com/installation-guide/). See also [Getting Started with MateCat](https://www.matecat.com/support/introducing-matecat/getting-started-matecat/) and the [FAQ](https://www.matecat.com/faq/).\n+ For inputting text snippets (like Google Translate), have a look at http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Apertium_Simpleton_UI or regular [Apertium](http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Installation) (but be careful about [the language pairings available](http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/List_of_language_pairs) e.g. it seems it can translate between English and Kazakh but not directly between English and French). (For an online experience with Apertium, forget the official online test drive and try https://apertiumtrad.tuxfamily.org/ and choose \"Text Translation\" which allows you choose a bridge language to expand the translation possibilities, e.g. English to Spanish to French.)\n\n---\nI offer here some more of the technical jargon & info, which might help in searches on the subject.\n\nIn language and translation, those kinds of databases are called ***corpora*** (plural) / ***corpus*** (singular), and a pair of cross-referenced corpora are called parallel corpora (and multiply for every combination of languages conceivable). E.g. one parallel corpus for Greek and Latin and Hebrew (for, say, biblical scholarship), a different one for English and Greek, yet another for English and Latin etc.\n\n+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus\n+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpora_in_Translation_Studies\n+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_text\n\nIIRC the EU (which needs to produce documents in all official languages) is a major source of parallel corpora and translations memories based on them. I believe those are mainly useful for assisting human translators (i.e. computer-assisted translation) translate documents, but I'm guessing from your link that you're looking for quick full machine translation of text snippets like Google Translate.\n\nNOTE 1: Downloading the corpora & other files for every single language (***and*** every single possible language pairing) out there would be a massive undertaking, so you would probably need to narrow your search down to the specific languages (& language pairings) you need.\nNOTE 2: Sometimes you might have to choose a ***bridge language***. I.e. To get from language A to language B, the software might have to go through language C. E.g. at [this online instance of Apertium](https://apertiumtrad.tuxfamily.org/tradtexte.php), to translate from English to French (for which [Apertium](https://github.com/apertium/apertium) does not have a completed validated pairing yet), you have to choose either Spanish or Catalan as a bridge language to get a result.\nNOTE 3: the language pairings are not always bidirectional: sometimes a corpus or machine translation engine is suitable for translating from language A to language B, but not for going from language B to Language A.\n\nIt seems there is at least one open source machine translation engine & service mainly based on EU corpora, but also providing a few pairings between English and non-EU languages.\n+ https://www.modernmt.eu/\n+ https://github.com/ModernMT/MMT\n+ https://github.com/ModernMT/MMT/wiki\n\nIt seems more like an advanced CAT (a tool to aid someone who knows both the source and target languages), but I'm not sure. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGUqGddCZGI) implies that ModernMT can be used as a backend MT engine inside other tools like **MateCat** which is an open source CAT web application that helps you translate document files (e.g. .docx) that offers two possibilities:\n1. use their hosted online MateCat service at https://www.matecat.com/ (which offers a confidential option)(choosing ModernMT as an engine there requires payment, but there are other possibilities, e.g. your own TM)\n2. [install your own MateCat instance on your computer](https://www.matecat.com/installation-guide/) along with your own instance of an MT engine or **TM** (translation memory), like your own free installation of ModernMT\n\nFor the hosted online service, see [Getting Started with MateCat](https://www.matecat.com/support/introducing-matecat/getting-started-matecat/).\n> MateCat already provides matches from a public translation memory with over 12 billion words and free machine translation. You can also create private translation memories for better reuse of your translations and for confidential projects (click on Settings to add your personal TM).\n\nFrom the [FAQ](https://www.matecat.com/faq/) for their online service:\n> **How private are my translations and translation memories?**\n> To guarantee the confidentiality of your translations, use a private TM when creating your project in MateCat, and make sure that the “Update” checkbox closed to the private TM key  is selected. In doing so you can be safe that your translated segments are stored only inside your private TM. Only the person who has created the private TM has access to it (the “owner”) and its content will not be shared with anyone else as opposed to the public TM which is available to all MateCat users. There will still be suggestions from the public TM, but your segments will not be saved in it.",

Nofish (who runs the most common zerome hubs) along with whoever made zerotorrent, had set the post limits to be very low. So you basically have to go beg them for more space or delete your old posts. There's no way to have limits automatically raise for active users, nor to set an unlimited space. Which is why hub designs work best, along with high limits. ZeroTorrent is dead and has had this problem for a while with some active uploaders. [...]\n\nI'm now beginning to understand this. But my main frustration is that *none of this is ever made clear to users in advance*. If there was at least a sentence of info about this, users like me would not find out the hard and confusing way, and could maybe even avoid the problem in the first place.",

The way to get your limit raised is by tagging him in a request on ZeroMe, which is explained nowhere. Other zites don't even offer that much.)\n\n(Example of good choice by admin: KopyKate gives an understandable and useful message if you try to upload a thumbnail that's too big.)\n\nIdeally zites should have built-in a more automated way both for users to request more space and admins to grant it. E.g.\n1. Zite automatically warns user approaching space limit and offers button to request more.\n2. User clicks button and zite admin gets notification.\n3. Admin decides whether to grant request.\n4. If so, admin sets new limit & clicks button.\n5. User gets notification of request response (e.g. request approved, new limit is Xkb).\n\nAll in a GUI, hopefully :)\n\nThanks for explaining what's behind the contradictory messages.",

You just dragged a file onto Bitcollider, which then automatically extracted / produced a range of metadata: file size, resolution, bitrate etc as well as various checksums (inc. P2P-specific ones, if you had those apps installed).\n2. Bitcollider then automatically opened a Bitpedia submission page in your browser, with fields like File Name and metadata already filled in.\n3. Users could add a little more, like a quality rating out of 10, tags, then click submit. The file then got its own page on Bitpedia with all the info, checksums and clickable links (Magnet, ed2k etc).\n\nIt was quick and easy. Bitcollider doesn't work any more, of course, as the Bitpedia website no longer exists, but if something like that could be made for a database on Zeronet (even hacking original BitCollider), that would be great. I was even wondering if using a [Bitzi datadump](https://old.datahub.io/dataset/bitzi) to \"kickstart\" / populate a hash database here on Zeronet would be useful, so that it wouldn't start off empty. But people would probably be pissed off if there were loads of hashes for files that simply weren't available on Zeronet.\n\nBy the way, [here's an example from the old Bitpedia I tried out a month ago](http://web.archive.org/web/20130913032141/http://bitzi.com:80/lookup/ADE2HDOI75PZB2NR6CVB7BEJJL4C37TW\n) to see what would happen and:\n+ Good news: The file *Transformers[2007]DvDrip[Eng]-aXXo.avi* started downloading almost immediately, so this still works!\n+ Bad news: The file *Transformers[2007]DvDrip[Eng]-aXXo.avi* started downloading almost immediately, so... I was getting a really crappy movie! :)\n\nI had to use Shareaza, which found a source on its own G2 (Gnutella 2) p2p filesharing network.

In order to let us do research studies, we have developed a system called Normandy which lets us serve SAOs to Firefox users. Those SAOs automatically execute on the user’s browser and while they are usually used for running experiments, they also have extensive access to Firefox internal APIs. Important for this case, they can add new certificates to the certificate database that Firefox uses to verify add-ons.*\n\n> \n> I’m not alleging any malicious intent here, but I’m bothered by some of the political and corporate hypocrisy. Consider that mozilla’s chief legal and business officer has previously said this about backdoors:\n\n> http://time.com/4263121/apple-fbi-backdoor/\n\n> > *We also need to understand that any backdoors that companies are asked to build are doors that can be opened, not just by law enforcement, but by others that want to do harm roaming the Web.*\n\n> \n> There is just no “safe” backdoor. You are either safe or you are not.\n\n> If they want to defend their backdoor (which has much deeper local access than a regular extension) as a useful tool for legitimate functions, I’ll begrudgingly say I understand their reasoning. If they want to say there is no safe backdoor, I can understand that too. However the hypocrisy is what I don’t have much tolerance for. On the one hand they tell owners we can no longer install our own extensions for our own safety, and yet on the other hand they wrote their own remote access backdoors for our machines.\n\n> I’ll give them the benefit of doubt regarding non-malicious intent, but why should they be entitled to higher access than the owners? And why, if they are so concerned about iphone backdoors being accessed by court mandate, do they place their own users at risk through their own low level backdoors? It’s do as we say, not as we do.\n\n> Sorry about the rant, I’m just venting some of my frustrations.",

(And I'm not sure but maybe if you are connected to Tracker A only and someone else is connected to Tracker B only, then you can't see each other; I believe you have to have a tracker in common.)\n\nZeroNet comes with a short list of trackers built-in, but some people have made longer, regularly-updated lists with more trackers. Some of these lists are made by Chinese ZeroNet users, I believe because the Chinese government blocks the addresses of known trackers, so Chinese ZeroNet users need these updating lists with additional trackers, with changing addresses, to avoid being blocked. (Using one of these lists involves trusting the producer of the list.)\n\nThere was a post on ZeroMe, in English and Chinese, with the address of one of these updating lists and the instructions for using it. I followed the instructions and now I have a lot more trackers to connect to (currently my ZeroHello reports: ***TRACKERS: 52/68***). And because I guess a lot of other people using this list and connecting to the trackers in it are in China (who are blocked from the regular trackers), I suppose I see a lot more peers in China than you.\n\nIf you're interested in this using this list, I'm afraid I can't find the ZeroMe post (I believe I found it via a different post by user @ssdifnskdjfnsdjk: ) and I can't remember the exact instructions but the following *might* work.\n\n1. Visit [BT高清电影网](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1JuwWYEgApiBVNyGxhvNYyohsv4YMtxy7M) (this is a Chinese ZeroNet site for BitTorrent sharing which also produces the tracker list). Visiting it will make you a peer of this site, allowing you to access its content, including the tracker list.\n2. In [ZeroHello](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D/), go to the three-dot menu and select ***Configuration***.\n3. In the section ***Tracker files***, add the following:\n`data/1JuwWYEgApiBVNyGxhvNYyohsv4YMtxy7M/trackers_all.txt`\n4. In the section ***Proxy for tracker connections***, select `Disable`.\n\nEvery now and then, at least for the first few weeks after doing this, I'd would find it impossible to browse ZeroNet. So I would check ***ZeroHello > Configuration*** and find that ***Proxy for tracker connections*** was on `Tor`. I would set it back to `Disable` and then everything would work fine again.\n\nJust in case, I'll give a couple other of my settings in ***ZeroHello > Configuration*** (I can't remember if they're relevant or not):\n+ ***Tor***: Enable\n+ ***Use Tor bridges***: On",

				"body": "@xcape2net:\nI am not an expert :) so be careful about anything I say here.\n+ Tracker number: My guess is that the second number is the total number of active trackers my peer is aware of, thanks mainly to the tracker list I use.\n+ File server port: sorry, I don't know.\n+ Master list: if anyone can download and run the tracker software (and modify it even, as it's open source), then a complete master list might not be possible. I guess the closest we can come are these updated user-created lists like the one I'm using.\n+ P2P: Like BitTorrent (which it's based on) ZeroNet ***is*** peer-to-peer, in the sense that the content (zites, images, videos etc) travels directly between peers and ***not*** up to/down from servers. But it's not a ***fully  decentralized*** peer-to-peer network, because (like original BitTorrent) it still requires trackers in order for peers to find each other and their content.\nPeople often suggest using a [Distributed Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) (DHT) instead of trackers, just like BitTorrent now also has. But I believe there's a complication: hashes are good for locating ***unchanging*** content (e.g. a video published on ZeroNet or shared on BitTorrent) but not necessarily for ***changing*** content (e.g. a website on ZeroNet whose articles are edited/updated). When the content changes, the hash changes, rendering the hash in the DHT useless. I believe a practical, fully-decentralized solution for finding ***changing*** content via something like DHT still needs to be found and/or implemented.\nI'm not sure but this issue of depending on trackers vs. DHT might be addressed in the upcoming version of ZeroNet created with the Python3 programming language, which will allow new features compared to the current version of ZeroNet built in Python2. Hopefully someone who knows more can answer that.",
