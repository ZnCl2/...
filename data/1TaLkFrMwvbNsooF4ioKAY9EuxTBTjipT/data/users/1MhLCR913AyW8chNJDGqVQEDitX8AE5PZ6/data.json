But isn't it odd how it's easy to breed whiteness out of someone, yet for hundreds of thousands of years there's been tons of white people?\n\nIt is indeed strange and sad in my opinion how easy it is to breed out European ancestry, what you call \"whiteness\". I think it is irreversible ... or it will take many thousands if not millions of years if you don't artificially try to re-create an European.\n\nThat first quote is from 1925 from Mr. Coudenhove-Kalergi by the way, a mixed-race person himself and the founder and president for 49 years of the Paneuropean Union, the precursor to the European Union.\n\n>There's no \"correct\" way of being human\n\nAgreed. No group should be targeted genocide.",

The rules the big governments or companies are setting are purposely vague so they can target whatever they deem worthy to be taken down.",
