				"body": "RT (Russia Today) is Russian troll fabric. Do not waist your time for promoting its shit here. Putin is a Leningrad gang. Nobody cares what gang thinks about his civilized opponents. I would prefer to find other sources if I wanted to now about US government, not RT, North Korea, Asad, or other pieces of shit. Don't talk about Russian government. There is no election in Russia therefore there's no legitimate government. The only interest of this 'government' is to steel more money and share them with there gang leader Putin. They do not love any country that respects law and justice. They can't. They will search for reason for conflict with them. If there were justice, not 'lack of democracy' in Russia, all your RT, 'government', and Mr. Putin would be in jail. Russia is aggressive, rotten country, trying to impose its illness to all world.",

				"body": "Sorry for triple post... That's my error, not intended. \n I do not find it strange that USA gov hates RT. I do dare to say I now such people that create RT, support Putins politics quite well. RT is not about news, information, opinion. It is about propaganda and manipulation.\n If you think it is normal to store rat poison in the same shelf as chocolate, you can say that RT is news service than. \nI do understand that information is often depending on views of journalist, but this isn't a case. A total infrastructure is organized intentionally to make people believe in things, that is known to be lie. Why I say that? My knowledge about    Putins propaganda is not based on any kind of media information. \n When you lie, you say info about one kind of people or country to another hoping that the first one will never know what was said. I am that one who knows what is being said about my country, in RT. Most people do not take interest what kind of information is spread in another continent in another language. That people is the target of lairs agency RT.\nIt is the same as trying to get news about USA from ISIS. It is even hard to explain briefly why it would be stupid, but it would, even if you do not like USA gov.",
