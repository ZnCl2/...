				"body": "Far right sucks, so does far left. Difference is everyone knows the far right is a joke, literally nobody takes them seriously. The idea of there being a superior race has been destroyed thoroughly.\nNot near as many regard the far left as being a joke or dangerous. The ideas are more palatable, who wouldn't want more \"equality\" or even \"equity\"???! Unless you're very wealthy AND greedy as shit, you probably believe there needs to be as much equal opportunity as possible, possibly even more equitable outcomes. The problems start to arise when figuring out the details of how exactly things are made more equal. Ultimately it's just people doing the equalizing, and they'll need lots of power to do so. Unless the people doing so are perfectly honest, fair, etc the outcomes actually become more unfair than they start as, basically because power corrupts. Maybe if there was some way to ensure the ones making decisions to equalize all the outcomes were verifiably transparent every step of the way we could have true \"equity\"...\nEven if that's the way it's portrayed, how does the average Joe verify that things are truly transparent, instead of just appearing so? Can you really trust the \"experts\" to tell you the truth? I think that's at the heart of the divide right now, can you trust a story/narrative simply because it's told on all the legacy media? Can you trust a narrative simply because it's told by the guy you like aka Trump? Or just because all the new media, like on LBRY/Odysee, agree? IS ANYONE able to be trusted? If so, WHY?",

Just let mega businesses consolidate their power and collude to restrict people's freedom, that way nobody can say the government is oppressing you. It's really ironic too because the same fuckwits who make the argument of \"big tech can restrict the flow of information because they're a private company\" lose their shit when they hear about a catholic bakery that won't serve gay wedding cakes or when chick fil a said they don't want to serve openly gay people\n\nIt's simply about power to them. Power is their principles, nothing else.",

I would just add that becoming self-sufficient can be a method of alternative currency, lessening dependency on, and support of, the central banking cartel. There's an excellent video out there called something like \"Seeds are the Currency of the Future\" or something like that by Matt Powers.",
