				"body": "that's good advice....and I'm assuming since you've commented this that a lot of other hardening hasn't been done, like isolating your server via subnet and using port knocking across a jump server to access the ssh server via a static route or at LEAST setting the listen port to some random high port number (under 65535 smh) in sshd_config so that the script kiddies aren't filling your logs with dictionary-based brute attacks....there's also some older methods of hardening that still work out ok like using fail2ban to automatically ban IP's for a limited amount of time after a predefined number of unsuccessful login attempts....also a good idea to set the options for AllowUsers *@123.456.789.012 (if you've got a static IP) or AllowUsers *@123.456.789.* if you've got DHCP assigned addresses from your ISP- usually they assign within the same block, so just take a look at logs or even ask them but I'd say normally the last octet is good enough for isolating the allowed IP's to a max of 254 possible addresses (assuming same subnet) and limiting the possible exposure surface of your server if you can't isolate the server from direct outside access and use a jump server via ssh tunnel to access. This is my preferred method of access- ssh tunnel across a jump server along with a port knocking script that specifies a series of knocks on a certain sequence of ports before the service listening port becomes accessible...This can be run from the sshd serving machine and/or the jump server....I think it's simpler to initiate the ssh tunnel across the jump server and use a bash connection script to trigger a port knocking script on the jump server that will initiate the knocking sequence against your sshd server that ends in it opening the port that sshd is listening on....You'll find plenty of tutorials online about this method, and it can be scripted to become very complex, the result of which makes your ssh server damn tough to access and impossible to sniff out using your standing tools, nmap/pcap-burp suite-etc....the port knocking script has way too many possible combinations of port number, number of knocks, and sequence to make figuring out the combination even remotely possible....the only thing I could see that would be a possible vuln to this setup would be if an attacker were using wireshark to listen in on all the packets coming into your jump server....but even IF they could find the port knocking \"key\" using this method, they would STILL need to know the subnet AND IP of the sshd server on the other side of the jump server, and if you don't keep any scripts ON the jump server pointing to this info and you're diligent about clearing your logs then it should be a challenge to say the least to figure that out even should the jump server become compromised....at minimum an attacker would need to breach the jump server and either wait around for a user to make a connection or use a C2 framework like CobaltStrike or Ninja C2 or similar active intrusion platform to hang around and monitor the server until a connection is made........",
