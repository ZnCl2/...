If I'm not mistaken, the US also created democracies in Congo, Guatemala, and Brazil.  But it's hard to say, since the history books are written by the winners of wars.  Also, there are no pure democracies anywhere in the world.  So, on that basis, you could argue that the US has never overthrown a democracy.\n\nIf they did indeed overthrew the communist government in Chile, then Thank You.",
