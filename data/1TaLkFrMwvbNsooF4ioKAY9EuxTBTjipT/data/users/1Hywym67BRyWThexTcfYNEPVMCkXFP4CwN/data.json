				"body": "Ok OP, i'll bite. The TL;DR to your question is to watch HG Tudor on YouTube, he will show u da wey. As for my blogpoast:\n\n8 Months ago I left a job where I was constantly harassed by a covert malignant narcissist, who was most likely a sociopath, let's call him Herschel. He did all the vampiric, boundary breaking, sanity eroding bullshit you could think of, all because I wanted to keep my nuts and not kiss the ground he walked on like everybody else did. And the fact that I couldn't immediately leave my job or take it to HR (because most of the faggotry they do is plausibly deniable), meant that I had to find a way to survive and thrive in the bullshit. Herschel basically looked like the spitting image of Nosferatu minus the teeth, but apparently he was so well liked that nobody noticed his more (((special))) features. In the 2 months leading up to the day I left, everyone in my office was informed that they were being laid off because of \"\"\"company downsizing.\"\"\" The fact that I would never have to see that piece of shit again was a godsend in disguise. On the final day of the job, I was finishing wrapping up the last of my belongings. I told myself that if Herschel tries to come up to me to try his faggotry just one last time, just to see if I'll give him the reaction he wants, I'm going to tell him the LAST THING his kind ever wants to hear. Lo and behold, the faggot shows up. With a shit-eating grin. \n\nWe were alone at the time. He walks up to me and says, \"Well, that was a fun time while it lasted, no hard feelings though right?\" He holds out his hand to shake, the shit-eating grin now turned into a sadistic smile (if you haven't seen one before, trust me, you'll know it when you see it). I stare at his hand and then back at him in total deadpan silence. \"Ohhh...so you don't shake huh?\" he says withdrawing his hand. I let him have it. \"Herschel is big on emotion, but low on substance,\" said with as little emotional delivery as possible. His pale skin turned beet red. He staggers back 5 feet as though he is about to suffer a stroke, \"W-What?!\". They best way I can describe his face is that he looked as though he had seen a ghost, as though he wanted to say \"I've been found out!\" I waited 5 seconds for him to say something. He said nothing so I started walking out of the door. As I'm about to enter the hallway, he shouts behind me \"A-a-assholes come from all w-walks of life!!! T-t-that's just y-your opinion!!!\" I ignore him and walk straight to the break room where I can get a drink. 20 Seconds later he barges into the breakroom and yells the SAME FUCKING THING AS BEFORE. \"A-a-assholes come from all w-walks of life!!! T-t-that's just y-your opinion!!!\" He suddenly looks to his left and sees 5 of the coworkers he build relationships with over the course of 11 years just stare at him like he's autistic. He leave the room even redder then he came in. I walk to the entrance and one of them say's \"Was he talking to you?\" I respond \"I have no clue tbh\" \"OMG I thought he was a cool dude blah blah etc...\" Basically this dude trashed 11 years worth of hard work because the response to his relentless drive to dominate, perfected over a lifetime of endless manipulation, was countered a simple \"no u.\" Life works in strange ways :^)",

I have been dealing with these types my whole life,  The town I was raised was pretty remote and had a high rate of fas and other backwoods factors.  I have quite a few \"crazy\" stories and was thinking I \"might\" make a blog one day.  \nSounds like a good idea, the more that people put their experiences out there about this kind of insanity, the better. As much as I would like to think that Herschel still stews in impotent rage about what I did, but the truth is that he most likely has already moved on to fucking with someone else's life. That's how it is with their kind. In a way, i'm kinda thankful for the experience. Now I know what my most glaring weaknesses are and most importantly, how to spot these people a mile away, most of the time at least :^)",
