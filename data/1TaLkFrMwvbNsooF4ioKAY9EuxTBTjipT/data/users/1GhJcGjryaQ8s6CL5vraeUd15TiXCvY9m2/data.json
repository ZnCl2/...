Find me a video of a group (3+) of Whites brutally attacking 1 lone Black person. If you can find it, I can give you 1000 videos of the race inverse. Of course, not all Blacks, but compared to other races, they are bred with hate like no other. [...]\n\nBlacks make up 13.4%[0] of the USA\n\nblacks killed 3218 people in 2019 where as whites killed 2948  [1]\n\nThis means you have 13% of the population committing over half of all murders.\n\n[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States\n[1] https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls",
