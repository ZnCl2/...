They are losing sales in cable, newspapers, and online subscriptions, so they are trying to make it up somehow.\n\nIt's more about controlling the message than any financial reason. Any \"independent\" media that operates outside of their predetermined dialectic (globohomo) gets throttled, banned, etc. As big of a disappointment as Trump's presidency has been, they fucked up big time when he got elected.

The fact that boomers were born with more than resources than any other generation and squandered it with no plan for the next generations is reason enough to get rid of them. They bought into all the jewish revolutionary marxist shit but then became yuppies when that sucked. They have had a good hand in destroying the west and they don't possess the introspect to actually ask themselves why everything is fucked up.\n\nCalling out the shortcomings of people/groups isn't about people that need to grow up.

It is likely  that more common desktop linux distributions will officially run on raspberry pi 4 but i would suggest the system should be completely loaded into RAM at boot because SD cards are not good with read/write cycles (I.E. just as in puppy linux). I am curious if Pi4 could be used as a terminal server (something like LTSP.org ) to improve performance of an old laptop which has not much more than 1GB. I definitely would prefer 2 Ethernet instead of 2 HDMI for that. In such setting it could nicely host something like a tor gateway as well. And of couse a zeronet bundle! I heard  the GPU part stil relies on proprietary stuff anyway, but that way it would not really require it.\n\nThe SD performance is quite a bit better since the last gen. Agreed about dropping the extra mini hdmi for 2 ethernet. Looks like the nic can sustain around 936Mbps. Running pf, suricata, etc on a $35 device would be sick.",
