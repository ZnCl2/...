I would not be surprised if a coordinated attempt to dismantle this service was attempted.  I'm new to zeronet, but have been using TOR, Freenet and other technology to resist censorship for a long time, so I'm just getting familiar with how Zeronet works.  I'm curious just how resilient it might be if there was an effort to destroy it.  As for the crimes of a few, too often this is used as the basis to punish many.  Let's hope we don't see that happen here.",
