It will be pretty challenging to balance all of the project's priorities in a decentralized environment.  I'm looking forward to be a part of it.\n\nWe shouldnt. It was right there from the very beginning of public internet and was called \"netiquette\" - boils down to simple \"dont be moron\". Sadly is dead now. The new norm is \"give a man a mask, and he will show you his real face\". Mostly the face belongs to some fuckin moron, but thats sign of times, I presume",

It should censor the proverbial shit out of any public site to match human decency. There are no regular expressions to resolve it, nothing less that TensorFlow and SciKit. Otherwise will be sabotaged as soon as it gains popularity and will threat powers-that-be. Someone WILL start posting things that will force all 3 letter agencies to intervene and they will do it. Silk Road was full of invincible people.\n4chan censored itself, altough I wouldnt call it \"censorship\".

The best way to avoid morons is to not give them resons to come. First: needs successful downvote mechanism and hide posts below certain points by defaut. Users can, if they want, lower the threshold and scuba dive in shit if they please. Something like slashdot.org has. Methods are already there - well tested in clearnet. This would need some brainstorming but is definitely doable. What should be fixed is human factor, not technicals. The goal is that even if you will get unlimited count of saboteurs, SJW moron, shills, niggerfaggots of all sorts - they will be limited to threads. \nIs definitely better to hear \"ZN hidden channels are full of shit\" than \"ZN is full of shit\".\n\nOr, I dont know, gold membership based on existing mechanisms like 1 USD lifetime certificate paid with CC or PayPal (not BTC) which will stop spammers and shills before they start (since one CC or PP can be used only once)\nYou ban CC/PP once - finito la musica, passato la fiesta - shill is out once and forever.\nI wouldnt have problems to pay for it, majority of valuable banned YT people already pay for Vimeo etc. Maybe will fly, maybe will not. Maybe this is completely stupid idea. Or ingenious. \nIm pretty sure there are countless possibilities but tech arms race is not one of them.",
