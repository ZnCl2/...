RED lies, BLUE lies, what does it matter in the end?\n\nBecause they'll push for shit like the Green New Deal based upon a lie, that's why you should care about it. Stuff like that wouldn't be possible if people saw the lies for what they are.\n\n>I am sorry man, but the anchorman in this video is... Well... [...] Sorry, no offense to you, but this guy is just not bright enough.\n\nIt's sad that this is the only adequate critical summary of the Green New Deal I could find on YouTube, guess you'll have to read the draft yourself if you want a good idea for what's planned for America (and Europe soon.)",
