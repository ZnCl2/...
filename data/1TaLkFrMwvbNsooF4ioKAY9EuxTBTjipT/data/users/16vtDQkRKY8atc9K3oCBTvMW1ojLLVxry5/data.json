We are talking TB now.\n\nHaha, yeah I just pulled up some old USB card that I've never used.\n\n> [xcape2net](#comment_227_1GJc2vm4vJjAKsFoFJ2D3gGmKiRac2kfnz): When I first came to ZeroNet in early June, ZeroTalk had about 6 MB of data.  That's for all conversations from early 2015 through June 2019.  In the last 24 hours, ZeroTalk has added about 10 MB.  At that rate, ZeroTalk will be about 3.6 GB in a year.  That's a lot of data.  That can't continue to increase year after year.\n\nI see, so this is a very recent development then, huh.",
