			"body": "Has anyone tried running ZeroNet on a mesh network without the traditional internet infrastructure? Is it possible to do this yet? I read somewhere that it still uses a central tracker to connect peers, rather than something like DHT. Also, the central reliance on ZeroName, along with Namecha.in (which isn't even a part of zeronet!) seems problematic.\n\nI feel ZeroNet really needs to be able to sever any connection with the regular clearnet, and be able to ran on mesh networks in order to really embrace the idea of decentralization, as well as be able to take off and become a useful tool, rather than just an interesting play-thing.\n\nA decentralized meshnet combined with a decentralized web seems like a match made in heaven. Combine that with the other P2P technologies, and you'd effectively be able to ignore and ditch the ISP monopolies, as well as prevent any sort of bullying by large companies.\n\nAs it stands, ZeroNet still relies on ICANN to distribute IP addresses, domain names (the Namecha.in domain), and relies on various internet backbone companies in order to distribute the data. This is still dangerously centralized in my opinion.\n\nIs this on the to-do? Is it even on nofish's radar? What's everyone's thoughts on such a thing?",

			"body": "Scraping zites for content is inherently problematic, due to the way ZeroNet functions. For a typical site, you just send a request to the page, get the page content, and do as you please. However, doing this on a ZeroNet site results in getting the ZeroNet wrapper, rather than the page itself. Instead, you have to resolve the javascript and load the iframe, and *then* grab the iFrame's content.\n\nAFAIK, there's no clean way to do this in Javascript.\n\nZeroMail comes with some echobot scripts that manages to scrape the page to look for email. I've adapted this script to work in a general fashion (since I was changing it to scrape site lists for Kaffiene). [Here's the generalized script.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1MgHVPCE1ve6QfKrgsqCURzRj72HrRWioz/?1NWh3WAty57FH8at1WtrZigMrdhrDkuPzh_3)\n\nAs you can see it requires the selenium library along with phantomjs, which is a piece of software that runs websites and properly resolves the page.\n\nI was wondering what other solutions there might be, that don't rely on using selenium/phantomjs, or may even be entirely javascript.\n\nFrom my understanding, this is the problem that merger sites are meant to solve: a local/client way (javascript/coffeescript) to grab content from other ZeroNet sites.\n\nThoughts?",

I know it's the same for you guys, since we have a very small, not very active community here. So have at it: what's so great that's driving you away from ZeroNet and back to the clearnet?\n\nFor me, I always wander back to Reddit for the news, varied discussions, and active userbase. But we already have a Reddit-clone here, but we *do* have a lack of news and discussions. And all the news sites inevitably point back to clearnet. I've also noticed a huge lack of images/pictures here. Is it because there's not really a need? Or because there's not a platform to upload pictures?

Using public wifi isn't really an option, since most wifi available is protected/locked and not available for public use, and the ones that are are few and far between here in the US.\n\nMesh nets would work, but they're far to slow to roll out because people simply don't see the need (home internet connection + mobile plan = \"internet everywhere\"). But the reality is that if you're reliant on a cellular network to connect, it means they can easily track what you do and where you go. Even if you turn off your location option.\n\nOne option could be to have old cell networks given to the public domain, and reworked to not track location or require authorization/id (which is how you connect to them currently, needing a sim card). The problem would be actually managing to do that, as phone companies aren't likely to be willing to give up their networks.\n\nThoughts?",

Kaffeine's is a clone of zerosearch with slight changes in the source code and fewer indexed sites, I'm not sure why anyone would prefer it to zerosearch.\n> Bwoi doesn't look like it has been updated in a while, but it does have an original source code. It only has 139 results though, around half as many results as ZeroSearch.\n\nZeroSearch was the first one. It uses a mix of a central authority list filled by it's dev, along with a collection of dev approved user submissions. At the moment, the index count is wrong, since there's several sites indexed multiple times. IMO it's not very functional, but it was what we had to work with for a long time.\n\nKaffiene (my search engine) is indeed a clone of zerosearch. I removed the user-submission aspect, since it just queued them up without adding. However, when I finished cloning it, Kaffiene had an identical amount of sites. I then took the liberty of adding a few more. I noticed earlier today ZeroSearch added quite a few as well. IMO, Kaffiene is more usable, and provides more or less all the same sites.\n\nBwoi is a new one that only indexes and searches the ZeroName sites.\n\nPerhaps I'm biased, but I'd say usability goes: Kaffiene > ZeroSearch > Bwoi.\n\nEither way, I'm planning on continually updating Kaffiene with new features/results. I'm currently looking into how to automatically grab new sites to index. As always, I intend to keep functionality and quality search results as a top priority for Kaffiene.

How is that worse than your current way of receiving sites through zeromail?\n\nIt's not. A user request system is nice, but it's ultimately useless. There's no reason to have a queue system that's mostly for the dev of the site taking up bandwidth and site storage space. It'd work better if users of the site could vote on 'good' sites. But as it stands, that entire functionality is useless without an active dev. There's the implication that the queue is autochecked when it's not. Making it more or less the same as the other sites.\n\nPersonally, I removed this because it's dishonest (the queue is equivalent to just asking the dev to add the site) and it takes up space. it also makes the site clunkier. It's not a fault for having it, but I just see no point in it. ZeroSearch honestly has much bigger problems than doing something with the queue system.",

IIRC, every search engine is equivalent in this regard at the moment.\n\n>Again, same goes for yours. You kept the same site and just changed the dev.\n\nI cloned the site, sure. But it's not really the same any more. And won't be in the future.\n\n>As I see it, you basically cloned my site, changed a couple lines to make it show the tags and remove the search limit, added your name on it and claimed it as your own.

Either way, in the next revision of the site I'll be getting rid of most of the existing code. My main intention was to provide a more functional ZeroSearch. Which I seem to have accomplished. I'm confused at why you're angry. If you don't want your site cloned, don't upload it to ZeroNet. Anyone is free to clone Kaffiene. I have no problems with that.

Hell, even a lot of reddit *moderators* don't care to do that and just copy+paste important stuff they like (full themes, generators for stuff, etc).\n\nAnd back in the day with myspace we saw a similar thing happen.

I mean: in my country torrenting is illegal, so I always have to use a proxy to use my torrent client. Is this also necessary here in ZeroNet? are the real IPs shared somewhere? Is there any extra precaution I should take?\n> Thanks\n\nZeroNet does not hide traffic. Which is why there's included  Tor support, and if you're overly cautious, you might want to use a VPN. Though I'm confused. You say 'torrenting is illegal'. Do you mean the protocol itself? Even companies like Blizzard and Microsoft use torrents to distribute their software and updates. And plenty of legal content is distributed through it. On top of that,  torrents themselves can be used for plenty of legal activities, like browsing ZeroNet.\n\nIf you're *actually* questioning about 'Play', then treat those torrents exactly as you would torrents you get on the clearnet. Because that's literally what they are: reposted magnet links. They seem to be all Rarbg links. So if you use a VPN or w/e for those, then you'll obviously want to use it for the movies you get off Play.\n\nZeroNet itself does not actually torrent the movies. Unless, of course, a movie is included as part of a website that you connect to (at which point the site would take a long time to load). It also wouldn't be prey to the typical ways that companies catch people torrenting (through looking at the IP swarm), since ZeroNet is it's own network and doesn't connect to people outside of it.\n\nIf you're planning on using ZeroNet itself (not using it to mirror links) to do illegal things, then you might want to get extra protection.",

If we make search plugin for zeronet (python) it can indexes all user sites ( sites what user seeds) and broadcast index to DHT network (like yacy do) and that plugin should have zero api, so if you want to find some information in network you send request to DHT and recursively find what you want (like yacy do). \n\nThis won't happen. I was talking with nofish about crawling sites. He doesn't want anything that could automatically 'reveal' sites that may be intentionally hidden. So any sort of crawling, or DHT searching, or w/e is off limits. Which means a few things: 1) it won't ever be included as a python script, meaning it has to be JS, or a separate download. 2) It won't have native support, meaning that the results would be inherently limited. 3) There's still no way to grab content, making the search practically useless.\n\nI think the actual future of the search engines is probably going to be merger-sites, where various site indexes link out their list of sites, search engines grab and merge those, and then search through them. That way, users can select which indexes they want to search through, sites can be added by any participating peer, and it still works in the manner that's intended by ZeroNet.",

Regular movie torrents from play didn't seem to work with my test, but I dunno if that was just shoddy example code, a shoddy connection, or just a bad torrent. Or if it legit didn't work with those torrents. The web torrent site says you need special \"webrtc enabled\" torrents in order for them to work. And those torrents need to be seeded by a 'webrtc enabled' client. Of which there's seems to basically be none.\n\nFrom what I can tell, it didn't at all store the file on my computer after the test. Presumably it was in the cache. Seeding doesn't happen after the user leaves the page. So all stuff would either have to be explicitly seeded with an external app, or the users would have to remain on the page while they seed.\n\nThis would be fine if lots of people were accessing the content, like popular movies on play. It's not so good for a video sharing site like youtube or vimeo which might have unpopular videos.\n\nIf it worked for regular torrents (my quick test showed it didn't), then it'd be brilliant for it. Just have the users upload magnet links/torrents, and then stream them. You can already do this with regular torrents, along with a streaming client like Playback.\n\nIPFS seems like a better way to go, but I found it was *really* slow to stream content. I dunno if that was because I didn't set it up right, or if it was just legit slow.\n\nPersonally, I like the idea of *regular* torrents, so that users can freely use a torrent client of their choice, or use the built in one.

Talking about cryptocurrencies was rather misleading.\n> I basically want to try and create turn based games, using internal messaging (like ZeroChat) to publicly update the state of the game to players and observers.\n> For my purpose it sounds like I can just have players use an incremental move number (0, 1, 2, etc), and if a player tries to cheat by sending \"double moves\" they will have to have signed both moves, which I guess could be detected and then the player will be considered forfeit by everyone watching the game.\n\nAh, this is completely doable. You can either just have the client check the moves and only display the latest/earliest (much like how [ZeroWiki](http://127.0.0.1:43110/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/?Page:home) only displays the latest update). Or you can use a server backend that visitors send messages to in order to submit their move. Something like ZeroID (to register unique names) or ZeroBoard (send messages to server which then posts for you).\n\nJust do this as you would any regular HTML/JS app, or introduce a python/php/etc backend if needed (though that removes the decentralization).\n\nDouble spend is still  an issue, obviously. Since the blockchain/bitcoin is the first solution to that problem. Cryptocurrencies are unique because they guarantee that the coin is unique and unable to be spent twice with no central authority. You either need a central authority to validate, or you need to trust the users (either client). The nature of ZeroNet allows someone to delete or change the content they've uploaded at any time. So that wouldn't really work well for a game, since cheating could happen. So you're probably stuck with either centrally checking it, or figuring out some other solution. Perhaps you could do a 'move verification' thing. Have 3 players in a game, and then make sure 2 of the 3 sign off on a move for it to be accepted.

And yes, all websites on ZeroNet require minimal hardware, since the hosting is decentralized.\n\n>I'm asking because I find it hard to imagine how a site with a 'large amount' of user generated content can be decentralized.\n\nDepends on how much you're talking about. For reference, the pirate bay database comes in at 700mb or so, and contains: \"names, descriptions, comments, seeder and leecher info, date of upload, size info and quality marks (only for some torrents, before before TPB took it down).\" Remove the extra information and leave the magnet links and titles and you get down to 75mb. That's more than small enough to host on ZeroNet. Albeit, you'll likely need to use the 'optional files' feature that allows visitors to download/seed only some of the files (stuff viewed).\n\n>Ideally the site owner should not need to be online constantly for the site to run normally (only to update features or fix bugs).\n\nYup, ZeroTorrent is already like that.\n\n>So in order for the users to be able to login and add content without the 'central server', the user database would have to be available to every peer. In order not to compromise the privacy of the users it must be possible for every user to encrypt his own private user data into this user database. Also as admin of the site one might want to also look in on some of this private data. So maybe the private user data needs to be also encrypted using the site owners public key as a duplicate.\n\n>Is something like that feasible or a pipe dream?\n\nYou're essentially describing how the DB system works for ZeroNet sites in general. Keep in mind the 'login and add content' is something you literally just did here on ZeroTalk. Instead of a question, all you'd have to do is post a magnet link and some info. To quickly summarize how it works, each user has permission to upload a 'data.json' file with their contributions to the site. These json files are aggregated into an SQLite database which is then accessed by the site. Each user's contributions are only able to be modified by the user (and perhaps the site owner). And there's even options to make them completely encrypted private, like in the case of ZeroMail.",

It's a python script running on a centralized/dedicated host that essentially acts as another user (such as the site's owner).  I actually have been toying with the concept of decentralized crawlers for my search engine [Kaffiene.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffiene.bit) Though unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a reliable way of doing that.

				"body": "Yea, I've heard of yacy. Obviously decentralized search engines (for anything) is possible if you have people running code for it. The issue is using ZeroNet as a platform to do that. The javascript for each site is ran like a typical website. Once you leave the site, the code no longer runs. See [ZeroTube](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1FUQPLXHimgCvYHH7v3bJXspJ7bMBUXcEb) for why that's an issue. The videos magnet links get uploaded, and while the user is on the page it seeds through webtorrent. But once they leave, the video becomes unseeded and effectively dead. On top of that, there doesn't seem to be a way to escape the site's sandbox, making it impossible to crawl clearnet for stuff anyway (not that users would agree, as many come to zeronet as an alternative web).\n\nYacy is able to do what it does because it runs in the background while users visit regular web pages. It logs that activity and crawls the visited pages. I thought up a similar idea for kaffiene: grab the user's list of seeded sites. Unfortunately this solutions was cockblocked by nofish, as grabbing a list of seeded sites is only for admin/official sites, making it impossible to use otherwise. For a torrent crawler, this method wouldn't work at all.\n\nOne solution might be to have a python script, or zeronet plugin that users can download and set up, that helps crawl for torrents or w/e else. They'd still be posted in the user-driven way, but it'd be automated. Perhaps that'd work?\n\nEither way, the big thing is that websites don't really have a backend here. It's just a frontend that's decentrally hosted. So trying to do backend stuff is likely going to have to be centralized (or you could come up with your own decentralized backend separate from zeronet).",

You can technically move the Zeronet folder itself to another location, but your site still has to be stored in /Zeronet/data or w/e. It has nothing to do with the sandboxing.\n\nThe issue I see is that you'd have to manually configure each site, or else keep the same folder structure for the sites which sort of defeats the purpose (unless you wanted the zites in /documents and the zeronet app in /apps).

Then run `brew install tor` to download/install the tor daemon (they have a mac app for the browser, but just ignore that). After it's done downloading and installing, navigate to the `/usr/local/etc/tor` folder on your computer. The easiest way to do this is to open finder and hit `cmd+shift+g` and paste it in there. You should see a `torrc.sample` file. Copy that and rename the copy to just `torrc` with no extension. Open it up in a text editor (presumably a plain text one like [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to prevent auto-formatting from messing it up. Avoid using mac's built-in one.) Look for `#ControlPort 9051` and simply remove the \\#. Two lines down you should see `#CookieAuthentication 1` remove the \\# from this one too. After that, save up and launch tor using `tor start` in the terminal. After this, restart zeronet and it'll run with tor. If you want to use tor for every connection (rather than just having one for a bridge or to access tor-only peers) then on the zero net homepage, click on the tor button in the top right, and hit 'enable tor for every connection' at the bottom. Then restart zeronet. You can disable it in the same way.\n\nHope that helps. That's how I got mine set up.

The issue that happen(ed/s) with posting in multiple hubs is the display logic that ZeroMe uses. it assumes stuff from 'posts' only comes from a single hub, where in reality it can come from multiple. All you'd really have to do is keep the multiple hubs distinctly separate, rather than assuming that only one can have posts.\n\n'joining a hub' is really just planting down the posts/bio/avatar/etc. info on that particular hub. For a generic torrent site, the 'posts' would be submissions, and would be properly categorized into the various hubs. There wouldn't be a conflict, since they'd be explicitly in different categories (hubs). What ZeroMe does is treat all the comments/likes/posts/etc. as if they're all one big zerome site.

				"body": ">Does anybody have a good explaination for how merger sites such as ZeroMe work?\n\nThe merger feature is broken up into two parts: A hub site which contains only data. And a viewer/merger site which grabs multiple hub sites and 'merges' them. You can replace either part: you can keep the same hub sites and replace the viewer, or keep the viewer and replace the hub sites.\n\n>If I am seeding a hub, am I by default able to view it in ZeroMe?\n\nYes. Any hub you're seeding, you can view in ZeroMe (provided, of course, that it's a zerome hub).\n\n>When I post something, does it go to the first hub I joined, or does it go to all of them?\n\nWhen you join a hub, that hub gets initialized with your profile and post data. When you post something, it goes to the hub that you initialized. There's currently a bug where if you initialized two different hubs, things will glitch. You can see which hub it'll post to by looking at the link to your profile, it'll contain the hubsite address.\n\n>If it only goes to one hub, am I able to switch which hub I post to?\n\nThere is no official way to do this, no. I wrote a guide on how to manually switch hubs [here.](kaffie.bit/?Post:25:How+to+change+your+ZeroMe+Hub) Though if you have existing followers, ZeroMe will glitch a bit. The lack of switching hubs is purely due to how ZeroMe works, and not an issue with the merger/hub feature.\n\n>Am I only allowed to have a profile on one hub or do I have a profile on all of my hubs?\n\nThe profile, as mentioned earlier is stored in your initialized hub. There's nothing technically stopping you from including this data on the other hubs. However, the ZeroMe merger site isn't written to support this, and glitches. ZeroMe expects you to have a profile on only a single hub. And indeed, there's no real benefit to having a profile on different hubs. For merger sites in general, a 'profile' isn't actually a part of the API. So you can forego it altogether, or allow users to make 'posts' on every hub (just like they can with comments).\n\n>Can I comment on somebody's post from a different hub? What happens if they aren't seeding the particular hub that I joined first? What would happen?\n\nYes, this is the whole point of a merger site. Your posts on other hubs are stored in your user folder on that site. If you are commenting on a post that's on a different hub, your comment will be viewable to anyone seeding that hub (which is the same group of people able to see the parent post). If, however, they are only seeding your home hub, and not the other hub, they won't be able to see the post. People only see content that's posted on/to hubs they are seeding. Comments and likes are stored in the hub they're commented/liked on. So if someone can see the post, they can see the likes and comments.",

				"body": "ZeroNet uses .bit domains resolved through a ZeroNet site. The default resolver is [zeroname.bit.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/zeroname.bit) ZeroName gathers it's list by connecting to the [Namechain](http://namecha.in/) website and grabbing a list of valid ZeroNet names.\n\nZeroNet also has an option to resolve using a local copy of Namecoin, or to configure your own domain name site.\n\nBy obtaining a domain name for your site, the links shorten to something like [http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffie.bit.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffie.bit) Still long, but much shorter. As you may have been aware with ZeroMe, you can see that the domain name has made it a bit shorter. The extra stuff at the end is site-specific parameters, which varies from site to site.\n\n---\n\nThe big issue, then, is the ugly localhost:port at the beginning. There's two ways of fixing this, and neither are official. The first is to either download the [ZeroNet chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zeronet-protocol/cpkpdcdljfbnepgfejplkhdnopniieop?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog), which is semi-officially supported (stuff like ZeroMe adjusts for it). Or you can head over to the [kaffie.bit protocol test page](http://127.0.0.1/kaffie.bit/test.html) and download the .pac proxy file to configure the `http://zero/<address>` style urls along with direct http://name.bit support.\n\nThere's also an option on that page to configure the `zero://` protocol, which is entirely unofficial, but cleans up links a lot (the end result is: `zero://kaffie.bit`). However, the way this protocol is handled only works on firefox (and likely clones), and doesn't clean up the url bar, it just makes links look nicer (which is pointless if people can't resolve them).\n\nThe big issue with both methods is that the purpose of clean links is to share them. However, neither the `http://zero/` nor the `zero://` methods are official, and thus not all users have them (again, refer to the test page to see which work for you). Hell, even the localhost:port bit becomes non-standard, with the presence of proxies and people customizing their port. Ultimately there's not really a clean solution to all of this, and it remains to be one of ZeroNet's biggest problems.",

Best you can do is treat it and move on.\n\n>It's a mental disorder, linked to a small but consistent abnormality in the brain, and like most mental disorders and illnesses (i.e. clinical depression) there isn't a cure either, only treatment.\n\nNo. It's not. Gender dysphoria, as described in the DSM-V is a mental illness, not a disorder. It's not linked to any abnormality in the brain, but rather an improper responding to sexed hormones. Which is why it's treated with hormone replacement. And yes, it's been cured. This is the type of idiocy I was talking about.\n\n> I could point you to a dozen books written by certified, professional psychiatrists, but they all say the same thing: avoidance and denial are absolutely, completely ineffective at treating anyone with a mental disorder: anxiety, PTSD, eating disorders, whatever.\n\nI don't disagree. I'm well read on psychology and mental health. Gender dysphoria, and being trans, are not a mental disorder.\n\n>And indulging in a disorder, i.e. normalizing suicide, or chemically and surgically imitating the opposite sex hurts people, badly, and permanently, and it's absolutely reprehensible for any medical professional to permit it.\n\nGreat strawman right here. No. Transitioning, hormone replacement, and surgery do *not* make people worse off. What makes people worse off is ignoring the problem. There's a reason untreated trans people have a 40% suicide rate while post-op reduces that dramatically.\n\n> So you know what my soon-to-be wife and I do, concerning dysphoria?\n\nSolve the problem? It's pretty straight forward, and treatment works almost immediately.\n\n>Find an effective therapist, learn to live with it, not reject it, or indulge in it, \n\nHave fun with that, I'd rather not live my life eternally depressed. Thanks. You do realize talk therapy doesn't help with a hormone problem, right? And that it simply gets worse with age?\n\n>and stay away from incredibly reckless practices like hormone therapy and surgery, the kinds of things that ruin people's lives.\n\nExcept it has an 80%+ satisfaction rate. One of the highest in medicine. If transitioning is 'reckless and ruins people's lives' then certainly all medicine and medical treatment must. Given everything else has a lower satisfaction rate.\n\n>Because you know what kind of people are able to accept their problematic circumstances, recognize reality, and endeavor to be happy despite it? Grown up, fucking adults.\n\nGrown fucking adults don't deny science and reality in favor of fantasies of \"I'll just get over it magically\".",

In most cases this means only trans or intersex people will get it, but there have been cases where cis people have gotten it for a variety of reasons (side effects of other drugs, forcefully transitioned, willfully transitioned, etc).

You literally do a brain transplant ala the one coming up? I think trans people in general would be pretty excited at that.\n\n> How do you think they would feel about that?What if they are stuck like that for the rest of there life?\n\nIf you did such a brain transplant on a cis (not trans) person, they'll almost certainly experience gender dysphoria due to conflicting hormones and anatomy. There's been quite a few cases that demonstrate this. The most famous is [David Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) who's a cis guy that was forcefully transitioned.\n\n> There brains are healthy, and the bodies are healthy, so what is the problem exactly?\n\nThis is the case for trans people. The issue is the gender/sex conflict. The brain expects a certain physiology and certain hormones. Examples unrelated to sex would be stuff like phantom limb syndrome.\n\n> The sexually dysmorphic differences in a body happen due to the sex hormone balance at multiple stages of a persons life.For many things, once developed, it is \"set\", meaning that changing the balance later wont change it much or at all.\n\nMost development happens within the womb and then later at puberty. Pubertal changes can sometimes be undone (depending on the exact trait/change we're talking about). But yes, several sex traits can't be undeveloped (voice, breasts, reproductive organs, genitals, etc).\n\n>The brain is sexually dysmorphic (why wouldn't it be?) and while it has much plasticity, it also has parts that have little or no plasticity.\n\nSure. The brain is pretty complicated as it is.\n\n> In the womb, humans start off female and are either left to develop as a female, or switched to male with a timed testosterone dump.The amount of testosterone in the dump, and the timing can be off, resulting in anomalies, like a brain that developed female in a body that developed male.\n\nYes. This is the current theory as to the cause of trans identities.\n\n> Biologically, males and females are almost identical, if you change a persons testo/estro balance during childhood to the opposite of there sex, they will develop into the opposite of there sex, voice, appearance, size and all.\n\nIndeed. Once outside of the womb, besides already developed differences, the presence of external hormones can cause the body to develop in either direction. This is why transitioning often times works much better for younger people.",

The film (In Time, it's pretty good and the whole motto is *against* the system contained in it) has a simple synopsis of: money=lifespan. I fail to see how that relates to ZeroNet at all.\n\nThe comments seem to be implying a cryptocurrency combined with zeronet sites? Something like Steem I imagine? I avoid using cryptocurrency forums/social networks for a reason. They discourage active users, and promote circlejerks/shitposts. On top of that, it adds a barrier to entry, have huge lag (due to blockchain requirements), and are impossible to have exponential growth. So ultimately you get an asymmetry along time, and the earlier users benefit. Fail all around.\n\nIf we tie it into ZeroID, that defeats the whole purpose of having decentralized authentication (See: KaffieID, Nanasi, etc). And nothing prevents someone from 'farming' by making multiple ZeroIDs and draining the existing account. If you just artificially gave out coins to anyone, you'd need a central authority, which defeats the entire purpose of ZeroNet: to be decentralized.\n\nLastly, there's no reason to even have such a thing.

This alone tells me the poster has no clue how ZeroNet works, nor what the risks are of running it. The DNS is based on namecoin, which is as safe and decentralized as bitcoin. If you have a problem with namecoin, you sure as fuck have a problem with ICANN, since namecoin is demonstrably more reliable and safe than ICANN. You can 100% guarantee that the site you're looking for is the site you get, and not someone who did a DNS hijack, or an ICANN official mucking things up.\n\nI don't use ICANN. Fuck them. OpenNIC for regular web, and namecoin for dark web. Anything else and you're opening yourself up to security risks.\n\n>For example, White Van material (talking about CP here) has been found encoded into EXIF data in seemingly benign pictures. Android had a HUGE insecurity where just viewing an image on your phone ran a script behind the scenes and you would never have known.\n\nThe issue with android is a bigger issue on the clear web, as images can come from anywhere and be automatically ran. ZeroNet prevents cross-site embedding, which means only sites you trust can load images or content.\n\n>You cannot, I repeat CANNOT browse or use a webpage while you are offline. \n\nYes you can. I often browse ZeroNet while offline. In fact, you can *only* view pages 'offline'. Page content is not streamed, it's downloaded and then viewed. ZeroNet just saves it instead of cache.\n\n>However, AJAX won't work\n\nAJAX works fine on ZeroNet, though it's obviously not encouraged.\n\n>HTTP requests and responses won't work, \n\nThey do. Only to sites that have been set to view offline.\n\n>links won't work\n\nThey do. Again, you can certainly use a search engine like Kaffiene, and then click a link to a site and visit it, all offline.\n\n> refreshes and updates won't work.\n\nThey do. You can refresh the page, and updates from you or anyone on your lan (once support is done ;P) work fine. Obviously you can't receive updates from the internet without being online. Duh.\n\n>OP is directing people to a link (I'm not posting it). If anyone asks a question, OP replies and attempts to answer by saying \"just download the link\". I don't need to explain why that would be monumentally stupid in doing so.\n\nYeah, it's really dumb to download and run stuff without knowing what it is. But that's like saying \"if someone tells you to download and run firefox, don't do it because you're dumb!\" ZeroNet is completely safe.\n\n>digitally signed, and secured so that information at rest and during transmission isn't being tampered with. \n\nActually, you can't get that guarantee with the clear web. You guarantee it with ZeroNet.\n\n> You can't verify that what is being handed to you isn't malicious or that executables aren't embedded in them. \n\nActually, that's true of the clear web, not zeronet. 'google.com' on the clear web could point you to a malicious site due to a variety of reasons. But kaffiene.bit on zeronet will *guarantee* you get the right files coded and signed by yours truly. But yes, just like the internet in general, you can't guarantee that any particular user will not host malicious files. That goes for both clear web and zeronet.\n\n>Once they have been received by your system, they don't go away when you delete Zeronet\n\nOh for fucks sake. ZeroNet is entirely self-contained. If there's any exploit, it's due to your browser, and thus you're equally as vulnerable on the clear web, if not more so due to the previous flaws mentioned.\n\n>Say goodbye to HTTPS, SSH, TLS, or any other standardized and ubiquitous security measure when you use Zeronet because you're pulling your information from an adjacent node, not a server.\n\nSure, but you don't need them. All the files are guaranteed to be correct by math.\n\n>TOR is not secured, either. \n\nTor is not zeronet.\n\nThis guy is clearly clueless about how ZeroNet works, or why it's *more* secure than the clear web, not less.",

I take an estrogen supplement (in the form of estradiol), along with an anti-androgen (spironolactone). The estrogen is used for the obvious reasons, to raise my estrogen levels up the proper female levels. The anti-androgen is used to *lower* testosterone down to female levels.

It's not exactly like you can just ignore the legal system and assume nothing will go wrong. I do think opting out of society as much as possible should be the current goal. And focusing on making free decentralized systems so that the current legal and monetary systems are unneeded. The less support mainstream society has, the easier it'll be to get rid of it. I talked a bit about this on my blog, but I definitely need to do some more in-depth writing. Unfortunately I don't think opting out completely without societal support will ever be possible, as long as you have medical needs or desire new tech.\n\nWhat we really need to get anarchism off the ground and going is lots of funding and resources. Building up networks of anarchist communities, and focusing on cutting ties with major systems. I think ZeroNet can be a key piece of this in terms of tech. No need for dedicated webhosts, no need for ICANN, no big corp tracking or spying, etc. Unfortunately the hardware and physical aspect of it all is much more difficult than the digital portion.

Currency today I agree, it should be abolished.   But I also think there is a missunderstanding about that too. The point I wanted to make was really about profit, money (as in currency can exist without profit).  Its still a ransom to work, but profiit (like interest) was never always the result of money -  in middle eastern societies before capitalism, prices were determined buy the community, not the buyer or the seller.  And never for profit. \n\nYou can't buy or sell something without ownership or property. As long as you have ownership and/or tokens representing such, you will always have people who try to maximize how much they have. Regardless of the systems in place.\n\n> Q) Should anarchists support bitcoin or decry it?\n\nIt's a step up from the current monetary system. And the blockchain itself can be a useful way of assigning names and numbers (see namecoin which is great). I do not think access should be restricted based on bitcoin (or namecoin). I think a UBI implementation like [duniter](https://en.duniter.org/) would be a better option to support, if you're looking to replace money but still keep it.\n\n> Funding?  By that I assume you mean 'stealing' (taking back what is ours to take), especially given your first comment about money ;)\n\nIdeally funding and resources would be obtained peacefully, rather than aggravating the rest of society. It's important to have a good image. There's also the issue of legal theft deprives someone else of their access. Which is anti-anarchistic. It would not be an issue in an anarchy, as the person 'deprived' could simply take it back, or take something else they need. But within current society, most people do not want to get on the bad side of the militarized police. You're free to do so, but I don't think that'll be the fastest way of demonstrating a minimal viable product. To properly kickstart an anarchy you'd need *lots* of resources. Land, some sort of farm for food production, technology, shelter, water, electricity, etc. The more the better. Imagine managing to make an anarchic city. Go anywhere in the city and it's still good. Showing that living without money is possible will make people quick to ditch their slave labor which will then crumble the system. Trying to fight the law first will only result in anarchists being perceived as 'hoodlums' and criminals, rather than as people who want to build a better and more functional society.\n\nThis is why I have no problem advocating copyright infringement, but I'm more iffy on depriving people of things, and aggravating police. If you saw during Trump's inaugeration, some people calling themselves anarchists were breaking windows, knocking over trash cans, and lighting cars on fire. While that *was* a demonstration of rejecting the legal system, I doubt many people would look at that and go \"I want to be like them.\" But if, instead, you show them a city of people living and not needing to work, opting in where they can best improve the city, and generally living with modern luxuries, that's more attractive and will get people supporting the cause.\n\nRobbing the rich is fine. They don't feel it anyway. Robbing from the middle class and poor results in the deprivation of access being felt, and should be a no-go. That's my 2c on the topic.",

Namecoin IS money. \n\nThis is kind of a complicated issue. On one hand, private ownership of a name/password/etc. is pretty much needed for online services to work and be convenient. On the other, owning a name or namecoin is indeed 'money' and thus enforced ownership. I think namecoin isn't really the way to go, even though it works *much* better than current DNS systems. I can see a type of namecoin blockchain popping up that has the UBI properties of duniter. Or maybe just ditching domain names altogether (though that might be difficult for non-tech people). As for web pages, yes. People should be free to be able to manage their own websites. Much like how it's done here on ZeroNet. You can easily clone a site, look at the source code, modify your locally downloaded copy, etc. So it's not like the content is 'owned'. And there'd certainly be no copyright. So really the only thing you could say is \"ownership of the ability to access content associated with a particular public key\". At which point I'd argue that it's not owned, but merely accessed by one person who's the only person who knows how to access it. If someone else got their hands on the private key, there'd be no issue with them modifying the site. Privacy =/= ownership. But this is certainly something I'd need to think more about, and talk about with other anarchists.\n\n>I agree we shouldnt own materials and have private property.  But I think you missunderstand my point.  UBI is a terrible idea because not only does it still allow the capitalists to control the means of production, it also doesnt give people the leverage of being able to withdraw their labour, and UBI could be cut back at the whim of the capitalists -  leaving many without any income or leverage to demand it back.   Its also why UBI is popular among the right wing capitalists as much as with the socialists.  Some corporate lobbyists are promoting UBI because its a distraction from the fact they own the property and means of production, it  grants them all the power of the state and resources and production in exchange for charity to the unemployed.\n\nOh I agree. I don't mean to say UBI is the end-all be-all system. I'm saying for transitional purposes, it's very useful. It helps remove the reliance on wage slavery. Again, refer to duniter for a good example of how I imagine a transitional currency.\n\n>Duniter means you only get income if you own a computer and own/purchase coins. \n\nIn duniter you don't 'purchase coins'. They're generated continuously and evenly distributed among the users. The inflation involved automatically equalizes older users and newer users, as well as the rich and poor. It's designed to be able to be used for transactions, while also keeping wealth and income equality over long periods of time. And yes, it's limited to people who have a computer and have opted-in, because this obviously isn't a government currency, and it's exclusively digital (like most money nowadays).\n\n>Theres nothing remotely anarchist about that.\n\nI didn't say there was. I don't think currency in any form is anarchist. I'm simply describing what I see as a useful transitional currency in order to *arrive* at anarchism.\n\n>Its still designed to be exclusive only to people who have the means to access it.  It is libertarianism, which to my mind is the worse of all systems.  I appreciate the intent is good.  But capitalism cannot be reformed.  Its just another variant of socialism trying to slow the worse excesses of capitalism.  But it isnt going to lead to anarchy.  We need to reject ALL forms of capitalism.\n\nI see socialism as the way to get to anarchism. By making existing systems more easily accessible without using pure cash, you decrease the reliance on currency, and thus make it easier to eliminate. I'm curious how you intend to arrive at a stable anarchism with a smooth transition, if you simply reject socialism and general attempts at removing reliance on capitalism. Violent riots/revolutions don't tend to work. Look at countries that tried that. They almost always end up with a similar style of government, and not actually anarchism.",

If you destroy property of banks (who are theives) or fight fascist police it actually effects them and may actually help other comrades, but you will not paint a good image of yourself.\n\nThere's a difference between short-term results and long-term ideological shifts. I'm focused more on the long-game, which will actually lead to major changes, rather than short-term which will just draw some small attention and not really do anything in the long run. Smashing a window doesn't actually help anyone to begin living in an anarchy.\n\n> You will NEVER get this without giving a bad image and stealing it.  The media controls how anarchists are percieved.  Nothing you do will make a differnce to how you are portrayed in the eyes of the public. And if you want resources you MUST take it, there is no alternative. It is never going to be handed to you.  Capitalists 'own' everything.\n\nAgain, you're confusing short-term gains with long-term movements. Stealing something does literally nothing. Things are stolen every day. It does nothing to change the political/economic climate to an anarchy. No amount of looting or violent resisting of police will end up, say, making every building freely accessible. That will only come from society itself changing.\n\n> This would be great.   Its what happend in catalonia.  All of those anarchists fought non peacefully to get it.  And they are not portrayed as people with a good image  today, even as most of the world today acknowledges Franco was an evil fascist.\n\nRight. Some sources will always paint anarchism in a bad light. But the more working examples we have, the easier it'll be to point to and say \"hey look, this works.\"\n\n> No I don t think they would say that either.  So?  You need to understand the black block movement.  Its a tactic for actually doing stuff that effects the system and allowing other protests (even non anarchists) to protest and act in other effectual ways whilst distracting the cops.    Do you think marching up and down a predetermined route helps?   The Womens March in DC last week was a distraction from the call for an actual womens global strike on that day  (which would have been way way more effective - revolutionary id say - see   http://www.womenstrike.org/  (the media didnt even acknowledge this call by women)    Thats why the media promoted the weekend march so much, to drown it out.   It does fuck all harm to them by comparison. And gives women an outlet that is mostly harmless to them.  Withdrawing labour is the only way to destroy capitalism.  Captalism will always exist while we still provide labour for them.  A weekend march doesnt touch them .  As a defiant act of self expression, it has some value (it potentially helps push the theory that we should change the system along a little).  But does nothing to actually change the system. \n\nRight. Demonstrations do nothing. What actually helps is systemic change. Not just a temper tantrum but a viable solution that works and will actually impact society in a major way.\n\n> Of course, but HOW do you get that city in the first place without TAKING it?\n\nThat's certainly a good question. One way is to just buy it out, participating in capitalism. I lived in a city like that, owned by a single company. Another way is to simply convert everyone in that particular city over to anarchism. Remember, the point is to get people agree with and participate in anarchism. Not attack people and try to attack existing countries. The big problem is that many supply chains are based around the world and are heavily entrenched in capitalism. A violent reaction where we cut ourselves off and claim a small block or neighborhood or something is functionally useless. Kicking people out doesn't help. We need them to simply readjust their work for anarchism instead of capitalism.\n\n> [thisweb11](#comment_312_1D9w8AJTfqmn26iT2kF81B8HxXFfycXuXM): Why do you think its important to go to space when we can't even roam the countryside outside our back gate without capitalists permission?  I'd say getting to space is the least important goal in the history of humanity.   Its only  importance is one of fun, the pleasure of discovery itself.   But that makes it extremely low on the list of things we need to do when I can't even walk in the woods without a fine.\n\nBelieve it or not, making space habitable will do a lot to help push anarchist and decentralist values. The point of, say, colonizing mars is for the systems that are built. Food, water, shelter, etc. all easily available in a place that doesn't really have that stuff. On top of that, pushing for other-world colonization can be one way of kickstarting anarchism. Just simply not on earth. The moon, mars, etc. are all international and not all that regulated. Meaning it's the perfect testbed for anarchism. It's not *as* important, but I still see it as a good goal to have in terms of political views. As it stands, I'd *much* rather have the $600billion/year military budget spent on space/nasa, than on killing people.\n\n> [thisweb11](#comment_313_1D9w8AJTfqmn26iT2kF81B8HxXFfycXuXM): Agree it is complicated.   ( I recommend anarchist David Graeber's book: Dept the first 5000 years which discusses the meaning of money at length)   Ive thought about this a lot and don't think its quite right to say anarchists must not use money.  Ownership of resources and private property is different to privacy and possessions. I think there are kinds of money that have a similar dichotomy of meaning that many anarchist fail to grasp. \n\nI cannot think of a single way to fairly distribute a currency and ownership without there being bias and a tendency to hoard and cause a growth economy. As well as to enforce those things. If you have ownership, you need a violent body to enforce that ownership (otherwise someone else could just take the thing). And by doing that you now have a government that decides who owns what. And thus you no longer have anarchism and capitalism will naturally arise.\n\n> OK.  Thats interesting I need to look into that more.  I think I missunderstood. How are they distributed and to who? , how is it decided who gets how many?  \n\nIt's all automatic based on the software. [See here for the theory behind it.](http://cuckooland.free.fr/TheRtmForTheKids.html) Everyone who's a 'member' of the software (actually using it and confirmed to be a unique human by the community) gets a portion of the newly generated currency. The amount generated is based on the current amount in circulation. Say, 10% (I think duniter has it at like 9.something). So every time new money is generated, it's 10% of the total amount in circulation, and that amount is then evenly distributed among members. This means there's continually rising inflation to equalize the the amount everyone has over time.\n\n> But we still have to actually get hold of resources to use this currency and thats what really matters, because if we have those resources we dont need the currency!\n\nRight. As I said, I think currency as a whole needs to be gotten rid of. But UBI is useful for remedying the current situation that capitalism has gotten us into.\n\n> Socialism hinders anarchy, if it didnt exist the capitalists would have needed to  invent it.  In fact thats why colonial countries like the UK adopted lots of marxist ideas (welfare, free schooling and eventually NHS) , anarchism was popular at around the same time, they were terrified of it.  Soft Marxism was used to appease an impending revolt and it held back the anarchists.  It does so to this day.\n\nThat's actually pretty interesting. I don't have any formal education in this stuff, and am simply sharing my thoughts on it all (and trying to keep up with terminology). Personally I still don't think the two are conflicting. I think socialism is a useful way of getting aspects of anarchism into capitalism without necessarily overthrowing the entire thing right away. For instance, I go through medicaid for health insurance and don't pay a dime. Exactly how it'd be in an anarchy. Likewise, I have a phone on a similar system. I don't pay for cell service. These systems let me opt out of capitalism in those fields. If you manage to do this with everything, you can completely opt out of wage slavery, albeit still be tied to a government. I definitely agree it reduces the 'need' for people to go to anarchism. But as I said, I see it as perhaps the fastest and easiest way of arriving at anarchism on a large scale. Socialize every single thing, remove the requirement of wage slavery, and then opt out of the legal system and economy entirely.\n\nThe other method I see is instead of socializing things through the political system, instead focus on not needing them at all through decentralization. Albeit that method is a bit harder, as you need to find alternative solutions for everything, rather than just jumping on board with existing ones. It'd also be more difficult to get people to switch as it'd require lifestyle changes for them.",

Wealth inequality only exists because the majority of people say it does. If the majority of people reject that, then it's not a thing. Imagine, instead of forcefully taking something, or breaking something, a wealthy person attempts to continue using their wealth. They can't drive their car because no one delivers the gas to fuel it. They can't fly where they need to go because no one flies them there. Perhaps these things are still done, but wealth is ignored entirely. Opt out and reject the systems at play. Even if the wealthy attempt to claim something, there'd be no one guaranteeing that ownership for them. Simply put, when everyone refuses to 'play', power suddenly disappears.

Boycotting McDonalds won't do anything. I *already* 'boycott' McDonalds. I just don't eat there. Hasn't done a damn thing. I encourage people to not eat there whenever possible.

Its been used by socialists and capitalists alike to justify everything from pimping women as prostitutes to implimenting UK laws making it illegal for supermarkets to boycott Israeli products.

Lots of people have pensions invested in oil and arms companies, we are all micro capitalists and have vested interests in keeping the capitalists in power.  Unfortunatly thats no excuse to ignore it and oppress the rest of the world who doesn’t have anything invested in it but misery.  All the people who dont even have minimum wage jobs at mcdonalds who live in the rainforsets being chopped down to supply burgers for example.\n\nI think you've mistaken what I'm saying. Attacking a *particular location* isn't going to help and will just cause inconvenience to bystanders who may be more than happy to join the cause right up until you interfered with their daily lives by releasing cockroaches where they try to make a living so they don't starve.

If anything they'd just push resources into security and laws to crackdown on it, and then get militarized police to stop it. They aren't going to go out of business that way. Look at the big banks. They were pretty much doomed to close down due to financial impact. You know what they did?

Even if you, say, had all of those people willing to steal (most aren't, morally, and likely wouldn't due to the existing law and their mindset of following it) then you'd still run out of food after it was all consumed.

The question first has to be why would they take it?   Without private property and the ability to sell it what would be the point?   Possesions are items that are of personal value, and can't be used to exploit people for labour etc, and have no special value to others in the community .  Eg a teddy bear.  And possessions can also be shared\n\nThis is where I really draw an issue with people who seem to have taken more political classes than actually thought through what would really happen and what would be best. Realistically speaking, *I as an individual* don't really give a shit about 'the means of production'. I don't care if I have access to a factory. I care if I have access to, say, a shelter with functional electricity/heating/internet, food that I can eat, water to drink, some sort of transportation to get around, etc. These are *also* the things that people are the most likely to 'steal'. People don't steal factories or restaurants. They steal food and electronics. The 'possessions' as you call them. In ancap or any other system with a monetary system, *these* are the things that would be restricted and people would lack the ability to access. Which means the exact same problems exist: lack of communication, lack of food/water, lack of clothing/shelter, etc.\n\nOr if you're thinking of things like tools, look at it this way.  You don't need to *own* a bike. You need access to one to be able to quickly get around. And you're not always using it, so after you're done someone else can use it. A teddy bear, quite frankly, is unneeded. Besides a few handcrafted personal sentimental items (*maybe*) I don't really see much need for them. Wasting resources on it is inefficient, and I'm willing to guess no one will willingly work to mass produce them when there's no real value there. The 'value' was that people have a consumeristic mindset and have been indoctrinated to hoard things. And thus they buy unneeded things like teddy bears or other pointless material things. When you get rid of the profit angle, there's no need to produce or own those things.\n\nThere's also no need to own a factory or anything like that. You just use it. As I said, how would bitcoin even work if no ownership was guaranteed? Things that are needed would be taken and used. Things that aren't would not be bought or sold.",

Of course, it's only a matter of adding ' &ws= ' to the end of your magnet link and then adding a HTTPS:// link to the exact same file that the torrent contains, but stored inside a webserver.. then previewing this magnet link in Instant.io, downloading the resulting .torrent file .. and uploading the torrent file into the same folder as the original .mp4 you have on your webserver. Of course, this can still confuse a lot of people .. \n> You can actually use Dropbox to create webseeds. At least, until they fix the exploit which allows you to create direct links by using the dl.dropboxusercontent.com domain. \n> I'm using a VPS for my seedbox and it's got about 200GB storage, for $9 a month (6 USD). So .. it could fit about 220 movies.. or 500-700 TV-show episodes. And I'm friends with the owner of the VPS provider.\n> What I like about it is that I can just go to a friend's house and then just stream the movies I want instead of carrying a USB drive or installing uTorrent on their computer.. so it kinda benefits me as well. :p\n\nI've tried a few times now and I can't manage to get webseeded torrents to actually play properly. The only way it ends up working is if I open webtorrent desktop, let the page 'find' the peers, and then close webtorrent desktop and let the page download from the webseed. But of course that defeats the whole point of having them webseeded in the first place.\n\nEdit: Figured it out. KopyKate auto-filled the magnet link and using the magnet doesn't seem to work, but pasting in the link to the .torrent (like I did originally to load the upload page) allows the video to be webseeded properly. Sweet. Time to upload some videos :3",

I do have the money to donate to any of these decentralized projects if they are 100% user friendly for non-coders. I still do not see any improvement to ZeroBlog and other sites on ZeroNet are still buggy. There's still no good youtube site where people can easily upload videos. App Centre http://127.0.0.1:43110/1LANDERvVWbShpNWpsrbBvfqSK1PabXtwv/ has no apps. ZeroPlus http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NCRELKZ3zWRS6DijziYrfWi9dsUY8Fh8n/ Avatars don't seem work. Even gifs don't work on 0ChanPorn http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NZNtZQZHQRJXafvJpmY5jgqwRaCEZMsUc The only thing that seems to work ok is the email and your music sites and that's not enough to get people to use ZeroNet. I knew this would be another failed project and so far I've been right. I think I'll just start donating money to the poor people. You guys have a nice day.\n\nDude you sound like such a troll right now. You know how long it took for those sites on clearnet to start working? Youtube took probably a few decades before the technology was there. This is *bleeding edge* stuff. It's not gonna be facebook. I've uploaded videos to KopyKate just fine. It's entirely straight forward if you follow the step by step video walkthrough. How much simpler do you need? How the fuck did you even get here on ZeroNet if you can't follow simple instructions?\n\nAs for 'App Center' and 'ZeroPlus' I have never seen nor used those sites. The first appears to be an unofficial attempt at making zeronet into an 'appstore', which it's not. And the latter is a chinese site that quickly cloned zerotalk. Of course neither of those are going to be high quality.\n\n0ChanPorn... do I even need to say? It's clearly a quick/crap clone of 0Chan, which even itself is still a very new attempt at getting the chans on here. Be glad it even exists.\n\n>Email\n\nWe don't have email on ZeroNet. You're thinking of the messaging site ZeroMail. Which is probably the only thing on here that *doesn't* consistently work for me. I always find it has issues with decrypting, sending, whatever. Very buggy. If you want the good sites, ZeroTalk is flawless, and ZeroMe is easily the best site on the network. I'm also very fond of Play and my own site Kaffiene. KopyKate, while the UI kinda sucks, works perfectly for video sharing. I've had 0 problems with it.\n\nAs for 'music sites'.... we don't have one of those. At least that's popular enough to be considered one. Just some really quick thrown together tech demos. Which is most of what ZeroNet is at the moment, *because it's brand new tech that's available NOWHERE else*. But do please show me where you find this stuff if ZeroNet is so awful? Where's *your* P2P youtube? Where's *your* DISTRIBUTED social network? AFAIK, ZeroMe is both the most active, and the only *proper* distributed social network.\n\nIt honestly sounds like you're crying because you came into a place where there's still development going on, and is highly focused towards developers, and then started crying because it's not Twitter/Facebook/Youtube. Seriously? Those sites have been around for a decade. ZeroNet has been around 2 years, with most sites less than 1. The sites are all made by hobbyist programmers, and it's all bleeding edge stuff. There's gonna be bugs, and you're gonna have to use your brain at the moment.\n\nIf you honestly have a more userfriendly P2P web platform, please share with us. AFAIK ZeroNet is it. It's the best and most userfriendly. *All* of our developers here strive to ensure that the sites are very welcoming and open. As well as feature amazing tech. If you've got something better, I'm sure everyone here is all ears. We're here because ZeroNet is the closest we've found to our idealized distributed web and we're all helping to build it. If you wanna help, then by all means stick around. But if you're just gonna insult progress and pretend there's something better, then I don't think anyone really cares for you to stick around.\n\nHonestly? You sound like an entitled millennial trust fund baby who can't do anything for himself. While the money would be great, I doubt many of us care for capitalism in general. Personally I'm here to make that money of yours *useless*. I like people who actually give a shit and can see a good thing when it's in front of them. Not someone who's gonna act entitled and bitchy and pretend bleeding edge tech is comparable to decades old websites. Did you also stumble onto the internet in the 80s and say \"well this is all shit, where's my video streaming? Look at this, sites barely even link to each other!\" No, of fucking course you didn't. You came onto the internet like every other self-entitled fuck in the 2000's when everything was baby-fied for you.\n\n> I knew this would be another failed project and so far I've been right.\n\nFailed project and yet we have one of the more active userbases for truly distributed networks. Again, feel free to share with the class if you have something better. Personally, I'll drop zeronet as soon as something better comes along. I have no attachment to the project other than wanting what's best for the internet.\n\nIf you want something, spit it out. Give explicit details of what you want. Because from where I'm standing, KopyKate is *more* usable than Youtube. ZeroMe is *more* useable than twitter or facebook. In general, these sites are *better* than their clearnet alternative. They put power back into the hands of the user, and give you complete control over your data. How is that a bad thing? But sure, go back to your walled gardens just because they have thousands of people working on them for decades with billions in funding. If you're just gonna act entitled, we don't want you here.",

Kaffiene does this automatically. Sticking a port (even the default) can cause issues.\n\n>This topic is the same. A big pile of shit right in ZeroTalk. And people will complain if we censored the stupidity.\n\nPretty much. I'm completely open to helping people out if they get a little lost or confused. It's new stuff, confusion is inevitable. But someone just not even trying and acting arrogant about it like it's all awful is just ugh. I'm still really curious about what P2P distributed platform he thinks is *good*. Because honestly? I've tried most if not all of them, and ZeroNet is the best. If I had money, I'd donate. It's the one tech project out of the hundreds/thousands I've seen that I actually think is going somewhere. It's the new web and I 110% believe and support that.\n\n>I only coded the avatars in a day (which works perfectly for me ;) as proof that these are not major issues. \n\nAvatars on finished sites (ZeroMe) work fine. It's when you come across a buggy half-coded site and then complain zeronet is shit is when you've got a problem. I mean, you have to really expect it. I wasn't surprised at all to find half-missing documentation, lots of half-assed attempts at sites, but an overall enthusiastic, but small, crowd in support of this project. It's pretty much exactly what I expected when I signed up.\n\n> Paying rent is a major issue\n\nIdeally, once I'm done with things, paying rent won't be an issue for anyone. Shouldn't exist. But tbh that's probably the main thing holding people back. People can't work on free/future tech because we're stuck figuring out how to pay the bills.\n\n>Oh, but people want us to make a PERFECT decentalized internet first.. then they might \"cough up\" some money. Like.. yeah sure. How exactly does one sit, code, and not pay rent? Hmm.\n\nYup haha. Gotta have an exact copy of the current web, but decentralized. And then *maybe* he'll give you a dollar or two.

I already quit promoting ZeroNet months ago because I finally decided I will only promote things I can use myself. I can't use ZeroBlog so there's really no reason for me to promote ZeroNet.\n\nHopefully the non-coding aspect is still somewhat appealing. Personally I didn't do much coding for my own blog and it works fine (though I *did* customize it a bit). It's kinda hard to keep non-tech people when everything is still heavily WIP. I've been trying to get my non-tech boyfriend into zeronet and he's just been confused from step 1 haha. Personally I usually don't promote ZeroNet to people unless I have a reason. And so far those reasons have been for development, and for political reasons. I'd hate to say that tech-illiterate people should just leave, but a lot of this stuff honestly isn't as friendly as popular sites are. ZeroNet *does* take a bit more effort, as does every P2P software. It's a different way of doing things and sometimes you gotta be open to trying something new.\n\nHopefully ZeroTalk/ZeroMe/KopyKate, and other well polished sites are enough to keep you around. We definitely need more users, techy or not. The development side has honestly been kinda lacking, so I can see why people wouldn't find it that appealing. I see ZeroNet currently as a long-term thing, not as a 'replace the internet this second!' thing. Stick around, see what happens. You know?",

Your keys file also stores a signed message from the ID service to demonstrate it's properly signed. KaffieID simply has the server's private key available publicly, so that no backend is needed. This means that names are not guaranteed to be unique. From there, zites can accept IDs from certain provider sites, and with that you can have a chain of trust. You can trust ZeroID to have unique names, and as such if you see someone with a particular zeroid, you can know for sure it's them. With KaffieID this is not possible, since the whole point is to make it so names are not unique and freely changeable with no server backend.\n\nOn the backend, how your user files (comments, uploads, etc) are stored is based on this public/private key pair, rather than your ID name. This is why KaffieID still works. This is guaranteed to be unique for every single ID generated. The same user cannot freely generate new key pairs for a site easily; though you can by removing the keys and restarting zeronet. This feature is what lets KaffieID freely associate different names to the same keypair.\n\nThe keypair is associated from your ZN daemon to the particular site. That is, your keypair for KaffieID is different than your keypair for ZeroID. With that, you can switch between wholly unique accounts on the same machine, simply by selecting your different provider. You can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/UJFg65M.png) that I have quite a few different accounts I can access without restarting my ZN.\n\n> I want to know exactly how much shit will break if I have let's say 3 ID's for different purposes on the same pc.\n\nNothing will break. ZN was built with this in mind. However, having 3 ZeroIDs would be kind of a pain to set up, but you can do it.\n\n>since practically all zites that needs a form of authentication seems to have a select user button I assume it should be possible?\n\nIndeed. Though by default zites have a whitelist of valid ID providers. This is almost exclusively ZeroID, but a few accept ZeroVerse or KaffieID too.\n\n>But zeroid won't let you have multiple zeroid id's.\n\nIt will, but it won't let you generate a new one if you're already logged in. Basically, since your keypair for the site is associated with your zeroid, whenever you visit the site it'll detect your keypair for the site is already paired with a zeroid and not let you generate a new one. To get around this, you'd need to delete the ZeroID entry in your sites file, then remove the zeroid from your list of accounts, restart zeronet (making sure the stuff is deleted), generate a new zeroid, then restore your old zeroid account in your account list, and restart zeronet again. You should then have 2 zeroids in your list and can freely select between them, much like you see in mine how there's my @kaffie.bit and @kaffie.bit - hack. It's not *supposed* to be used this way, and most people find it easier to just set zeronet in multi-user mode and go from there. But it's possible to do.\n\n>So if I then use kaffieID or some other random ID service can I just roll around with 5 different ID's without zeronet either shitting itself or zites stopping to work altogether?\n\nYou must do the same process on KaffieID as well, even though it lets you freely change your name. As your account is actually the keypair, and the name is just a descriptive label for it. As you see in my list, I have two KaffieID accounts, and they both work fine on services that accept KaffieID. And since KaffieID doesn't care about name uniqueness, you can even have the same name for multiple accounts if you wish. Though some sites may rely on name uniqueness, and ZeroMe had this problem at first when I was testing all this. I happened to have user info of my other account fed to me improperly due to the name. However, as long as the site goes by public key for determining the user (as it should, since that's how the file storage is determined), then all should be well.",

Popularity is irrelevant to actual science.\n\n>If that were the case, we'd still believe the old popular theory of a flat world.\n\nMany people still do. They're all right-wing conservatives. Just yet another example of my point.\n\n>Also, what do you mean you can't debate about abortion?\n\nThe only debate that can really be had is \"abortion shouldn't happen\" vs \"we need it though or people die.\" These are not conflicting positions. What the 'abortion shouldn't happen' people are arguing is that the alternative is just everything is okay. Not that people die. That's not reality. But the other side \"we need anyone to have the choice for an abortion whenever\" also really isn't right. It's needed, in terms of medical, environment, and economic reasons. But it's not needed as a free choice, as there's many options for birth control. On the flip side, the anti-abortion people are *also* often against birth control, which are conflicting positions (you can't ban abortion and then also ban birth control).\n\nIn reality the answer should just be: make the decision most medically necessary, allowing for some patient choice in the manner like all healthcare. Which is arguably the liberal position.\n\n>Are your ideas on abortion so dead-set that even if new evidence were to surface would you not take a look at your stance again?\n\nThe only thing that'd change my stance on abortion would be the widespread and free use of artificial incubators in every case where abortion would occur. Because that would be the better alternative.\n\n>I'd be interesting in reading one of these studies; maybe I'm wrong.\n\n[1](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611421206) [2](http://2012election.procon.org/sourcefiles/Kanai_Political_Orientations.pdf) [3](http://www.uky.edu/AS/PoliSci/Peffley/pdf/Amodio%20Jost%20Neurocognitive%20correlates%20of%20liberalism%20and%20conservatism.pdf) [4](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0190272510361602) [5](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289614000373) (5 shows that it's the social beliefs, not the economic ones that demonstrate intelligence even among republicans).\n\nThat enough? And all of those have extra studies referenced in them. It's pretty clear that religion and conservative social views are correlated with less education and less intelligence. In terms of economic views, it tends to be unrelated to intelligence (which makes sense as there's solid and intelligent arguments on both sides).\n\nI could give studies that show why economic conservatism is also bad, but in reality *I* used to be economically conservative (the typical socially liberal, economically conservative). There's good arguments for it and many smart people support those views. But they're still bad long-term for a variety of reasons. I'd wager there's still an intelligence/education thing going on there, but less so than the social views.",

Quite the question as to how initial posting works; perhaps a filter searches for the auth_key first, and if found doesn't trigger creation function, while said creation function does not recognize anything other than the certSelect API call's array of accepted cert issuers. Something to poke later.\n\nYeah I just ran into this same bug. After doing some digging it appears to me that it's due to the modified name being listed as the cert signer. There's a field in the user's content.json which looks like this: `\"cert_user_id\": \"kaffie@zeroid.bit\",`. When the first description field is modified as in your example, when creating a new content.json it writes it as \"kaffie@modifiedname\". This then leads to a problem as zeronet checks the site's content.json for this:\n\n```\n  \"cert_signers\": {\n   \"kaffie.bit\": [\n    \"1KH5BdNnqxh2KRWMMT8wUXzUgz4vVQ4S8p\"\n   ],\n   \"zeroid.bit\": [\n    \"1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz\"\n   ]\n  },\n```\n\nWhich links the @whatever.bit to an actual address. This, of course, is yet *another* reason why names should *not* be used for unique identifiers. @nofish: needs to really fix these bugs and rely *only* on unique public keys instead of various domain names/user names/etc. The actual cert itself contains *no* information as to which site actually signed it. That's a huge problem. Ideally the cert should contain the address of the signing site, which is included in the content.json for the user. Then this sign+site address should be used to verify that it's legitimate and in the valid list of site signers. \n\nLots of problems unfortunately.",

That's not to say people who are pro-choice *want* abortions or like them, but that they should be determined by the doctor and patient, not by the law.\n\nAnd now to tear apart your idiocy.\n\n>People who have sexual identities problems like you think that this is such an important thing. \n\nI don't have sexual identity problems. But yes, I *do* find proper healthcare and equality, along with respect for all people equally to be important. It's obviously not the *most* important thing, but humans can multi task. There's no reason to be a complete douchebag and go backwards on rights while you try to solve problems. All it really takes is to leave people alone, and not be an idiot. It's not hard.\n\n>Like it's not like the planet is being destroyed, inequalities are bigger than ever, the financial system makes us all slaves, the mode of production itself (capitalism), is horrible. \n\nIndeed, these are all problems. Though really that's all one problem: capitalism. Which yes, fucking sucks. But it's not the only problem to fix.\n\n> No. All that doesn't really matter. LGBT rights and gender theory is one of the most important stuff to discuss about. \n\nYou're the one who brought it up. A completely irrelevant backhanded remark for absolutely no reason. And I decided to call you out on it. It's not like I'm randomly bringing up this shit every time I have a conversation. But morons like you are obsessed for some reason with \"finding out ivanka is really a man!111!\" like some sort of horrible idiotic tabloid gone wrong. Who gives a fuck? If ivanka is trans, who fucking cares? Why does it matter, *at all*? Being trans is a legitimate medical condition, and there are millions of people who are.\n\n>This gender theory came from crazy degenerates like Alfred Kinsey. \n\nLol I don't give a shit. I find modern LGBT stuff to honestly be ridiculous as well.\n\n>No need to have a Phd in Biology to know that if you have XX you are a female, and XY you are a male. \n\nThis is entirely incorrect. Sex is based on a variety of factors, and there's more chromosome configurations than XX and XY. So stop assuming shit with your 2nd grade education.\n\n>shit spread by planes (chemtrails),\n\nDoes the idiocy ever end? You're a fucking moron if you think this is the case. Can you seriously not understand what a contrail is?\n\n>stupid and sexual music clips shows at children at a young age (lady gaga, Nicky Minaj etc...)\n\nAmerican confirmed? AFAIK, most other countries are more open than sex than they are about violence. America is the prudes haha. Does it matter though? Lady Gaga is cool.\n\n>all of this shit create disturbance in the identities of the people,\n\nLol holy shit. Do you really think those are the reasons trans people exist? hahahahaha. That's so fucking dumb. No. The reason trans people exist is due to a birth defect related to the hormones produced while in the womb. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. Anime doesn't make you trans, sorry. And neither does anything else. It's just a birth defect like every other sex disorder.\n\n>and then some guys like you who haven't clearly identified the source of this say: gender are not defined by birth. \n\nDid I say that? I don't think I did. I know exactly the source. It seems you're the one who does not.\n\n>Of course it is defined by birth.\n\nIndeed. But you just went ahead and 'debunked' this with all your idiotic conspiracy theories.\n\n>Only after eating so much industrial shit, breathing this polluted air, and especially watching this crazy and really non human medias, one can lost feet and think he or she is of the opposite sex. \n\nNot only are you wrong about how and what trans people think, but you're also wrong about the cause. Think about it for a second. If those things were actually the cause, why would only a minority of people be trans? Certainly it should be an epidemic! \n\n>Since you are not stupid and can probably think in good faith,\n\nIndeed. I've already gone through this and many arguments like it and debunked them all. Which is why I find it hilarious and a bit upsetting when people like you come out and act like you know everything, and in reality just spread hate and don't know a damn thing.\n\n>did the primitive tribes have gender identities troubles?\n\nThe answer to that is unsusprisingly YES. Gender identity disorder, and being trans, are not new things. They've been around basically forever. Such people are included in more or less every culture in the world, most holy books, and indeed at least as far back as our current knowledge of history goes. At least, true transsexuality. I don't speak for the modern trends and shit, whatever those might be.\n\n>Does the last primitive tribes living on earth have gender identities problems? Of course not.\n\nThey actually do. In the same sense as everyone else. Because it's a biological issue, not a cultural one. The only real difference is that we just recently got the ability to do something about it.\n\n>Thus gender identities troubles are not genetic\n\nYou're right. They aren't genetic.\n\n>but only a consequence of this particulary crazy society. \n\nNope. Has nothing to do with society. Sorry but you're objectively demonstrably wrong here. Or by \"this particularly crazy society\" do you mean *all* of human society throughout history?\n\n>Listen to me, i reject all this progressive shit.\n\nYou reject actual medical science, yes. It appears you also reject actual environmental science, along with biology.\n\n>Not because i'm a bad nazi or intolerant bastard, but because all of it is a consequence of capitalism in it's final development. \n\nNo. Your idiocy is *not* a result of capitalism. It's your own damn fault you're retarded. The internet is available. You can read the research yourself.\n\n>There is not LGBT in a primitive tribes.\n\nThere is though. And the LGB part has even been observed in animals.\n\n>All these guys are lost souls who cannot even correctly point the source of their unhapiness.\n\nAlright. Tell me. What is the source of my unhappiness? Since you seem to know and I'm apparently a clueless idiot who *hasn't* read up on my own body and issues. I'm eagerly awaiting your answer to eternal happiness.\n\n> Same remark for alt right guys who think the problem is the gay or the migrant when the problem is money, hierarchy, the state, division of labor, delegation of power and property. \n\nAt least you can see capitalism is cancer. You've got that going for you at least.\n\n>Since i reject capitalism, i also reject capitalism's culture: progressivism. \n\nLol. Progressivism is basically the rejection of capitalism.",

[...]\n\nThe big question is the technical side of things. You have to make sure that git will actually push to such a site. I don't really know what goes on behind the scenes,but if you want to make some sort of ZeroGitHub, then looking at current ways of putting git repos on ZeroNet would be the first step I'd think.\n\nOne way could be to make a site like 0git, but as a merger site (kinda like zerome) and then have git repos act as 'hubs' that you can download and look through. Optional files are another way to go, but I personally don't like the centralization there. Every git repo managed by a super-admin of the site? Why not just benefit from ZeroNet's decentralization?\n\nUse something like what I linked as the hosting method, and then build some sort of github frontend that makes viewing them easy.",

How can I see them?\n\nRegistered ZeroIDs can be found in the zeroid.bit data.json files. So in your ZN data folder, just go to `1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz/data/` and you'll see users.json (newly registered users) and users_archive.json (older users). users.json has about 800 people last I checked, and users_archive.json has like 42,000 or something like that. So together that makes about 43,000 zeroid users.\n\nThe other number, for ZeroMe users is a bit more difficult. Theoretically the ZeroMe user registry (1UDbADib99KE9d3qZ87NqJF2QLTHmMkoV) would have every user who signed up for it. But that's not quite right. As it cuts out other IDs other than zeroid and zeroverse (kaffieIDs don't show up in there). And given that's a mess, I figured using the merged database would be better and is found at `1MeFqFfFFGQfa1J3gJyYYUvb5Lksczq7nH/merged-ZeroMe/ZeroMe.db`. Now if looking through an sql db doesn't sound like fun, no worries! I did the hard stuff for you already. You can find the python script I use to read the DB and scrape a list of users along with intro/auth_addr/etc. [here.](/kaffiene.bit/zeromeusers.py) And if *that* is still too much work, you can just [use kaffiene to search through the users.](/kaffiene.bit/?q=&i=ZeroMe%20Users) As you can see, Kaffiene's current index pulls up 8503 users from the DB. And the index can be found [here.](/kaffiene.bit/userdata.txt)\n\nPretty simple tbh. My ZeroMe count might be off though if I messed something up in my code. But AFAIK that should be the entire list (minus people who just signed up after I published).",

Hating someone for being a nazi or muslim or christian is bad. Hating nazism, islam, and christianity is perfectly fine. Hating black people is bad. Hating blackness is still bad. If you're attacking the person, it's hate speech. If you're attacking something the person did not choose, it's hate speech.\n\nThere has been hate speech against white people. See the SJWs/liberals and BLM. For more recent events, introducing a religion ban is *not* hate speech. Wishing to abolish and eliminate islam is *not* hate speech. Hating or harming someone who *is* muslim, *is* hate speech.\n\nHate speech incites violence by it's nature.

You can request other sites data, or users data ?\n\nMerger sites work by classifying a group of similar sites as 'hubs' or w/e name you want to give them. They have their own little section on ZeroHello, and each 'type' of hub is in it's own category. From there, whatever site can classify itself as a 'merger site' for a particular hub type. The merger site then gets access to all of the data hosted on the various hubs a user has downloaded of that type.\n\nSo anything that classifies itself as a 'ZeroMe merger site' will request access (and get it) for the ZeroMe hub sites. This lets you have multiple different merger sites that work similarly access the same data. And thus be able to modify the UI, or do whatever special functions on it you want. On the data side, anyone can start up their own hub of any type. So you can easily clone a ZeroMe hub and have it automatically listed among the rest of the ZeroMe-type hubs. No modification needed to any of the merger sites that access the collection.\n\nThis is really good for anything where users will store their data, since they aren't locked into a frontend merger site. If, for instance, nofish really messes up ZeroMe, you can just use one of the ZeroMe clones and not have to deal with those new changes. Likewise, you can use a hub that you trust, instead of relying on nofish (or any other merger site owner) to manage your data.\n\nZeroMe uses the 'optional files on hubs' system to host pictures. And, IMO, it works really well. Images have never been down for me, and they're perfectly decentralized and entirely optional to host.\n\nOne could easily take advantage of ZeroMe's image feature to create a filehost that hosts files unconnected with ZeroMe posts, but are still hosted by anyone who decides to \"host all files\" for a particular hub.",

It works just fine without cryptocurrency.Similar to BOINC, it works just fine without a cryptocurrency, but for those people that are interested, they can be rewarded Gridcoin for contributing to BOINC.So for instance vanilla ZeroNet could be sans cryptocurrency, but could have a version that has support for it also.  [...]\n\nIf you own 51% of the mining power of a blockchain, you can control what happens. It's a huge problem for bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies that have become centralized as difficulty rose. For smaller currencies it becomes an easy target, depending on the number of nodes.\n\nSo let's say we have ZeroNet coin. *Everyone* running a ZeroNet node then helps manage the blockchain and is a full blockchain mining node. Given ZeroNet has.... what? 5000 users tops? That means that an attacker only needs 2501 of those nodes in order to completely manipulate it.\n\nWhile this may seem extreme (it's easier when you have a mining pool that makes up 44% of users ;P ), keep in mind this is the scenario OP presented: someone having significant enough control over the network/nodes that they can manipulate traffic. Personally, I think the 51% attack would cause more damage and overall reduce security of ZeroNet.\n\nPersonally, I think if ZeroNet was going to add a cryptocurrency, why not just include a basic bitcoin wallet, or namecoin wallet? All the core dev-work is there, it's massively popular and watched like a hawk, and it'd fit right in with zeronet addresses/users by default.

There are plenty of variants of 'socialism' that *don't* require forcing you to do things (socialistic/communistic anarchism, for example). As for \"forcing you to commit some of your properties to the country/gov\", *capitalism* does this. Namely through the form of taxation, printing new currency (decreasing the value of your own), civil forfeiture, etc. And they *force* you to commit your time and work to uphold the existing system (don't like capitalism? time to throw you in a box or possibly kill you!) It's not much different than the authoritarian systems in say North Korea or China. People may *label* those as 'socialism' or 'communism' and then *claim* that the US is different. But fundamentally it's the same political structure. One has just progressed further politically (namely the more restrictive ones) and are more restrictive. But make no mistake, these are still capitalistic countries.\n\nA true socialistic system/country/whatever would be something more like ZeroNet or a mesh network. Everyone pitches in and helps, but there isn't any authoritative or coercive control over it. The *community* owns things, rather than a single individual being able to manipulate everything. This difference isn't capitalism (being 'better') vs socialism (being 'worse'). It's anarchism/libertarianism vs authoritarianism/facism.\n\nA free capitalistic web will look like what we see on the clearnet. Lots of companies censoring their sites, restricting access to data, putting up paywalls, etc. ISPs will censor sites freely, ignore net neutrality, etc. These are *capitalism's* ideas. It's 'free' in the sense that the *companies* can do whatever they like. Not the people. However, the criticisms of China and N. Korea are absolutely right. Those are extreme capitalistic/authoritarian systems. The exact *opposite* of what I personally advocate. Their capitalism restricts, their authoritarian government restricts. People aren't free nor equal.\n\nYou *can* have an authoritarian socialism. If you think of the political compass, it'd be at the 'top left'. With socialistic anarchism (what most of us here support) being in the 'bottom left'. Free unregulated capitalism would be in the bottom right, and what china/north korea have (authoritarian capitalism) would be in the top right.\n\nTo say you support capitalism, but then come to ZeroNet because you don't like the clearnet is *ridiculously* silly. ZeroNet goes against capitalism completely. There's *no* easy way to monetize content here.\n\n>I think he meant to say that you have more freedom of speech on sites like twitter -- while those are being maintained by commercial companies, there are way more FOS than in mainland China.\n\nThose sites do not focus on 'freedom of speech'. They are subject to the laws and rules on speech relating to the country they're hosted in. Facebook and Youtube in particular experience *heavy* censorship. Twitter is also known for lots of censorship on topics they don't like. They're 'free' in the sense that they allow you to converse without too much hassle. However, there's still tons of problems, and don't think for a second they'll stay that way if/when the US starts cracking down on the freedom of speech. The only thing protecting us on those sites is that it's legal to say those things in the US. Do note it *is* possible to use those sites in china. You don't *have* to use ZeroNet. So if they're so great? Why not just go use those? Personally, those are the type of sites *I'm* escaping from. They are much too restrictive.\n\n>Sometimes there's a thin barrier between languages and it's easy to get a few words wrong, so let's try to understand what each other is actually saying :-)\n\nNo worries. I was just poking a bit of fun. I might've been a little irritated at the time lol. Most people here (that I've talked to) *support* socialistic/communistic anarchism. So it's a bit silly to say the people actually on here are somehow 'inferior' while you support what we do. In my eyes, China is the end result of capitalism. When you let companies run free, and increase government control. I can't see where that is socialism or communism? Do they get free medical? Free housing/food/basic income? Are they able to opt-out of coercive capitalistic employment? Something tells me the answer is *no*.",

				"body": "My favorite thing about ZeroNet (that can't be done on clearnet) is super easy site cloning and hosting. It's two clicks max for both. Want to upload some content? New site -> paste your files -> sign -> publish -> share. That simple. On the clearnet? Well first you need to go pay for hosting (because who self-hosts? If you do, you need to call up your ISP for a static IP or find another solution), then you need to go buy a domain name, both of which you need to pay yearly for. Set up the nameservers properly so they point your domain to your host. Wait however many hours that all takes. Then ftp or ssh into your server and upload your files. It's a huge pain and expensive.\n\nThere's the censorship issue. But also identity. Since all sites have signed verification by default, you can be certain that content signed by a particular public key is trustworthy. Rather than wondering if it's the same user or if the site was hacked or if there was a MITM attack.\n\nThere's the whole offline and mesh benefits. ZN doesn't need centralized domain names, and hopefully soon won't need to rely on centralized IP allocation either (as soon as ipv6 and dht support get here so it can go on cjdns). Lose internet? still access sites, yay.\n\nAlways open source. Any site you see has the source fully available. The only time this is not true is when you leave ZeroNet (by requesting resources on clearnet/ipfs/whatever).\n\nWith Merger sites you've got a separated front-end/back-end setup, and back-end being decentralized and user-driven. This means that sites can rapidly improve through it's open source nature, data isn't held hostage (it's always the user's!) and front-end services can be swapped out easily. This means there's no drama or huge 'site takeover' issues. Reddit's mod team piss you off? Just use a different data hub. The front-end site sucks now? Throw up a mirror of the old code and use it with the same backend.\n\nAs mentioned earlier: users have control over their data! They have *full* (not partial or obscured) control over any data they post on ZeroNet. With merger sites it's possible to host your own hub, and therefore have *full* and uncensored control over your data.\n\nCentralized universal ID certificates! Lots of groups tried to push this on the clearnet but it always failed by design. However, with ZeroNet you can use the same ID practically anywhere. And with services like KaffieID, you can register your account completely offline and make no outside requests (completely private!). Albeit, no 'all signers' option for sites, so there's still problems there.\n\nSites are always up. This is great. No worries about DDOSing or hosting issues or government takedowns. You put something up, it will always be up, guaranteed.\n\nThat's just a few things off the top of my head. For the *user* there's not much benefit. The actual content and sites as of now are honestly worse and less active than clearnet alternatives. It's more an ideological thing, and hopefully better infrastructure.",

It's only 25€ or so, one time, and for domain, I first used a free Dyn-DNS-provider (No-IP), and now I somewhat switched (still re-activating the No-IP-domain :D) to a domain I bought, which costs only 0.75cents a month (or so,.. I forgot xD).\n\nSo lots of paid services, buying hardware, having to have an always-on server (even if it's a raspberry pi), and still running it off your home network and thus prone to all sorts of issues. Setup is also complicated and not intuitive.\n\n>Yes, I admit, it all was somewhat hard'ish to set up, but I mean, why not!? :D\n\nBecause the point is to make it *easy*. Let *anyone* be able to quickly put up a website with one or two clicks. I could probably teach my mom how to make a ZeroNet blog. But all that? No hope. Stuck in tech support hell lol. Obviously there *are* cheap ways of doing self-hosting (albeit not free). However, the ZeroNet solution is easier and cheaper.\n\n>About the thing that the user has full control of posting stuff, maybe,.. because I could just go into ThunderWave's code, and edit it, so that User 1 only sees messages from a selected range\n\nWell yes. Site owners have full control over their site. But if your run your own site or hub (like I do with KaffieHub) then that's not an issue. It's a caveat, but a minor one. What ZN offers is *leagues* ahead of, say, something like Facebook or Reddit.\n\n>Not everybody can code, not everybody wants to code, not everybody is concerned about his data's security (hmm, the last is somewhat not the case for probably any user on the ZeroNet :D), so if User 1 is just a \"normal\" End-User, why should he check the code?!\n\nThat's another good point. ZeroNet is *way* easier for people who don't want to code. Lots of things are 0 hassle.\n\n>Zites are not always up. If all users just delete it, or have no internet access, then the user wanting to access the zite won't be able to download it (xD that's kind of a stupid argument right there, but everything can happen (though, this is true for somewhat private website e.g. a blog)).\n\nThis is the theory, but in practice this doesn't happen. Take a look at something like the [Toki Pona blog](http://127.0.0.1:43110/tokipona.bit/) or [this little snake game.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1JsJ1JitaLboc8pvo4fxh9dvP8mt6toPrE/) The blog was last updated nov 2016 and still has 61 peers my laptop can see. And the snake game has 159 and was last updated feb 2016. These aren't exactly popular sites either. Even the least popular and dead sites (that are near empty) still have a like 5-10 peers. It's *very* rare that a site that was used at some point will go down. In fact, I've only ever seen it happen once with ZeroTV, which was destroyed through the will of the owner. And yet now we have a 90% mirror that will likely remain up forever.\n\nThere *are* flaws with ZeroNet, but it's a hell of a lot better than the traditional hosting model. Especially for amateur and hobbyist programmers, or people who want 0-configuration hosting. I'm pretty sure it's easier to set up a blog here than it is to use wordpress, tumblr, or medium.",

Basically:\n\nproxies - Needs relative links or links using that particular proxy.\n\npure domain - needs absolute links in the format that matches their config (unknowable), pure domains, or *possibly* (depending on setup) http://zero/whatever format.\n\nstandard zn - needs relative links or links that use the default port.\n\nmodified zn - needs relative links or links that use the modified port.\n\n---\n\nPersonally I think it's best to abandon the pure http://whatever.bit/ format. There's no way to specify it's zeronet. Instead people should use zero://lettersnumbers or zero://domain.bit as a way of signifying general links. It's possible to configure one's browser to use zero:// links, and in the future, it'll be easy to link software/browsers/sites/whatever. You'd know it's exactly a zeronet url too. Alternatively, using the standard http://zero/whatever works as well. This would get around the proxy problem, the weird need for relative links, and the mess with port numbers. However, it's not supported by default and thus may not work for many people.\n\nSo what's the solution? The solution is to use relative links that auto-adjust for pure domain and proxy users. That tends to work best so far. It's clear to the users, clear to the viewers, etc.",

Markets are difficult to do on ZeroNet due to data that's posted being typically very public. Likewise, there's no server-side code, making it hard to do transactions and purchases.\n\n>Ethereum Prediction Market (something like www.betmoose.com)\n\n>Decentralized dice game (something like https://www.vdice.io)\n\nIIRC people have attempted these ones before. But honestly, they're pretty unrelated. And it really sounds like you're just taking ethereum apps and wanting them on zeronet. Why not just go back to ethereum if that's the platform you enjoy? It's clear you don't care about the goals or direction that ZeroNet is headed and instead just want it to be a copy+paste of ethereum. There's a reason I'm here instead of on ethereum stuff.\n\n>Automatic site change log (a la wikipedia)\n\nThis takes up a lot of data, and sites are already getting too big for ZeroNet's architecture.

And something that autologs sites will never exist. I tackled these issues with developing [Kaffiene](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffiene.bit). Search engines can always be messed with, given they're just sites. You might want to check out Yacy for clearnet though. In the future I hope to make Kaffiene use the merger feature, so that people may use their own site indexes, that'd avoid the centralization of indexing.\n\n>Run over mesh network (in the near future)\n\nLots of people want this. AFAIK it needs IPV6 and DHT support before this can happen. But after those two things are done, it can be put onto cjdns, and thus meshnets. Soon, maybe?\n\n>Supports larger zites and media (think LBRY)\n\nFirst, lbry is shit. I wouldn't want ZeroNet to become anything like that. Second, this is already happening. Large file support *is* coming. There *are* media sites already, such as [KopyKate](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kopykate.bit). But there's not really a clean way of handling it yet. The big issue I see is that not everyone has a lot of storage space to throw around. This is the big reason blockchains don't attract people.\n\n>Easier to make/clone zites and/or zite\n\nWat. How much easier does it need to be? You can literally click a single button and have a site. To write a custom site you literally just upload the html/js/css. Very stupid simple and anyone can do it.\n\n>Decentralized VPN support for privacy\n\nThis will never happen. Use a 3rd party solution if you want privacy. Tor support is built in.\n\n>Decentralized CDN support for speed\n\nThis will never happen. Goes against the entire point of Zeronet.",

Or some other country. There appears to be a very large difference. I have not observed this in the antifa groups I've seen. But yes, there are some members of antifa who are, ironically,  authoritarian communists.\n\n>Free speech should include all the hate speech imaginable. \n\nDepends on what you're talking about. If you mean legally, then I absolutely agree. If you mean socially, I vehemently *dis*agree. And if you're talking about particular communication platforms, I disagree as well. People should have the *right* (as is naturally assumed) to say what they please. I do not see reason that this should go without consequence or social reactions. it should *not* hurt your livelihood or ability to sustain yourself. And certainly in some/many/etc. channels, there should be a restriction for the sake of civility. But in your own home or among your own groups? Sure, go crazy. This is why I disagree with ICANN and other groups interfering with domain names. Domain names should remain neutral, and let anyone direct names to their site. However, I am *okay* with web hosting censoring content they do not like. It's their servers, so they should have the final say, regardless of legality.\n\n>If I hate fat woman, I want to be able to offend them, if I want to offend stalinists, the same.

There's not really any way around that. There's no reason to do it other than just being an asshole.\n\n>Antifa as a movement were about muting hate-niggers yesterday, are about muting hate-trans today and will be about muting hate-stalin tomorrow.\n\nAntifa has very explicit goals and has not diverged from those goals in the time I've been watching them.",

The result surely qualifies as hate speech. By the way I hope you don't hate all the people who \"hate on people for intrinsic traits\" because this way you qualify too.\n\nJust an FYI, while indeed it is the same type of speech, there's a difference between literally having hate be your ideology, and simply venting and letting off steam when pent up. The latter is acceptable, even if it's not good. The former is unacceptable.\n\nIt's entirely safe to say that if you discriminate or legitimately hate people based on intrinsic traits, you are against freedom and equality. There's no other way around it. They're inherently contradictory.

Ask any anarchist or communist: There's no such thing as a white rights organization, there is only racism and white supremacy. There's no middle ground to stand on.\n\n*Any* movement based on benefits for those of a particular skin color are inherently racist, discriminatory, and against equality. That's the literal definition. That's not to say there can't be 'white lives matter' groups as opposed to explicit hate/supremacy groups. But like BLM, it's inherently racist, descriminatory, and promotes inequality. One should be pushing for *removal* of specific racial/gendered/whatever language in the laws.

You're aware of all the anarchists (and communists) marching around the US right now under the banner of Antifa who are literally holding up signs that say things like, \"Free Speech = Hate Speech\", right? Or burning giant signs that say, \"Freedom of Speech?\"\n\nI'm well aware. I, too, thought this was particularly strange. It's a core anarchist belief to reject hierarchy, which would mean you *can't* restrict speech. So I asked my fellow anarchists why there was this apparent disgust towards 'free speech'. They told me the reasons were two fold (and now I agree). The first is that 'free speech' is used as a dogwhistle for right-wing hate groups. It's not truly free discussion the advocates want, it's to be able to hate on people without social consequence. And indeed you see this in their spaces. Try to have a calm rational discussion, and the 'free speech' advocates ban and silence you. They don't want 'free speech' they want 'freedom to hate'. The second reason is that 'free speech' as it's used in the US today, doesn't actually refer to the ability to freely say what you want, nor say it without consequence. Instead, 'free speech' is used to refer to the 1st amendment of the government *restricting* speech, and controlling what you can or cannot say.\n\nIf you actually asked, most would actually be okay with calmly discussing things. Though, nazi views and fascism get a special exception. These ideologies in particular attempt to use discussion not as a serious inquiry into furthering each others' views, but rather as a platform in order to gain more followers. This is why a core concept is 'don't give them a platform'. It's not that anarchists want to *silence* people or make it illegal to say things. But rather, that the person should keep it to themselves, or among their circle, rather than spread it.\n\nLastly, anarchists do not believe you can actually restrict speech. Free speech isn't a right, it's just a natural thing people do. There's only what other people do in response to that speech. I personally agree with these views, which is why I've switch from supporting 'free speech' to supporting 'free discussion'.\n\n>They also wear spiffy t-shirts that advocate literally punching Nazis. Just the other day I saw a picture of a cake that was decorated in the style of the Red and Black anarcho-syndicalist/anarchist flag which said, \"Kill Nazis.\" \n\nThe people who do this on social  media are not anarchists (they're authoritarian communists). Some might be part of antifa, but legitimate serious anarchists *usually* don't do this unless it's a joke. If you ever see a nazi *actually* punched, there's almost always a bigger picture that's being ignored. *Or* the person who did it was then pulled back by antifa and anarchists. In fact, in many scenarios they explicitly attempt to keep peace. If you could point out specific examples, I can clarify the intent further.\n\n>Or maybe you meant the \"anarchists\" that still like capitalism, which many Marxist anarchists would also identify as Nazis... Read some of Antifa's pamphlets and fliers. \n\nAnyone who supports capitalism is not an anarchist. The two are mutually exclusive. As for the pamphlets and fliers, I see and read them. I actually follow various news organizations tied with antifa.\n\n>I still think the non-aggression principle holds value, \n\nI'm a fan of it, provided you remove the bits about property. I think it's very valid that people should not harm one another. And if they do, then it's okay to defend one's self or help defend one another.\n\n>Europeans can establish and maintain libertarian societies; we already have in the past and it worked out great. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with libertarianism or anarcho-capitalism. Both are wonderful ideologies I used to support myself. The problem, as I see it, is that they rely on capitalism to function. And capitalism, unfortunately, has many long-term problems. But in the short term it's wonderful.\n\n>I must say though, if you're really a libertarian, which I get the impression that you are, then why are you so strongly against discrimination in the laws? \n\nI'm not a libertarian. I used to be. I'm an anarchist like any other. I'm against laws themselves. But if we are to have them, they should apply to everyone equally. I uphold equality and freedom as two very important traits. As I'd be hypocritical to say I should be free while others must suffer. In my opinion, if you cannot accept the worst outcome of your political views, you should not have that as your political views. If you say 'X should be exterminated', then put yourself as X. If you say 'Being X should be illegal', put yourself as someone who is X. Would you still hold these views? A good example is to look at history. Women or blacks could not vote. Put yourself in place of women or blacks, or perhaps a black woman. Would you support this model of society? Of course not. Why would you restrict your own actions? As such, you've taken a hypocritical view. The only way to avoid this is to treat everyone equally and to provide as much freedom to as many people as possible. The only system that accomplishes this is anarchism.\n\n>BLM is roaming the streets shouting obscenities at people who are minding their own business, making credible threats of violence, rioting, looting, etc. \n\nI agree. BLM has many problems. I don't think the *spirit* of such is necessarily bad. But the way they go about it is toxic. Likewise, it's inherently racist, trying to provide benefits to only black people. I originally supported 'all lives matter' until I had learned it was yet another dogwhistle for the right-wing hate groups.\n\n>Do you see any \"Nazis\" or \"White Supremacists\" doing this, despite having superior numbers? If not, why not?\n\nI have, actually. The nazis and white supremacist actually recently *killed* someone. Rather than just rioting. Likewise, many such nazis and white surpremacists are part of the police force, which doe things like this constantly. There is also, of course, horrendously racist and anti-freedom ideals that they push. They're no better than BLM. Both are despicable groups.",

If you want to be the most 'uncensorable' then you'd want to host your own hub, much like what I do (I host my ZeroMe profile on KaffieHub, which I own). However, if a particular site, like ZeroMe (the client) gets attacked, every hub is safe since they're separate sites. Though a compromised site *could* have it's code modified to act on the users' behalf and delete their content or modify it in a particular way. Of course, users can clone their own client and then be certain it's safe, negating the attack entirely.\n\nI think a manual backup option would be nice.

And then if you sign/publish your new site, it'll be identical to the old site. There's an official feature for this where you can hit \"clone site\" on zerohello and it'll make a copy for you.\n\nYour computer will not send files until you 'publish' them. At which point other users check if they're properly signed. If they aren't, then they'll reject them. Meaning you can't edit other peoples' sites.\n\n>How know who is the true site?\n\nSites will always have a unique address that matches a bitcoin address. Same address=same private key=same owner (unless someone else gets access to the private key). ZeroTalk has the address `1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT` so if we go here, we know it's the site that nofish created and runs. Whereas other zerotalk clones can copy the site, sure, but they can't edit this specific address without knowing the private key.\n\n>And how can I edit my own sites?\n\nOnce you have a site (either click create on zerohello, or run sitecreate in the terminal) you can edit the files as you please. In the gui, drag open the top right icon and scroll down and you'll find the sign/publish buttons. Once you're done editing, click sign and then publish and it'll be good to go.

You can also visit sites that will log your IP (people can embed clearnet tracking service like visitor counter right), but unsure if they can discover more about you from that.\n\nPairing it with your ZeroID is a bit more difficult, as there's no guarantee that an IP is creating the post/data rather than simply relaying it.\n\n> [leftside](#comment_120_16dEowtNbV89NxPcDrAKkmnuXtiJVoVcDm): Here, another question arises. Can the hybrid(?) client (partial tor) behave as a kind of repeater between the clear net and the tor net?\n\nThat's essentially how it functions, yes. If a tor-only user posts something, and sends it to a hybrid peer, the hybrid peer has the info, and then relays it to the clearnet-only peer.

This lets you selectively sign stuff in order to guarantee unique names. KaffieID makes this key public, so that anyone may sign their own cert with whatever name they want. This means people can end up with the same name, since there's no check for uniqueness.\n\n> [leftside](#comment_256_16dEowtNbV89NxPcDrAKkmnuXtiJVoVcDm): If I clone your id.kaffie.bit site, what should I change essentially to make it work as a cert_signer different from id.kaffie.bit?\n\nWhen you clone the site you should have an index.html file and inside it should have:\n\n```\nvar genkey = \"PutYourGeneratedKeyHere!\" //Gen Key goes here.\nvar permissionaddress = \"PutYourPubKeyHere\" //Permission address goes here.\nvar certname = \"yourdomain.bit\" //This variable determines the @whatever.bit\n```\n\nThese are what you want to edit to make the cert_signer work properly (sign certs properly).\n\nTo get the genkey and permissionaddress values, you'll want to uncomment this snippet of code:\n\n```\n// Use these to generate a new key to create your own service.\n// var keyPair = bitcoin.ECPair.makeRandom();\n// document.write(\"<br>Gen Key: \"+keyPair.toWIF()+\"<br>\");\n// document.write(\"Permission Address: \"+keyPair.getAddress()+\"<br>\");\n```\n\nThen visit the site. Upon visiting the site, it will generate the gen key and permission address each time you visit the page. Grab a pair, and then edit the above variables. Feel free to delete this section of code (or re-comment). After that, you're done! And you'll have a site identical to kaffieID. The certname/\"yourdomain.bit\" is what will show up at the end of the cert names. So: for [name]@Kaffie.bit you'd want to set certname to \"Kaffie.bit\". If you wanted [name]@whatever you'd use \"whatever\". There's no need to actually use a .bit address there. But this site is what will be linked to when users are asked to create a cert id using that provider. So in KaffieID's case, it actually links to Kaffie.bit, not id.kaffie.bit. There's no way to have the display and link differ. The certname/.bit domain should ideally be unique, so that when sites use your provider, they aren't conflicted in terms of permissions (you don't want to use the same certname as anyone else).",

I believe, it will be much harder against a good identicon implementation.\n\nJust a heads up, KaffieID was never meant to prevent confusion between names. The assumption is that ZeroNet should be fine as it handles things with the auth_address. Instead the point was to allow name registration without an external server (so it can be done offline or on mesh networks), as well as give some more freedom over peoples' names (one user registering a name won't just lock off that name for eternity). And ultimately for those purposes it works perfectly. If there's ever any doubt over someone's identity, just refer to the auth_address, which you should be doing.",

What my post suggests is removing all of the clearnet trackers and instead replacing them with these zeronet bootstrapper trackers.\n\nUsing a specific domain name (pex.0net.io) would entirely defeat the purpose of my idea. Since my idea was to be able to replace the necessity of trackers (which rely on clearnet domain names and hosting) with just peers running zeronet in the first place. This means that when we move to a mesh, there won't be any worries about trackers, since our bootstrapped ZN nodes will work for that.\n\nSo to keep with the spirit, it'd be best to provide the *ip address* of the server, rather than the clearnet domain name. That way we can directly connect to it (and stick it in the tracker list) without bothering with clearnet stuff.\n\nI'm thinking we need something like the 1.1.1.1 dns or like google's 8.8.8.8.

Stores all accessed data at every node.Dispersing bits of files across many nodes in a way they can be reconstructed (using erasure codes) is much more efficient.Secret sharing systems use these principles: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharinghttp://ansrlab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/software/cdstore/Look at parts of IBM GPFSAnd the Mojette Transform - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojette_TransformLastly, this may be of particular interest (python): https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/zfec\n\nReplication is more important than HDD space. We have all the space we need. Tons of it. Terabytes upon terabytes. What we *need* is to ensure this data can never be deleted, taken offline, or corrupted. And replication just a fuck ton of times is exactly what can accomplish that. You can take down individual pieces, or disconnect one piece from the other and then you don't have a file. But if the whole file is in one place? You could take it down but there's thousands of other copies.\n\nEdit: Webtorrent is worse because it stores the file on a single computer, and then doesn't spread or seed 24/7.

I'm sure there are a tone of of stories about what PIZZA gate is and as it stands, the prevailing opinion is that said PIZZA shop is not guilty of any crime. \n\nSure. The exact pizzagate stuff isn't a guilty verdict.But it definitely is super suspicious. It's all the stuff *connected* to it that's a slam dunk. The most damning to me (that hasn't been cleaned up by the elite yet) is the elpida pedo logo painted on their mural. [Here's the pic on the official radcliffe foundation website.](https://radcliffefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_1764.jpg) So some background details: the logo you see on the far left is a recognized symbol pedophiles use to communicate with one another. This has been recognized by the FBI and used to bust pedo circles. On the right of the image you can clearly see elpida's name, confirming this is indeed a mural for elpida. That pedo symbol was actually their logo, but now they changed it, killed their social media pages and websites, and removed all scraps from the internet. The radcliffe foundation site confirms this is indeed elpida's mural.\n\nNow the radcliffe foundation and elpida are funded and frequently visited by.... you guessed it! The same bunch accused in pizzagate. That's pretty much as clear as you can literally make it. A known pedo symbol, used by an organization where they gather children, connected to a group of individuals already suspected of being pedos.\n\nThere's many other less \"slamdunk\" pieces of evidence. Like the talks of $65,000 pizza, or the pornographic images posted by Comet Pizza. Or the literal pedophilic comments made towards children on their social media. But often you see the MSM deny those images even exist, which to me makes it even more damning of evidence. Like they clearly exist, so why lie about it? Why would *snopes* lie about it? Why would *CNN* lie about it? It makes no damn sense unless they were trying to cover it up.\n\nSo what do we actually have?\n\n1. Emails that, if taken with a known code pedophiles use, become very clear discussions about molesting children. And if taken literally, make no sense.\n\n2. People connected to an organization that collects children and uses known pedophilic symbology as their logo and prominently displayed on their murals.\n\n3. These people frequent a pizza joint which posts tons of pornographic images, with many comments by owners+friends that are known pedophile slang and made towards children in suggestive poses.\n\n4. All talk of pizzagate is banned and covered up, erased from the internet. Any archive posts are erased from the internet. Websites are all immediately changed and removed content to hide anything seen.\n\n5. Every MSM site regardless of politics pushes out lies about the whole ordeal, and goes on for months reiterating that it's \"absolutely debunked\", \"a clear and obvious hoax\", \"obviously fake\", etc. With a kind of vigor never seen in any other rebuttal.\n\n6. MSM, including fact checking sites, *LIES* about what actually happened. Then they back each other up and try to hide the fact that they were lying about everything.\n\nTo me, this is pretty damn obvious that there's something here, and it's something related to pedos.",

Sites can have \"optional files\" which are essentially just files that are only downloaded upon viewing.

This connects devices that are connected directly to each other at layer 2, including devices on the same LAN, directly connected by ethernet or configured to use the same ad-hoc wireless network.\n\n>If you are unable to find nodes in the nearby area, a best effort is made to maintain a list of Public Peers for new users looking to join or test the network.\n\nSo basically.... the same issue. No automatic peer sharing just like with cjdns. Both only have auto-peering if you are on the same LAN (or a meshnet perhaps). So online peers need to be manually added.\n\n---\n\nTechnically this is more of a feature than a bug. Since the point of these networks is to provide accurate/quick decentralized routing. And to do that they construct a map of which peers you are connected to. With our online network that isn't much of a concern, as we don't worry about physical distance (all of our peers are far away and we just use the regular internet to connect them). For online it leads to the problem where we can't auto-connect to closeby peers, because we aren't physically close. Thus we end up having to manually build our map.",

If you do not think that is better, then idk what to say to you. Discord also selling data has been proven. There is a reason why the Linux community prefers Matrix/Riot.\n\nMatrix/Riot is *federated*, not *decentralized*. Each server is entirely centralized, but connect to other servers to share channels/rooms. And in terms of internet infrastructure it's *entirely centralized.* Not to say that discord is any better there, but I find federation to be.... not good. When you use a site it has a higher chance of going permanently down and you losing your account and access to the platform. Likewise mods are more likely to ban/suspend for petty reasons, rather than have an official mod team held to high standards.\n\nSo as a result most people just use the standard matrix/riot server, rather than the federated ones. Making it essentially centralized, which defeats the purpose. From there you end up with the same situation as discord, except discord is much better.\n\nWhat matrix/riot has over discord is really just that it's open sourced. Ultimately I find it's a good replacement for *irc* but not for *discord*. It lacks many of discord's features, fails to be truly decentralized, and still has the same issues of mod abuse. So while I'd use it over irc (which I don't use at all), I wouldn't use it over discord. At least for me personally.",

As federations lead to a communal centralized network.

To send a  response, you do the same thing.\n\nIf you clone zeromail, the cloned site and the original have no connection. So the same thing will result.

So any site can be cloned if they do a merger with other parts in the defined terms of software response usage program name. (This is what Lisp does to your brain.) lol..\n\nYou can \"clone\" any site merely by copying the content in the site folder (in the /data/ folder). Some sites have an option enabled where you can just click the \"clone\" button. But this does *NOT* merge the data, nor make all of the data accessible everywhere.\n\nTo do *that* you need a merger site and hubs. Compare ZeroTalk with ZeroMe. ZeroMe's content can be viewed on any site that fetches the zerome hub data. ZeroTalk can only be viewed on ZeroTalk. You can clone zerotalk and have a new *empty* forum without the same data. Likewise you can clone the zerome *client* along with a *hub* and change the hub system over to a new name so that it'll be a new network.\n\nIf you want to have a forum site that works like zerome, where you can have multiple hubs store data that is viewed across multiple clients, you'd need to rewrite the site  using the merger plugin and specifically set out to make a merger site.",

				"body": "Email itself is already \"decentralized\". How it works is that you send a command to the OS over the internet to save the message, addressed for a particular person. This later evolved into dedicated software managing the arrival of mail, and then to centralized services that provide addresses for people (so their computer didn't need to be on 24/7).\n\nThe way email works is that you point the message to go to the recipient's computer and user account. AKA user@website.com. The 'website.com' tells the computer where to send the message, and the 'user' bit tells the recipient server which user it's addressed to.\n\nWhen we start getting websites like ZeroMail, there's no more recipient address that we can use. If we tell gmail (google's server) that we want to send a message to kaffie@mail.zeronetwork.bit, it won't know where 'mail.zeronetwork.bit' is, and won't send the message. Likewise, therre's no actual *server* associated with that domain name. Instead of there being a server, we write the message on our *own* machine, and \"publish\" our data which sends it to other hosts of the site. The way the message is *stored* is also drastically different from traditional email.\n\nSo if you wanted to send a message from gmail to zeromail, google and gmail need to recognize that it's a zeromail address and then do the publishing properly for you.\n\nThe reverse is more difficult. How you send a message *from* zeromail is the same way: write and publish text to the website. The recipient must then host the website to *download* their message and decode it. So even if we write the message to zeromail, there's no guarantee an email recipient will ever receive the message, as they too would need to have zeromail and use it.\n\nThere's a direct incompatibility.\n\n---\n\nBitmessage works very similarly to zeromail. The big issue is figuring out how to send a message to \"everyone\" while simultaneously allowing \"everyone\" to receive. The way this is done in email is by having software compatible with sending email. Decentralized solutions may be able to *send* email (and indeed you can send email from your own computer), but *receiving* is the difficult part as there's no way to address it to the decentralized \"cloud\" and particular user. At least, not through traditional email software.\n\nSo in order to support clearnet email, the clearnet email services need to run the decentralization software. Which is just a pipe dream when you look at companies like google or yahoo.\n\nTL;DR: no hope in getting large companies to run p2p software, which means no hope in making their services compatible.",

To anticipate the obvious, no I'm not asking why someone is charging for a service, I'm asking, since all these other services are free, why someone hasn't set up a gateway to handle traffic for free as well. Have people just not thought about this? Is it too technically difficult for most? If it's not too difficult, and since it is a big hole in these systems, wouldn't it be very beneficial to set up a gateway service between ZeroMail and clearnet email just like BM has?\n\nSeems straight forward.

There's no way to  say where one begins and the other ends. Or how you enforce one without enforcing both. Just to be clear, privacy refers to having sole control over your information and visibility of it.\n\n>edit: although someone acting privately can increase such actions, (conspiracies/shaming) are not a product of privacy, i could argue that if i'm a private racist/conspiracy theorist i'm hurting no one until i go public.\n\nI wasn't talking about conspiracy theorists, who are usually acting *against* privacy. I'm talking about the people *doing* conspiracies. As for \"secretly being a racist\", while you're right in that it doesn't *overtly* hurt anyone, it can still lead to stochastic terrorism. Regardless, privacy *encourages* keeping these things a secret, and hiding them from view of others where they can properly be addressed. A \"secret racist\" may act covertly, slowly gathering support privately until it's much too late to do anything about it. Government officials could use their privacy to strike deals that are harmful to the public.\n\n>again, these things are not a product of privacy but rather of private interest, as the late Aaron Swartz said:\n\nThey're necessarily a product of privacy. As that's what privacy *is*. Could you clarify what you believe privacy is, if not having sole control over the distirbution and visibility of particular information?\n\n>The world's entire scientific ... heritage ... is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations....\n\nThis is privacy. This is letting corporations and the people running the corporations have their own privacy. The opposite of privacy here would be requiring full transparency of every company, all of their data sets, their source code, etc. Or look at it this way: you are asking to see their datasets and information. Would you also be willing to put up your entire drive to show the world what information you have on there? If not, why the hypocrisy?\n\n>The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it.\n\nThe open access movement is fighting against privacy. Namely it fights against sole control and ownership over a traditonally copyrighted work. However, *photography* is something that falls under copyright. Say a model takes photos of themselves and sells them. It's *copyright infringement* to then leak those photos you have purchased. The same as piracy. So in this case the \"open access movement\" is demanding that photos of models, whether they be sfw or nsfw, to be open and visible to all, and allow all to use/repost/share/etc. as people please.\n\nSo what happened to the model's privacy? Where'd it go? How do you ensure privacy while also ensuring open access to copyrighted works? As it stands, we all by default own the copyright to our own photos. This is, after all, how we can guarantee privacy. If you ask a news org to remove your photo, they legally must do so. But if this open access movement removes copyright, they no longer have to ask for your permission to post your photos/videos/etc. even if you don't want to share them.\n\nCopyright, at it's core, is a tool designed to facilitate privacy. DRM is an enforcement of that privacy.\n\nThe balance between open access/knowledge, and privacy is one that's pretty tricky in today's society. Privacy is needed due to the current state of things. But open access to information and knowledge is ideal. So as it stands, open access advocates like myself will generally concede to allow for privacy relating to individuals, while pushing to allow for openness of impersonal work and knowledge.

The recipient then shares it online for free. You are opposed to this due to a breach of privacy.\n\nIn terms of technology, how do you draw the line? How do you even prevent sharing of a single photo, let alone all of them? Why are photos in case 3 somehow more special than photos in case 2? Certainly the person's privacy is still at stake? And how is the photos in case 2 somehow more special than the photos in case 1? Certainly they're both being sold for profit, so they should have the same protections and rights?\n\nThe solution today is to treat them all the same: you have copyright over your own photo, and redistribution without permission is copyright infringement, which is a crime. Prevention of copyright infringement has been tried with DRM, but that has mostly failed. The only way to perfectly prevent infringement would be to have full control over minds and electronics to prevent improper sharing.\n\nIn terms of ideology, why is case 3's privacy somehow more special than case 2's? Certainly both people should have the right to privacy, regardless of what they do with their photos?\n\nCurious to hear your response. In my view, all three should be *freely allowed to be shared* once we're in an ideal society. However, for now, I agree that a line needs to be drawn somewhere. Case 3 is special because the person in the photo hasn't given permission to share, while in case 2 it was implied by the purchase (ie: porn was going to be seen by customers, and thus it's fine to share it as you would porn). Though as a woman it's a bit of an uncomfortable topic, since I'm not sure the average porn viewer makes such a distinction. Will people do the right thing and check and confirm that the people in the porn are okay with it being shared? Or will they treat any NSFW media that they receive as identical, regardless of how the person in it feels?\n\nThings such as x-ray photoshopping (real+fakes), and deepfakes are very concerning when you look at what people are asking to do with them (nudes/porn of people without their consent).\n\nI'm not really sure there's a good solution other than to either destigmatize (in the ideal open society) or to build a cultural and societal respect to not share (the feminist approach). I'm curious about your thoughts here.",

[...]\n\nMy stance, to be clear, is this:\n\nIn an *ideal society* (which we don't have, but we should try to reach), there should be no privacy and no secrecy. Everyone should instantly know everything. This should be normalized, and peoples' blunders/mistakes/etc. should be understood as a human thing, and in some cases indicators of future problems. Not as a witch hunt, but in a \"we're all looking out for one another\" kind of way.\n\nIn *today's society* (where we're at now), personal privacy should be heavily protected. As this sort of information can be used in an antagonistic manner. However, *public* information should be freely available for all. AKA scientific studies, world news, political leaders and what they're up to, etc. This way people can be *informed* but still *protected*. This *is not ideal*.

The \"risk\" is that a site owner goes rogue and pulls the site down. In practice we should start using merger/hub style sites, so that data can be decentralized into many hubs, rather than centralized on a particular site. And the viewing/merger site can be decentralized so that there are many ways to access that data. As you saw with the way kxovid works (my copy of the client lets you watch all the same videos).\n\nAnd *all* zeronet sites are safe from hostile external takedowns. The only way to effectively take down a ZN site is by changing the site to remove the content. But it's easy to backup posts and site content. Reuploading user posts i the only thing we aren't sure how to do effectively/quickly. Might just need a simple script to recursively go through a folder and sign all of the content.jsons.",

When I try to register an ID it says there is a 15 second wait but you can wait for half an hour and yet nothing will happen. [...]\n\n*All* user certs on zeronet are based on a public-private key system. ID providers then provide a signed cert with a name for that public key. When you sign into places you provide the cert, and it confirms if it's valid or not. In this way, the id providers can sign only certs that have a unique username, which guarantees name uniqueness on top of the regular public-private key system.\n\nKaffieID ditches that and provides the cert signer key publicly. So users of the site can sign their own cert on their own machine, making it truly decentralized. But since the key is public there's no enforcement on name format, or name uniqueness. So people can put whatever name they want on top of the public key. So when a KaffieID user goes to sign into somewhere, the cert is provided, and is always accepted since the cert key is public. This means names aren't guaranteed to be unique, but the auth public key is still unique, so the ID works fine, but lacks name uniqueness.\n\nOn the *site's* end, they accept the cert and manage files using the auth public key, rather than the username. When they display they can choose to display either the name (unique for ZeroID, not unique for KaffieID) or they can choose to display the auth-address (always unique).

We saw this with zeroverse which also had a centralized backend (and as a result you can't register for it anymore). KxoID seems neat in theory, but suffers from the same centralization problem. It's called [Zooko's Triangle.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1KiwiBCVBUcuypVm8FEmUW9YT6fJDXkN9r/?/imported/en/https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-zooko-s-triangle/zooko-s-triangle) You can basically have two of the following: Human-meaningful, Secure, or Decentralized. Something can be human-meaningful and secure (traditional username systems, but require centralized auth). They can be secure and decentralized (ie the random bitcoin-style addresses), or they can be human-meaningful and decentralized (KaffieID usernames are decentralized and legible, but doesn't ensure uniqueness).\n\nMost decentralized systems, including zeronet, use secure+decentralized as the basis, and usually put decorative non-unique text on top. Things like namecoin have actually sort of solved zooko's triangle, albeit the \"centralization\" is the namecoin network itself (and thus not truly decentralized). This is why zeronet uses it for domains, it's legible and \"decentralized enough\".\n\nBasically for a true decentralized system, we need either \"secure and decentralized\" (which is our ZN basis) and/or \"human-meaningful and decentralized\" (which would be our aesthetic layer on top). KaffieID, like other zn id providers, uses secure+decentralized as the auth, but then puts self-selected/non-unique decorative names on top. This is the best solution we have for truly decentralized names at the moment.",

Basically whoever has it can sign the certs. So hiding it and keeping it centralized allows you to sign certs selectively (pause signups, guarantee name uniqueness, etc.), but if everyone has it, or a lot of people do, then people can sign whatever cert they want, even if you take down the site.",

Like how can I use the private key to sign certs without making it available on the zite yet at the same time being able to generate working ID's but without a php backend? Or is that not possible?\n\nThere's no way to make the private key usable but unable to be exploited. The only way is having centralized control over the key, and using some centralized backend (either by hand or by computer) to sign certs. Since you need the key to sign the cert, and if you make it usable/visible to the client, then they can use it for whatever. So instead the client sends a request by sending their public key to the backend centralized server, which signs the cert, and provides the signed cert to the client.\n\nThere *are* ways of having decentralized name allocation, such as namecoin. But afaik such a thing isn't possible without a blockchain.",

You either need a centralized person or centralized system to hide the key and do the signing for you. Blockchains can guarantee name uniqueness not through a private cet signer, but through blockchains recording who owns which name (similar to how it tracks currency). But even blockchains are sort of centralized (in that you have to be on the same network).\n\n>And if possible how do you hide the private key from the zite?\n\nYou either just don't put it on the zite, or you put it on a private centralized backend server (like what zeroid does).\n\n>how would one go about signing certs by hand or manually\n\n>Where do you generate these public/private keys? Thank you.\n\nYou can see how you can go about signing them by hand, and generating your own public/private keys by checking out the KaffieID source code (just open up the folder and look at the files). KaffieID has pre-written code for generating the keys, and for signing certs. The cert signing you'd just do on the centralized owner's machine (and not publish the private cert key to the zite like I did with KaffieID).\n\nIf you're asking for a way to sign certs while hiding the cert private key, without using a backend server.....

ISPs also have the ability to see which IP you connect to (which a VPN or TOR can help protect against). The usual stuff basically. \n\n>When using a VPN connection is there any leak issue (WebRTC) with ZeroNet?\n\nZN has the same vulnerabilities inside of your browser as traditional sites. webrtc leaks can happen, though ZN protects against redirects and keeps sites sandboxed inside of an iframe.\n\n>All ZeroNet sites data are stored unencrypted on the local disk. Is this just because of the P2P technology or due to performance ?\n\nHonestly it's probably just due to laziness. Though performance could be a reason as well. There's no reason files can't be stored encrypted.\n\n>Supporting the net itself, is there any kind of full-node setup (like i2p) ? ... or just setup a raspberry with a SSD and keep it running 24/7 ?\n\nZN has zeroconf over lan, and works with all types of meshes (ipv6 meshes included). It doesn't do any of the internet side of things. It's software ran on top of an existing network. You can pair it up with cjdns to have a zeroconf mesh net w/ zn web, which seems pretty neat. Yggdrasil is another option. ZN does have a few options for dedicated servers (multiuser mode and such).\n\n>Is there any trust method / trust ranking for ZeroNet sites / ZeroIDs to highlight \"good\" sites / IDs and guide newbies ?\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/sites.zeronetwork.bit/ is the \"official\" site that people use for sharing sites. It has likes/favs which can help direct attention to good sites. I also made [a search engine called Kaffiene](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffiene.bit) which can help search for popular/well-seeded sites, though I haven't updated it in forever so it's a bit out of date. Generally speaking people will just drop links either on zerome or here on zerotalk. There's no built in method to highlight good sites, and all sites are treated identically by the ZN software. There *are* shared blocklists that help put up warnings when you end up clicking on a not so good site (CP, porn, etc.) They're entirely optional. And only block them for yourself.\n\n>When downloading sites, how can we protect ourselves from auto-downloading and contributing malicious content ? Any protection from ZeroNet or is it up to the users ?\n\nSee above. There's blocklists which will prevent you from going to a site unless you manually click \"visit anyway\". ZN *only* downloads things that you visit/look at. Nothing else. So if you never visit a site that has CP, your computer will never download/share cp. Sites themselves can be moderated by the owner and approved moderators for the site so if something bad gets uploaded to a site, the site owner can remove it. **The site owner has full access to the site and can edit any content that's visible on it.** You can delete a site by pulling open the sidebar (click and drag that circle in the top-right over towards the left) and scrolling down to \"delete\", there's some other goodies in there as well. You can also delete sites from zerohello (the main page) by clicking the \"...\" next to it. And also delete individual \"optional files\" (files that only dl on viewing, rather than on visiting the site itself) through the \"files\" tab on zerohello.\n\nYou can also manually stop seeding individual sites without deleting them, if you choose to do so.",

But yes, specifically I'm referring to the rejection of the standard MO of western civilization: the concept of a singular \"job\" done for a token, which can be used to trade rights to particular physical things, rules enforced by a violent monopoly done in the name of \"keeping order\", and machines based on oil/coal/non-renewable energy.\n\nEven asian and south american countries have fallen to this way of living. Communism was a decent attempt at fixing the various problems, and did well for it's time. But ultimately it becomes clear that having a centralized management is too prone to corruption.

				"body": ">Say someones a faggot and uploads cp. If i happen to download it, it gets shared from my computer, right? \n\nThat's correct yes. The only way that you end up downloading it is: if you download a site it was directly uploaded to (kinda uncommon since pics are usually treated as 'optional files'). *Or* you visit the image directly in your browser if it's an optional file (ie seeing an image posted on some website, marked as an optional file, it won't be downloaded until you load that page/image). For the latter you can see this functionality in zerome, where it has an explicit \"click to view\" feature, and won't download images unless you click on them (at which point there's an option to delete the image from your machine).\n\nSites allowing direct image uploads from users without optional files is kinda rare, as it'd bloat the site and make it kinda large. Most just do it as optional files, though not all have click-to-view.\n\n>And if i dont notice it bunch of people can download it from me? So im a distrubutor at that point, arent i?\n\nYes. This is why it's best to use sites that don't allow direct image uploads from users, and instead uses optional files, and ideally sites that have the click-to-view feature, along with an easy way to delete them.\n\nGenerally speaking there's blocklists for cp, porn, etc. and other things you might not want to be spreading/looking at. This will prevent you from downloading anything from those users, and anything from blocked sites unless you explicitly allow downloading the site.\n\n>If somebody wanted to destroy the community, all he would have to do is to spam cp all over the place until everybody gets scared and leaves?\n\nIn the case of spam you can block the spammer and download nothing from him. And site owners can ban people from posting on their site, along with deleting content people posted. So if someone tried to spam cp on my zerome hub, for instance, I could go in and delete their content and ban them from my hub.",

The ZN client downloads whatever you look at/visit and shares it immediately. There are domain names through the namecoin network. It can autoconnect with other machines on the same lan, and has full support for mesh networking. There is support to allow multiple users to edit the same site (in subfolders with an in-depth permissions system). And functionality to allow for DB reading to make site development easy.\n\nDAT is a protocol that's primarily developed inside of the Beaker Browser (which was made for DAT). it is not supported by any other browser, and cannot be ran as a standalone thing. DAT does *not* download what you look at/visit and share it automatically, but instead works as a more self-hosted solution, which other people can \"mirror\". DAT sites fail to have any user-interactivity as users can only edit their own site. It fails to have any sort of live interactivity at all. So stuff like zerotalk or zerome is impossible in DAT. There are, AFAIK, no domain names either. No way to allow multiple users to edit the same site.",

This includes calling things \"hate speech\".\n\n>I assume that we can say EVERYTHING, we just CAN'T DO EVERYTHING, because as soon as I try to hurt someone PHYSICALLY mainly, there will be a reaction, alias we can have a reaction from someone even talking, so it's ALWAYS GOOD, we have in mind that not everyone reacts the same way to what we say.\n\n>But like HERE, let's just talk or write, there will be no physical contact with you and anyone who is offended may very well block the person.\n\n>I believe the wisest thing is to cherish total freedom of speech / thought.\n\n>But with one detail, if ANYONE disagrees with this, the MAXIMUM this one can do here is block me on his page and or mutate me.\n\nWhile you can't harm someone physically over the internet, you *can* use words as propaganda to drive hate and a desire to harm one another. Which leads into wanting to invade and attack those who have done wrong \"hate, violence, terrorism, etc.\" and as a result can indirectly lead to physical harm.

Some good examples are discussing pedophiles, discussing eugenics and racial theories, etc. Generally speaking, in our oppressive society you'll find *even discussing these ideas without accepting them* gets you branded as a pedophile, racist, etc. and your speech censored. The use of slurs isn't necessarily a good canary, since they can be \"reclaimed\" and used by imperialists without any public backlash. \"Queer\" is a good example here. If the elite decide to \"reclaim\" the word \"nigger\", then it can be used despite oppressive censorship and thus fails as a canary.\n\nI find people who have a desire to say it typically wish to use it genuinely, rather than as a free speech test. IE hating a particular group of people without clarifying the reason for their hatred. And that hate is usually due to propaganda and poor education.\n\nThe modern approach by imperialists to this obvious canary problem is by making concepts impossible to discuss through conflated and obfuscating the meaning of words. Saying \"nigger\" may get you banned from pro-official-narrative media, but it'll be accepted with open arms on controlled opposition sites. It's allowed because racism against arabs and africans is part of the \"war on terror\", just an unspoken one (and pushed by controlled opposition). But once you start discussing the actual concepts underneith, that's when you arrive at a problem. For example discussing whether arabs are inherently violent, or if the violence is caused by islam, is not an allowed topic. The controlled pro- side will call you a racist and shut it down. The controlled anti- side will ignore the distinction and attempt to conflate arabs with islam. The actual discussion of the matter simply isn't allowed by either official side and will be shut down almost immediately.\n\nSame for africans. If you talk about how africans are actually *6* different races, the left will simply deem you a racist and shut it down. The right will just conflate them all as \"they're all niggers/subhuman/etc\" and shut down any attempt at distinguishing. Are some genetic lineages of africans more inherently prone to problems than others? This is an idea we simply can't discuss under the current imperialist empire.\n\n---\n\n> [caropc6](#comment_22_1NwrEqNkark7rqYFZatB1pLPmwz1TA6mDT): Kind in the previous government were no longer respecting private property and basically wanted to implement the SAME kind of china and cuba government here.\n\nAFAIK china is currently heavily capitalist/imperialist.\n\n>Trying to privatize and diminish the state, tax burden and so on.\n\nThis is the imperialist goal: to have all functions privately controlled by the wealthy with no way for the poor to have a say.\n\n>Like, it's less worse than a year ago, as we're getting closer to the US model of government, \n\nGod help you if you end up like how we are in the US.\n\n>as the hitler's party, which to me demonstrates that the Nazis would be leftist and not rightist as scholars and specialists insist on saying, because just like Nazism (pt), the The workers' party here from my country wanted the same thing as the Nazis, they even hated the Jews.\n\nHitler and the Nazis were zionist and imperialist.

For example, here in the US you're treated worse than animals if you're unemployed. And employment isn't guaranteed. If you aren't fortunate to have good social connections you end up homeless, starving, without healthcare, lack of transporation, and ultimately a restriction of freedom. Being employed ends up consuming most of your time community and performing pointless slave labor simply for enough money to eat and a place to sleep, also restricting freedom. None of it is needed, which leads to most work being entirely pointless and only done to keep capitalism running.",

I'm not here to have my current beliefs further validated by other people...  what I find interesting is academic/intelligent discussions about topics we aren't allowed to talk about (or at least not outside the parameters our 'leaders' enforce).... race, technology, alien life, the future, psyops, etc.  Partly because I find it very entertaining, and also because I'm seeking some \"missing pieces\" in my perspectives on the world, and I strongly believe that seeking esoteric knowledge on this topics give you the potential to gain a powerful unique perspective on the world, which you can benevolently impose on the world in powerful ways (inventions, creative writing, art... any medium that is created by your mind).  That is why I'm always drawn to the frontiers on the internet.... first on TOR, and now here.\n\nYup. It's astounding how topics are shut down by pseudo pro and anti sides. Aliens are another good example. Pro side is \"aliens may exist but we haven't found them yet, weird\". Anti side is \"the gov is conspiring with evil aliens\" and the anti side is deemed \"ridiculous\" even among many conspiracy theorists. Go ask them about reptilians and see the response. It doesn't matter what you personally believe, any discussion of the topic is shut down.\n\nPsyops are the same way. With the el paso shooting I saw some threads popping up about how the father was a psychiatrist who worked with people involved in MK ultra. This discussion was shut down and effectively banned by a number of sites. Some people suggested looking up some independent blogs on it. The writer who discovered this, Kurt Nimmo, ended up being a writer hired by info wars to do controlled opposition, and later called them out on it.\n\nIt doesn't matter what your views are on kurt nimmo, mk ultra, or the connection to the el paso shooter. It doesn't matter if you believe the shooting was a psyop. Any and all discussions of that avenue are shut down. But are those dedicated to exposing the deep state really looking out for you? Perhaps they're correct in that dissenters are just propagandists of the opposite side? What is the opposite side anyway? Do we even know? What is the goal of countries like north korea? or islamic countries which are independent of the european powers? What is their motive in all of this? Are they funding dissent so we're funneled into their regime instead? You can't even discuss topics like these in the current climate, and ignorance is what leads to people being conned. So it's important to be able to discuss them, without any sort of name calling or antagonizing one another.\n\n> [caropc6](#comment_23_1NwrEqNkark7rqYFZatB1pLPmwz1TA6mDT): What you said is what I understood what the US based on youtubers would be like. [...]\n\nYeah. If you just find some poor americans they'll let you know how it really is here. Fortunately internet accessibility is basically universal here, even for most of the poor. This means that even if poor we can properly educate ourselves, provided the internet remains free and open (which is something the deep state is trying to stop).\n\n>That basically either you have money or you're fucked, because NOTHING is free there.\n\nThis is correct. I'm \"blessed\" to live in the liberal/leftist california where my healthcare *is* covered, due to my poverty. But for food/shelter I'm reliant on others who generously help out. If I were in a different state, I wouldn't be able to get healthcare either.\n\n>I don't think, I think IF you think there's anyone in need of help, YOU as you seem to be worried, should help and not the state.\n\nI would love to help others but I'm unfortunately economically pinned. Since I'm dependent on those I'm close to for food/shelter, the only alternative if I wanted to move somewhere better (we're in a pretty rural area) is to basically just starve and be homeless. If I tried to revolt, I'd quickly either be killed or locked up. If I tried to flee, where would I go? Two sides of the nation are ocean, and one is a worse country (mexico). Could I flee to canada? From what I hear they're just a slightly upgraded US, and I'd be unable to travel that far anyway (I'm in the southern half). Not a fun situation. Right now I'm just focused on improving my health and planning my next move. I'm also pushing for Andrew Yang to become president, so he can enact a ubi ($1000/month). That would give me enough economic liberation to manage to get out of my rut. The big problem is that the problems the US face are systemic. So even if you fight the symptoms, it'll keep happening until major structural reform happens. And class consciousness simply isn't aware enough for that.\n\n>NOBODY stops you or anyone else from helping people.\n\nI help people where I can. But here in the US \"helping people\" usually just means giving them money. Since money is the end-all be-all here. And I have no money to give.\n\n>I find my system of government less worse, because I think anarcocapitalism or libertarianism is better for this, because NO ONE should be stolen via taxes to help anyone.\n\nAncap/Libertarian helps the elite and makes situations like my own even worse. It pushes inherent reliance on the capitalist system and needing employment and social acceptance, otherwise you get tossed out and called a criminal. You've bought the controlled opposition. The sides economically are: pro-narrative bigger state to help the poor, anti-narrative ancap because the gov is bad at helping people.

Thanks for proving my point.\n\n>These questions aren't specific to ancaps (true anarchists). \n\nAncaps aren't true anarchists. As capitalism requires coercive hierarchies to function.\n\n>How do YOU enforce the concept of no ownership?\n\nThe laws of physics? Ownership isn't a thing that actually exists. Objectively speaking. So if you violently assault someone because you believe in fictional nonsense, you're the one initiating the violent assault, and are the problem. People are free to believe what they want, provided they don't harm others. If you want to believe you own something, as long as you don't harm someone over that belief, you're entirely fine.\n\n>What will you do if I simply disagree I don't own the things I claim to own? \n\nNothing? You can believe what you want. The problem comes when you violently assault people to force your will onto them. At which point people would resist such violence.\n\n>Assault?\n\nI wouldn't harm someone over a disagreement, no. But I *would* defend myself if violently assaulted.\n\n>Ancaps will let you have a commune if everyone agrees to it, would you say the same?\n\nIn practice this is never the case. Capitalism can't stay in it's own lane and *must* always infect everywhere else by violent invasion. As capitalists go into the society without ownership, then take the things there and claim to own it, and when people are naturally upset by this they violently attack those upset, claiming they're \"stealing\". When in reality it was the capitalist who stole it from the community. Capitalists simply can't behave, and are violent barbarians who take from society and hoard it to themselves.\n\n>Rights are a reciprocal understanding. Once you no longer reciprocate, I no longer have to reciprocate.\n\nYou're free to believe what you want, but if you use violence to force your will onto others, that's no longer a free and peaceful society, and becomes one that people will naturally resist.",

No one else can tell you what to do with your body, and even if they do they can't force your body to do what they want.\n\nBy this logic you can \"sell ownership\" of your body and effectively be a slave? Fuck that nonsense.I don't \"own\" my body. I inhabit my body. I *am* my body.\n\n>You are the only entity capable of full control of your body, so you own it.\n\nI disagree. I don't know of a single person who is capable of full control of their body.\n\n>If you own your body, you also own the affects of your body.\n\nProof?\n\n>It is not someone else typing this response, it is MY response.\n\nYou don't own it. I can easily copy it. It's a response written by you, but it's not \"yours\" in the sense that you own it. Fuck copyright.\n\n>If you do not own the affects of your action, you logically can not be criticized for the affects of your actions either, because they are not yours.\n\nYou're confusing the *actions* you perform, and the *thing you act upon.* If I say a sentence, my body produces auditory waves that can be interpreted as a sound. I don't \"own\" that wave. I produced it by using my body to speak. But that wave is not mine. Similarly, if I perform an act, say building a computer. That computer isn't \"mine\". I don't \"own\" it. I created it, but there's no proof or way to determine it's \"ownership\" because such a thing doesn't actually exist. If I plant a seed and grow a plant, I don't \"own\" the plant. The plant is a living thing separate from myself. Do plants own themselves? Why does this magic concept of ownership only apply to humans? Do rocks own themselves? What about animals like cows and chickens? Do they own their body?\n\n> if we use our body to produce something, we should naturally own that thing too. \n\nWhy? There's no reason to assume this. If I use a pencil to create marks on paper, while I performed that act, I don't suddenly own the objects I acted upon. Why would I? if I shake your hand does that mean I now own your body? What actions grant me ownership? Is there a list? How do we determine which actions grant ownership and which do not? Or is it.... your arbitrary opinion with no basis in reality?\n\n>If I used my body to plant crops and then harvested those crops, no one else would be entitled to those crops.\n\nDo the plants not own their body? If a woman gets pregnant and grows and harvests the fertilized egg/human, is she entitled to that newly produced human? Does this apply to chickens? If you mate chickens and have them give birth to a new one, do you own that chicken? Where are the lines drawn? How do we know? What objective measure is there? Or are you just making it up as you go along?\n\n>Since I own the labor of my body, and my owned labor produced crops, it would be a theft of the labor I expended creating that crops. Hence, it is my property. \n\nSo: women own the labor of their body, and their owned labor produced babies, it would be a theft of the labor they expended creating those babies. Hence, those babies are their property? Am I following this logic correctly? Or does it suddenly not count if it's women's labor? And since you said bodies are owned, that means that she owns those babies who are raised? Slaves? So if the slaves revolt, then that's theft? I think I'm getting the hang of this.\n\n>First use is justified because anything is allowed as long as you are not infringing on other's property (which means includes their body, their most sacred property). \n\nRight, so you can't infringe on a woman's body and take her property. Which includes eggs, uterus, etc. And since she produced the human, it's rightfully her property. And so infringing on that property isn't allowed?\n\n>Then i can tell you to fuck off. I own my shit.\n\nCool I don't really care what your beliefs are.\n\n>Just because you don't agree doesn't make your viewpoint valid.\n\nOh are you trying to claim your view is somehow objectively correct? Can you show me an objective way of measuring ownership?\n\n>If I don't agree cutting off your arm is assault, it still is assault. \n\nNo. You're trying to redefine language. I entirely agree that theft is taking something that someone else own's, without them agreeing to it. I just disagree that you own anything. Ownership and property rights *are* an opinion, which is why it differs in region to region.\n\n>Boss + employee relationship is not coercive. It is a voluntary interaction that both can leave at any time. \n\nAnd starve to death?\n\n>Why? I thought morality was subjective? Are you going to violently assault someone for disagreeing with you?\n\nDo you not agree that peace should be the foundation of a modern civilized society? If not, you're someone I don't want in the society in which I live. Why bother with civilization at all if you're okay with murdering one another?\n\n> [bigbadbob](#comment_94_1CLhLYdMKjXtium9yjuRkSnFvPfdoUTXAj): I think you might misunderstand a little on this one.  When i say house im literally talking about a house.(personal space)  Someone could walk around my house without having mobility restricted.   If someone walked into your personal space and wanted to argue about ownership of said personal space... what would you do?\n\nYou're already starting with the assumption that the fictional idea of \"ownership\" is a real thing. Under our oppressive society yeah, I can see the issue as deprivation of resources means greater problems for myself. But under a proper society that isn't oppressive, there's no issue and I wouldn't mind if people share a space with me.",

Would you kill me if I'm incapable of understanding your nonsense? Do you have proof that plants and animals cannot understand?\n\n>it does if nobody owned them before (unlikely because they are a produced good). First use is only applicable if no one owns the thing before you.\n\nHow do you objectively determine if someone has ever touched a particular object prior to you? I can't fathom how this is possible? If everything relies on trade, and everything is owned before you are born, how can you trade? Your system is idiotic and favors those who were alive earlier, for no real reason. And you can't even explain how people can be born without theft. Do you believe theft is the original sin?\n\n>No because rights are affordable to all who are or will become sentient. Every human life is sacred because we all will become sentient and capable of respecting other's rights. \n\nSo then being born is stealing from people?\n\n>You engaged in an act that you knew had a possibility to lead to a sentient life.\n\nPregnancies from rape are a thing. Also it doesn't matter if the life is sentient, is it not your body? Your body produces something effectively out of thin air (through food/energy you consume), and suddenly you do not own that thing? Sounds to me like you're stealing the results of someone's labor. Why are women exempt from this concept of owning what you create? Women are pretty much the only ones who can truly *create* something. Everything else is just acting upon one another.\n\n> By engaging in intercourse, you have agreed to the terms of conditions should you produce a life, and one of those means you do not get full authority over the fruits of your labor. \n\nSo what other labor are you not allowed to have the fruits from? Is there a list? Who determines this? How do you objectively figure these things out? Or are they, gasp, opinions with no real basis in fact, and the entire system is idiotic and you're just making it up as you go along? According to your rules:\n\n1. Everyone owns their body.\n\n2. Everyone owns the labor of their body as a result.\n\n3. Two people do joint labor to produce a single new thing, with one party doing 90% of the work.\n\n4. The object, by the rules above, should grant that the person now owns the thing they created, with 90% ownership and the other party having 10%.\n\n5. Said thing isn't somehow owned by the two people who did the labor, but instead is an individual person who stole the work/results of the labor.\n\n6. That's okay and nothing went wrong?\n\nSeems entirely nonsense. You say it's because it's life, but in other cases: such as the exact same act/labor being done by, say, a pig. The pig does not own it's labor despite doing the exact same thing as humans? It's hypocritical, nonsensical, and quite frankly sexist to say women do not own their labor while men do. There's no objective proof of this nonsense system, as you hypocritically apply it differently to different labor by different species and sexes. So there goes any and all logic it may have been constructed from.\n\nAt this point it's just an entirely arbitrary opinion  with no real reason to hold it other than violent coercion.\n\n>Nothing inconsistent here.\n\n\"You get full fruits of your labor, unless your labor is X, or you're a Y\". That's entirely inconsistent.\n\n>Seeing as how you hate property, would it be okay for me to use your toothbrush, eat off your plate, sleep with you in your bed, etc? \n\nUse toothbrush, yes provided it's at different times. Eat off plate, sure while I'm not using it. Sleep with in bed? no, as that'd be a violation of personal space/autonomy, but you can use the bed afterwards. This, of course, is assuming that my model is accepted and that I have the same respect for everything. If we're still violently coerced into living under capitalism, then no of course not.\n\n> If there is no such thing as ownership, do you have any privacy?\n\nYes and no. Privacy for use of particular intimate services/objects. IE private facilities to sleep, have sex, or use the restroom, shower, etc. Other than that I don't see a need for privacy in an ideal society.\n\n> Can I just follow you around and go into the bathroom with you all day if I want? \n\nYou can follow me around, but not enter the restroom facility while I use it. After I'm done you may use it.\n\n>Can I take your phone and use it myself?\n\nIn theory, yes. While I'm not using the phone you may use it. In practice we have more than enough phones for everyone to have their own personal one. Same for toothbrushes and other personal items.\n\n> For anything? \n\nYes. Again, this is assuming we're operating under the system I advocate for, and not capitalism. Don't expect me to live under capitalism, but grant you ownership over my things granted to me by the system we're forced to live under. As that'd be hypocritical and are not my views.\n\n>Can I use it to hammer nails in?\n\nYes, but I think people would think you're kind of stupid to use a phone to do that, and we'd wonder what sort of barbaric and archaic society you grew up in that'd make you think that is how you properly use it. We'd recommend you use a hammer.\n\n> Can I break anything you like? \n\nYes, though again I don't see what motive you would have to do this. Are you a barbarian who shouldn't be living in a modern civilized society? Are you incapable of behaving? I think if you breaking things is a chronic problem, some effort would be put in to teach you the proper way of acting in our civilization.\n\n>I would really like to hear your logical explanation why these things are not allowed or why they're not a problem, as well as why harming your body is wrong if you don't own it.\n\nHarming my body is wrong because it's a violation of autonomy, not ownership. If I stopped using my body, you are free to do what you want with it. However, given our current technological progress, I'm always using my body and have to, until I die. But in the future when I'm able to stop using my body, you're free to use it for whatever purpose you'd like. Similarly, if I'm using a phone or a fork or a toothbrush, violently assaulting me to grab it and take it would be a violation of autonomy. But after I'm done using them you're of course free to use them. Why shouldn't you be? In the case of personal items, we have enough to give everyone  their own. For instance, we don't *need* to share a toothbrush. You're free to, of course, but why would you? we have tons of them.\n\nSomething like a car you'd be free to use when I'm not. But if you'd try to violently assault me while I'm driving, then there'd be a problem. But once I'm done you may use the vehicle as you please.\n\nProvided this is followed everywhere (or at least in a large society), I have no problems with it. I *do* have a problem with my own freedom restricted via capitalism, but then expecting me to live under the system I advocate, but allowing capitalists to exploit that fact in the ways they're prone to (ie that they take the things I own/use under capitalism, but then I have no way of using them anymore). That's a common strawman used against my beliefs.\n\nPregnancy and childbirth are the rare exception to this, because it's inescapable. In the future I'd support bans on abortions and just moving the child to an incubator. In the mean time we don't really have that, so it's a tough balance to make between the mother's health, and the child's life. In most cases there isn't a problem though. In this sense there is a slight violation of autonomy for the case of birth. In practice I support abortion up until the child is sentient. This way the mother retains autonomy, and the sentient child retains autonomy. It's not ideal but it works.\n\nFor everything else, I see no problem with sharing after something is done being used. For instance, restroom facilities. In multi-use facilities that are public, they work as you normally use them. In private facilities, those are single-use and one person may use them at a time (unless the person using it allows another to use it simultaneously, this applies to all use of things). For example if you take a game console. If someone is playing a game, they are using it. If the game supports drop in 2 player, the other person may not force their way into playing as well, but the person playing may opt to let them play. Once the first person is done playing, the next person can play without restriction.\n\nBasically: the usage of an object/facility/etc. means that a violation of that object/facility leads to a violation of your autonomy, and isn't good. But after the object/facility is done being used, you may use it as it does not violate anyone's autonomy.\n\nIn this sense, an ideal society would be *vegan,* or more specifically *fruitarian.* So that plant and animal autonomy is retained. In the short term it may take some time to arrive there due to existing systems.\n\nHarming my body that I'm using is entirely okay if I grant permission for you to do so. This is because I'm using it currently and I can allow you to use it simultaneously. Once I stop using it, you may use it for whatever you wish.",

Do you hate any other groups? If you see there as being a hierarchy of races, what order do you put them? Or do you only see one superior race, and the rest as inferior? How do you divide up the races?\n\n2. What's your take on global politics? Generally speaking the conflict in the middle east is western countries siding with israel (jews) and them all opposing islamic countries. But I hear neo-nazis hate both Jews and Muslims? What's going on here?\n\n3. If you're in the US, do you see it as the end goal to leave and return to your country of origin? Why or why not?\n\n4. For those who have ended up in mixed cultures who lost our history and culture, what do you suggest moving forward? Make a melting pot \"white\" culture in the US? Or return to countries of origin and attempt to assimilate? Break off and make our own nation? How do we restore the multiple white cultures?\n\n5.

I know y'all get lumped in with republicans/right-wing folk, but I figured I'd ask.\n\n>Hypocrisy of racial states for all except whites\n\nDo you support a restoration of the mediterranean/greater middle east area for the iberian/mediterranean race, rather than arabs/muslims, and jews? Why or why not? What do you suggest should be done about mixed countries like the US? We're mostly \"white\" but the original people were native americans. There's a lot of mexicans/hispanics here though as well. Should we restore the US back to the native americans?\n\n>The capitalism and communism dichotomy\n\nI'd like to hear your thoughts on this.

Should people be free to move around? Provided assimilation is done? A complete lockdown like north korea? A single nation for a single race, or multiple nations for a single race, with travel freely between them?\n\n>The holocaust, what denial of it is, and what it isn't\n\nA rundown here would be nice. I'm curious what your thoughts are. I'm also wondering about your thoughts on hitler's zionist views, where he helped send jews to palestine.\n\n>The decline of art and culture in West among whites\n\nDo you see mediterranean/iberian people as white? IE modern italians, jews, greeks, lebanese, and ancient romans, greeks, ancient egyptians, sumerians, babylonians, phoenicians, etc? If not, could you describe what decline of art and culture you mean? Has europe also seen a decline? I figured it was a US thing as we end up distancing ourselves from our ancestry.\n\n>The constant neocon wardrumming for Middle East wars\n\nI touched on this earlier, thoughts? Is it that you disagree with the zionist/imperialist agenda? Or do you support leaving islamic countries alone in their conquered land?

Where are the lines drawn? People differ genetically even among their own family.\n\n>My families have been here for many generations, and white America has generally mixed a lot with other whites for the most part. At this point, you can consider white America to be its own ethnic group. I think there's some identity problems with the US as a result, compared to France, German, Britian, etc where they had a more coherent identity and were still in their homeland. The US is my home.\n\nGenerally speaking the census reports that people who identify as \"american\" and have been here long, descended from the original british settlers. Whereas some, like my family, still have really close genetic ties with our ancestry, though the culture stuff died with my great grandma. It puts me in a weird spot since I don't really have ties to italy/germany, but I don't feel the same as \"white americans\" in the slightest. Hence my question. I figured a lot of other people might be in a similar boat.\n\n>I don't see a problem with socializing some aspects and taking care of less fortunate whites. Rural white America is a mess, for example. You hear about factories closing and economic deprivation, but it's worse than that. Whites move out of there to go to the cities, and the old whites grow old and die off. No children there. These rural white folks have no future with the current situation. \n\nThis is exactly my situation, and why I end up far left. So many people are in this mess, to where the existing capitalist infrastructure simply can't handle it. It's interesting you can recognize the need for such support.\n\n>Due to the pursuit of profit over nationhood, the corporations will elect for importing people for cheaper labor and, more significantly, a more consuming people to sell products to. \n\nThat whole paragraph is something I pretty much agree with. The need for profit destroys any care for culture or nationhood.\n\n>The only group I will assure is not white is the Jews. They have clear characteristics that on average don't fit with whites, and clearly see themselves as an out group around white people.\n\nIt's curious that you include others based on appearance, but exclude jews due to culture.

So in that sense I support neither of those. Instead I support a gradual reduction of reliance on state and capitalism by switching slowly over to decentralized means of production. Think off-grid preppers, mixed with p2p technology, solar power+community smart grid, etc. And push automation to the extreme, change culture to reduce reliance on overconsumption, etc. So over time each piece will push less and less reliance on first capitalism (by gov providing cash/supplies to automate/decentralize) and then less reliance on gov (gov helping provide supplies to reduce reliance). The ancoms have a \"lets burn everything\" method that leads to a power vacuum and culture shock where people return to capitalism and a dictatorship. Marx-leninists push state reliance to the extreme where they end up with a dictator. We need to avoid both solutions and instead create a reliance on community and self-production.\n\n>btw. People with health issues need foremost social services. Just giving them things is not enough.\n\nTrue.\n\n> All those \"commies\" from the USA (now really not talking about you, just my personal rant) who think that they could support special rights for some special snowflake groups and minorities should read a book.\n\nYou misunderstand. By LGBT rights I mean: don't kill people for being gay/trans, cover trans healthcare (HRT+SRS) the same as you would other forms of healthcare, etc. Not \"we'll be thought nazis\"\n\n>As i see it based on what you write, you are a SocDem with some slight hints of nationalism (not conservatism).\n\nSpecifically my \"ideal society\" would be a place without any sort of structured government, and without any monetary tokens, or business transactions. Instead things just exist, and set up in a way to allow for maximum public use, automation, and distribution. For example, every building being equipped with solar panels, p2p web, many farms and food sources around cities along with various automated farms, etc. Transportation would be how public transit systems are now, but alternatively electric cars and other personal vehicles could be used by anyone (no keys). Open up the cellphone networks/towers to be able to be connected to by anyone. And same for wifi.",

We lack any real culture or sense of responsibility in our entitled lazy capitalism mindset, which is arguably the hardest part of the switch. Since it'll be distributing the workload equally, it means everyone needs to learn to participate properly, rather than just exploit people. Same way how you do \"those shitty jobs\" for where you live.\n\n>how does prostitution work, \n\nThe same way sex and relationships work right now? You wouldn't be able to force people to have sex with you by bribing them with more power/influence. People would be equals, not your servants. \n\n>farming, \n\nGenerally speaking, many plants grow food indefinitely. For example, fruit trees grow fruit without any effort (just water/sunlight). There's various automated farm tech that's quickly becoming a thing. And for the rest, people should be taught and learn how to garden and help grow food.\n\n> land ownership, \n\nThere wouldn't be land ownership, because we're abolishing both capitalism and the gov. \n\n---\n\nAt least in the US, most people have 0 actual sense of responsibility or functional needed skills and instead mooch doing pointless things that aren't needed and are just bloat. In practice we've already automated things to such an extreme degree that only a minority of people *actually* need to work. In practice we would have self-organized groups of people to take on larger tasks for the community. IE some people would group together to work on producing and providing food for everyone, others would focus on maintaining infrastructure and public transit, etc.\n\nAs it stands now *we can't even participate in this stuff if we wanted to.* It's quite literally illegal to try and help without permission.

Likewise, just because there's a recognition of the disorder, doesn't mean that the treatment is covered.\n\n>In fact, putting trannies on a podest is unfair towards other mental illnessses like schizophrenia (maybe with multiple personality issue) that is way more common and has a way higher social stigma.\n\nI actually have (not yet entirely diagnosed, in the process) schizophrenia, and I'm trans myself.

[...]\n\nOne thing that a lot of people don't realize is \"trans\" isn't one condition. There's actually several different disorders that the MSM and political elite are trying to conflate and hide. The two main ones are GID (which y'all are likely familiar with, it's a form of transvestism), and Transsexualism (despite the name most people don't actually understand this one, it's like intersex). GID is the one where they get dysphoria, hate themselves, and fetishize looking like a girl. They crossdress and go further and they end up as the caitlyn jenners of the world. Transsexualism is more like an intersex condition where the body has weird biological quirks, inverted sexuality (similar to homosexuality), and so on. TS people end up acting and behaving as the opposite sex, and as a result end up coming across and looking that way as well. And given the sexuality inversion, surgery is the best way to make things go smoothly. HRT came later and was almost an afterthought for TS patients, despite HRT being the primary treatment for GID. This is why no one gives a shit about making sure surgery is covered, because GID people usually don't get it (they like their dick too much). Though sometimes they do. SRS and HRT regret rates are usually caused by misdiagnosis, ROGD, and GID patients not meeting their idealized body type. TS has very low regret rates.\n\n> [r3naam3r](#comment_17_1Dssbq2y2JDD14aojGG9RX3d5EPpw6zQxM): Do you agree with such statement:\"Yellow race has the best intellectual potential but worst physical, white race is in the middle, and the black race has best physical potential but worst intellectual\".?

Definitelly not.\n\nThat's not really what transsexualism is. If \"you have a fetish to be a girl\" that's called autogynephilia, not transsexualism. As for \"would rather be a girl\"..... while it can be phrased like that, it's not really just a plain want/choice. It's not like \"wanting to see a movie\", it's more like \"wanting to eat food because you're starving to death\". There's a lot of problems that come with TS as well. It's a genuine medical disorder, and if I didn't get transition-related care, I'd still get the inverse treatment.\n\n>Some girls rather have big boobs, i also don't want to pay for this.\n\nCorrect. I don't propose having any such cosmetic surgeries covered. Personally I got small boobs but I wouldn't expect healthcare stuff to cover that. I *would* expect healthcare stuff to actually cover my needed healthcare (hormones, genital surgery, therapy).\n\n>There is no treatment needed if its not an illness and if it doesn't cause health problems.\n\nAll of the related disorders cause health problems. That's why they're considered disorders. TS causes social integration issues, along with sexual issues and hormonal issues. GID causes mental health problems. ETC. It's worth noting stuff like pedophilia doesn't cause health problems, but causes problems for others, and as a result is still considered a disorder and needs treatment.\n\n>The misinfo is that in all those discussions about SRS, the pro-side rarely even mentions dilation.\n\nYes they do? Pretty much anyone actually receiving medical treatment for TS knows all about SRS, how it works, what's done, what the aftercare is like, etc.\n\n>Dilation is lifetime!\n\nYes and no. Initially after surgery, during the healing period, frequent dilation is needed. After the healing period is over, infrequent (monthly at most) dilation is needed, which is less frequent than periods (which require hygiene products/care). So it's basically really the same amount of upkeep that other women have to do. Not a huge deal. And in practice, sex would cover it.\n\n> And then you reach your final schedule of 30min delating per day IF you additionally have sex (which is not the case for pretty much all of them)\n\nThat's *way* off. As for sex, I'm in a relationship already and have no problems in that area. Nor do any of the transsexual women I know. GID people notoriously have problems there though.\n\n>Also you have to pick out a nice hairball once in a while from the thing that you call \"vagina\" and the constant fear of developing a fistula and leaking fecals out of your \"vagina\".\n\nThere's a lot of misinfo here too. And your bias is showing. The organ is called a neovagina or reconstructed vagina. It's not a natal one, nor should anyone believe it is. \"Hairballs\" happen with a particular kind of surgery, and primarily happens with bad/poor surgeons. \"leaking fecals\" isn't a thing unless you get a particular rare kind of surgery which really isn't done anymore due to the huge number of side effects and high risk. In practice most people don't have issues whatsoever. And those that do were because of bad doctors, not the concept of the surgery being bad.\n\n>Read some posts where people wrote about their dilation schedule.\n\nI have. Most people who talk about it just recently got surgery, and yes, during the recovery period it's quite a lot.\n\n>SRS as treatment for gender dysphoria is like lobotomy as treatment for schizophrenia.\n\nI can't comment on using SRS as a treatment for gender dysphoria. GD usually doesn't prompt SRS, but it sometimes can and AFAIK it usually has poor results in that sense (because the neovagina is not a natal one and thus dysphoria persists). SRS as a treatment for TS, however, is very successful and has been used for over a hundred years now. Generally speaking there's no issues.\n\n>It's inhuman and in a few years we will be looking back in disgust about how cruel we were.\n\nA few years meaning 120+ years? Because that's how long SRS has been a thing now. And more crude forms (castration) have been done for millennia. I agree that HRT+SRS is very crude/cruel for treatment of GID and dysphoria. Its not an ideal treatment at all in that case, often has poor results, etc. But there's not really an alternative treatment available, and they block all research into the topic. As for TS, we're stuck until you can somehow change the sex of the brain, and someone's sexuality. Which means homosexuality will be cured/treated before TS. And that research has been entirely blocked as \"homophobic\" and \"cruel\".\n\n> [aspidochelone](#comment_41_1PPUrYcZ1E1rGkkE6PH18Qi43LRsKABo1Z): Now the transsexual bit ... some of your comments bear out ( https://transcare.ucsf.edu/guidelines/vaginoplasty ) but is dilating worse than needing a tampon?\n\nInitially? Yes. After the healing period is over? No. It's pretty much the same amount of care needed. It's funny that you can tell the people who are \"horrified\" about doing something monthly are all men. Not to mention people don't realize that trans people *already* do things daily as part of TS maintenance. In common with natal women we still shave body hair and that sort of thing. And TS specific would be daily pills, switching patches, possible injections, etc. Adding in dilation every now and again really isn't a huge problem.\n\n>Letting them get free procedures in the military instead of disqualifying them for medical reasons was highly dubious, but giving everyone free health care by right would be ideal.\n\nThe military situation is kinda complicated. In practice, transsexual women do not enter the military. Any transitioners there will almost certainly have GID instead. Usually GID doesn't require SRS, and as a result no dilation is needed. They *do* need regular HRT though. Which isn't strange for medical conditions, of which the military allows (they provide meds for people who need them). Trump's ban makes a lot of sense, they ban anything that requires active adjustment/treatment, but allows pre/post transition just fine.\n\n> [myriri](#comment_25_145qVnMUHFaHhDNmmd1s2ZPh5FTArtZmjn): See in the USA once you join the military the US government takes on responsibility for your healthcare for life.And a trannie who transitions is a patient for life. \n\nThis is the same for any chronic condition, which are already allowed in the military.\n\n>Whats more if they start offering the surgeries and hormones essentially free to them, you'll have trannies breaking down the doors to join the military. \n\nNope. Transsexual women don't care to enter the military. GID people might, but they don't need genital surgery, and cosmetic surgeries don't need to be considered medical treatments. Hormones are dirt cheap and are cheaper than most medication that the military provides (including viagra, which isn't a medical need but is still provided anyway). The military is *less ideal* because of their stricter requirements. Especially when elsewhere already just allows you to get proper medical treatment without restriction.\n\n>The costs would be quite horrific longterm as they would for a long time only ever go up.\n\nProviding hormones for transsexual patients is much cheaper than providing viagra for men who can't get it up. Yet the military does the latter. Are you opposed to that? Why aren't you horrified at the wasteful spending? Something tells me it's because of your bias/hate against transsexuals (who are less than 0.01% of the population and don't enter the military anyway) rather than the concern you're making here. Chronic illnesses are already covered in the military, and other ones are much more expensive than simple HRT.",

When you reject or entirely remove the ability to reproduce, you have cut off a critical part of your future: your children. \n\nCan't reproduce before surgery either. Because sexuality isn't a choice. It's a disorder, but that doesn't mean people are choosing it or that it can be treated in the way you want.\n\n>I would consider abnormal sexuality degenerate because the organism is either failing survival through reproduction\n\n\"Degenerate\" implies someone is actively causing problems. Would you also say people who are ill, or have a disability, are \"degenerate\"? What about amputees? Are they \"degenerate\"?\n\n>or on a higher level, weakens impulse control and favoring pleasure over self-control, which often goes into the slippery slope of increasingly crazy/harmful stuff.\n\nThere's no proof of this, but you can share your scientific medical studies that show this if you have them.

Doesn't matter if you \"don't want your children going through it\". If they're born that way then that's how it is.\n\n>and yet you have stories of children being taken by the state under protection laws because their parents don't want them doing such things.\n\nYou mean... receiving medical treatment?

Drag isn't the same thing, and that absolutely should not be happening. Transsexualism is a niche medical disorder, and drag isn't even related to LGBT stuff. Drag is honestly disgusting and is entirely a choice that those people make.\n\n>Hell, you have Desmond is Amazing, whose parents have yet to be thrown in jail for exploiting a 10 year old for progress signalling and having them dance for older men.

The fact the network absorbed that kind of traffic with no additional modifications to begin with is turning heads in the world of networking technicians/admins.  There have been some hiccups, but there are a lot of eyes on this project, now - and since it is basically a system that floats on top of a database using torrent files to update the database in a distributed manner - you could actually run ZeroNet using a completely different piece of software - such as a standalone browser, and you wouldn't really need to change how the torrent system works, much.  There may be some optimization routines launched for seeders to use that would condense hard disk usage down by hashes and owner indexes (how many people 'own' a copy of that file and where are they considered to own it - useful for larger pictures and movies where content could be posted and deleted).  Since the two systems are theoretically compartmentalized from each other, you could build off of it almost any way you wanted to without harming the network, as I understand, at least.\n\nZites are independent of the ZeroNet platform.

ZeroTalk has been cloned many times over, and none of the clones are controlled by him. ZeroMe is a merger/hub site, meaning he *cannot touch* any hubs or clients that he did not put up. There's alternative clients like sakana that can't be touched by nofish, and there are alternate hubs, like my kaffiehub, that he cannot touch. As a result, I and others can keep using zerome without nofish trying to end up being corrupt or w/e. Same goes for the other zites.\n\nZeroHello *is* under his controller, but you can point your homepage to be anything. You can clone zerohello, and then use your cloned version. Problem solved. ZeroHello is given a special admin permission by the ZN client by default, but you can grant this special permission to any site you'd like. IE, disable the default zerohello, and just use your cloned one, so nofish can't touch it.\n\nThe github is not part of zeronet, and as a result is centralized in the same form as other github repositories. People can fork them if they please and run their own fork. Just how github normally works. The source has been downloaded on every single ZN user's machine, and as a result users can edit their ZN client however they please, and nofish can't touch this.\n\nZeroUpdate is similar to zerohello. Same goes for zeroname. zeroupdate and zeroname are referred to by zn, but you can edit which site is pointed to, and you can clone both sites so nofish can't touch them.\n\nIE you can just make your own cloned copies, and are safe from nofish messing things up. It's just that *other* people cannot edit nofish's zites, and as a result can't edit it for *other people.* However, as with all things zeronet, you can configure your own client how you please.\n\n>ZeroTalk depends on nofish to increase user data size limit. ZeroMe depends on nofish because of the hub list.\n\nThe hub list isn't needed to join zerome hubs. ZeroMe auto-fetches any hubs you're seeding and allows you to select them. The only thing that has a problem with centralization is the user profile list (for filling the \"new users\" page). But that isn't essential to zerome.\n\n>However, it can do a little bit more than just welcome someone -- it's given so-called \"ADMIN\" rights. This means that, if nofish gets hacked (which wouldn't be a surprise to be honest), ZeroHello code can be changed to destroy the whole network. What's even more terrifying is that the changes would spread immediately over ZeroNet, destroying everything in a few minutes.\n\nThis is untrue. Admin rights for zites *do not let the zites run backend code.* Configuring zerohello to auto-delete the list of zites upon visiting the page is possible, so perhaps it's important to have zerohello update manually, and not auto-run upon visiting the site? Alternatively, encouraging users to set a new home page could fix this problem.\n\n>You might say: just fork the network! Create your own SuperNet! Yes. SuperNet. Not ZeroNet. Not everyone will switch to my fork. Or your fork. Or some other fork. ZeroNet will be split into small parts that can't even communicate to each other: some forks would become outdated, some would stop being supported. The awesome ZeroNet community would be destroyed.

In terms of cryptography, zites can't steal your private keys, even with admin permissions, if you don't run the code on the site (which is entirely optional). Nofish controls his own sites. And zerohello, one of them, is given admin permissions to do site management. You can take this permission away, and give it to a site you yourself control and own.",

Likewise you don't have to download boards/content you don't want to see. Whereas you have to by default with 08chan.

Likewise when you run out of chat space you won't have to nag the single 08chan admin. And your images don't count towards your post total since they're optional files.\n\nWhy would you use 08chan when it's so clearly inferior?\n\nEdit: this also means you can write/edit your own millchan client, and be able to view/customize the display of data how you want and share that client with others.

There's a trust factor involved with respect to the anon doing the development work.  This is of understated importance.  Migrating to milchan may happen, yet we've been here only a few days now.  When I tested one of your milchan boards, my post wasn't anonymous (just an example).  I'm not a fan of forking at all, and the result with 08chan is no longer open source.  However, this concern is mitigated by knowledge regarding credibility of the zite owner.\n\nI didn't make the site, I'm just linking it. [This is the announcement post.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT/?Topic:1548974921_18S47ArorYtHtcicjdGi6VZdhgJgwhrud7/Millchan+merger+site) Pretty sure it's made by the original guy who made millchan.\n\n**YOUR POSTS ON ZERONET ARE NEVER ANONYMOUS.** ZeroNet uses public/private key pairings to publish content. This means that you can always track someone's post history by following their public key. In \"anonymous\" sites like the original millchan, they had a site-specific key associated with no name, ie just the public key itself. The millchan merger site also supports this, along with zeroid posts. ZeroIDs just provide a display name for your key. And that name is guaranteed to be unique due to the zeroid server checking it. Things like kaffieid let you change your display name freely, and doesn't guarantee name uniqueness. Whereas millchan and other \"anonymous\" id providers just use the public key as the display name, or \"anonymous\".\n\nHowever *your post history can always be traced by following your public key.* Go look in the 08chan folder, then go into /data/ and look at your public key folder. All of your posts are there. If you need your public key, you can open the sidebar of a site to see what the currently set one is. You'll see it under \"identity address\". The only way to avoid this is to cycle keys, which is a huge pain.\n\nThe merger site is *more* anonymous than something like 08chan because your posts are *not centralized* into a single site folder. Meaning that if someone isn't sharing the same board as you, your posts can't be seen by them. So if you post on 3 boards, then people who only see 1 of those boards cannot see your entire post history in other boards, protecting your anonymity. 08chan doesn't do this.\n\n08chan actually is a clone of the original millchan, and the millchan merger is as well. I *don't* trust the 08chan dev, because they can't even do optional files properly. Why do you trust them?\n\nPersonally, I don't see why you'd want to put yourself at risk of hosting CP. But suit yourself.\n\nEdit: As an example, here's one anon's post history that I fetched off a proxy (I ain't dling 08chan): http://nullpaste.bit/?1NWh3WAty57FH8at1WtrZigMrdhrDkuPzh_13 you can see which boards they posted to, what they said, etc.",

Pseudoanonymity is fine though (account post history, but no connection between account and real person).\n\n>Obviously TOR + VPN or why bother m8.\n\nTOR+VPN disconnect your account from you as an individual, but they don't change pseudoanonymity to full/true anonymity.

If I trusted people to manage my communication platform, I wouldn't be on ZN, now would I?\n\n>Regarding CP, I'm not afraid of the wild-west frontier.

The merger site seems technically superior in every way, so it baffles me why someone wouldn't use it and instead choose something worse.\n\nThat said, if the 08chan dev turns images to be optional and not shared by default, I'd be happy to help seed the site.",

				"body": "> [myriri](#comment_12_145qVnMUHFaHhDNmmd1s2ZPh5FTArtZmjn): So wait what is a merger site?\n\nThe merger feature was added a while back. Basically a merger site \"merges\" content from various other sites, with the setup done in a particular way. So the end result is that you have some client site frontends that view a set of data, and then the various data backend sites that hold the data/posts. The frontends display the content from the various backend sites, and displays them as a single site. This means you can swap out the frontend and view the same data, and you can swap out the backend data while keeping the same client/frontend.\n\nSo take 08chan for instance, if this was set up, you could keep the actual viewer that loads in posts. but the data could be spread out across multiple different sites and thus you can have only what you'd like to see. And if you don't like the frontend, you can swap that out while keeping the same data and interacting with the same community.\n\nLook at ZeroMe for a good example of how this works. For stuff like zerotalk, we're stuck using the same frontend, and if we leave and make a new site to fix that, we can't view or interact with the same community. But with zerome you can swap out the frontend to something totally different, like sakana, and still interact with the same community.\n\nSo the site I linked, the millchan merger, does this as well. So all of the posts are stored on different sites, and that's why the boards didn't appear. Because each board is it's own site. The actual site you go to first doesn't have any of the data on it. So you can host it or swap it out without worrying. And then the boards each are on their own site, so you could host like /b/ or something, but not /cp/. With centralized sites like 08chan, you have to host everything, doesn't matter if you like it or not.\n\nThis also means that the *workload* is divided up. I heard 08chan is 16gb? Imagine each board being 1gb, with 16 boards. Then if you don't like some, you don't need to serve all of that other 15gb if you only like 1 board.\n\n>Honestly the idea of a lack of anonymity is concerning.\n\nZeroNet is psuedoanonymous, like other online web services. You can use tor or vpns to divorce your pseudonym from your IRL self. And ofc you can just create new public/private keys and pseudonyms if you care to. Decentralized systems can't have \"true\" anonymity in posts like the chans usually have, since you need a public/private key pair to actually sign your content so others can't edit it.\n\nZeroNet could, theoretically, provide a way to generate 1 time use key pairs for sites, which would allow for true anonymity. But at the moment ZN isn't structured to provide that.",

Or is this specific Korean ISP stuff or just Google Translate stuff?\n\nZeroNet *can* work without a traditional internet connection. It can work entirely over lan w/ zeroconf, and if you pair it up with mesh networking software like zeronet or yggdrasil, you can have a mesh network+zeronet setup without any traditional internet. So the use case provided (a single router with everyone connected to it) will indeed work and zeronet will function. And as mentioned, when connecting back to the traditional internet, it will snc accordingly.\n\nYou can also use zeronet entirely offline by yourself, if you disable your connection you can still read content, post things, etc. It just won't sync to anyone else until you connect to them.\n\n> [memesadler](#comment_29_194xi8BJsLXhwje1kBJETKo6tjvhHmK73S): Very interesting. I'll need to look into this. I can't fathom how it works since I imagine the very concept of services online are performed by ISPs and controllers of the wires and towers themselves.\n\nIt works the same way that your home lan works. Modern networking stuff has the ability to request a list of other machines on the network, and zeronet uses this to do zeroconf connections between people on the same lan. No ISPs needed. ZeroNet sites are hosted by the people who visit them. Meaning that if you get disconnected you still have access to all of the sites you visited prior.\n\n> [crazylime](#comment_54_1D9oYXWZH2S55PeoCFDKTqq8roNXqZqP7n): Then, what happens if you get that working AND introduce Internet gateways that only a small portion of the clients connect to.

So this is the existing topology/infrastructure of the ZN community *right now.* We have mesh-only users, and users with both traditional internet and mesh. They connect through cjdns and yggdrasil.

If that isn't enough you can enable the bootstrapper plugin as well. It has support for both IPv4 and IPv6 and has been tested to work on mesh networking software like cjdns and yggdrasil. I've got [a tutorial on my blog](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1N6zp6jCXPBktNMPfe7UJBpQGyfCq7k2M8/?Post:51:Using+CJDNS+with+ZeroNet) on how to set up cjdns on mac with zeronet. Very simple. Yggdrasil works similarly.\n\n>The issue is bootstrapping, discovery and trackers.\n\nBoostrapping/trackers can be easily done either by the lan zeroconf that zeronet has, or by enabling the bootstrapper plugin (which gives trackers that look like: zero://ipaddress:port). I'm currently using zeronet *only* through bootstrapped trackers.\n\n>In a pure offline mesh, you may need some sort of gossip/DHT for peers to find each other on bootup. \n\nZeroNet itself is not a mesh networking platform. It has zeroconf lan support and can be run over mesh networks (in the same way it can be run on the internet). Peers share/trade boostrapped nodes, and given the nature of mesh networks like cjdns or yggdrasil, it's easy to keep things going. We just need users.\n\n>By offline mesh, it means peers of the mesh (not ZN yet) find each other and connect. There is no DHCP or typical router functions. You do not need a router. Routers in that typically act as \"boosters\", as they often have higher power transmissions than a cell phone. But, otherwise, they are primarily acting as peers themselves. \n\nThere's two parts of a mesh. The physical hardware, and the routing software. The routing software involves stuff like cjdns. The hardware can just be your regular router and computer.\n\n>Would need to not connect to a router and only use Wifi Direct to mesh two nodes. \n\nYou've got a weird description of a mesh in your head.

You need to delete the file, and then sign+publish. You can do so by opening up the sidebar while on the site and clicking the related button. You may need to change which content.json is being signed over to the particular user's one. Not sure if it'll auto-prompt (sometimes a publish button auto-pops up in the bottom right of the screen). Once it's published, the other users will remove the file IIRC. But I think they need to reload the db?\n\nI don't have multiple machines to test, but it *should* be syncing whatever you change upon publishing.",

In this sense zeronet is *safer* because you can read all of the code your computer runs.\n\n>What happens if someone tries to do something malicious here or anywhere else?\n\nThere's not much they can do.

Which happens on the regular web as well.\n\n>XSS\n\nNot sure if XSS works, but it's effects would be mitigated. As sites can't auto-redirect your browser, and can't make calls to other ZN sites. In practice an XSS would have to be caused by user error on the rare sites that do allow URL params. There is a theoretical possibility of injecting a js script which makes calls to an outside centralized site, but many users mitigate this by using tor browser and blocking any non localhost sites. I'm not even sure it's possible.

Only the individual files are synced. And the individual files require the authorized private keys in order to sign/publish (ie the site owner, or the person who posted the content). Meaning they're entirely untouchable. As for malware. There's not much the malware could actually *do.*",

Modern North Korea was caused by imperialists destroying electrical supply chains, which lead to a famine in north korea, and as a result collapsing their system (which was heavily reliant on electrical power, rather than oil). So... grats to the imperialists for fucking up a superior nation? North Korea doubled down on their problems by turning their land ownership scheme into capitalism, along with their citizens starting up illegal black markets and using foreign currencies to account for the agricultural and electrical collapse caused by imperialists. That has lead NK down the path of capitalism, and from there they've just been getting worse. Something very similar happened in Russia and China. That said, even in it's pure form I don't support capitalism, due to the reliance on centralized system and power structures; the same flaw we see here in the west. The exact same problem can occur here. Disrupt our oil supply chain and we end up with our entire system collapsing.",

Value is a subjective decision that is made by the parties involved in the trade. Someone may make less and work harder because their labor or the product they are producing has a lower demand. If they are being underpayed, a competing comapany will appear that will offer them a better wage. The only reason this doesn't happen is due to central planning and government restrictions that make it hard for competitors to appear. What we need is more capitalism, not less.\n\nUntrue. People with minimum wage jobs are actually being *over* paid for what the market demands to pay them. The only reason they're not paid less is because of the wage floor. I imagine they'd in reality make only a couple dollars an hour if there wasn't an artificial floor. See 3rd world countries as a good example. Wealth is currently flowing *out* of wealthy countries and *into* poor countries. And capitalists see nothing wrong with that? This is why the wealthy countries like the US are getting poorer, and the poorer countries like china and india are getting wealthier.

				"body": ">\"Can\"? Not by default/built in? Does it mean that my IP address is actually broadcast when making requests on ZeroNet? Please tell me I'm misunderstanding this...\n\nWhenever you make a request online (ie visit a website, or connect to some online service) your IP is shown when you make that request. This is so that the computers responding know where the message is coming from, and where to send the response. This is true *for everything online.* In P2P networks, your computer connects to something called a tracker, which shares your IP and status with the other peers. This is so you can all connect to one another. This happens when you play video games online as well.\n\nIn ZeroNet these connections are used to send/receive websites, similar to how the regular web works. Except on the regular web, your requests go to your DNS server, and the website you're trying to connect to. Whereas in ZeroNet, the requests go to your fellow ZN peers. Just how in gaming you can connect to the centralized gaming server, or connect directly with the people you want to play with.\n\nBy default, these requests will show your *real ip address.* This is because that's how the internet works. But what this means is that if you visit a couple of sites on the regular internet, and then play call of duty, the elite corps can see your IP accessed those sites, and then played call of duty. Effectively spying on what you're doing. The same is true for ZeroNet, though it's a bit harder to do. People can see your IP requests say, zerotalk, and so they send you zerotalk. Then you request zerome and 08chan, and the people send you those. Now since it's p2p you're requesting different peers for each request. But they still can see your IP and still trace it to your ISP, and effectively ring you up for a DMCA notice. This is how people who torrent movies get caught. The movie companies hop on a movie torrent, see your IP and then ring up your ISP to tell you to knock it off.\n\nZeroNet has built in support for something called tor. Tor basically sends your traffic encrypted, to a peer, who sends it to another peer, and they send it to another, and so on. Until the last person sends your traffic to where it's going (the other ZN peer). This means that what you're requesting is separate from your IP, and your IP is hidden to everyone except the initial tor peer you connected to. VPNs work similarly in that you connect to your VPN and tell them what you want, and they deliver it for you requesting on your behalf. These anonymize your traffic and IP, making it impossible to figure out who you are (more or less, but the gov has busted some tor users before).\n\n>How is this technically possible?\n\nSites are initially downloaded, and then stored locally on your computer. This means your access/load times of the page, after the initial download, or not limited by your internet speed; only your initial connection/download of the site is. When you receive updates to the site, the updates are just the much smaller individual files of the site, rather than it's entirety. And the updates happen in the background, not when you try to visit the site. This means when you access the site, it's dependent on how fast your HDD and browser loads the files, rather than how fast your internet connection is.",

It's no more anonymous than BitTorrent, but privacy (the possibility to find out who is the owner of the comment/site) will increase as the network and the sites gains more peers.\" I'm very confused about this.\n\nIt's because if you look at the swarm, you can see which peers send which files to you. As a result if it's just you and one other person in the swarm, then when they request site A you know they want/visit site A. If you see them send an update for site A, you know they posted/updated it. But if there were three users, then what that person sends might be an update from the other user. And then if you have 1000 people, what one user sends you may be a relay or it may be their own activity, it's much harder to tell.\n\n> [bvcfbfbcbcvd](#comment_10_1KUSKrffaR1sfLwxZUXUPshLpKhh5PXWm7): ayra: Sounds very, very disappointing. That is indeed a major security problem. I was convinced that the basic point of ZeroNet included the ability to be \"invisible\" both as a site owner and a visitor of any site, but this is clearly not the case... :(\n\nIt actually *is* the case, provided you use tor or another anonymizing service. If the ZN community is large enough, you *effectively* become invisible for those types of things, since it becomes unclear if you're the one publishing the new content, or if you're just relaying it. But nothing is perfect ofc. Tor gets rid of that and just anonymizes you outright, hence it's support.\n\n> [bvcfbfbcbcvd](#comment_11_1KUSKrffaR1sfLwxZUXUPshLpKhh5PXWm7): gitcenter: Possibly the fact that the point of a network like this is lost if you can just track everyone like that?

Tor is the current stand in for anonymization, and ZN does a few things to help obscure your traffic, but isn't perfect, especially with low amounts of users.",

				"body": ">What exactly am I supposed to hold on to?\n\nWhatever you want? Generally speaking most people will hold onto their /data/ folder, which contains their private keys, and sites they've dl'd.\n\n>A single private key for ZeroNet? Where is it stored on my system? \n\nYour private keys are stored in /users/data.json. Technically you *only* need to backup the master seed, but in practice you want the whole file to prevent headaches.\n\n>Will this single private key file be the one and only thing that I need to keep secure and backup in regards to not losing control of my \"ZeroNet account\" and any \"Zero sites\" I create?\n\nYes, that's where your keys are stored. I'd recommend making secure backups of the other json files in that folder though (sites.json, mutes.json, etc.) as they contain other useful data. Sites themselves are stored in the /data/ folder, inside of their individual folder. If no one else hosts these, and you delete them, they will be lost. Which is why it's best to hold onto your /data/ folder.\n\n>Is ZeroNet \"released\" already, or is this some sort of \"early testing phase\"?\n\nSoftware doesn't work like that. ZeroNet is not a commercial product.\n\n> Can I start right now to attempt to get people to use my \"Zero site\", or is this for testing only, and all content on the network will be reset for the \"stable release\"?\n\nNofish, or anyone else, can't \"delete\" your site. That's the entire point. Censorship free, no \"resets\" or worries about deletion. So yes, feel free to make a site and get users. While things may *break* if you rely on non-standard ways of doing something, your content won't be deleted.\n\n>How exactly is data stored?\n\nSame way as regular files. Users download the sites they visit, and those files are stored as regular files on your computer.\n\n> It just flies around nodes like little encrypted chunks, all stored in RAM/network, hoping that all nodes will never go down at once?\n\nNo. They're stored on HDD like regular files.\n\n>How does ZeroNet get around the need for \"vaults\" (people running dedicated storage servers and getting paid for it with a special cryptocurrency)?\n\nIt's not a blockchain. It's really that simple. Users visit a site and request it, existing peers send the site. The user downloads it and starts hosting. Very similar to how a torrent works. Torrents are free, zeronet is free. Simple.\n\n>Is it possible for me to, right now, make a \"Zero site\" which nobody can modify or add content to or do anything to, and I am the only one who can add/modify/delete it?\n\nThat's how sites work by default, yes.\n\n>When making a Zero site, it seems like it's a requirement for me to display the full \"source code\" (HTML, CSS and some sort of \"enhanced JavaScript\"?), because there is no server where PHP or whatever can execute. \n\nThat's correct, yes. You can use regular JS as well. It's all clientside code. IE HTML, CSS, JS, and anything that compiles into JS (by default it supports coffeescript compilation). No way to execute backend code.\n\n>This makes sense, and is like SAFE Network, but nothing stops me from having a PHP script on my computer which, for example, adds content to my site in an automated fashion, or pulls new data from my site (which is set to only be visible by me) for processing locally... right? \n\nThis is correct. If you check the Kaffiene folder you'll see some of the python scripts I used to manage the data on there.\n\n>If so, is it easy to interact with ZeroNet from PHP?\n\nYou'd want to use ajax and send requests to an external server that has cors disabled. Not exactly ideal, but it works.\n\n>Must a ZeroNet node be running on the same computer? \n\nDepends on what you're doing. ZeroID has code to send a request to a backend centralized server so it can sign certs. This is usually *not recommended for regular sites.* Most people don't like accessing centralized servers on a platform that's meant to be decentralized. Hopefully you can see why.\n\n>Assuming that I've sorted out all the above, how would I make my new \"Zero site\" known? \n\nSign+Publish (feature on zeronet) then share the link to the site.\n\n> Is there some sort of way that I could get legitimate attention to my Zero site on Zeronet itself? Like in that \"main menu\" thing which I'm using right now to post this? Is there some sort of \"discovery system\" in place for people to actually find my stuff?\n\nThere's a variety of sites that are dedicated to sharing links. In the early days we had search engines that were updated with all of the new sites, though most haven't been updated. Nowadays most people just post in zerotalk, zerome, or zerosites. [This site](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1LtvsjbtQ2tY7SCtCZzC4KhErqEK3bXD4n/) seems to be useful in getting things seeded. Often people will visit their site through a proxy, as proxies are up 24/7 and get quite a bit of traffic.\n\n>And if so, won't it quickly be flooded with garbage, making it impossible to find my site nevertheless?\n\nYeah there's a lot of junk. Same problem as the regular web. How do you determine whether a site is \"quality\"? It's entirely a preference.\n\n>Do you need to pay with \"Zerocoins\"? If so, how do you get those?\n\nNo such thing. ZeroNet does not use blockchains.\n\n>Is really nobody moderating this thing (\"ZeroTalk\")? If that's the case, the quality of the posts is surprisingly high...\n\nNofish (the dev of zeronet) is the moderator for zerotalk. But he doesn't seem to actually do much moderation. ZN just attracts high quality users haha.",

It shows an placeholder - questionmark icon which can be clicked to show & download the image. After some browsing, i have checked ZeroHello/?Files and no thumbnail was downloaded 👍 this is awesome news for all who are afraid of hosting unwanted content. 1) Tor, 2) enabling \"always spoiler\" and being able to mute bad boards and users. Quite nice protection (on Millchan and on updated 08chan)\n\n08chan still downloads thumbnails even if you don't view them, IIRC. You should check your data folder to ensure that they *are* being ignored and treated as optional files. AFAIK this isn't the case. In the original millchan and millchan merger site, thumbnails *are* optional files, but I'm not sure the same is true for 08chan.",

You would need a constant stream of people sending reprints into the repository, because new papers are always coming out.  You'd need a LARGE amount of distributed disk capacity.  Only a few dozen people in the whole world might request an interlibrary loan of any one item, so who would seed it?  And then there's the factor that pushing this first would play into the hands of someone trying to attack ZeroNet as an \"illicit file sharing network\" rather than as a general internet protocol.  It's not something that some guy is going to do in a few months.\n\nReminder: sci-hub already exists and is ran as a centralized service. They keep backups of requested papers, and fetches new ones when requested. For a ZN sci-hub we'd do something similar. For new papers just fetch from sci-hub, and then store in the ZN site as an optional file. for old papers just fetch the optional file. Likewise anyone with the existing collection of sci-hub papers could start as an initial seed, and then as people request papers, they'd help decentralize the platform.

Btw, with optional files people can come and download only what they need (but as means of helping with keeping the zite healthy I'd advocate to store books/papers in chunks of 100MB or so).\n\nYeah I remember antilibrary. It was a cool project and I wish it actually took off and was a success.\n\n> [mg0](#comment_114_1LbP2cNA6NkvuFJvs7McUmv9qGjkNqVkTa): @kaffie: do you know about Library Genesis? I think zeronet could have such a zite as well but I'm not versed on web stuff; luckily that site doesn't really rely on js afaik and mirroring the searching interface shouldn't be impossible. Let me know what you think of having such a site in here.\n\nI'm aware of the service, and use it frequently for dling books. They've got a lot of mirrors too, IIRC. I'd love to have some huge library available like that. Right now we really only have that for movies, with PLAY (stored as rarbg torrent magnet links). We also have similar torrent links for TV shows. Having books and scientific research available would be absolutely lovely. The problem is the huge amount of data storage requirements. It's in the terabytes, iirc. Personally I'm running ZN off my laptop, where I have maybe 5gb free on average. My entire ZN folder fits within 4-5gb. A large project, even with hundreds of gb, isn't going to be possible for me to do without new hardware. I'd definitely love to see it happen though.",

As having the development repo being primarily hosted in a decentralized fashion allows for any takedown attempts to be prevented. If it's accessible through zeronet in particular, it means that all you need is zeronet in order to contribute to ZN development.

Whereas forum-style comment trees are good for *depth* but not *breadth.* So the forum style stuff works best when there's a few people talking a lot about particular complex ideas. Whereas reddit is more tuned towards having a lot of people say their piece and maybe have a little back/forth on it.",

But reading your post here it seems there's even another worry: having this apply to \"malicious\" software. You touched a bit upon this in terms of a malicious government, but there are malicious people as well. And tracking isn't the only malicious software use case.\n\nTech has been pretty good with keeping up protection against malicious software that is harmful digitally (attacks computers), but we've been notoriously bad at protection against malicious software that is harmful physically/socially (attacks people). The \"free software\" model actually furthers the harm done.\n\nFor example, say a malicious software popped up. Lets go with deepfakes. If it were closed source and centralized, it'd be easy to restrict usage, or to prevent people from using it altogether. However, given that it's open source, people can easily copy/modify/share/use it as they please, furthering the harm that results from such a software. And this is \"protected\" by copyright? fuck that.\n\nUnfortunately I don't think there *is* a solution to socially malicious uses of software. Other than to take steps to avoid being caught up in it and to discourage it's use culturally.\n\nI understand the original point of the free software idea, but ultimately it's spiraled out into a corporate monster that's doing more harm than good. The \"do what you want, fuck copyright\" model is better in that sense, as people are not obligated to further harm and can do what they deem is morally right.\n\nGov problems should be fixed legally. Social problems should be fixed culturally.",

The details of the exploit were not mentioned, but I'm *very* curious how you managed to gain admin rights, steal private keys, and run backend code all without actually visiting the site in question. Please ZeroMail me how this was done. The linked site details a replacement exploit in which site content is replaced by the frame key. A massive exploit, but ultimately does not contradict what I have written. If you don't actually run the content on the site (by visiting it in the browser), the site itself is entirely harmless. Likewise, this does *not* use admin rights (it's an iframe exploit), and *does not* take user keys via built in admin features; which is what I was talking about in the quoted post.\n\nMy comment, of course, was in the context of *bug-free usage.* Not via the use of exploits. Naturally any software may not work as intended due to bugs. But through official means and using the APIs as intended, you cannot do this. If you don't run the site, the exploit can't run. Note:\n\n>Ask the target to visit the site;\n\nThat being said, several major attack vectors exist. One is the one detailed: somehow acquiring the frame key and abusing it to make zeronet do things that a site is not authorized to do. Another is to attack the browser directly, which I'm sure people are already aware of. Lastly it's to attack the operating system along with it's automatic file indexing. AFAIK any truly harmful code will have to do one of the three. Either attack ZN itself, through the use of abusing it's API, attack the browser itself through abuse of JS bugs,  or attack the OS itself through abusing file system code. There's also always the possibility of typical user ignorance being an attack vector. Which is, of course, the way most malicious code these days is executed, such as this exploit here. \n\nThis has less to do with nofish being the sole dev and more to do with exploits and bugs existing in software.

If you gave the ADMIN permission to the site yourself, I would be able to steal keys too.\n\nI'll have to look into this. Is there a legit official function to access private keys? If so that's a severe problem. My understanding is that admin sites could fetch/delete other sites, but *not* actually steal or access private key info. Reminder: direct ZN access is *different* from admin permissions on a site. So having the frame key should theoretically give *more access* than a regular admin site should normally be able to have. Here's a list of officially documented admin API calls:\n\n>as\n\nFunctionally harmless for identity theft, as other sites can't access private keys. but it *can* cause harm in other ways.

I don't know of any way to officially grab and display private keys on a zn site, only public keys/certs. Recent undocumented additions to admin permissions seem the same: can do some harm in terms of zn settings, but functionally can't steal zn identity, and can't run backend code.\n\nMy comment was talking about the official functionality of admin sites. Admin sites can do damage in the sense that they can wreck your site list. But ultimately can't actually expose your pivate keys. Unless there's some unintentional exploit.",

This doesn't run any new code, only updates a site as usual, and prevents dl of the content from users in the list. Plugins you're free to install/uninstall/update plugins however you please, there's no auto-update and no forced installs. There was recently an addition to make it easy to dl+install plugins.

The \"transwoman\" (in reality this scenario played out with a transvestite claiming to be trans) should respect the wishes of the workers, and the worker should be free to see whoever they wish. If it were an actual transsexual woman, and post-op as well, then the worker would be in the wrong for discrimination. That's not to say that transsexual women are men, but rather that we fit into a third social role so it's understandable.\n\n2. Unrealistic, and I'd definitely cast doubt as to how many are \"actually trans\". Even if they were all legit, transsexual women and natal women have distinct differences. So no, it's not a good balance.\n\n3. Arrest rates, police brutality rates, number of 911 calls.\n\n4. I don't believe it's racist. But do keep in mind comparing raw numbers doesn't tell the whole story. There are more whites than asians here.\n\n5. It looks to me like many cases are due to increased aggression by the person rather than the cop. Which would make sense why blacks and men tend to have higher incarceration and conflict rates.\n\n6. This is an impossible scenario. Transsexual women do not compete in sports. It's not in our biology or wiring. If someone is claiming to be, they're likely a male transvestite instead. So yes, the women would be right to complain.\n\n7. In the case of basketball, it's clear they select for physical ability/height/etc. which black men excel at. It's unclear of intelligence varies per race; though I have a hypothesis that hylic people may be 'dumber', less creative/innovative, etc. than pneumatic people. If true, this means we should see nordics, africans, and south asians (china and lower) performing worse, and presumably europeans; especially italians, greeks, and jews, along with koreans and asians performing better.\n\n8/9. Generally speaking the secular progressive answer is that crime and poor education/intelligence is caused by poverty. Though it's curious how certain races always end up uneducated, in poverty, and with higher crime rates. Even more curious that it always seems to be hylic races.\n\n10 Blind auditions.

However, I spend the vast majority of my time on text-only zites, so that might be why.  How much data must be on a zite before it begins to exhibit the characteristics you describe?\n\nThe data caps vary per site. Zerotalk I think has a default limit of like 50k, but I'm at 973k right now (out of my current cap of 2400k). So as you can see I've gone over it quite a bit, and that's with text alone. A couple mb limit is usually enough for plenty of posting. I've been on zerotalk for years now and still have under 1mb though I definitely could've been more active. Sites themselves have a 10mb limit before they need to ask for more space. I've seen a few sites go over 100mb+ but that's pretty rare. Most are under the 10mb just fine especially if they use optional files. But all zeronet sites, including zerotalk, are very small right now. I wonder how it'll manage once a site scales up to millions of users. Merger sites with hubs was meant to alleviate this issue, but there's some problems with those too (namely that you can't see all the content without downloading all the hubs).",

I thought you were talking about a size limit for all zites that is inherent to ZeroNet's design.  I didn't understand that you were talking about an intentional posting-and-comment limit. [...]\n\nWhat I'm talking about is baked into every zeronet site. There's site size limits for the site itself (10mb, with larger sizes needing permission) and size limits for user generated content (manually set by site owners). The latter makes it hard to be a regular user over a long period of time if it's strict. The former can be quite unwieldy for sites that may be potentially gigabytes or terabytes in size. If they were optional it'd be fine, but they're built-in limits that every site must have. Hubs are used to decentralize things. Both user generated content, as well as admin-posted content. The merger site itself working as a sort of \"client\" with the hubs being the data read into it. Once sites start becoming gigabytes or terabytes in size you don't want to download all of it, and so you can download just the parts that are relevant to you.\n\n> [styromaniac](#comment_3134_16NS3rBdW9zpLmLSQoD8nLTtNVsRFtVBhd): Size limits can be whatever the owner wants. 1TB? 8TB?  10PB?

ZeroNet is full of what I've started to refer to as zombie blogs (they're dead but still hanging around), because people start them and lose interest after a few months.  Now we have to wade through an ocean of zombies to find a site that is still alive. If I had time, I would create a site that lists all the currently active blogs and forums, but it would be a lot of work to maintain that I don't have time to do.  I am already running three zites on ZeroNet (just created the All-Night Bookstore and Cafe last week--shameless self-promotion intended), and one is a mirror blog for which I am currently 8 months behind in transferring content from my blog on the regular Internet.
