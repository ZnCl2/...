				"body": "Expecting women to work is the greatest destroyer of the nuclear family. That and that the state prefers women to be single mothers. \n\nA wife should be nurturing, not have the ability to support you. Putting food on the table is your job. This is a biological reality. Breaking from this ancient biological routine will leave you empty.\n\nHowever I fully realise how the corrupt legal system is and it essentially begs women to take everything from you if you provide for them. You need to be careful. Never discuss finances with your wife. Never put everything in a property that she can legally take in a divorce. Never keep everything in one place. When you buy a house, put it in your parent's name so she can't take it, and don't tell her. Pretend like you are renting it from your parents. It will allow you to save as well. Stash money away. Bitcoin. Never divulge your true finances. There should be nothing to take.\n\nMy best tip would be to find a wife who is nurturing. Avoid the \"intellectual girls\". In reality they are stupid and they will never be men. Stop trying to make women into men. Women who are nurturing are the epitome of a mate. Look for how she is towards animals and kids. A honourable nurturing woman is an asset worth more than all the money in the world. \n\nStart with someone who is quality. Are her parents still together? Does she want kids? Does she love being nurturing? Does she have no mental hangups and able to raise your kids? \n\nThink about how it will be when you are old one day. You need a legacy. Children are an extension of yourself. It is the most important thing you can do. Metaphysical immortality.\n\nI would suggest moving out of the city and into nature. Become self sufficient and entirely reduce your utility bills if you can. It won't be easy but learning skills are the real assets you have in life. None of that shit in the city at an office job is real. They are made up and fake. Rural areas are essentially empty now and just full of old people as everyone is moving to the cities. Depending on where you are, you can buy half an acre of land for less than a new flagship phone. Cities are cesspools and if you live in a cesspool you will become a part of it. It is only going to become even more expensive. \n\nEven if it is old agricultural land, plant some fast growing trees and turn it into a permaculture forest. Avoid the monoculture way. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture\n\nUse the earth's static temperature 2 meters down to thermoregulate your home. It is the best insulation you can find. Heating/Cooling bills are wasteful and a result of working against nature. Build your house into the ground and fill it over with a thick layer of soil. And drain it properly. Two shipping containers placed side by side in a mound is better than any HVAC system. Warm in winter and cool in summer. \n\nThere are so many things you don't really need. And to be honest you will be happier without them. Don't let your things rule you. You don't need half of the shit you're paying for. They're not worth the grind it takes to keep buying that shit.\n\nWhile we are on this point I will also add that you should always try to buy everything used as to not generate extra taxes that will be used against you. Always pay in cash and in person. Try keep the paperwork to a minimum and anonymous. Some things are obviously not possible, but many things are just as good used as new, for eg. tools, vehicles and electronics. Always keep an eye out for good items used. Haggle on the price and learn to recognise what items are worth. Avoid retail shops like the plague. Support the small guy in cash. A high quality used item is worth far more than a new low end item. Usually high end items also have all the parts available so you can cheaply replace cosmetic parts to make it look new. \n\nFor eg. A used high end Hilti Cordless Drill vs a new cheap Ryobi. \nA used high end Dell Latitude vs a new cheap laptop. \n\n\nThe long term savings you could gather instead of wasting it on utilities and other pointless possessions in a city is essentially years off of your life. Rather spend it on building skills for eg. Welding, Carpentry, Machining, Plumbing, Irrigation, Livestock Husbandry, HVAC, Electrician, Electronic and Mechanical Repair. These are jobs that actually matter and people will pay you anywhere you are to do them, or even barter you food. You can teach yourself how to do these by practising. YouTube can teach you how to do anything. There are millions of books and research papers available on any subject. Be an autodidact. Teach yourself. Don't fall for the suburban trap. It is soul crushing. \nThese skills will save your life one day when civilisation falls. Read here about why you need to get out of the cities:\n\nAnti Tech Revolution Why And How by Ted Kaczynski\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/KaczynskiAntiTechRevolutionWhyAndHow_201803\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/12MVkvYGcRW6u2NYbpfwVad1oQeyG4s9Er/index.html?view:item+id:15f1_19N49krDPpRvUbPMuHmxJVAXgKXPLQP32w_item_2+type:book\n\nGood luck.",

Putting some wealth off your direct access (in a cousin's account) is truly a wise decision but not because it stops wife from taking it through divorce, but if you take bad decisions or sign fishy contracts then you could at least have something left to start anew when broke. Legal system does just too much for women in a separation, and I think that's because of the conventional nuclear family of worker male and housewife female so women get some wealth until they get a way to make it on their own (they normally get children custody as well). But if you are going to doubt so much of your wife, why are you marrying in the first place?\n\nI agree. None of us are good judges of character. Especially when young we have no idea how to read people's intentions. It will only come with age. And a lot of the time we realise what we actually want later in life. Some people are really good at hiding their flaws and the true personality only comes out later. It is always good to be prepared. Have a contingency plan in place. You never know what could happen. It could save you from the banks taking everything from you if the market crashes and we head into a depression and all your clients or business dries up or you get fired. Or you become disabled. Be prepared in such a way that if the debt collectors come calling you are not worth that much on paper. If you are smart with your finances like this, then in the end you have more money in retirement. If she turns out to be a good person you will have lost nothing. Only gained the peace of mind knowing you are prepared. It is generally a good practice to never keep your eggs in one basket of ever show your hand entirely.",
