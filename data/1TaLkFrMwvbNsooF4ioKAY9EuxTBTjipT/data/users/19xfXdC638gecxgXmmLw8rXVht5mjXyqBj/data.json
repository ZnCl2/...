Clearnet is already full of clutter, the only good content is 1% compared to the 99% that is absolute garbage degenerate crap. The few of us that are smart enough to create a welcoming community that promotes better internet etiquette should do just that. It will be hard, and maybe not everyone will be on board, but i don't think that fighting against censorship is worth it, especially on a platform where your voice can be silenced by smear campaigns and being denied advertiser revenue. I may not make sense because it's late, but we can probably do it. \nI've only had zeronet for a few minutes and it's so much better than the alternatives. Its installed quickly and works straight out of the box. When we have a dedicated browser it's gonna be even better.",
