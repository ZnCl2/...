Since I work in the IT business, I'm always open to new and better standard. The problem is always the adoption, but for video we have a least program like VLC who act as a swiss-knife for most \"exotic\" format.\n\nI remember having a hard time with .webp on Linux (the default Gnome app doesn't support it. Seem better on Windows).",

[...]\n\nThanks for the link, I just checked and kdenlive is still stuck at the previous generation (VP9, the one that AV1 is supposed to replace).\n\nI'll check if I found another editing software, but the solution seem to render the final video on VP9 and then convert it (so more work). I'll test it when I got the time, just to see the differences.",

H265 in browser is only supported by Edge apparently so that was out as well. I might try reencoding with RAV1E now though!\n\nI tried on Linux (distro Pop!_OS) with Brave (Chromium based like Chrome) and your video work well, a little buffering at the start to kickstart the thing (like 3/4 secs) and then it was a smooth ride.",

My H265 attempt was ~20% smaller, and V1 is supposed to trim up to 30% off on top of that so a 40% decrease in filesize compared to H264 wouldn't be unreasonable.\n\nI need to try it, but I didn't succeed at my first attempt to convert a video to AV1. I know I can render with VP9 (which is the codec previous to AV1) with kdenlive, but I didn't found a plugin/add-on to make it render in AV1.\n\nMy attempt to convert a video ended up taking too long and the weight of the file was bigger. I'm still searching and trying until I get a good result.",

They are also currently in the process of making a phone.\n\nYeah, I agree. They do have anti-tamper process in place, depending of the level of threat you're under and some are advanced, so you may want to look at their products.",
