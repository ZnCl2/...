That was 4 years ago. If you started connecting to other people back then you'd either be stuck on a 4 year old phone or reconnecting every time you're switching phones. Useless in a real world scenario. Imagine journalists (as Briar explicitly states is one of the target users) making connection with deep sources and then they had to contact them on open platforms again because their phone fell and broke?\n\nAlso, the desktop version is more of a proof of concept chat-only app, so while it may be the future, at this pace a useable Briar ecosystem is roughly two decades away.",
