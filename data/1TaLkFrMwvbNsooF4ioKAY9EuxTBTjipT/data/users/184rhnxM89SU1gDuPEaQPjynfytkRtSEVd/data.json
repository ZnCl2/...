			"title": "Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)",
			"body": "The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), also known as the \"Digital Telephony Act,\" is a United States wiretapping law passed in 1994, during the presidency of Bill Clinton (Pub. L. No. 103-414, 108 Stat. 4279, codified at 47 USC 1001-1010).\n\nCALEA's purpose is to enhance the ability of law enforcement agencies to conduct lawful interception of communication by requiring that telecommunications carriers and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment modify and design their equipment, facilities, and services to ensure that they have built-in capabilities for targeted surveillance, allowing federal agencies to selectively wiretap any telephone traffic; it has since been extended to cover broadband Internet and VoIP traffic. Some government agencies argue that it covers mass surveillance of communications rather than just tapping specific lines and that not all CALEA-based access requires a warrant.\n\nThe original reason for adopting CALEA was the Federal Bureau of Investigation's worry that increasing use of digital telephone exchange switches would make tapping phones at the phone company's central office harder and slower to execute, or in some cases impossible.[1] Since the original requirement to add CALEA-compliant interfaces required phone companies to modify or replace hardware and software in their systems, U.S. Congress included funding for a limited time period to cover such network upgrades.[2] CALEA was passed into law on October 25, 1994 and came into force on January 1, 1995.[3]\n\nIn the years since CALEA was passed it has been greatly expanded to include all VoIP and broadband Internet traffic. From 2004 to 2007 there was a 62 percent growth in the number of wiretaps performed under CALEA – and more than 3,000 percent growth in interception of Internet data such as email.[4]\n\nBy 2007, the FBI had spent $39 million on its Digital Collection System Network (DCSNet) system, which collects, stores, indexes, and analyzes communications data\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act",

			"body": "Technitium Mesh is a secure, anonymous, peer-to-peer (p2p), open source instant messenger designed to provide end-to-end encryption. Primary aim of developing this instant messenger is to provide privacy which is achieved using cryptography and anonymity using Tor network. It can be used over Internet and private LAN networks (without Internet) for instant messaging and file transfer with support for private chats and group chats.\n\nMesh is based on Bit Chat and is its successor. Mesh takes core ideas from its predecessor and removes a few. Notably, Mesh does not require centralized user registration and provides anonymous profile support using Tor hidden service. It also removes use of BitTorrent trackers for finding peers which was causing issues with Bit Chat since some ISPs blocking BitTorrent traffic would also block Bit Chat traffic. Instead, Mesh relies only on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) for all purposes.\n\nMesh allows creating both pure p2p and anonymous profiles with support for running multiple profiles concurrently. Both p2p and anonymous profiles are interoperable such that a p2p profile user can connect with an anonymous profile user via Tor Network.\n\nWith Mesh, there is no meta data generated. User identifier is designed in such a way that it can be changed anytime to hide identity. Since, there is no user registration, we don’t know who uses Mesh or how many people use it. In p2p mode, the connections use IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity directly to connect with peers without any server in between. With anonymous mode, all connectivity occurs over Tor network and uses Tor hidden service to accept inbound connections.\n\nhttps://mesh.im/",

			"title": "Xorro P2P How we built a BitTorrent-like P2P network from scratch",
			"body": "Xorro P2P How we built a BitTorrent-like P2P network from scratch\n\nXorro P2P is a BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer file sharing network built by software engineers Ken Chen, David Kurutz, and Terry Lee.\n\nInterested in P2P networks and distributed systems, we set out to build our own from scratch. The version available today is our alpha release, providing a working proof-of-concept. We want to continue improving upon Xorro — upcoming features are listed further down this page.\n\nThis site outlines our journey building Xorro P2P. We hope that readers leave with a better understanding of the P2P problem space.\n\nResearch\n\nAs strictly end users of P2P systems, we started our journey facing a very large learning curve. Much research was needed for us to understand the history and internals of these systems. We collectively read up on P2P networks, old and new: Napster, Gnutella, Freenet, BitTorrent, IPFS…\nCentralized vs Decentralized\n\nAn important concept to understand is the difference between centralized and decentralized systems. A comparison of first and second generation networks helps to illustrate the difference.\nNapster: Centralized\n\nNapster was a P2P file sharing service that was mostly used to transfer music files, and was popular from 1999-2001, It’s estimated that there were about 80 million registered users at its peak. Napster worked by having all nodes connect to a central index server that contained all the information about who was in possession of which files.\n\nDue to its centralized nature, Napster was vulnerable to attacks and lawsuits and Napster was shut down by court order after about 2 years of service. In addition to those vulnerabilities, the central index meant there was a single point of failure, as well as a lack of scalability.\nBitTorrent, Gnutella, Freenet: Decentralized\n\nThe next generation of P2P networks were able to escape the same fate as Napster by moving to a distributed model.\n\nIn a decentralized system like BitTorrent, every computer/node acts as a client and server, maintaining its own segment of a file lookup index. Nodes can find out about the locations of files through other nodes, removing the reliance on a central server.\n\nFocusing on P2P File Sharing Systems\n\nKnowing the advantages of newer P2P systems, we went down the path of investigating their features more deeply. Luckily P2P networks have been around for a while so there were many resources available. White papers about distributed hash tables (DHTs) proved to be the most critical, as DHTs are the foundation of current P2P networks. Countless hours were spent reading and digesting white papers, specification documents, blog posts, and StackOverflow answers. We made sure to have a good understanding of DHTs before we started any coding.\n\nKademlia\n\nA Kademlia network consists of many Nodes.\n\nEach node:\n\nHas a unique 160 bit ID.\nMaintains a routing table containing contact information for other nodes.\nMaintains its own segment of the larger distributed hash table.\nCommunicates with other nodes via 4 remote procedure calls.\n\nEach node’s routing table is divided into ‘buckets’ — each bucket contains contact information for nodes of a specific ‘distance’ from the current node. We will discuss the concept of distance in more detail shortly.\n\nEach contact contains the ID, IP address, and port number of the other node.\n\nBecause Xorro is a file sharing application, the DHT segment will contain key/value pairs where each key is a file id, and the corresponding value is the file location.\n\nhttps://github.com/xorro-p2p/xorro\nhttps://xorro-p2p.github.io/",

			"body": "The block was put in place at the end of July and is enforced via China’s Great Firewall.\n\nThe Chinese government has deployed an update to its national censorship tool, known as the Great Firewall (GFW), to block encrypted HTTPS connections that are being set up using modern, interception-proof protocols and technologies.\n\nThe ban has been in place for at least a week, since the end of July, according to a joint report published this week by three organizations tracking Chinese censorship – iYouPort, the University of Maryland, and the Great Firewall Report.\nChina now blocking HTTPS+TLS1.3+ESNI\n\nThrough the new GFW update, Chinese officials are only targeting HTTPS traffic that is being set up with new technologies like TLS 1.3 and ESNI (Encrypted Server Name Indication).\n\nOther HTTPS traffic is still allowed through the Great Firewall, if it uses older versions of the same protocols – such as TLS 1.1 or 1.2, or SNI (Server Name Indication).\n\nFor HTTPS connections set up via these older protocols, Chinese censors can infer to what domain a user is trying to connect. This is done by looking at the (plaintext) SNI field in the early stages of an HTTPS connections.\n\nIn HTTPS connections set up via the newer TLS 1.3, the SNI field can be hidden via ESNI, the encrypted version of the old SNI. As TLS 1.3 usage continues to grow around the web, HTTPS traffic where TLS 1.3 and ESNI is used is now giving Chinese sensors headaches, as they’re now finding it harder to filter HTTPS traffic and control what content the Chinese population can access.\n\nPer the findings of the joint report, the Chinese government is currently dropping all HTTPS traffic where TLS 1.3 and ESNI are used, and temporarily banning the IP addresses involved in the connection, for small intervals of time that can vary between two and three minutes.\nSome circumvention methods exist… for now\nStay fully connected with Wi-Fi 6 Campus\nHuawei has a full array of Wi-Fi solutions that ensure comprehensive coverage under different campus scenarios so enterprises can stay ahead of the trend.\nSponsored by Huawei\n\nFor now, iYouPort, the University of Maryland, and the Great Firewall Report said they were able to find six circumvention techniques that can be applied client-side (inside apps and software) and four that can be applied server-side (on servers and app backends) to bypass the GFW’s current block.\n\n“Unfortunately, these specific strategies may not be a long-term solution: as the cat and mouse game progresses, the Great Firewall will likely to continue to improve its censorship capabilities,” the three organizations also added.\n\nZDNet also confirmed the report’s findings with two additional sources – namely members of a US telecommunications provider and an internet exchange point (IXP)\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/china-is-now-blocking-all-encrypted-https-traffic-using-tls-1-3-and-esni/",
