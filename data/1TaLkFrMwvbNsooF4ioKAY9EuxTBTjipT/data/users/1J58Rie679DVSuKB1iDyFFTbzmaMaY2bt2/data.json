For instance if I search for Mr Robot, it would be great if I could get a URL\n- Assigning videos to 'Favorites' Lists, Being able to share or browse a catalog of people's favorite list / playlists\n- An ability to 'mute' specific users without having to assign a global mute through ZeroID\n\nI'll come back and add more when I think of them.

[...]\n\nIt won't really say anything, I noticed most of those peers originated from Asia and their tastes of taboo are well known there mixed with the dense population and quick adoption of 0net usage, it would only make sense for the popularity boost.  \n\nAlso it doesn't reflect much on Zeronet imo. Any user of zeronet would understand how quickly technology changes and progresses. Do clearnet users still believe that Google is still putting up a good fight for the independent creators rights as the company once did in the late 90s? Not exactly.  \n\nWhen Zeronet becomes a popularity issue with the powers that be, expect the Zeroent network to be discussed by mean stream outlets as the new Tor2.0. Much like there are a plethora of articles that mention the name \"Kodi Box\" referring to a Pi loaded with the Kodi media player to the extent of CGI graphics with a Kodi Logo cropped onto a pi case.  \n  \nWith the way things are headed, we can expect the same discussion to rise about ZeroNet in only due time.

In my opinion Putin is not supported for 'freedom & liberty', Instead many follow him as he is concerned for the continued preservation of the Russian economy and is not keen to selling away those Russian resources to US or EU corporate interests. Citizens of Russia have it bad, but they know their economy is much more stable that that of the US and their fractional banking systems.  So even if someone who disagrees with Putin's actions, they will still uphold his leadership so long as the Russian economy stays strong. \n\nOf course the mainstream media doesn't help the matter any. These endless stories of Russia scare & intimidation only goes on to cast an illusion that Putin is much more powerful than he is. (He has the US media in some kind of red scare), and people will naturally follow those who are labeled as powerful.\n\nThat being said, I'm not Russian and I don't support Russian interests. But that doesn't prevent me of making some attempt to understand it. For as bad as Russia is, the US is not much better Just imagine you could have a career here that will pay you less because you have a vagina while the male employee who is less talented than you would be granted a higher salary. You could become a military career so long as you don't lose any limbs, then you're likely to die from VA paperwork fraud to deprive you of your appointments, in which you will be rendered homeless without any access to healthcare or assistance. So as you can see, being American making pokes at Russia while my own backyard is a junkyard can easily make one feel nauseous. \n\nLong story short, feel free to hate Julian Assange as that is what the mainstream corporations that control our nations want you to do. I mean, has your country offered him any assistance? Mine labeled him as a National Terrorist and would love his head.\n\nMaybe Putin see's it as a US bargaining chip due for future use.

Since each zeronet site is a bitcoin wallet address, attempting to discover sites through random addressing is impractical. With the regular internet, when creating a domain name it is reported to one or more indexing services like ICANN for the sole purpose of public discovery.\n\nTerminology is everything and a network does not need to be scary simply because it is dark and deep.
