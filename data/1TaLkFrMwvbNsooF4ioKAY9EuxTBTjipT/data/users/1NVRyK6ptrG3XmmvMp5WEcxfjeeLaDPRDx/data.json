			"body": "Parents/teachers keeping their kids away from all the hardships in life that made them strong, not realising the temporary discomfort hardens them along the way. \nKeeping boys away from slingshots and not allowing them to build guns out of the legos they because that's violent and dangerous, telling them to play with dolls instead.\nTelling children to rely on authority to fix their problems instead of taking care of it themself. \"Go to the teacher if he's bothering you\"\nNo wonder millenials are such limpwristed fags and eternal manchildren. They never learned what it is like suffering. \nGood times does not necessarily mean weak men. Weak parents and teachers breed weak men.",
