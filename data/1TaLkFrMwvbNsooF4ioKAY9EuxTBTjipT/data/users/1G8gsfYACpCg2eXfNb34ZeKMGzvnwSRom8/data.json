With a 3.7ghz processor and 4gbs of RAM I can load that huge thread on /pol/ in about fifteen seconds in Firefox. You may wish to Pin the board to download all its content and then you're only loading the files locally after the first time. That will make it easier/faster.\nThe boards were already pinned, and it would take about 15-30 seconds to load a thread as well. As far as what it did when when I loaded a thread that is \"too long\", Palemoon just popped up an an unexplained error messages while Chromium and Tor loaded \"A web page is slowing down your borwser. What would you like to do? Stop it, Wait\". And, of course, NOW it loads the entire thread (After having to reinstall 08 again).\n\nAs far as computer specs, one is 1.6 ghz with 4 GB of RAM and the other is at 2.0ghz with 8 GB of RAM.",
