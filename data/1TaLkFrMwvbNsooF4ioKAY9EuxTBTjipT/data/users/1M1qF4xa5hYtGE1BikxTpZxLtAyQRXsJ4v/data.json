			"title": "Zarathustra came from Persia (Iran)",
			"body": "He created the first religion to distinguish Good from Evil: Ormuz and Ariman. The question is what do we do when we see Evil today? Do we remain quiet, obedient or even opportunistic and \"cool\", because we think we are on the winner's side (as we seem to have for the past centuries). Or, do we choose the uncomfortable path of speaking and pointing out the unpleasant truth? Can we actually speak for ourselves? Or are we just the naive cattle in the herd? Then again, how many millions across the globe spoke out loudly against the war in Iraq in 2003? It seems to have made no difference, cattle wants to be slaughtered. On the social media fostered by uncle Sam, we tend to reproduce the same logic of the celebrity system that tells the stories from the winners side. Hollywood unfair, fairy tales - of the good and the evil guys. At the accelerated pace of televised media and the internet posts, that's how the \"new\" civilization shows and blows up its power, trying to silence another civilization whose past moved slowly through milleniums of wisdoms and also regrets of war and dominations. What do we know about Persia? What do we know about Iran? We know for sure that this western empire wants to take it all. From the Iranian people, and from us, the cattle who don't dare to realize. The truth is that this \"civilization\", not by chance, allows us to use only 10% of our brains, so that we nowadays may not move any pyramid, or travel on a flying carpet. To take a cat-walk on the red carpet of kings and queens, presidents and prime ministers, pop stars and soccer players, is what this oligofrenic, neoliberal disneyland allows us.",
