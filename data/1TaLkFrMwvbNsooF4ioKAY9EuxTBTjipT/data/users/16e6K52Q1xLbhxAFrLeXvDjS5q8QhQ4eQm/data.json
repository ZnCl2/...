Contrary to what many people have been lead to believe, most \"valuable\" materials aren't really that more precious than other common materials.Yes, this applies to gold and diamonds as well.No, your coin collection isn't going to make the history books, and you can't trade any of that if the economy crashes due to hoarding and a lack of spending.Think of the economy as a living thing. To be alive, it has to move.You're not promoting hibernation or nut-squirreling, you're promoting hoarding and suicide.Stop being stupid please.\n\ngovernment spending based on borrowed funds isn't good and it's inflating the bubble.",
