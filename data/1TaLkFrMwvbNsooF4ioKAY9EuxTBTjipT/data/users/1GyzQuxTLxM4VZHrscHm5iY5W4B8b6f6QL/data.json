What now? [...]\n\nI don't believe any bunch of 0s & 1s could be illegal. It was invented for introducing censorship. Whats now? Now you have really free internet.\nIf you are afraid of so called 'illegal' thumbnails or whatever you should use vpn/tor and drive encryption.\nAnd to be honest its very same on clearnet excluding part about distribution.\nSince by seeing something illegal on clearnet you already posses those images on your hard drive cache :^)",
