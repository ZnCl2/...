			"title": "Tor meek bridges for tracker connections",
			"body": "Hello everybody ! I am looking for some help as I am a new user of Zeronet and facing some problems when I want to get some sites. I have this message : \"Use Tor meek bridges for tracker connections\nNo meek bridge support in your client, please download the latest bundle.\" I think that I have the last version as I have just began to use zeronet a week ago. But I have tried to reinstall everything in a new directory without success with the bridge problem. Another problem : I have imported in this new install the users.json file with my zeroid id inside but I have lost access to this zeroid identification ! Hopefully having a backup of the firs install I was able to go back to a working version but with the bridges problem not resolved. Somebody have an advice ? Thanks in advance.",
