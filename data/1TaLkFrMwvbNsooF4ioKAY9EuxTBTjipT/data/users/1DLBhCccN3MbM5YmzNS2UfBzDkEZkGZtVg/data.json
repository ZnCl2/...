			"body": "zfs with compression (I'm using lz4) works well on javascript files and json files (which are majority on files on typical zites).\n\nzfs is easy to setup, encourage others to try it out.\n\nIf you're running low in disk space, you can iteratively move files from your main partition to zfs partition.\nIn my case, my home directory is now hybrid ext4 & zfs on top of lvm.\n\n**Caution**\nA catch is if you've used >50% of disk space, it's impossible to migrate from zfs back to other partitions without additional harddisk because zfs cannot shrink or remove devices from the pool.\n\nThe only way to 'escape' is to copy files to other partitions when remove the whole zpool (you cannot iteratively release the space from zpool)\n\n**Update**\nThe compressratio I got from zfs is 1.24x - 1.33x\n\nIf you want to have more aggressive compression (at the cost of more CPU cycle), you can use zstd.\n\n**Update**\nJust tested with btrfs, it also supports filesyetem compression without losing the flexibility to resize the partitions. Hence more preferable than zfs.\n\nBtrfs doesn't have the lockdown problem when you've used >50% disk space.",

I'm on a little more than a dozen different platforms, and I plan to go up to twentyish, after which it becomes \"unmanageable for one individual\". [...]\n\nI feel that, its already much effort to produce good content alone. Don't really want to spend effort to pursue others to consume the content being produced.\n\nSo my approach in the example of software is, I make software and tools for myself, and I share it online, e.g. push to github. If others find it useful, feel free to take it. But i don't spend extra effort to make noise. \n\nThis approach is fine for tools. But if you're building platform or ecosystem that require network effect, you cannot avoid making noise … Unless you're super patient and urgent about it's grow. But usually for platforms, it's not much useful in practice if it cannot reach critical mass.",

We may adopt ipfs (or it's file system design) for content deduplication.\nFor the networking (and seeding part), ipfs works generically. Each node may relay content that is not interested on that node, hence the networking seems more robust while zeronet node can only download content from peers that has seeded the specific zite content.
