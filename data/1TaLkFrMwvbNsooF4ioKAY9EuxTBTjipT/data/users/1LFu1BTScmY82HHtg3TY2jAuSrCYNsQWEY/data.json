It's used for the trackers and 2.) When you visit a zite in ZeroNet, you are NOT using the ZeroNet protocol - you are using a **local HTTP server** that serves the files that are stored locally on your computer. The ZeroNet protocol is what handles storing those files locally. They're separate things.\n> Additionally, what if we wanted to add more servers to the ZeroNet client. Me and @imachug have created a Gopher plugin for ZeroNet that will serve these local files/zites to a gopher client. The gopher client uses `gopher://`. It's the same thing. The ZeroNet protocol handles storing the files locally, then we overlay a _local_ server on top of that to actually serve the files based on the protocol we want to use, by default it's HTTP, but we can also use Gopher, FTP, etc.\n\n(by @krixano on [GitHub](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/83#issuecomment-489451550))\n\nInstead, it would be be better to use `http://talk.zeronetwork.bit.zero` or something like that:\n\n> I would now recommend to use `http://talk.zeronetwork.bit.zero` or something like that. This would allow accessing sites without (`address.zero`) and with (`domain.bit.zero`) domain. It would also allow other DNS (like ENS or even classic DNS) and also other protocols (Gopher, FTP...).\n\n(by me on [GitHub](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/83#issuecomment-489452892))\n\n---\n\nSo, please wait to see what format will be recommended in the future and standardized.

In this case, users will just have to use `zeroframe.myCommand()`. It's downside is that it would be hard to implement in JS. I want that only not existing methods will be forwarded as ZeroFrame commands, but existing will work normally. Something like what [PHP's `__call()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php#object.call) does. I also want that original methods will remain unchanged because this would enable better IDE auto-completion and highlighting and documentation. \n\n---\n\nI would more like second option, because it would be better for usage. But I don't know how to implement it.\nIs there any solution? If not, I will have to use first option.",

The ability of one app to interact with another is very limited on ZN. \n\nThis could be done in the future and it is also mostly related to my other suggestion.

You would be able to chat via ZeroTalk, but all data would actually be stored on other service and also accessible from there.\n\nOther example could be managing or accessing blog posts from ZeroBlog. Or articles from Kiwipedia or ZeroWiki. Or posts from original ZeroTalk. This could be similar to [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), maybe also with it's official protocols.\n\nBut this would require a lot of work so it could be done later in the future.

Both revision and version are same as latest.\n* **Latest version!** - Not really updated. Version is latest, but revision is not.\n* **Outdated!** - Outdated version.\n\nThis can be problem and confusing for users because it displays **Latest version!** even if new version/update is available. In fact, all Python 3 users (with `0.7.0`) will have **Latest version!** displayed, even if they updated ZeroNet few months ago. This is because the only Python 3 version is `0.7.0` and it is also the latest, even if there are many newest revisions.\n\nQuick solution would be to drop  **Latest version!** (revision) check, rename **On the edge with the latest revision!** to **Latest version!** and check both revision and version in new check. So there would now be two possible stated:\n\n* **Latest version!** - Both revision and version are same as latest.\n* **Outdated!** - Revision or version is not same as latest.\n\nHowever, **better solution** would be to finally release ZeroNet `0.7.0` as version and handle all updates/changes with proper versioning scheme.",

The first is during the regular updates to the lists of reporting phishing and malware sites. **No information about you or the sites you visit is communicated during list updates.** The second is in the event that you encounter a reported phishing or malware site. **Before blocking the site, Firefox will request a double-check to ensure that the reported site has not been removed from the list since your last update. This request does not include the address of the visited site, it only contains partial information derived from the address.**\n\nSo it looks like they use local list which is updated every 30 minutes. But before blocking URL, they again check if it is still on the list. I think that they here only send first part of URL hash and then compare it locally against other, similar to what [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords) does with passwords.",

Maybe it is just simple mistake, but maybe I posted some critical sensitive information by accident.\n\nHere I quite like how GitHub has this solved with issue comments.

They have Google and this is everything they need :)\n\nAnother problem is that Google has all things integrated with each other. You can use same Google accounts for mail, messages, calendar, contacts, storage, photos, maps, YouTube... and all things are connected with each other. But with alternatives, you have to set each up individually.\n\n> Note that some (Google) services (search, mail, storage...) could be easily replaced by alternatives (not really ZeroNet based alternatives, but just alternatives). Here, the main problem is because of aggressive advertising by Google and other companies. But YouTube and popular social networks, for example, have something that alternatives don't have, content and users. Which user would want to use YouTube alternatives, but with 1% of all YouTube content or Facebook alternative with just 1000 users?\n\nThat YouTube is very hard to compete also proves a fact that even Google wasn't able to compete with it. If you don't know, YouTube was not created by Google, but by three former PayPal employees. YouTube has then become very popular and Google of course wanted to compete with it. They already had Google Video (created one month before YouTube), but it was not very popular. And Google found a solution: they simply bought YouTube...",

You can have main UI zite for managing all files. You can show, upload, download, edit your files from it.\n2. When you want to edit a file, main zite opens another zite dedicated for editing of specific file types (word editor, powerpoint editor, excel editor, markdown editor...). You then edit files from it.\n3. You also have personal \"workspaces\" as separate zites. That zites stores the files you own. Files/workspaces can be either private (encrypted and only for you), protected (encrypted and for you and specific users) and public.\n\nAlthough this might sound too complicated, it is actually needed to have truly decentralized system:\n\n1. Having separate main UI zite allows you to access data from alternative UI (if you prefer different UI or in case if original owner deletes the UI zite).\n2. Having separate zites for editing makes things more modular and allows anyone to create editor for new file type.\n3. Having data in workspace zites prevents other users/main zite owners from deleting your files.",

It just fetches whole website to local folder, indicates it with date and publishes that to ZeroNet. However, it doesn't prevent later modifications to that folder due how ZeroNet workd (but this might change soon). It also can't handle websites that heavily relies on JavaScript due how HTTRack works.\n\nIt needs to be as local program because websites can't fetch other websites because of CORS restrictions. Archive.is or archive.org can be as websites, because the processing happens on their backend. But with ZeroNet, you can't access backend (although it might be possible with BackgroundProcessing).\n\n---\n\nFor your specific case, you need to fox all links and URLs to point to your site address URL. As other people suggested, put `./` at the start of URLs that link to that site itself. Also, you need to make sure that you actually downloaded all files from that website.",

However, because there still are incompatibilities, it would be good to resolve it.\n\nAlso, modularisation of ZeroNet and relicensing core libraries as MIT or another permissive license would make ZeroNet more popular.

To do dynamic zites, you need to use JavaScript with ZeroFrame WebSocket API.\n\nHowever, if you prefer Python syntax, you may try to use client-side versions of Python, like [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide), which compiles Python into WebAssembly, or [Brython](https://github.com/brython-dev/brython), which transpiles Python into JavaScript. And there are also other similar projects. They either compile Python into WebAssembly or transpile it into JavaScript so it can be used in browsers. With them, you will be able to use Python syntax to create websites. However, you still won't be able to use Django or other server frameworks. And note that some of that projects are currently experimantal and can be a bit unstable.\n\nThere is also other possibility. You can create classic website with Python and Django, which is hosted on normal centralized server, but it uses ZeroNet as a storage or identity provider. To do this, you can use [ZeroFrame WebSocket API for Python](https://github.com/filips123/ZeroFramePy) which connects to existing ZeroNet instance and communicates with it. To do this, you would need running ZeroNet instance on you server, and Django server which will connect to it. Note that unless you provide option to users to download whole backend server and run it locally (so maybe bundling whole server and code into EXE so users can run it locally), it will sstill be somehow centralized as users will have to depend on your server. But it will be still more decentralized than classic servers as it would use ZeroNet for storage and identity.",

I would like to see how exactly it looks like.\n\nFirst, you should ensure compatibility with current Python implementation so users of both implementations will be able to communicate in the same network.\n\nThen, start creating new features, which could/should later also be ported to Python implementation (and also other implementations if they exist at that point), to make network compatible.\n\nSome of the features I found that people mostly want are:\n\n* More modular source code. For example, spitted implementation of the protocol itself and other code. This would enable easier integration with custom third-party ZeroNet-based solutions.\n\n* Support for more network protocol features, like WebTorrent, DHT, PEX, HTTP seeding... It might be possible to use [libtorrent](https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/) for this, which is C++ implementation of BitTorrrent with most of that networking features. However, you would need to create Rust bindings for it, and I also don't know how much configuration would be needed to make it work with dynamic content which is used in ZeroNet.\n\n* Better (also non-iframe-based) wrapper/sandbox. That's what @gitcenter already started implementing in Python version, but didn't complete it.\n\nFor more feature ideas, you'd probably need to search on existing GitHub issues or on ZeroTalk.",
