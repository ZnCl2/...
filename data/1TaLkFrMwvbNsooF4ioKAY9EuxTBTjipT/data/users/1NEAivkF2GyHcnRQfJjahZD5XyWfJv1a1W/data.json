Stay on the so-called #clearnet, and be their bitch. If you're just worried about legality, use #Tor or a good non-logging #VPN. As you know, it's illegal in some stupid corrupt places to just use the #internet. Further, encrypt your zeronet data directory with on-the-fly encryption in a hidden container for plausible deniability with programs like #EDS for Android, and #Veracrypt for Windows Etc. Or just access zeronet through a proxy. Nothing to leach or seed that way..😁\n@realjohndoe I'm not ready to eventually go to prison for helping in distributing illegal content \"for other's freedom\".\n\nThe project I'm working on would be a nice site for ZeroNet (something like a categorizer for each site content, which would allow oneself to take informed decisions before opening a site) and I don't like being criticized for not wanting to distribute illegal content.\n\nPlease think before answering: *I'm not ready for open Child Pornography and Drug selling, while I'm ready for liberty of speech, which the openness of the internet should be about*.",
