				"body": "> [bigbadbob](#comment_20_1CLhLYdMKjXtium9yjuRkSnFvPfdoUTXAj): a news story with trump bitching about facebook libra.   wtf is that.   is he trying to herd the sheep towards paypal 2.0 and away from any real crypto threat?    the power is always lies.\n\nI doubt Libra will take over the world. It's already been delayed to 2021, and legislative issues could kill it before it even launches.\n\nI'd be more concerned about companies using tokens to pay their own employees. Imagine you work for Amazon. You can either get $10/hour, or the equivalent of $15/hour in AmazonCoin. Since Amazon offers everything under the sun, most would choose AmazonCoin. Other megacorps could partner with vendors to offer similar stores. A thousand corporate tokens could damage the free market much more than a single currency like Libra.",
