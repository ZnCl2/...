			"title": "US Gov Angry at RT for Exposing Surveillance State, Lack of Democracy, and Wall Street Greed",
			"body": "From a report by the Director of National Intelligence 2017 https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf\nNullFolder hash bf551ccb3a5ca8d81d1ed2980d152cd3a478dba5\nParts of pages 6-8 that I found to be most important:\n\nFrom August to November 2012, RT ran numerous reports on alleged US election fraud and voting machine vulnerabilities, contending that US election results cannot be trusted and do not reflect the popular will.\n\nIn an effort to highlight the alleged \"lack of democracy\" in the United States, RT broadcast, hosted, and advertised third-party candidate debates and ran reporting supportive of the political agenda of these candidates. The RT hosts asserted that the US two-party system does not represent the views of at least one-third of the population and is a \"sham.\"\n\nRT aired a documentary about the Occupy Wall Street movement on 1, 2, and 4 November. RT framed the movement as a fight against \"the ruling class\" and described the current US political system as corrupt and dominated by corporations. RT advertising for the documentary featured Occupy movement calls to \"take back\" the government. The documentary claimed that the US system cannot be changed democratically, but only through \"revolution.\"\n\nRT created a Facebook app to connect Occupy Wall Street protesters via social media. In addition, RT featured its own hosts in Occupy rallies (\"Minaev Live,\" 10 April; RT, 2, 12 June).\n\nRT's reports often characterize the United States as a \"surveillance state\" and allege widespread infringements of civil liberties, police brutality, and drone use (RT, 24, 28 October, 1-10 November).\n\nRT has also focused on criticism of the US\neconomic system, US currency policy, alleged\nWall Street greed, and the US national debt. Some of RT's hosts have compared the United States to Imperial Rome and have predicted that government corruption and \"corporate greed\" will lead to US financial collapse (RT, 31 October, 4 November).\n\nRT runs anti-fracking programming, highlighting environmental issues and the impacts on public health. This is likely reflective of the Russian Government's concern about the impact of fracking and US natural gas production on the global energy market and the potential challenges to Gazprom's profitability (5 October).\n\nRT is a leading media voice opposing Western intervention in the Syrian conflict and blaming the West for waging \"information wars\" against the Syrian Government (RT, 10 October-9 November).\n\nIn an earlier example of RT's messaging in\nsupport of the Russian Government, during the Georgia-Russia military conflict the channel accused Georgians of killing civilians and organizing a genocide of the Ossetian people. According to Simonyan, when \"the Ministry of Defense was at war with Georgia,\" RT was \"waging an information war against the entire Western world\" (Kommersant, 11 July).\n\nMaybe US corperate media would run more stories like these if they weren't owned/influenced. RT shows its obvious Russian bias in whitewashing Russia's involventment in Syria and Georgia.",

I don't think automating that would be that hard. Additionally you might want to let circuits live for longer than the default 10 mins.",
