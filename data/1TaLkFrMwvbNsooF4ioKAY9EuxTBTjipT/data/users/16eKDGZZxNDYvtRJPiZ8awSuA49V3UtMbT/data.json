It's when you suddenly stop being able to enjoy things you used to like you know you have a problem.\n\nexactly. older people telling us to  \"get off your phone and enjoy\" .. i hate that. let us enjoy what this generation has, as they enjoyed their things too. i bet their parents told them to \"turn off that walkman for once\" too...just enjoy what you got.",
