So this isn't possible with multi-user sites.\nb) Some data is stored in localStorage (modern cookies), and as the host is equal for all zites (127.0.0.1:43110), any zite can access localStorage.

And once zite is downloaded, it will trigger some action, example e-mail notification.I can make a bash script, yet i am unsure about which command and parameters to use to query that particular zeronet URL (here is used this command: curl --silent http://$ZERO_HOST:43110/$SITE > /dev/null) and a good command that will verify if zite was downloaded (i can use awk to strip zite address out of URL and then check zeronet data folder if the zite directory is there and contains content.json) (i hope this file is an indicator that zite was added to my connected zites and will get auto updated)? [...]\n\nNo no no no don't use `curl`. That's unsafe because ZeroNet does some checks. Instead run `python zeronet.py siteDownload {address}`.",

			{
				"body": "> [citadell](#comment_7_1GE4QKLQM3L6r1NngDQEuEzwNBqHoBiXtL): What is this about, that amd/intel thing?\n\nYep. Spectre and Meltdown are critical vulnerabilities that let any process read another process'es or kernel memory.\n\nI'll try to explain how they work.\n\n# Meltdown\n\nModern processors execute several different instructions at once. If you have the following program:\n\n```\na++;\nb++;\nc += 2;\n```\n\nThen those instructions will be executed in parallel.\n\n## How it works\n\nLet `userspace` be your array, and `kernelspace` is what you want to read. Meltdown tries to read `userspace[kernelspace[0]]`. Of course, segfault appears, but it is not handled right now. Instead, `userspace[...]` is accessed and pushed to cache by processor.\n\nNow processor understands segfault should appear, and process is killed - but, cache isn't cleared. So that process can try to understand what part of `userspace` is in cache by timing.\n\nFor exampe: let `kernelspace[0]` be 12. Then item `userspace[12]` is read, and it is pushed to cache (those L1/L2/L3 caches). Now process will to read `userspace[0]` - e.g. that took `100` ticks. Same for `userspace[1..11]`. And `userspace[12]` is read within `10` ticks. Now we know item `12` was accessed, and that `kernelspace[0] = 12`.\n\nThen we do the same for `kernelspace[1]`, etc.\n\n# Spectre\n\nNot sure about this one, though, but I'll try to explain.\n\nModern processors have branch predictors. Take this code for example:\n\n```\nint i = 0;\nint a = 0;\nwhile(true) {\n    i++;\n    if(i % 2 == 0) {\n        a += 2;\n    } else {\n        a--;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThose `if` instructions (and maybe even some next cycles of while!) are executed in parallel, and then the wrong one's result isn't used. But then we will have to run both `a += 2` and `a--` even though only one part is ran. Branch predictor to rescue!\n\nBranch predictor sees that every odd call goes to `then` and every even call goes to `else`. So it tells the processor: I think, this branch should be executed - if it isn't, let's try another one.\n\n## How it works\n\nSpectre creates a loop with `if` inside. On first iterations, `then` branch is ran. That `then` branch reads some userspace memory via `userspace[userspace[0]]`. First iterations train branch predictor to go to `then`.\n\nOn iteration e.g. 1000 `if` condition is changed to `false` and `userspace[userspace[0]]` is replaced by `userspace[kernelspace[0]]`. Branch predictor thinks: we went to `then` for 999 iterations - let's go to `then` again. Invalid memory is accessed by `userspace[kernelspace[0]]`, segfault should be thrown - but now branch predictor sees that condition is `false` and thinks: oh, I took the wrong branch - and goes to `else`.\n\nBut `userspace[kernelspace[0]]` is still in cache. Now, if processor has good timings, we can find which item was accessed, take its index and find `kernelspace[0]`.\n\n# Which processors have this vulnerabilities?\n\nAll Intel processors since 2008.

				"body": "# Specifications\n\n[RFC 4616 - AUTH PLAIN specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4616)\n[RFC 5321 - SMTP specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321)\n[RFC 1939 - POP3 specification](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt)\n\n# Changelog\n\n## Jan 04, 2018 8:15:58\n\nFix message not rendering correctly on ZeroMail when lines are too long. This is caused by ZeroMail treating `\\n` as `\\n`, which is incorrect. So I manually replace all single `\\n` with spaces. Double `\\n\\n` are not replaced as they are separating paragraphs.\n\n## Jan 04, 2018 19:08:37\n\nUpdate: now `text/html` is searched and converted to markdown before looking for `text/plain`.\n\nSomebody, please check if SMTP server works for you.\n\n## Jan 04, 2018 18:48:14\n\nSome fixes:\n\n1. Loaded messages are converted from markdown to HTML on the fly.\n2. If message given to SMTP server is multipart, try to find `text/plain` section first. Then, fallback to `text/html`.\n\n## Jan 04, 2018 11:14:13\n\nYay! SMTP server *practically* finished.\n\n1. Start it with `sudo python smtp.py`. \n2. Write messages as usual - you may specify several recipients (`<something>@zeroid.bit`)\n\nHTML/markdown support is not ready yet, so inbox messages may appear like `**Hello** *world* !`, and outbox messages may look like `<b>Hello</b> <i>world</i> !` in ZeroMail GUI.\n\n## Jan 04, 2018 12:23:07\n\nAdded `README.md` with examples for Windows Mail and ThunderBird to GitHub. Fixed POP3 protocol not working with Windows Mail. Command-line `send.py` can now send messages not to yourself only.\n\n## Jan 03, 2018 00:33:48\n\nPOP3 support practically finished.\n\n1. Change path to ZeroNet in `config.py`\n2. Run `python main.py` and copy public/private keys which will be printed\n3. Run `python pop.py`\n4. Configure your mail client to use POP3 on `localhost` on port `110` with login = public key and password = private key\n\n## Jan 03, 2018 22:52:08\n\nA small update. SMTP server isn't finished yet, but you can send messages to yourself via command line.\n\n1. **Send a message to yourself via GUI first (this is needed to add a `secret` for you)**\n2. Run `python send.py`\n3. Type subject, message and your nickname (e.g. `gitcenter` or `nofish`)\n4. Open ZeroMail GUI and check if message appears\n\n## Jan 03, 2018 21:14:15\n\nPOP3 now working with builtin Windows Mail application!\n\n## Jan 03, 2018 15:17:18\n\nSome POP3 update.\n\nNow login is not public key - instead, it is your id on ZeroID. For example, for me that's `1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di`\n\n## Jan 03, 2018 12:37:44\n\nYay! POP3 server finished.\n\nInstallation instruction:\n\n1. Change path to ZeroNet in `config.py`\n2. Execute `sudo python pop.py`\n3. Configure your mail client to listen to `localhost` on port `110` with login `local` and password `local`.\n\nIf using `local` did not succeed, manually find your public/private key and pass them as login/password, respectively.\n\n## Jan 03, 2018 10:44:09\n\nYou can now use `local` as username and/or password to let ZeroMailProxy guess your public/private keys, respectively.\n\n## Jan 01, 2018 18:11:34\n\nYou can now change ZeroNet path in `main.py` and then run it. The script will try to guess private and public key by reading JSONs. Then it will display messages and cache them.",

				"body": "**TL;DR:**\n\n1. \"Normal\" files are used for HTML, CSS, JavaScript - all site layout - small files. They are always downloaded. E.g. posts on ZeroTalk or ZeroMe.\n2. Optional files are used for middle files. You choose if you want to download them. E.g. images on ZeroMe.\n3. Big files are used for... big files. You choose if you want to download them. E.g. files on ZeroUp.\n\n> someone more experienced than me may know better and have a superior answer, though.\n\nPractically the same, but more techy details:\n\nWhen you visit some site for the first time, ZeroNet downloads `content.json` of the site from other peers. That `content.json` has hashes of all files and some more metadata. Now your client checks all files from `content.json` and downloads them (maybe from other peers). As soon as `index.html` is loaded, it is shown as homepage. That's how most sites work, including ZeroTalk - you probably saw topic list updating in real-time when you downloaded ZeroTalk - that's because many files were downloading at once.\n\nNow imagine ZeroMe (you are registered there, right?). If all images were downloaded, that would result in *many* GB. But ZeroMe doesn't download all files because **images were marked as optional files**. Optional files aren't downloaded at once; instead, you choose when to download them - and when to delete them, of course.\n\n@nekololi mentioned a checkbox to download all optional files. Yep, it exists, and it really downloads **all** optional files - both past and future. (that checkbox doesn't work for ZeroMe, through - instead, you should turn it on *hubs* if you want)\n\nAnd the last but not least is ZeroUp. It can host large files. Those files are marked as optional and **bigfiles**. **Bigfiles** are downloaded only if you want them (like optional files), but instead of downloading them from one peer, **bigfiles** are downloaded from many peers at once - that's BitTorrent.",

If you read a code of a popular project that's being developed by many people, you'll always find some fingerprints -- even codestyle doesn't help here.

				"body": "Short explanation: It's bad.\n\nA bit longer explanation: It means that a zite can do bad stuff with your ZeroNet instance.\n\n## Long explanation\n\nAll clearnet sites are independent. They have their own storage (and can't access other site's storage), they can't read other site's content (to prevent reading your Facebook page to find out who you are). How does your browser check that *this page* can access content/storage of *another page*? It just checks the host -- e.g. if you use `facebook.com`, it has access to everything stored for/served by `facebook.com`. This mechanism is called **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).\n\nHowever, when you visit ZeroNet all the hosts are `127.0.0.1:43110`, so the browser thinks it's one single site, and it turns out that zites can access data of other zites. Oops.\n\nTo prevent this from happening, ZeroNet uses iframes. When you open ZeroNet at e.g. `127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit`, the script creates an iframe and loads the site content inside it. The iframe has security settings -- e.g., it can't access so-called localStorage, or read any zite content, or *connect to the websocket*. So we have fixed most of the problems. But not all of them.\n\nLet's talk about websockets now. First of all, what is a websocket? A websocket is a tool that allows a script running in your browser to communicate with a site. E.g., if you were making a clearnet game, you would use websocket to connect your browser to the game server.\n\nNow, what does ZeroNet use websockets for? Just a lot of things. For example, clearnet sites can't read any zite content -- but zites *must* do it! Also, ZeroNet supports SQLite database to make sites faster. It also allows the site to *write* content -- e.g., when you make a comment or a post, in fact it's the websocket that's used to move the text from your browser to ZeroNet instance, which is then distributed to the whole ZeroNet network.\n\nSo, websockets are really helpful. However, if we allow any sites to connect to it, we will soon stumble upon a problem -- what if the site wants to do something we don't allow it to do? For example, deleting other sites. Or setting size limit to 10TB. Or something worse. What should we do then?\n\nLet's *not* allow any sites to connect to the websocket. Instead, let's allow the sandbox to connect (sandbox = what you get when you visit `127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit`, iframe inside sandbox = the zite content that the sandbox loads). The iframe would tell the sandbox that it wants to do something, the sandbox would check that it's allowed and pass the request to ZeroNet websocket. ZeroNet instance would receive it and make the appropriate action. Easy-peasy. (I told you a bit more than you asked me about, but that will give you an idea of how zites communicate with the network.)\n\nSo, the sandbox loads the zite inside iframe to prevent some breaches. The *real* problem is that *sometimes* sites can do *something* to connect to the websocket directly (ZeroNet uses a mechanism similar to [nonces](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1KiwiBCVBUcuypVm8FEmUW9YT6fJDXkN9r/?/imported/en/https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-cryptographic-nonce/cryptographic-nonce) try to prevent it). This *do something to connect to the websocket directly* = run code outside iframe, in the *sandbox* part (again, sandbox = what you get when you visit `127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit`, iframe inside sandbox = the zite content that the sandbox loads). This is called *escaping the iframe* or *breaking from iframe*.",

And it's not just a fairy tale. I think I'll have to tell you something I've never told anyone.\n\n---\n\nWhen I've found a serious vulnerability and received a notice from @zerolstn about something wrong happening with his proxy, I've understood that something is going wrong. I've created a encrypted room outside ZeroNet (on Matrix if that matters) to discuss what to do with the most active ZeroNet developers that I trust: namely @krixano, @zerolstn, @glightstar and also @thunder33345. We've fixed the vulnerability soon, but when we started thinking about pushing & sending a pull request, we've got a problem.\n\nnofish was on vacation. We've sent him a email, but he didn't reply. We couldn't publish the PR right now because someone could easily exploit it before the fix was merged. And we couldn't wait because the vulnerability was most likely being exploited.\n\nWe didn't know what to do. It was a really stressful situation.\n\nHowever, we've found a solution. We would use the exploit itself to change the source code to fix the nodes (yup, it was The \"Vacation\" RCE vulnerability).\n\nExactly at the point when we've implemented it and starting testing, nofish replied. We've published the PR next day & he merged it immediately.\n\n---\n\nIt was a really stressful situation that shouldn't have happened at all.",

Rotating the address for ZeroHello(for example) frequently or implement a feature that requires 4 of of 5 signatures in a content.json to update a critical zite might be a good idea to somewhat combat that, but seem a bit hacky to me.\n\nThat's not hacky, that's how modern internet should work.\n\n> [pexo](#comment_112_1DfrA2M9Qra6stqT6tzwNMYNweswY54KAC): There is also a consideration to be made as to what group of people should get into that position.\n\nThat's somewhat a problem, right.

[...]\n\nI'm not sure whether my solution is the best thing we can come up with, however, here it is:\n\n1. When the site owner wants to make his site multisignable, he sends a special `siteMultisignTransform` command, signed with the master key (master key is the site address private key in this context).\n  - The command requires a list of public keys that should be allowed to sign changes. This list is saved by all peers who seed this site\n  - This command is broadcasted to all seeders, like `sitePublish` for example.\n  - When new peers download this site, other peers (who have the site already) should send this signed list too\n  - When peers get `sitePublish` command signed with the master key, they ignore it if they've received `siteMultisignTransform` already.\n  - When peers get `sitePublish` from master key but they've received `siteMultisignTransform` already (or they've received the list from other peers), they ignore the request\n    - Sybil attacks is something that can't be physically solved, so I don't think this is important\n2. When people (from the first signers list) want to change the list itself, they start voting\n  - They may send `siteMultisignVoteAdd(\"1anotherpublickey\")` signed with their public key, and provide the old list, signed with the master key as a proof\n  - This command is broadcasted the same way as described above\n  - When peers receive this command, they check something: if the count of votes is at least 75%, they update their list locally. They also save the signature that all the voters made\n3. When the new peer wants to vote, he provides both the original list and the signatures of people who voted for him, and so on.\n\nThis makes it look like a simple blockchain. However, it's private and doesn't require any proof of work/stake/anything, so it's light, fast and won't be broken.\n\nWhat I haven't mentioned is:\n1. The required signature percent can be modified by the master key (originally), and be voted for (later)\n2. Removing someone from the list is also possible, it doesn't bring any problems",

So, if a single person has an optional file, you have to be lucky enough to connect to him. In case the file cannot be downloaded from known peers, ZeroNet queues that file until new peers are found for the site.\n\nSo, most of your questions are related to how ZeroNet works *at all*, not with optional files. Nevertheless, I think they are important enough to answer:\n\n> Will it use all?\n\nYes, ZeroNet will connect to all trackers you have.\n\n> Will this cause some lag (how long)?\n\nThe trackers are accessed in parallel. Once a tracker returns a peer list, ZeroNet tries to use it immediately. So, the only lag is the ping time to tracker.\n\n> What if i have 100 working trackers?\n> i want to add optimal amount of trackers and not overload my computer/zeronet in any way (it is already utilized enough)\n\nSame here.

Will this single private key file be the one and only thing that I need to keep secure and backup in regards to not losing control of my \"ZeroNet account\" and any \"Zero sites\" I create?\n\nA random private key is created for every site you create, and every certificate (i.e.: your ZeroID, KxoID, etc.) you create. All these keys are stored in `users.json` file. This is the only file you have to backup.\n\n> Is ZeroNet \"released\" already, or is this some sort of \"early testing phase\"? Can I start right now to attempt to get people to use my \"Zero site\", or is this for testing only, and all content on the network will be reset for the \"stable release\"?\n\nIt's released.\n\n> How exactly is data stored? It just flies around nodes like little encrypted chunks, all stored in RAM/network, hoping that all nodes will never go down at once? How does ZeroNet get around the need for \"vaults\" (people running dedicated storage servers and getting paid for it with a special cryptocurrency)?\n\nPeople who have a specific site downloaded (e.g.: ZeroTalk) download and store all ZeroTalk content on HDD. This means that as long as at least one peer is online, you can download the content from it.\n\nIf you want to make sure there are always peers for your own sites, you can publish them to proxies (e.g.: zn.amorgan.xyz)\n\nThe data is not encrypted.\n\n> Is it possible for me to, right now, make a \"Zero site\" which nobody can modify or add content to or do anything to, and I am the only one who can add/modify/delete it?\n\nYes. Open ZeroHello, open menu (next to \"Hello ZeroNet_\"), press \"Create new, empty site\". There you go.\n\n> When making a Zero site, it seems like it's a requirement for me to display the full \"source code\" (HTML, CSS and some sort of \"enhanced JavaScript\"?),\n\nZeroNet doesn't use any \"enhanced JavaScript\" in case you mean \"JavaScript with new syntax\" or something similar. Instead, it uses a special API (called ZeroFrame; you can get a copy when you create an empty site).\n\n> because there is no server where PHP or whatever can execute. This makes sense, and is like SAFE Network, but nothing stops me from having a PHP script on my computer which, for example, adds content to my site in an automated fashion, or pulls new data from my site (which is set to only be visible by me) for processing locally... right?\n\nYou're right. You can use any language as long as it's running on your computer (obviously). But you can't make others execute your PHP code.\n\n> If so, is it easy to interact with ZeroNet from PHP?\n\nZeroNet uses websockets for this; there's going to be a library by someone for PHP soon, but you can take a look at how ZeroNet uses websockets and simulate this with PHP.\n\n> Must a ZeroNet node be running on the same computer?\n\nSure, how would you publish content to others otherwise?\n\n> Is there some sort of minimal \"server edition\" of ZeroNet which can be (and maybe has already been) vetted? (It's scary running \"sketchy\"/new software on my machine.)\n\nNo, there's no other version.\n\n> Assuming that I've sorted out all the above, how would I make my new \"Zero site\" known? Since the Internet (clearnet) is the way it is these days, all opportunities for advertising something have long since disappeared. Is there some sort of way that I could get legitimate attention to my Zero site on Zeronet itself? Like in that \"main menu\" thing which I'm using right now to post this? Is there some sort of \"discovery system\" in place for people to actually find my stuff? And if so, won't it quickly be flooded with garbage, making it impossible to find my site nevertheless?\n\nThere's ZeroSites, which is a site catalogue. You can use it to make it easier for others to find your site. Making a thread on ZeroTalk is a good and common idea too.\n\n> Do you need to pay with \"Zerocoins\"? If so, how do you get those?\n\nZeroNet doesn't have any cryptocurrency.\n\n> Is really nobody moderating this thing (\"ZeroTalk\")? If that's the case, the quality of the posts is surprisingly high...\n\nnofish is the administrator of this forum. However, AFAIK, he has never deleted a post here.

				"comment_id": 663,
				"body": "A quote from a private conversation with nofish:\n\n---\n\nForce-updating security-related code makes sense. There should be a single kill switch, like what Debian/Ubuntu have with their `security` repository branches. For example, the Exim fiasco was fixed by issuing an update to `security` branch, and many servers got updated before their administrators noticed the problem. This should not be difficult to implement. The update could be ran on shutdown (that will be kind of a mess on proxies though, I have no idea how it should work there; that's something we should discuss later). Automatically updating code without user revision is kind of unsafe though; it probably makes sense to sign that code twice (yes, here we go again with multisign). You could either make the code signed by two of five (for example) people, or, at least, require two signatures from two of your devices to ensure we don't get screwed if one of the devices got hacked.\n\nIt also makes sense to make vulnerability reporting easier. Using GitHub issues means it'll be public, which should be avoided. Using ZeroMail instead *does* sounds like a good idea, but ZeroMail doesn't support group topics (remember \"The Vacation\"? At least three people took part in the research), neither does it support attaching fixes and exploits (we could use GitHub/GitHub Gists/something, which is, again, not as simple as it should be). There should be a way to report vulnerabilities both inside ZeroNet and outside it.\n\nNext, publishing the post-mortem with the explanations, like we did with \"The Vacation\" vulnerability, and an AMA thread will make people start looking into ZeroNet code, and show them it's not that difficult to add their feature, fix their bug, or find their vulnerability. Some vulnerabilities can also teach others a bit and make them carefully look through their old code.\n\nI have a good enough solution for the two problems mentioned above. While there is a Gitlab mirror of ZeroNet repository, it's only a mirror. Gitlab allows a lot more features; that's what I'd recommend to use. Also, GitHub was acquired by Microsoft, so I think it makes even more sense to switch. First, Gitlab lets us create an organization (aka group) for free. It also lets us create unlimited private repositories for free, and replace an outdated Unix-way \"Nobody / Collaborator\" permissions with \"Nobody / Guest / Reporter / Maintainer / Owner\", which will be helpful in the model I'll describe below.\n\nBut, obviously, the greatest feature Gitlab has is that everything can be automated. And by \"everything\", I mean everything.\n\nGitlab has many useful features regarding pull requests, and I strongly suggest we utilize some of them. One of them is requiring reviews from some people or groups of people. For now, you could be the only reviewer. Then, we would use a bot for tests and linting (Gitlab runs the checks using fork tests, so it's technically possible to manipulate the results; we'd use a bot to fix this). Again, the result formatting could be made by the bot.\n\nNow, can we simplify reporting vulnerabilities? Yes, we can. Gitlab supports confidential issues, but they have a few major issues. Instead, we would create a special issue dedicated to vulnerability reports or to reports containing personal information. Whenever someone wants to create a private issue, they would send `@zeronet-bot /private-report` there. The bot would then create a private repository (e.g. `HelloZeroNet/Report-17`), invite ZeroNet developers and the reporter, and ping them all with a @mention. The reporter will then be able to use the bot to invite more people to the report with `@zeronet-bot /invite-to-report @username` (for example, if the vulnerability was found by several people). Finally, the reporter and the developers will issue `@zeronet-bot /publish-report` to make the report public after the problem is fixed or `@zeronet-bot /delete-report` to delete it in case the problem hasn't been confirmed.\n\nAnother interesting feature Gitlab has is automatic merging as soon as all necessary reviews are made. This means that security update signing can be automated: if you are offline, we would create a private report, provide a fix, and get accepted by a majority of ZeroNet-related developers. More specifically, the following workflow could be used to handle \"The Vacation\" vulnerability faster:\n\n1. I issue `@zeronet-bot /private-report` to the main repository;\n2. The bot creates `HelloZeroNet/Report-6` repository and invites you and me;\n3. The bot creates an issue (#1);\n4. We (as in: me, krixano, anoa and anthyg) explain the vulnerability with an issue in the private repository;\n5. We prepare the fix in a private fork in `vuln-fix` branch (e.g. `imachug/ZeroNet`);\n6. I invite `@zeronet-bot` to the fork as a guest;\n7. We tell the bot about the fix with `@zeronet-bot /set-fix imachug/ZeroNet vuln-fix`;\n8. The bot imports the fix to `HelloZeroNet/Report-6`;\n9. The voting starts; several developers send `@zeronet-bot /accept-fix` (or, in a good case, only you send it);\n10. Once the majority (or you) accept the fix, the bot merges it, assigns a new revision number and version, updates ZeroUpdate with the code and a \"security update backed by <reviewers> and <developers>\" notice;\n11. ZeroNet core shows the notice to users as soon as the update is received, and before shutdown too. There's a small caveat here, though: you have to be careful not to overwrite other developer's patches they haven't commited yet in their local repository.\n\nYou might be wondering why it's required to import the fix, so let me explain that. The fix might be created by the reporter, not by a developer; so, it's technically possible to upload a correct fix, wait till it's about to be accepted by you, and change it to malicious code quickly. Using `/set-fix` followed by a small cooldown (a single minute is enough) during which the fix can't be accepted will fix that problem.\n\nThough I understand that these suggestions sound difficult, I have used them for a while and they work rather well.

In case they, however, don't have access to Wikipedia, it's still ok -- they can route their connection through other peers who are \"exit nodes\" -- PeerMessage would work well here.\n\nFinally, where do we get signatures from?

But they aren't listed, ask nofish why.\n\n> [filips](#comment_159_1LFu1BTScmY82HHtg3TY2jAuSrCYNsQWEY): It should be also integrated with other services, as I described here and here.\n\nI'm not sure about Nodis Chat, it was never updated AFAIK. Also, glightstar is working on better ThunderWave now, so I'd avoid integrating with old ThunderWave. Other ideas look sane though:\n\n- ZeroTalk integration can be implemented the following way: on Reddit, there will be a \"Migrate topic from ZeroTalk\" button. When you press it and you give it the link of a ZeroTalk thread, it'll copy the topic to Reddit and send a \"*Continue discussion on Reddit [here](/)*\" comment to ZeroTalk (in case you're the topic author, it'll embed that link to the topic text as well);\n- Additionally, a subreddit can be configured to be a mirror of a ZeroTalk. For example, `r/misc/zerotalk` can be a mirror of official ZeroTalk. In this case, ZeroTalk is used as the only comment/topic storage, and users will have to download ZeroTalk to participate in that subreddit;\n- ZeroBlog can be integrated the following way as above;\n- Additionally, articles from ZeroTalk, ZeroBlog, Kiwipedia, ZeroWiki and Millchan can be embedded as widgets, similarly to file/image attachments.\n\n> [filips](#comment_159_1LFu1BTScmY82HHtg3TY2jAuSrCYNsQWEY): But, if I understand correctly, most of subreddits are managed by original Reddit owner. And if you want to create new ZeroNet subreddit, you have to first create it in Reddit. This has some problems. What if owner of Reddit subreddit doesn't use ZeroNet? Who will maintain it? Or what if someone want to create subreddit in hierarchy (maybe r/tech/myproject), but you don't or can't have Reddit? How will you be able to do that?\n\nI think you didn't get the idea. ZeroNet Reddit should (will) be completely separated from clearnet Reddit. By \"Reddit owner\", I actually meant \"ZeroNet Reddit owner\" -- i.e. some top-level subreddits will be maintained by me (or the one who creates ZeroNet Reddit). Additionally, we might want to support several root subreddits -- i.e. if you don't trust me, you can create your own root subreddit, link to r/tech, r/rec, r/resistance or whatever you want and maintain the links yourself.",

Then you ask us all about where they're coming from.

I mean, I wasn't sure whether he's a single person, but he's real at least. Here's his GitHub: https://github.com/shortcutme. Please notice that most commits to ZeroNet core is made by him.

You've raised an interesting question about network owners being responsible in what people use it for. This is not something I'm ready to discuss and it's not a question with a single correct answer. But we should look at ZeroNet from the point, of, oh well, Bitcoin. I'm not talking about blockchain or something -- I'm talking about who it's used by and what it's used for. Most people use Bitcoin just as a currency, but criminals use it for they dirty work payment too. I understand that nofish wants to remain silent, and you put it really well.\n\nEven if those mistakes are actually \"mistakes\" (as put by @znnex), they are reasonable.\n\nI've also thought about how nofish feels when I report another vulnerability and ask him to spread the right to control the network to several parties. It looks like kidnapping.\n\nBut I don't see a way to continue ZeroNet growth with nofish remaining the only silent developer.

Please ZeroMail me how this was done.\n\nWill do that in a few hours. Sorry, I want to sleep too much\n\n> The linked site details a replacement exploit in which site content is replaced by the frame key. A massive exploit, but ultimately does not contradict what I have written. If you don't actually run the content on the site (by visiting it in the browser), the site itself is entirely harmless. If you don't actually run the content on the site (by visiting it in the browser), the site itself is entirely harmless.\n\nTrue (well, unless there's another issue I missed).\n\n> Likewise, this does not use admin rights (it's an iframe exploit)\n\nFalse! The reason it breaks the sandbox is just to get ADMIN permission. After that, it uses the normal ZeroFrame API. If you gave the ADMIN permission to the site yourself, I would be able to steal keys too.\n\n> Which is, of course, the way most malicious code these days is executed, such as this exploit here.\n\nSocial engineering is definitely the way to go. Still, it can be rather well-hidden. I could add the exploit to the post-mortem or find some dirty site that supports user content and embed the exploit there (e.g. thunderwave, there was an XSS before).\n\n> This has less to do with nofish being the sole dev and more to do with exploits and bugs existing in software. Having more developers wouldn't mean that bugs suddenly no longer exist.\n\nIt doesn't mean that there will be no bugs. It doesn't even mean that there are going to be *fewer* bugs. What it *does* mean is that the vulnerabilities will be found faster and then fixed faster -- as soon as they are reported -- and there will be no fiascos like \"Vulnerability half-fixed\" (i.e. your issue).",

If it didn't work, do `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py && python3 get-pip.py`;\n- Download ZeroNet with `git clone https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet.git`;\n- Install ZeroNet dependencies with `cd ZeroNet && python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`;\n- Allow yourself to connect to the node from LAN by adding `zeronet.conf`:\n```\n[global]\nui_ip = 0.0.0.0\nui_port = 80\nui_host = 127.0.0.1\n```\n- Start ZeroNet with `python3 start.py`.\n\nYou'll now be able to connect to your node from another computer with `http://machineip` (learn the IP from the router or something).\n\n---\n\nIf that won't work well or you want to make a more difficult setup, I'm always ready to help.

They then check that the username is not registered yet (they check their local database first and then run a 30-second, or so, round of consensus).

[...]\n\nLooks like you don't understand how ZeroNet works.\n\nThere are certificate providers. Each provider has a privatekey (or many). When you want to register a username, you somehow ask the provider to sign your username<->auth_address mapping with their privatekey. Your ZeroNet client then saves this signature along with your username locally (to users.json) and then adds it to all files you create. For example, when I write this message on ZeroTalk, ZeroNet automatically adds `gitcenter<->1Cy3` signature to my comment. So, having a signature is enough to confirm that you own the username, and the only way to lose the signature is to delete your users.json (which is rather dumb).\n\nAlso, I don't really understand the \"can be hidden per the blocklist\" part. Krixano can't block you from other people, only those people can do that if they want to. I mean, anyone can block me on ZeroTalk as well even though I'm using ZeroID right now.",

So even if technically the code is being run on random people's computers, what code is being run is controlled by him or whoever he decided to lend the keys to.

But 0background.py is run by BackgroundProcessing plugin that can't be updated silently by Krixano. BackgroundProcessing plugin (it's written by me and it's open-source, so you can be sure there are no issues there) makes sure that 0background.py code is executed safely without any vulnerability.\n\nSo, the only threat we're left with is that Krixano could possibly change the register algorithm to disallow some people to register. First, that can be disabled by making 0background.py file readonly. Second, you can get a username as long as at least one of the registrars support you, so you're safe as long as there are \"hardcode speech activists\" among registrars.\n\n> That's why I said \"if it ever becomes a feature\".\n\nI doubt nofish will implement that, but ok.\n\n> All it would take is nofish pushing an update that adds that feature\n\nHa ha ha ha ha.... he he. *ahem* Sorry, but I doubt that'll be implemented, and if it is, I'd say it's the right time to fork ZeroNet.\n\n> or the maintainers for the required plugin to get KxoID certs (which again, for all I know might be controlled by the same guy who set up KxoID) which would prevent people who have themselves gotten KxoID certs to recognize blacklisted users as valid.By making these lists he expressed at the very least an intent to make it easy for other users to block people he disagrees with. Making it mandatory for people who use his ID service to subscribe to those blacklists is just a step away.\n\nWell, there are many spamlists among ZeroNet, and you don't argue with them for some reason!",

I'm talking about the plugins pinging a clearnet address with your IP, your master seed, your bank account, or what have you. Plguins (at least as far as I understand it) are omnipotent. I wouldn't really want to have somebody who subscribes to leftist ideals so much that he goes out of his way to maintain wrongthink lists to be able to push arbitrary code to my computer.\n\nThat's right, plugins can be unsafe. But that's officially stated by nofish, and it's not recommended to install plugins if you don't trust the developer (or, even better, read the code). The only plugin you have to install to register a KxoID is PeerMessage (by me), but you can check its code, and rather many people use it, and you can delete it immediately after registering a username, so I doubt that's a problem.",

I'm talking about cert providers being able to revoke the certificates they have emitted in the past. Which by itself would probably be a reasonable feature.\n\nWell, if that gets implemented, all certificate providers will be able to remove IDs, so that's not related to KxoID and shouldn't be thought of as a con.\n\n*Hello @glightstar btw*",

Like, is it because the certificate gets issued and saved (so I guess, saved somewhere for others to see, and for the registrating user).. and then .. I don't know 😅\n\nYeah, something like that. Let me use ZeroID as an example: you ask ZeroID server to register you. The ZeroID server then gives you a signature that signs `web/glightstar@zeroid.bit#youraddress` or something like that, I don't remember the exact format. You then add this signature to all user content.json's you sign. Other ZeroNet clients then do the following:\n\n- Read your content.json,\n- Find your signature,\n- Check who you're claiming to be,\n- Ensure that the signature is signing the correct username,\n- Ensure that the signature is signed by ZeroID.\n\nSo, as long as you have the signature, you're safe.",

Basically, it's something like sandboxing: the code is only allowed to access a small set of features.\n\nMore technically speaking, it parses your code and replaces *all* accessed variables (e.g. `var`) with `scope[\"var\"]` or similar, as well as all potentially dangerous accessed attributes. Then, only a fixed set of variables are allowed to be accessed (namely, a few stubs and the ZeroFrame API class), and you can't really use them for anything except what they were intended for (i.e. you can't get access to `function`/`code`/whatever objects because they're not in the scope, and all dangerous attributes are disabled).",

When registrars receive the request, they decrypt it with KxoID's private key to find what they should do. They then check that the username is not registered yet (they check their local database first and then run a 30-second, or so, round of consensus). After that, the registrar that was the first one to receive the request adds the username to their database and broadcast their database to all the network (using classic ZeroNet this time) and send the response to the original user (via PeerMessage).

The \"likelihood of seeing spam vs anonymity\" balance doesn't have to be the same for all users.Of course it isn't easy, and I'm not suggesting all of this can be done in a week, but as far as I know, there aren't any plans or publicly stated intentions to do all of this in the short term OR in the long term.\n\nThis looks like a troublesome idea to me -- mostly because of its implementation.

Just a guess.\n\nThat's impossible currently.\n\nAlso, let me quote my reply from GitHub:\n\n---\n\n> What is the purpose of making a user's public key UNIQUE on every zite\n\nThat's not to allow sites to deanonymize you if you don't want that.\n\n> but the auth_address (aka Bitcoin address) the SAME on every zite?\n\nauth_address is *not* the same on every zite. The only way to make it the same is to switch your identity from \"No certificate\" (which used to be \"Unique to this site\" before, by the way) to some ID (i.e. ZeroID or KxoID, etc.). Thus, sites can't deanonymize you, but you can choose to use a single ID (*or* different IDs, which is not supported now but should be; you can make it work right now by using several domains though) for centralization.\n\n> But what if you're NOT using Zeronet's sqlite data storage\n\nHow is SQLite even connected to what you're talking about? I guess you're just talking about file-based storage.\n\n> since you have to rely on \"legacy\" authorization techniques for the user\n\nPlease explain what's legacy. If you're talking about the auth provider stuff, I doubt it's legacy.\n\n> Rather, a Zeronet-enhanced APP SERVER \"should\" be able to retrieve a user's public key from a registry (based on their cert id) and then send a challenge that can ONLY be solved by the private key holder.\n\nOk, so are we talking about user verification? In this case:\n\n1. Automatically signing everything *must not* be even considered. Signing lots of data is insecure, eats CPU resources and so on. Instead, an app should decide what (and whether) to sign data, which is currently possible with PeerMessage (you can add BackgroundProcessing for performance and reliability).\n2. There's a (fairly obvious) way to get current user public key which you can then share or save or do whatever you want. There's also API to sign and verify data. Can't you use that?\n\n> making user authorization BUILT-IN for ALL developers.\n\nWhat *is* built-in user authorization? We can't just allow *all* data to be saved. The site owner has to control this. Now, you can either use built-in file share mechanisms or use PeerMessage to simulate whatever you want.\n\n> It should appeal to developers wanting to bridge an existing Clearnet application over to Zeronet\n\nLike what?\n\n> In which case, it would be ideal to utilize current backend systems while making the migration to a fully decentralized solution.\n\nHow can this even be possible? Are you talking about bridging as in \"make all decentralized data decentralized and leave all centralized data centralized, but also use a central service to bridge these two storages\"? If that's the case, you can already do that in an obvious way.\n\n> Could utilize the deprecated auth_key. (btw, why was this deprecated?)\n\nI guess that's because it was centralized and allowed fingerprinting. Also, it wasn't really secure because all sites could use it to sign (possibly dangerous) commands.\n\n> Create a NEW plugin to derive a STATIC public key from the master key.\n\nAgain, what for? Do you *really* want a static public key? You can make a static *address* currently (either use existing solutions like ZeroID or generate the IDs you need on the fly ~~like in my upcoming project~~). If you only need to sign or verify data, you don't need public keys -- addresses are enough. If you want to encrypt or decrypt data, that's a bit more of a problem, but you can simply use different encryption keys for different sites, which should be better for security, by the way.",

When enough people upgrade, we'd allow users use the added features.\n\n> I don't even know how you would create and test a fork of ZeroNet.

What about, say, allowing the user to enable/disable unattended security updates when ZeroNet is installed (recommend enabling it though, many users can't read unfortunately) and allowing them to cancel the update when they've received one (e.g. if they're doing something important on ZeroNet right now).

I personally take my time to check for updates periodically and I like being present and aware when an update is about to be installed. That way I can start updates when I have enough free time to fix whatever goes wrong with it (and actually make snapshots of my zeronet folder so said update won't cripple my instance irreparably).I'd like being able to update like windows does, that is, having some grace time that I set between the time a security update becomes available and the time I actually decide to install them. If I don't install them in that period, then force the update. Finally, a switch that would disable any way of auto-updating, just for those users that want control over anything else (like me).\n\nLooks great to me, that's exactly what I am thinking about.",

Such as manual updates. But even those are not enough in many cases. Many/most (?) of the operating systems contains (national) (USA) backdoors. Even open source ones, such as OpenBSD. And that system is inteneded to be secure by default. So there could be vulnerabilities, even in an open source code, and people (not even coders) would not even notice it. Or even if they would notice it, they could not do many things about it/them.\n\nThere are several ways to abuse the unattended update system:\n\n- Generate a valid update. Probably the first thing you'd think about. However, if we implemented multisig, this would mean stealing the keys of several people who use ZeroNet. The keys should be stored in an offline storage (say, a flash drive or a piece of paper, lol) so it's literally impossible.\n- Make nofish and someone else sign the invalid update. This would probably need the attacker to have much power and be able to force the signers. Relatively impossible given that there are several signers, preferably from different countries (thanks to Krixano for this idea, this is something we've discussed before).\n- Abuse the update deployment process. If the attacker has found an RCE in ZeroNet, he could theoretically use it to modify the update or steal the keys from the signers' computers at the moment of signing. This is probable if the signing process and instance run on the same device, but literally impossible as long as ZeroNet runs under a separate user or even on a separate device.",

These are the connections you make when you want to publish your comments/posts/etc. or you think it's the right time to check if there's new content available (every few minutes).\n- Incoming (only available if you have an open port).

Snap updates automatically, so if a developer is somehow convinced into pushing a dangerous update, it will be delivered to all the users in no time. Additionally, there is no verification by the distro maintainers.\n3. Chances are, Snap updates are going to interfere with ZeroNet's own updates, although don't quote me on that.\n4. Snaps are slow, it takes an eternity to start apps.\n\nSnap is like Electron -- it's modern, everyone uses it, everyone admits it's worse than native apps but it's easier for developers so fuck users' problems.",

We met when I was making a project, StackOverflow for ZeroNet, and then found out Krixano had released it when my site was half-ready.

He had taught me a lot.\n\nBut from time to time he grew wild for no visible reason. Sometimes he would tell us to fuck off and left the group for weeks or months, but then he returned as if nothing happened. I didn't understand him back then, just like few understand me now: I was young and haven't seen depression. When he decided to delete the sites, I couldn't stop him. He told me to make backups, save the repositories; I affected nothing so I said 'go for it'.\n\nI don't want to go down that road. Things may work out, but I don't want to leave shutting the door.

Is it really necessary to have so many permissions? I mean, isn't there a way to reduce the amount of different permissions? This is me advocating for a smaller permission set since it should reduce the potential issues that come by implementing so much functionality.\n\nIn short, the permissions are:\n\n- **ReadSettings**: Retrieve site, ZeroNet node, user and tracker information.\n- **ReadData**: Read site files and query site databases.\n- **WriteData**: Allow adding, deleting, editing and publishing data on your behalf.\n- **SiteUpdate**: Control site updates.\n- **Stats**: Get statistics about peers, trackers, site updates and file sharing.\n- **WrapperUI**: Change ZeroNet UI settings for this site.\n- **SetStorageLimits**: Set arbitrary site size limits.\n- **SiteDelete**: Delete this site.\n- **IdentityControl**: List, add certificates, and use any ID certificate for signing data.\n- **ServerAdmin**: Restart, update and configure ZeroNet.\n- **NativeIntegration**: Open files and directories in system file manager.\n- **ListSites**: Get basic information about all the sites you host and download new sites.\n- **NewSite**: Create and download new sites.\n- **NoSandbox**: Open site outside wrapper.\n- **PermissionControl**: Add arbitrary permissions.\n- **ADMIN**: Access all sites, modify any settings, run any programs on the computer.\n- **ContentFilter**: Block users and sites.\n- **NewsfeedSubscribe**: Subscribe to notifications about site updates.\n- **NewsfeedRetrieve**: Read all your newsfeed.\n- **OwnershipControl**: Manage site private keys and ownership settings.\n- **ReceiveMessages**: Receive peer-to-peer messages over ZeroNet network.\n- **SendMessages**: Send peer-to-peer messages over ZeroNet network.\n\nI admit there're quite a lot of them. We could merge ReadSettings and SiteUpdate into ReadData, merge Stats, WrapperUI, SetStorageLimits, SiteDelete, IdentityControl and PermissionControl into a single SiteControl permission, allow NewSite, NewsfeedSubscribe, ReceiveMessages and SendMessages for all sites, merge ListSites, NativeIntegration, ContentFilter, NewsfeedRetrieve, OwnershipControl, ServerAdmin and NoSandbox into ADMIN, and we're left with just:\n\n- **ReadData**: Read site files and query site databases.\n- **WriteData**: Allow adding, deleting, editing and publishing data on your behalf.\n- **SiteControl**: Configurate ZeroNet and site settings, limits and permissions.\n- **ADMIN**: Access all sites, modify any settings, run any programs on the computer.\n\n...which looks okay for a few months, until we start adding features. For instance, you don't want to allow background scripts to publish updates, so you disallow WriteData, but sending messages via PeerMessage is not blocked so you're damned. Then someone decides to make an RSS-like newsfeed aggregator so they have to request the whole ADMIN permissions, which many users won't accept, and so on.\n\nThe thing is, most users and developers won't have to think about permissions, the main work is done under the hood. And when they *have* to run privileged commands, they don't have to swear their code does nothing malicious, but just request the minimum required permissions.",

He has a monopoly over ZeroHello which I believe to be the main issue -- people see ZeroTalk, people open ZeroTalk, people talk here. Cross-forum links are seldom posted here, and when they are, they're usually deep inside the comment tree. Users want a plug'n'play solution, they open ZeroTalk and start chatting, they don't spend enough time to find other sites (who remembers StreamZ here?)\n\nIt would be more fair to either add others' sites to ZeroHello or only leave ZeroSites there, but nofish is afraid both of losing the auditory and of sharing any privileges with others. I admit he has a good reason not to share it with me --I was angry and childish at that moment, and only my fear saved us from a cataclysm; I don't want to talk about that-- but I have no idea why he's against adding a link to, say, ZeroWiki.\n\nHow should an average find that site? It's not listed anywhere on ZeroTalk & ZeroMe. People are greeted with a large list of Chinese titles on ZeroSites and illegal content so I believe some of them are afraid of hosting ZeroSites at all; general-purpose sites are listed next to the ZeroLSTN feature request forum, old abandoned chats, ZeroNet documentation, etc., and awesome sites are buried deep down.\n\nThis is a monopoly, even if you say 'not working with nofish is the aim of the network, and we are developers, so let's, uh, do something'. This is the aim *we* are aware of, which might not be the same as nofish'es own view on the situation. You've said it yourself [here](/1F4WVHDpQYxuJL6xEY3EZTYkZds9TTjVHC/?Topic:1584434817_1GooUE19488nDwG3TdkM8seYAHct4gjkq4). I want to work with all of you, work on an alternative client, update ZeroTalk, make alternative ID providers, etc., but that's plain wrong without adopting official clients & services.\n\nYou say: write plugins instead of modifying core. Looks great, yeah, but that only works for non-essential stuff. One of the changes I wanted to propose was to isolate the plugins themselves from core; another one is to add some kind of backend support & change how permissions work, which has to interfere with how the core works. Should nofish make a change that breaks the plugins (this has already happened to PeerMessage and BackgroundProcessing), users will update ZeroNet and stop using the plugins -- bye privacy-essential plugins and so on.\n\nYou see, IPFS & Co don't suffer from this problem because there are no built-in official sites. I2P does not have many  built-in links too, and a good site catalogue is advised for the users. ZeroNet, on the other hand, helps people keep using Zero*-sites only. If nothing else, this is suspicious. Personally, I would find it way easier to proceed if nofish either agreed with me and shared the privileges with the active users, or told me I'm wrong, said that he isn't going to promote others' sites because of that and that reason and closed this discussion. In the first case, I'd finally make up a good roadmap, merge PRs, close the dangling issues, fix existing problems, add some kind of hub support to ZeroTalk, refactor shit, add multisig support, get things moving, and then hope others will catch up the idea -- all without waiting for year long responses from nofish saying 'this is against ZeroNet goal' or 'we already have XYZ', or not hearing back at all. In the second case, I'll have to shut up if he comes up with a good reason (read: not 'I don't like any of you'), or have an argument for stubborn developers like you (around 50% of the developer base, I think?) and advocate for forking, switching to the fork together and promoting the new version everywhere.",

If you had a large list of useful changes which were for some weird reason not being merged than sure. But i'd stay pretty far away from anyone who would post shit like this.\n\nSome of my PRs: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+author%3Aimachug\nSome of my issues: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Aimachug\n\nSome of my private messages to nofish to make him start fucking care about a little more than code:\n\n> ...\n>\n> Is there any better idea? I don't see one. You might find it, however. We could just ignore this incident: I reported the issue to you, in the first place, so I'm not going to sell this or something. Still, it makes sense to simulate what we would do if a vulnerability was used in the wild.\n>\n> The first thing you'd do is fix the vulnerability. Shouldn't be that difficult, just change the code. Don't forget to publish it to ZeroNet Py3 updater. Probably makes sense to backport the fix to py2, not sure about that though.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> That looks like everything we can do right now. However, we might be faced with other vulnerabilities in the future, and we have to prepare for those today.\n>\n> Force-updating security-related code makes sense. There should be a single kill switch, like what Debian/Ubuntu have with their security repository branches. For example, the Exim fiasco was fixed by issuing an update to security branch, and many servers got updated before their administrators noticed the problem. This should not be difficult to implement. The update could be ran on shutdown (that will be kind of a mess on proxies though, I have no idea how it should work there; that's something we should discuss later). Automatically updating code without user revision is kind of unsafe though; it probably makes sense to sign that code twice (yes, here we go again with multisign). You could either make the code signed by two of five (for example) people, or, at least, require two signatures from two of your devices to ensure we don't get screwed if one of the devices got hacked.\n>\n> It also makes sense to make vulnerability reporting easier. Using GitHub issues means it'll be public, which should be avoided. Using ZeroMail instead does sounds like a good idea, but ZeroMail doesn't support group topics (remember \"The Vacation\"? At least three people took part in the research), neither does it support attaching fixes and exploits (we could use GitHub/GitHub Gists/something, which is, again, not as simple as it should be). There should be a way to report vulnerabilities both inside ZeroNet and outside it.\n>\n> Next, publishing the post-mortem with the explanations, like I just did above, and an AMA thread will make people start looking into ZeroNet code, and show them it's not that difficult to add their feature, fix their bug, or find their vulnerability. Some vulnerabilities can also teach others a bit and make them carefully look through their old code; I probably wouldn't find a vulnerability in render() method if I didn't browse StackOverflow that day.\n>\n> ...\n> Cool. Some of my suggestions are, however, rely on a Gitlab bot. I've started implementing some of them two days ago, so you can check them here: https://gitlab.com/ZeroNet-alpha-management/ZeroNet/issues/1 . Something is not ready yet, but it should give you an idea of how it would work in real life.\n>\n> I've just talked to Krixano and I believe we've found a good enough fix for fake unattended security updates.\n>\n> In my previous letters, I said that \"once half of maintainers or a single owner approve the fix, the fix will be merged into ZeroNet automatically\". We can change this sentence to \"When at least one ZeroNet maintainer from at least half countries accept the fix, it will be merged into ZeroNet automatically\". So, it's not that several people have to sign an update; it's that several maintainers have to sign it. This means that all maintainers are equal now, would it be you, me or mkg20001.\n>\n> This will prevent government forcing you to fake a security update. Krixano also noticed that we should pick people from countries that are not allies --for example, a person from Russia and a person from the US-- because a country can tell it's allies to do something -- it's International Law. Neutral countries would be good too. Notably, that's probably the only case when countries being unfriendly is a feature.\n\nSome of my important requests: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroHello/pull/125\n\nSome of my ideas: http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1562000931_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di / http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1566397383_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di\n\nOthers' thoughts: http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HMLvnRWViMnuvZc5LK4Dm86sZNcSH1jdh/?Topic:1566424248_1D9oYXWZH2S55PeoCFDKTqq8roNXqZqP7n\n\nAnyway, you see the point... it has little to do with me developing features, it's about the infrastructure, it's about making the community voice affect the development.",

Two week long period of time when I can barely do anything except sleeping and studying almost seems natural this year. Literally everyone where I study has anxiety, not just students so everyone freaks out once in a while which results in enormous work for all of us. (Someone accidentally offended the lecturer? He'll delete the PDFs of the lectures and block access to our materials, and so on.) I've started ZeroNet half an hour ago and I'm now looking through all the comments and posts.

I wasn't sure about that first, but I became 100% positive when they invaded my job, programming, I still don't believe Torvalds has followed them. Since then SJW are enemies to me; but only then I started to analyze the reality. It's amazing how many people follow SJW without understanding a word they're saying. I don't understand a word too though; it's kinda fun, it's like a dog and a man barking at each other. SJW are just screaming senseless slogans that sound high-flown to the general public. They're widening their goals and theories without measure because that's how they got popular. They say they're protecting the minority, but at the moment their protectees list contains much more than 50% of the humanity. They're protecting almost everyone, and they're doing too much and too less at the same time -- they make an illusion of changing something while in fact they can only cry very loudly. So, who is more crazy: the easily controllable general public following a nonsensical movement, or a small fraction of people trying to retain their common sense?\n\n> conspiracy theorists that should be monitored\n\nYou know, I'm something of a conspiracy theorist myself, but I'm very careful to verify my facts and sources and not to jump to conclusions. ZeroNet is one of the only places online where people share ideas freely; some people here don't proofcheck what they say, but sometimes what they say is true, just too radical for the official media. Think of ZeroNet as an endless brainstorm and it'll stop looking crazy.\n\n> I'm also willing to be a number of you are pedos too.\n\nEvery decentralized network with freedom of speech and privacy is open to everyone, including terrorists, perophiles, etc. Nuff said.",

That is not how development works, and especially not how it works on ZeroNet. Wait a sec, apparently you did contact me, you sent me `how did you generate a zeronet site with custom start?(1NAMexxxxxx)` via ZeroMail a few hours after publishing this post. *Sure that works.*\n\nI know I haven't visited ZeroNet for a looong while, but that doesn't mean I completely forgot about it. I still want to return someday. And just because you think I left ZeroNet that doesn't mean you're free to copy whatever I made while I was active. Technically there's no license so you can't do that at all, but I'm not that pure-capitalist guy.\n\nThe real problem is that people have absolutely no reason to believe you won't infect their systems with trojans. Granted, I'm not very reliable either, but it says something that I didn't break ZeroNet the three-ish times I could do that (vulns & exploits, you know).\n\nTreat this comment as a cease-and-desist letter. Two options:\n\n- Either I integrate your BitMessage support to Name.YO, I add you to `AUTHORS` or whatever, you choose, and people use Name.YO service which a) still has that big list of old domains, b) is more trusted and is more safe, c) supports BitTorrent.\n- Or you don't make the site UI, this post, the naming and the plugin code looks the same as mine, and warn people that your plugin has not been verified for exploits and such by other developers, and installing it can (theoretically) harm users' computers, should a bug be found or you decide to take over ZeroNet.\n\n---\n\n*As a sidenote: I did not start ZeroNet for the first time in a while because of *this*, but it immediately caught my attention.

ZeroName plugin does not have such file, but (what a coincidence) it completely matches `UiRequestPlugin.py` from Name.YO code, except that 'nameyo' is replaced with 'trust' accordingly.

It all matters. Looking at how others implement plugins, name systems, what directory structures they use and so on is fine. That's how development works nowadays, the community thinks it's completely fine, and I think so too.\n\nCopying most of that without a second thought is a whole 'nother story. Here's what *I think* you did: you cloned Name.YO site, `sed s/Name.YO/Name.TRUST/g`, modified `plugins/NameTRUST/SiteManagerPlugin.py`, *hack* *hack* `mkdir bitmessgae_backend` [sic] *hack* *hack*.",

				"body": "I too had a similar idea about a year ago but I immediately dismissed it as 'won't work in practice'. Elaborating:\n\nOn most Clearnet domain registrars, the price of a domain decreases with its length. For example, fdsdsfdsbfsdkhfsdhjkfsdfsd.com costs much less than a.com. This makes a lot of sense: there are fewer shorter domains than longer domains, *ergo* if someone wants to buy a short domain, the odds that they are willing to buy a longer domain is lower.\n\nEconomics 101: The more people want to buy a particular item, the higher the price is. With vanity addresses it's the other way round: longer patterns cost more.\n\nI'm looking at my ZeroNet `data` directory right now and doing some statistics:\n\n- `1bible...`: 2 sites\n- `1blog...`: 6 sites\n- `1chess...`: 2 sites\n- `1code...`: 3 sites\n- `1docs...`: 3 sites\n- `1talk...`: 6 sites\n- `1tech...`: 2 sites\n- `1trump...`: 5 sites\n- `1zapps...`: 2 sites\n- `1zero...`: 10 sites\n- `1zgag...`: 2 sites\n- `1zgo...`: 2 sites\n- `1zhao...`: 2 sites\n- `1ztalk...`: 2 sites\n\nThere are probably more my eyes didn't catch. And that's *terrible*, because when I use Clearnet I can just type chess.com and it opens the site I expect, but when I use ZeroNet, type 1chess and wait for autocomplete, it gives me two addresses and I have to recall which is which.\n\nVanity addresses, in fact, make more sense when you treat them as tags instead. Tag 'blog', tag 'talk', *et cetera*. Maybe you could come up with a better use of vanity addresses with that idea in mind?",

			"body": "> Several people came to conclusion that I'm going to steal nofish'es rights. That's not what I meant, however, if that's how you all understand me, it might be my problem, not yours.\n>\n> We'll fight centralization another way then. We'll write our own ZeroNet implementation, for other platforms, in another language. Completely independent of what the current ZeroNet looks like. Continue something that mkg20001 started.\n>\n> Thank you all for a wonderful discussion.\n\n---\n\nAs you all know, @nofish is the author of ZeroNet. First of all, let me say that I appreciate his work and respect him.\n\nHowever, we have a problem -- @nofish is currently the only man who has access to:\n\n- ZeroTalk, ZeroMe, etc., other zites\n- ZeroHello\n- GitHub repository & ZeroUpdate\n\nThis leads to a couple of problems. Let's discuss them one by one:\n\n### Social platforms\n\nOn ZeroNet, any site that supports user content can't really live without any interaction from its owner. ZeroTalk depends on nofish to increase user data size limit. ZeroMe depends on nofish because of the hub list. Needless to say that if nofish leaves us, we would be stuck with the current sites with no further updates.\n\n### ZeroHello\n\nZeroNet homepage is the page that welcomes any user. However, it can do a little bit more than just welcome someone -- it's given so-called \"ADMIN\" rights. This means that, if nofish gets hacked (which wouldn't be a surprise to be honest), ZeroHello code can be changed to destroy the whole network. What's even more terrifying is that the changes would spread immediately over ZeroNet, destroying everything in a few minutes.\n\n### GitHub repository & ZeroUpdate\n\nThese two places are the places where ZeroNet hosts its source code, and that's what it uses for updating. We have two problems here at once:\n\n- Code poisoning. We've discussed it already, so I'll skip this part\n- Update stop. This might be even more dangerous in the long term\n\nZeroNet aims at decentralization. All its sites are decentralized, so there is no single point of failure inside the network. Inside the network. Inside. But there's still centralization outside ZeroNet. And it's nofish.\n\nIn case nofish gets into trouble, ZeroNet development will just stop. Most users get updates either from ZeroUpdate or GitHub. However, if the repositories stop being updated, there would be no way to synchronize the code among peers.\n\nYou might say: just fork the network! Create your own SuperNet! Yes. SuperNet. Not ZeroNet. Not everyone will switch to *my* fork. Or *your* fork. Or some other fork. ZeroNet will be split into small parts that can't even communicate to each other: some forks would become outdated, some would stop being supported. The awesome ZeroNet community would be destroyed. In a single second.\n\n---\n\nIs there any solution?\n\nOne possible way to fix this is to help nofish to work on the project. Having a single owner is bad. Having several owners is slightly better, but it's better than nothing.\n\n*The below is just one of the possible solutions. Several users have brought it down. Thus, it's only here for historical purposes. We're in progress of making a better solution, however, some parts might still be valid.*\n\nHere's what should be done to implement this *right now*:\n\n- (optionally) Create a GitHub organization -- this will help communicating about the project & working on plugins\n- Add other users as collaborators to the GitHub repository\n- Give private keys from ZeroHello, ZeroUpdate, ZeroMe, ZeroTalk and probably a few other sites to the most reliable users\n\nTogether, we can make a better solution by doing the following:\n\n- Setting up GitHub repository carefully:\n  - We could allow to merge pull requests if there are at least 3 of 5 acceptions (in case 4 people join, of course)\n  - Disallowing any changes to `py3` or `master` without pull requests -- this will be another security wall to prevent embedding malicious code\n  - A way to change member list if the network votes to change it\n    - This can be done by giving owner permissions to some of the trusted users\n- Improve multisign support\n  - If the members decide that something must be changed, and they reach consensus, the zites should be updated\n  - If the consensus is not reached, no changes should be made\n\n---\n\nFinally, we have to discuss what group of people should actually have the rights to rule the network. Here's the best solution I could find:\n\n1. nofish is included automatically\n2. You can vote for any user (including yourself) by posting a comment below. Please explain why you vote for someone (or why you promote yourself) so that we can be sure you aren't a bot, and that we understand whether the mentioned person is a core developer, whether they can develop plugins for ZeroNet, zites, or whether they're good in theory, or whether they can bring good ideas, etc.\n3. If you support someone, you can either post your own comment or just upvote someone else's (if person A promotes person B and you upvote that comment, that's a vote for B, not A)\n4. You can vote for several people\n5. After some period of time, a few users who have most upvotes will be chosen\n  - The period of time is to be discussed. I'm not sure what's the correct way to choose it, so please mention this in comments if you know what to choose\n  - The user count is to be discussed as well. I'd choose top 4 users, or if there are a few people who are voted for, only choose top 4 users among those who have more than 20% upvotes. This means that we'll most likely get 5 collaborators\n  - People who have no *good* comments (i.e.: only spam) on ZeroTalk before Jul 1, 2019 won't be counted. However, if they post a comment (with some explanation, of course) and not just upvote, they *will* be counted\n\n---\n\nFinally, this movement must be supported by @nofish in the first place to be brought into life. Looking forward to hear from you, @nofish.",

This point is subjective, but it's still a reason;\n- Unix-way permissions: `Nobody / Collaborator` means you are either a user or you can manage issues, pull requests, code, settings and what not;\n- Difficult or impossible to report vulnerabilities: there is no such thing as private issues, so we have to use either ZeroMail or @zeronet.io mail (which is troublesome if several people have found the vulnerability) or external services (which is definitely not ideal);\n- Centralized solution: if nofish stops working on ZeroNet, we have no way to change anything in ZeroNet core (sure, you can fork code, but, seriously, how many people will notice the fork?);\n- Travis CI is troublesome.\n\nQ2: Why GitLab\n\nGitLab supports a lot more features than GitHub, solving all the problems above:\n\n- GitLab can be self-hosted if we abandon gitlab.com;\n- `Nobody / Guest / Reporter / Maintainer / Owner` permissions;\n- Confidential issues are supported; using a bot makes reports even simplier;\n- Adding maintainers and enabling automatic merging solves nofish centralization;\n- GitLab CI/CD is free and more powerful.\n\nAdditional features that weren't described above:\n\n- Unlimited private repositories;\n- Groups / subgroups / etc. for free;\n- and more.\n\nAny suggestions?",

			"body": "I've recently argued with several people about decentralization, and finally I came to conclusion that we're talking about different things.\n\nThere are actually two types of decentralization:\n\n- The classic \"consensus\" approach. Several parties (e.g. users) come to a single conclusion about account balance, file content or whatever;\n- The \"fork\" approach. In this case, everyone makes a decision himself. For example, favorites-like domain management, blocklists and whitelists work this way.\n\nZeroNet mixes these two approaches: it uses \"consensus\" for file content, and \"fork\" for blocklists and sites/files you store.\n\nBut there's also such a thing as ZeroNet development. I can rename the approaches to explain the difference better:\n\n- \"consensus\" = many developers on a single repository;\n- \"fork\" = a few developers on many forks.\n\nWhen I told people about decentralizing ZeroNet development, they pointed me at the approach I now call \"fork\"; however, that's not the only decentralization type. In case of programs/applications/sites, the \"consensus\" approach works better:\n\n- In case of \"consensus\", if a few developers are compromised, it won't result in a failure;\n- In case of \"fork\", if a single developer is compromised, a few people will be in danger.\n\nTo me, it looks like the first approach works better here.

			"title": "Site classes proposal",
			"body": "The proposed idea is similar to merged sites but not quite. The major differences are:\n\n1. A site may have several classes, as opposed to a single `merged_type` field in content.json.\n2. 'Merged' site data is not automatically imported into database, and the 'merger' site does not immediately have full read-write access to site contents.\n3. Site class does not solely depend on site settings, but is almost always inherited from the site it was cloned from.\n4. Classified sites almost always contain code, not just data.\n\nAn example of a class and the reason for this proposal is ZeroTalk. There are many forums on ZeroNet, and most of them have a compatible data structure, for they all inherited it from the official ZeroTalk forum.\n\nThere are many usecases, e.g. a separate frontend for all ZeroTalks, selective archiving, cross-site threads, etc. Why can't we implement all of that now? Filtering all sites manually is cumbersome, filtering by site title & description filters out lots of sites, and comparing by database structure is even more inaccurate. Also, the site would have to have ADMIN permission to check all sites which is both slow and insecure.\n\nThat said, classification is possible to implement, but that requires applying modifications to the ZeroNet core. The basic ideas are:\n\n1. A site may specify its class(es) in content.json.\n2. If a site didn't specify a class, it's assumed to be the same as the class of the site it was cloned from. Luckily, ZeroNet stores that information in content.json.\n\nThe problem arises when the site is downloaded while its parent isn't. Note that this is only a problem for sites created *before* this proposal is implemented so it's okay to find a solution that works for commonly used sites, not all sites. My solution is to maintain a local database of classes, even for some sites that aren't downloaded, and populate it by downloading content.json's (and only them) for each parent site. AFAIK most sites have a short history of clones so this shouldn't be a problem. Manually classifying sites that don't have valid parents may be a good idea too, although I'm such pre-built database wouldn't get merged into the main tree.\n\nThoughts?",

			"title": "RFC: ZeroNet security system. Permissions & contexts",
			"body": "I was going to add backend to ZeroNet apps, but found out that ZeroNet permissions are not enough to implement everything I have in mind. Hence this request for comments. Please tell me what you think about this update.\n\n---\n\n# ZeroNet security system\n\n## Abstract\n\nZeroNet currently uses a permission-based security system which has great potential but lacks useful features at the moment. The proposed standard is a combination of ideas derived from Android permissions and Linux capabilities. The motive for a better permission system is that due to ZeroNet growth and plugin development sites actually become apps, and extending their possibilities is an important goal. Additionally, backend, background scripts, native code, etc., should they be added to ZeroNet, would need a different permission set, because what is allowed in browser might not be a good idea in background. For example, a user may want to forbid signing and publishing in background because they manually verify what is published, or gathering statistics all day long may be bad for privacy, etc.\n\n\n## Contexts\n\nIn this document, the word 'context' refers to the situation in which a particular command is called and the permission is utilized. There are currently three contexts:\n\n- `web`, which is used for site scripts using ZeroFrame API\n- `wrapper`, which is used by the wrapper code\n- `uiconfig`, which is used by /Config and other configuration pages\n\nMore contexts are to arise in the future, one example being backend code, should the support for it be added.\n\nThe current handling of the two contexts is to allow all calls for `wrapper` and to allow basic calls which leak little to no information about other sites and peer information for `web`. Support for cross-site communication is extremely limited: only read-write for merged sites and read-only for CORS sites, which is often not enough.\n\n\n## Basic permissions\n\nFor simplicity, we will limit the API list to the core without default plugins such as Cors and MergerSite. See the next chapter and Appendix A for the extended API.\n\nThe required permission is assigned to almost all commands, including the ones that are currently allowed without any requests. Hence each context has a set of *default permissions*, which allows simple and careful risk management. The recommended default permissions are described below, and should be changeable by users who want more privacy. Additionally, the default permissions depend on whether Multiuser plugin is enabled.\n\n\n### Available without any permissions\n\nSimple maintenance commands are allowed for all apps.\n\n- `response(result)`\n- `ping()`\n- `userGetSettings()`\n- `userSetSettings(settings)`\n- `as(address, cmd, params=[])`, permissions for which are handled separately\n\n\n### ReadSettings\n\n> **ReadSettings**: Retrieve site, ZeroNet node, user and tracker information.\n\nThis permission is enabled in `web`, `wrapper` and `uiconfig` by default.\n\n- `announcerInfo()`\n- `userGetGlobalSettings()`\n- `siteInfo(file_status=None)`\n- `serverInfo()`\n- `channelJoin(channels)`, where channel is one of \"siteChanged\", \"serverChanged\" and \"announcerChanged\"\n- `certSelect(accepted_domains=[], accept_any=False, accepted_pattern=None)` (only valid in `web` context)\n\n\n### ReadData\n\n> **ReadData**: Read site files and query site databases.\n\nThis permission is enabled in `web`, `wrapper` and `uiconfig` by default.\n\n- `siteListModifiedFiles(content_inner_path=\"content.json\")`\n- `siteBadFiles()`\n- `fileQuery(dir_inner_path, query=None)`\n- `fileList(inner_path)`\n- `dirList(inner_path, stats=False)`\n- `dbQuery(query, params=None, wait_for=None)`\n- `fileGet(inner_path, required=True, format=\"text\", timeout=300, priority=6)`\n- `fileNeed(inner_path, timeout=300, priority=6)`\n- `fileRules(inner_path, use_my_cert=False, content=None)`\n- `siteReload(inner_path)`\n\n\n### WriteData\n\n> **WriteData**: Allow adding, deleting, editing and publishing data on your behalf.\n\nThis permission is enabled in `web` and `wrapper` by default.\n\n- `siteSign(privatekey=None, inner_path=\"content.json\", remove_missing_optional=False, update_changed_files=False, response_ok=True)`\n- `sitePublish(privatekey=None, inner_path=\"content.json\", sign=True, remove_missing_optional=False, update_changed_files=False)`\n- `fileWrite(inner_path, content_base64, ignore_bad_files=False)`\n- `fileDelete(inner_path)`\n\n\n### SiteUpdate\n\n> **SiteUpdate**: Control site updates.\n\nThis permission is enabled in `web` and `wrapper` by default.\n\n- `siteUpdate(address, check_files=False, since=None, announce=False)` (only for the current site)\n- `sitePause(address)` (only for the current site)\n- `siteResume(address)` (only for the current site)\n\n\n### Stats\n\n> **Stats**: Get statistics about peers, trackers, site updates and file sharing.\n\nThis permission is enabled in `wrapper` by default.\n\n- `announcerStats()`\n\n\n### WrapperUI\n\n> **WrapperUI**: Change ZeroNet UI settings for this site.\n\nThis permission is enabled in `wrapper` by default.\n\n- `siteSetSettingsValue(key, value)` where `key` is \"modified_files_notification\"\n\n\n### SetStorageLimits\n\n> **SetStorageLimits**: Set arbitrary site size limits.\n\nThis permission is enabled in `wrapper` by default.\n\n- `siteSetLimit(size_limit)`\n\n\n### SiteDelete\n\n> **SiteDelete**: Delete this site.\n\nThis permission is enabled in `wrapper` by default.\n\n- `siteDelete(address)` (only for the current site)\n\n\n### IdentityControl\n\n> **IdentityControl**: List, add certificates, and use any ID certificate for signing data.\n\nThis permission is enabled in `wrapper` by default.\n\n- `certSet(domain)`\n- `certList()`\n- `certAdd(domain, auth_type, auth_user_name, cert)`\n\n\n### ServerAdmin\n\n> **ServerAdmin**: Restart, update and configure ZeroNet.\n\nThis permission is enabled in `wrapper` and `uiconfig` by default.\n\n- `serverUpdate()`\n- `serverShutdown(restart=False)`\n- `configSet(key, value)`, where `key` is any of: \"tor\", \"fileserver_port\", \"language\" (additional verification is performed to prevent LFI), \"tor_use_bridges\", \"trackers_proxy\", \"trackers\", \"trackers_file\" (LFI is prevented), \"log_level\", \"fileserver_ip_type\", \"ip_external\", \"offline\", \"threads_fs_read\", \"threads_fs_write\", \"threads_crypt\", \"threads_db\"\n- `serverErrors()`\n- `serverPortcheck()`\n\n\n### NativeIntegration\n\n> **NativeIntegration**: Open files and directories in system file manager.\n\nThis permission is enabled in `wrapper` by default.\n\n- `serverShowdirectory(directory=\"backup\", inner_path=\"\")`\n\n\n### ListSites\n\n> **ListSites**: Get basic information about all the sites you host and download new sites.\n\nThis permission is disabled by default in all contexts.\n\n- `siteList(connecting_sites=False)`\n- `channelJoinAllsite(channel)`\n\n\n### NewSite\n\n> **NewSite**: Create and download new sites.\n\nThis permission is disabled by default in all contexts.\n\n- `siteClone(address, root_inner_path=\"\", target_address=None, redirect=True)` where `address` refers to the current site\n- `siteAdd(address)`\n\n\n### NoSandbox\n\n> **NoSandbox**: Open site outside wrapper.\n\nThis permission is enabled in `wrapper` by default.

Additionally, the whitelisted commands are hardcoded, which has already caused problems when some of read-only commands could not be used. The proposed approach is to allow configuring arbitrary permissions for arbitrary site groups, which is a superset of the currently permitted permission sets.\n\nPermissions `<site_group>/<permission_name>` apply when a site from the said group is accessed via `cors-<site)address>/` or `merged-<merged_type>/<site_address>/` virtual directories or `as` command. The difference from the current implementation is that if a site has `Merger:A` permission and it can access another site via `merged-A/1Address/...`, it will also have write access to `cors-1Address/...`, although this is unlikely to cause problems.\n\nA site group is one of:\n\n- `<site_address>` which should be a valid address, for a single site.\n- `Merged:<name>`, which is for merged sites.\n- `Class:<name>`, which is for classified sites, a proposal for which was published [on ZeroTalk](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1603313852_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di/Site+classes+proposal).\n- `group1,group2,...` to specify one permission for several groups.\n\nFor instance, the old `Cors:1Address` permission is now an alias for `1Address/ReadData` (although a few more commands are allowed), and `Merger:<name>` permission is an alias for `Merged:<name>/ReadData,WriteData,SiteDelete,NewSite` (`,` separates permission names here).\n\nHence, no new permissions are needed for Cors and Merger plugins, and the few defined commands are added to the existing ones:\n\n- `mergerSiteAdd` goes to `Merger:<name>/NewSite`\n- `mergerSiteDelete` goes to `Merger:<name>/SiteDelete`\n- `mergerSiteList` goes to `Merger:<name>/ListSites`\n- `corsPermission` goes to `PermissionControl`\n\n\n## Implementation requirements\n\nThe required permission set can be specified via `flag.permission` decorator like this:\n\n```python\n@flag.permission(\"NewSite\")\ndef actionSiteClone(self, to, address, root_inner_path=\"\", target_address=None, redirect=True):\n    ...\n```\n\nShould several permissions be required, they can be comma-separated:\n\n```python\n@flag.permission(\"Perm1\", \"Perm2\")\ndef actionMyCommand(self, to):\n    ...\n```\n\nIf a command is enabled without any permissions, `None` must be passed. This is to prevent developers from accidentally allowing dangerous commands.\n\n```python\n@flag.permission(None)\ndef actionPing(self, to):\n    ...\n```\n\nThis rule does not apply to old plugins, e.g. PeerMessage, because of compatiblity issues.\n\nIf a plugin creates a new permission, e.g. SendMessage, it's properties are specified in plugin_info.json in `permissions` field:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"PeerMessage\",\n    \"description\": \"Peer-to-peer requests library\",\n    \"rev\": 7,\n    \"permissions\": {\n        \"SendMessage\": {\n            \"no_multiuser\": false,\n            \"default_enabled_contexts\": [\"web\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs a permission with the same name may be added by several plugins, a permission is allowed in a context if and only if it's allowed by all plugins. Same with `no_multiuser`: a command is allowed in Multiuser mode iff the flag is set to `false` by all plugins.\n\n\n## Requesting permissions\n\nThe old `wrapperPermissionAdd`/`permissionAdd` commands remain but start accepting new permissions and new syntax. The affected sites are specified as in the *Cross-site permissions* chapter. The affected contexts can be specified via `<context_name>#` prefix. For instance, all of the following are valid permissions to request:\n\n- `Cors:1Address` (legacy)\n- `1Address/ReadData,WriteData`\n- `web#1Address/ReadData`\n\nThe following are not valid for security reasons:\n\n- `wrapper#...`\n- `uiconfig#...`\n\nThe following may become valid in the future:\n\n- `backend#WriteData`\n\n\n# Appendix A: Permissions of plugin-defined commands\n\n## Bigfile\n\n- `bigFileUploadInit` is enabled by WriteData\n- `siteSetAutodownloadBigfileLimit` is enabled by SetStorageLimits\n\n\n## Chart\n\n- `chartDbQuery` and `chartGetPeerLocations` are enabled by Stats\n\n\n## ContentFilter\n\nA new permission is added, disabled in all contexts by default:\n\n> **ContentFilter**: Block users and sites.\n\n- `muteAdd`,`muteRemove`,`siteblockIgnoreAddSite`,`siteblockAdd`,`siteblockRemove`,`siteblockList`,`siteblockGet`,`filterIncludeAdd`,`filterIncludeRemove` and`filterIncludeList` are enabled by ContentFilter\n\n\n## CryptMessage\n\n- `userPublickey` is enabled by ReadSettings\n- `eciesEncrypt`, `eciesDecrypt`, `ecdsaSign` and `ecdsaVerify` are enabled without any permissions, but ReadSettings is needed if the key is specifed by index, not value\n- `aesEncrypt`, `aesDecrypt`,`eccPrivToPub` and `eccPubToAddr` are enabled without any permissions\n\n\n## Newsfeed\n\nA new permission is added, enabled in `web` by default:\n\n> **NewsfeedSubscribe**: Subscribe to notifications about site updates.\n\nAnd another one, disabled by default:\n\n> **NewsfeedRetrieve**: Read all your newsfeed.\n\n- `feedFollow` and `feedListFollow` are enabled by NewsfeedSubscribe\n- `feedQuery` and `feedSearch` are enabled by NewsfeedRetrieve\n\n\n## OptionalManager\n\n- `optionalFileList`, `optionalFileInfo`, `optionalHelp`, `optionalHelpRemove`, `optionalHelpAll` and `optionalHelpList` are enabled by ReadData\n- `optionalFilePin`, `optionalFileUnpin` and `optionalFileDelete` are enabled by WriteData\n- `optionalLimitSet` is enabled by SetStorageLimits\n- `optionalLimitStats` is enabled by Stats\n\n\n## Sidebar\n\nA new permission is added, enabled in `wrapper` by default:\n\n> **OwnershipControl**: Manage site private keys and ownership settings.\n\n- `sidebarGetHtmlTag` and `sidebarGetPeers` are enabled by Stats\n- `sidebarSetOwned`, `siteRecoverPrivatekey` and `userSetSitePrivatekey` are enabled by OwnershipControl\n- `siteSetAutodownloadoptional` is enabled by SetStorageLimits\n- `dbReload` and `dbRebuild` are enabled by ReadData\n\n\n## UiConfig\n\n- `configList` is enabled by ServerAdmin\n\n\n## UiPluginManager\n\n- `pluginList` and `pluginConfigSet` are enabled by ServerAdmin\n- `pluginAddRequest` is always enabled and is only valid in `web` context\n- `pluginRemove` and `pluginUpdate` are disabled in all contexts\n\n\n## PeerMessage\n\nTwo permissions are added, enabled in `web` by default:\n\n> **ReceiveMessages**: Receive peer-to-peer messages over ZeroNet network.\n\n> **SendMessages**: Send peer-to-peer messages over ZeroNet network.\n\n- `channelJoin(channels)`, where channel is one of \"peerReceive\" and \"peerSend\", is enabled by ReceiveMessages\n- `peerInvalid` and `peerValid` are enabled by ReceiveMessages\n- `peerBroadcast` and `peerSend` are enabled by SendMessages",

However, all of that, plus built-in deduplication enabled for all existing sites, can be implemented by separating data from file paths. That is, all the data is stored by hash, and the site files are only links to that data. This proposal describes how and where the blocks are stored and how the filepath-hash relationship is saved.\n\n\n# Storage medium\n\nThere are two (obvious) alternatives:\n\n1. We could use an SQLite database and a table with `path`, `hash` columns, or\n2. We could trick the filesystem into doing calculations for us.\n\nThe pros of the first alternative are:\n\n- We're not limited by the filesystem format, so in theory we can arrange data more efficiently,\n- Accidentally damaging a single database file is more difficult that modifying a file for an average user.\n\nThe pros of the second alternative are:\n\n- Everything is handled by the kernel which is slightly more efficient than walking the tree manually and much faster than Python + SQLite,\n- Filesystem is more resistant to corruption than a database,\n- It is more obvious that a directory should not be deleted (unlike content.db which may be easily rebuilt),\n- It's natural to arrange files for maximal efficiency like one would do on a regular filesystem, so chances are a filesystem would handle sites better,\n- Simple operations like copying or moving a file need a single syscall but require several queries if a database is used instead,\n- It might be possible to arrange the filesystem in such a way that one can browse the tree without any plugins or drivers.\n\nThis proposal describes the second alternative.\n\n\n# File tree structure\n\nThe following diagram demonstrates how a single file is stored.\n\n```\n└── data\n    ├── __blockstore__\n    │   └── rYFJHZWETYESHOPMBDEIZODEP43UFPVW7LXESE26YUFQGCTAM3FRQ\n    └── __ns__\n        └── sites\n            └── 1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D\n                └── test.txt -> blk:rYFJHZWETYESHOPMBDEIZODEP43UFPVW7LXESE26YUFQGCTAM3FRQ\n```\n\n`__blockstore__` directory stores the content of all files (actually most of them; see below), while `__ns__` (which stands for 'namespace') only contains links to the file content.\n\n`rYFJHZWETYESHOPMBDEIZODEP43UFPVW7LXESE26YUFQGCTAM3FRQ` is the full-qualified hash of the file contents. The first character describes the file and hash type, `r` stands for 'regular'. The characters after it are the first 32 bytes of the SHA-512 hash of the file contents, base32-encoded without padding.\n\n```shell\n$ xxd data/__blockstore__/rYFJHZWETYESHOPMBDEIZODEP43UFPVW7LXESE26YUFQGCTAM3FRQ \n00000000: 4865 6c6c 6f2c 2077 6f72 6c64 21         Hello, world!\n\n$ sha512sum data/__blockstore__/rYFJHZWETYESHOPMBDEIZODEP43UFPVW7LXESE26YUFQGCTAM3FRQ | head -c 64 | xxd -r -p | base32 | head -c -5\nYFJHZWETYESHOPMBDEIZODEP43UFPVW7LXESE26YUFQGCTAM3FRQ\n```\n\n\n# (Ab)using filesystem details for maximal efficiency\n\nIt is most easy to explain the details on Linux filesystems, such as ext, so I will start with those and then show how the same applies to NTFS & Co.\n\n\n## Linux filesystems\n\nThe file inside `__ns__` is actually a symbolic link with `blk:<hash>` as the destination. Notice that it is technically a relative path, although it does not point to any existing file. This is ensured by adding `:` which is an invalid filename character on Windows and is hence forbidden on ZeroNet; although nothing bad is expected to happen, should the destination exist on the filesystem. `blk` is for curious users who find strange links among their files and decide to delete them because of their unobvious purpose.\n\nThe hash length is arranged in such a way that the resulting destination takes at most 60 bytes, which is the maximum size of [fast symlinks](https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout#Symbolic_Links) for ext filesystems. `blk:X` takes 5 bytes, so 55 bytes are left for the base32 string (35 bytes decoded). This means that the hash is stored right in the inode entry, and the overhead of using a blockstore is only 160 bytes, not 4256 bytes (on an average disk).\n\nThe reason why symlinks are used instead of regular files is that although small regular files can also be stored in the inode itself, this feature, which is called [inline data](https://lwn.net/Articles/468678/), is only available since Ext4, Linux 3.8 and has to be enabled manually, while fast symlinks have been around since Ext2 (I've traced that back to 2000).\n\nNotice that symlinks work on all *nix filesystems (e.g. APFS), not just ext, it is just that it's more efficient on this particular filesystem.\n\n\n## ntfs-3g\n\nCompatiblity is an important concern, it must to be possible to start ZeroNet on Linux + ext, copy files to an NTFS drive, boot Windows and continue work there, then boot back to Linux and get the updated data without any corruption.\n\nntfs-3g, which is the most popular NTFS driver for Linux, converts symlinks into [Interix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interix) links which are regular files with 'system' attribute set and `IntxLNK<0x01><destination in UTF-16LE>` content. It is easy to generate such files, and they also take no additional space on disk because its contents are stored as a [resident attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/askcore/the-four-stages-of-ntfs-file-growth) (at least, as of Windows 10).\n\n\n## Filesystems and drivers without symlink support\n\nFilesystems that don't support symlinks (e.g. FAT) or drivers that don't support symlinks (e.g. the default MacOS NTFS driver) are going to use Interix links as well.\n\n\n## Motivation for using symlinks\n\nThere are other alternatives, e.g. native NTFS symlinks, NTFS reparse points and hardlinks. The cons of using them are:\n\n- NTFS symlinks cannot be created without admin rights on Windows (by default),\n- NTFS reparse points (aka junctions) cannot point to files, cannot use a relative path instead of an absolute one (which means they may break if ZeroNet data directory is moved or copied) and cannot be easily created on *nix,\n- Hard links are very easily forgotten because there is little difference on how the files appear on the application side, so copying ZeroNet data directory on many systems will effectively double the space used (or even more), because hard links are not retained but the whole content is copied.\n\n\n## How fast does it break?\n\nFrankly speaking, the worst problem lies between chair and keyboard, for they may accidentally delete some important files. The idea itself is very simple: you use symlinks if you're on POSIX and the FS supports symlinks, and you use Internix links if you're on NT or the filesystem lacks symbolic link support. All the optimizing magic happens under the hood.\n\n\n# Deduplication\n\nAs many files can refer to the same block, it is important not to delete a still in-use block accidentally. The classic way is to use hard links, but we have already settled on manual link handling. Thus, we have to save refcounts manually. There are three ways:\n\n- We can store the refcount and other metadata at the beginning of each block file, or\n- We can store the refcount right in the inode, or\n- We can store the refcounts separately in a single database file.\n\nIn the first case, the metadata size has to match the filesystem cluster size (usually 4096 bytes) which is too big compared to the refcount integer size. In the second case, we'd have to find a cross-platform and cross-filesystem way to save information in the inode; the only metadata that is always available is timestamps, but they may easily be overwritten accidentally. Finally, a separate database (Berkeley DB) is perhaps the safest way.\n\nAll in all, we use a database to store metadata, filesystem to store block contents and symlinks to link files to blocks.\n\n\n# Compressed content\n\nSome blocks may be stored in non-raw format, e.g. gzip-compressed data. This format is preferred when the file can be stored more efficiently, and such files are usually not read and written in 4kb blocks, so we can sacrifice a few bytes (say, 16?) at the beginning for metadata -- after all, gzip has its own header too. Whether a file is raw or not is also stored in the database. In case the database is malformed, it can be rebuilt by checking what the checksum in the filename matches: the raw content itself or the decoded content (if it can be decoded).\n\nExample:\n\n```\n00000000: 677a 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  gz..............\n00000010: 1f8b 0800 0000 0000 0003 f348 cdc9 c9d7  ...........H....\n00000020: 5128 cf2f ca49 5104 00e6 c6e6 eb0d 0000  Q(./.IQ.........\n00000030: 00                                       .\n```\n\n\n# Appendix: file/hash type\n\n- `r<hash>`. Stands for 'regular'. The characters after `r` are the first 32 bytes of the SHA-512 hash of the file contents, base32-encoded without padding.\n- `i<content>`. Stands for 'inline'. The characters are `i` are base32-encoded (without padding) bytes of the file content. This should only be used for files of at most 32 bytes. This is an optimization.\n\n\n# Following up: big files\n\nIn a nutshell: a big file is stored on disk as a meta-block which refers to other blocks which contain real content; that's similar to merkle trees but with only one level. *The piece size is not constant* because [content-defined chunking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_hash#Content-based_slicing_using_a_rolling_hash) is in use, so a B tree of indexes+hashes is stored, not a linear array of hashes.",
