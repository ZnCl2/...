			"title": "Cloning Millchan to make it \"legal\" and transforming it in a file hosting zite",
			"body": "In my opinion Millchan is one of the best zites on zeronet because some reasons:\n\n- actively developed\n- good graphical interface\n- the ability to auto-seed/block specific chans or users (this should increase the number of complete seeds and is also very useful managing a seedbox)\n\nbut have also some very important defects:\n\n- it creats spoiler thumbnails of all content of the zite (also illegal files) this don't allow to create legal seedboxes easily (this option can be disabled, but to do this you should first download the zite...)\n- it cant host some very common file types like .iso and .rar\n- max file size is too low\n\n...but the strong points are a big advantage when this zite is compared to IFS, zeroup or kopikate:\n\n- IFS is very buggy, not developed and don't have an option to auto-seed content or block specific users. Also vids and audio files must be completely streamed to gain a seed (because of this most big files go dead share).\n\n- all Kopikates can host only videos and have auto-thumbnails\n\n- Zeroup have a small size limit and cannot stream audio and video files. Zeroup unlimited is similar (with a small increase of maxsize)\n\nI decided to make a clone of Millchan removing the automatic spoiler thumbnails and correcting the points described above, creating \"Galactichan\" (A new improved version of the Intergalactic File Server).\n\nYou can view this zite following this link:\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/19HKdTAeBh5nRiKn791czY7TwRB1QNrf1Q/\n\ncould you help me testing the zite?",

There seem to be a certain percentage of the population which, for whatever reason and regardless of vaccine status, have an acute reaction to an infectious agent.  While there are risk groups which have been identified, the research has yet to isolate specific causal indicators as far as I am aware.The real moral challenge is how to handle the initial stages of a pandemic where immunity is expected to be low and hospitalizations at their highest.  To which, my response is that the greatest common factor among recovery indicators is baseline nutrition/health, the presence of family for care, and access/training in first/aid and basic healthcare techniques.  In the same way that I was taught how to triage and to treat wounds in the military, it should be part of common civic education to teach elementary care.  I had a friend with a festering puncture wound on her stomach who could not afford to go to the doctor - and I found out it had been that way for potentially months without healing.  Did she really need a doctor?  Perhaps for stitches to prevent scarring - but the real issue was the infection.  Peroxide wash/flush once a day and cover with sterile bandage.  Healed up in a week.  Take the bedding out and set it in the sun for several hours if you can't wash it - let the UV kill a bunch of the nasties on it.  Try to get out and take a walk or just sit in the sun for a total of around half an hour a day - help recycle the cholesterol back to vitamin D.Having family around to help when someone is sick and can't easily take care of their own needs helps a lot.  Having community action plans for how to handle health emergencies (or emergencies in general) should be part of the plan/strategy.  For example, in a mass casualty situation, the galley/mess hall (eating facility) becomes a defacto hospital for overflow.  To transfer this to the civilian world - does the local government have parks to host tents and supplies to prop them up - what about public sports arenas and stadiums?  Soccer fields could quickly be made to support helicopters.  These are the reasons we are supposed to have government.  Not to try and set up lockdowns and restrictions on our activity - but to give us focused plans of action to work through issues and crisis. [...]\n\nYou can critic the efficacy of covid vaccines due to short follow up but not the vaccine at all! Vaccines are the best wespons we have against infections diseases and they can eradicate some lethal ones Like tetanus snallpox or poliomelitis without inducing patogen resistence!
