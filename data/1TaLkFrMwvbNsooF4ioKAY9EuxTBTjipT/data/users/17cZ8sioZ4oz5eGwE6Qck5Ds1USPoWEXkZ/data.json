I doubt though that The Washington Post is doing this in good faith but doing this because they do not like ZeroNet in of itself. In my experience, these politicians and publications want control of these places and will use any excuse to do it. If it was not ZeroNet, they would of used something else though. This is with any illegal or harmful organization. You seen this with Silk Road or illegal movies with torrenting. The number one priority to fight radicalization will always be information and helping people. People that tend to be more radicalized are more likely to have troubles in their lives. 2nd way is to not accept people from those highly dangerous countries. [...]\n\ni think, that article is bullshit. There are no islamists, but this network can not be controlled.",

For example he brings his zeronet HDD to the outside world and syncs with other peers outside of Russia, then brings it back to any of the intranets in Russia and syncs with the peers in the intranet.
