Most of the content I find there is 20+ years old\n\nfms (Freenet Messaging System), is by far the best darknet discussion forum platform. Plus freenet has better security. The biggest downside of freenet is that it takes more computer resources to run, and ZeronNet has the advantage of being faster. Also freenet only works well on linux, in my opinion.
