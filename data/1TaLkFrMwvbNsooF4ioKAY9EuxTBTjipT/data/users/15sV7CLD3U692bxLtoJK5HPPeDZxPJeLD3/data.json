			"body": "Recommended lockdown videos: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mK93gHFWXs\n\"The first documentary film to investigate the actual mechanisms by which mobile phone technology can cause cancer. Resonance takes a deeper look at how humanity is reacting to the most profound environmental change the planet has ever seen. Two billion years ago life first appeared on earth, a planet bathed in a natural electromagnetic frequency. As life slowly evolved from simple to complex organisms, it did so surrounded by this frequency, forming a harmonic relationship with it, a relationship that science is just beginning to comprehend. New research is showing that exposure to this frequency is vital to human beings. It controls our mental and physical health, it synchronizes our circadian rhythms, it aids our immune system, and it improves our overall sense of well-being. Not only are we surrounded by natural frequencies, our bodies are suffused with them. Our cells communicate using electromagnetic frequencies. Our brain emits a constant stream of frequencies and our DNA delivers instructions using frequency waves. Without them, we could not exist.\"",

Seriously.\n\nOne of the good things about reddit is that you can see peoples posting history, at least 3 times I've become angry about some post someone did, I then put him/he in a box, thinking the person must be this type, but then it turns out that we have a lot of things in common, and we are not really a box, but more like intersecting mesh, with snap to grid enabled.

Highly recommended. Did 30 km on the e-scooter in nice weather in Copenhagen's green path's yesterday.\n\nDo you know what a fake artificial feeling feels like vs a original natural one ?",

A very quick and not insightful suggestion is ZeroMe and 8chan for images but their format might still not be exactly your thing. Unlimit talk is zerotalk almost completely except it allows graphics in posts. Everyone of them might not meet some of your key criteria. All the best!\n\nFound 8chan.
