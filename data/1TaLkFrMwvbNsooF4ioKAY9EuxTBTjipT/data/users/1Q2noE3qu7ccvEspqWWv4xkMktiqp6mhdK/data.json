				"body": "It would be nice if there were a modular framework or platform that functioned in a similar way to Joomla which less skilled website owners and creators can use easily. Content is key to wider adoption and people wont create content if it's too difficult and for the most part the best content creators aren't the most skilled developers and vis versa.\n\nI have been watching Znet for the past year or so because I have a need to move a community off the clear net. There are several barriers one basic core functionality is lacking for someone of my skill level, and two ease of use for users/community members who have very little technical skills and are reluctant to radical change.\n\nDocumentation is a bit lacking for new site owners coming from a traditional hosting environment and lamp/wamp stack, who have limited coding and system level administration skills imho. Some of the documentation seems to assume a certain level of understanding, which we don't all have especially anyone coming from a Win environment.\n\nPersonally I'm kind of stuck at the moment trying to get my ZeroFish Docker installation functioning fully on a Synology nas. I haven't had time to reach out for help yet, so I cant complain, because I'm sure the community here will point me in the right direction when asked. Having said that I should really be able to figure it out using documentation or user guides on my own.\n\nOnce I manage to do that I will face the problem of developing a site that functions like a traditional forum and CMS, that allows easy content creation, admin and user management. It will also need to be simple for community members to interact on the forum, search and user content and thread management being quite important. A private messaging system would also be useful imho, although ZeroMail could fill that gap initially.\n\nIs it possible to run an instance of ZeroMail as a private community service rather than relying on the global Zmail service?\n\nIt would be nice if there was a standard global text editor like tinymce or something to help users create content with basic html, css and formatting etc.\n\nI haven't attempted clone and develop a site yet, one because I need to get my installation functional, and two I haven't really come across an easy guide to follow that explains some of the quirks and pitfalls to avoid for an idiot like me.\n\nAnother issue is what do we do with all the years of content we all ready have out there on the clear net? Obviously we can continue to maintain the existing site in the short term, but ideally that content would be brought over to preserve historical information and research etc. Is it going to be possible to export and migrate sql data tables from say a forum to a Znet site?\n\nFor example would it be possible to build static/archive type framework that has all the basic required fields to support something like a phpBB forum or Wordpress, Drupal or Joomla site, with migration tools?\n\nI'm not a developer and I'm not particularly smart, but I am and have been very aware of the dangers we face with respect to the future of free speech, privacy, security and governmental/corporate control, and I want to find a viable solution. So far Zeronet seems like the best solution on many levels, although scaleability is a concern.\n\nWould it be possible to establish a dedicated core dev team that could build a standardised generic platform, with modular aspects like skinning, admin panel, site level user management etc. similar to Joomla and it's user created extensions for example? Maybe with features and goals/milestones which users can vote for and then fund the development of? Or is that wishful thinking on my part?\n\nSorry for the long and rambling post which is probably a bit disjointed. Hopefully I managed to make a useful and valid point here and there?\n\nMy big concern is the fact that time to make a transition is running out fast, especially in Europe! We need to be encouraging large numbers of users over from the clear net asap imho. To do that we need nicely presented and easy to access content, that's accessible securely across a range of devices.",

Who holds the power to determine the definition and enforcement? What is the ultimate deterrent/solution if these naughty people continue to express their views?\n\nCould you please ask whoever is in charge of the definitions and enforcement to add people who do not use language properly please? Maybe hacking off both their thumbs would be a reasonable punishment for persistent/repeat offenders? Perverting and trashing our language/s and words that have clearly established and well defined meanings is a far worse crime, than spouting an unpopular opinion imho! Why do you think the vermin and parasitic classes keep changing meanings of words? Could it be because there is power in controlling and defining language?\n\nWe now have Western Governments adhering to a 'International Rules Based System' wtf? What's wrong with the 'International Law'? In thirty years most people wont even remember the term International Law exists, in one hundred years it will have been virtually removed from human consciousness.\n\nIn the early 1900's gay meant that something was pleasant and enjoyable, by the turn of the century that meaning was entirely lost. As a consequence of social engineering...the hijacking of that word has helped pave the way to a situation where there are upwards of 40 pronouns to identify three possible natural states male, female and androgyny. Laughably this has actually become a matter of serious debate! That's just one example of the power and science of social engineering at work, in conjunction with the abuse of language. \n\nThere are many more examples where language has been perverted, and where words and terms have been weaponised for use on the battle ground of social engineering, politics and within the legal system etc. \n\nIt's also ironic that your opening post is apparently anti hate, and yet you hate people with different views so much that you propose a method of controlling them and their opinions. lmfao  Lets hope that you always manage to hold the same views that are deemed acceptable by your masters, setting those undefined catch all terms, such as 'hate groups/speech' etc. \n\nGood luck with that mate (M8) and be careful what you wish for!",

				"body": "Maybe it's because people are exploring the technology and simply move on after a time?\n\nThe key is to attract content creators and currently Znet is too challenging for your average creator types. The exception would be those using the system out of necessity, due to censorship and awareness of the impending clamp down which is ramping up, especially in Europe.\n\nSome comprehensive user guides on Ytube might help teach people enough to give them confidence to give Znet a go? Most of what's on Ytube is old and doesn't really go into the nitty gritty of actually using Znet in real world use cases. Many Znet videos on Ytube don't even have dialogue which makes it difficult to follow.\n\nEducation is vital imho because people need to know how to do basics, like backing up their configs and general management. There needs to be walk throughs that go through the cloning process, simple site edits and other routine tasks.\n\nYtube may not be the best choice either Dtube and bitchute might have an audience more likely to investigate Znet more seriously?\n\nThe other problem is attracting an audience over to Znet to consume content. Mobile phone usage is probably an issue as managing a Znet installation isn't practical on a phone. More proxys would probably help overcome that to an extent. \n\nI don't think there is a simple answer beyond the rate of adoption and natural wastage. Znet still seems rather experimental and has a number of quirks, which probably leads to a low rate of long term adopters.",

It's a bit of a chicken 'n egg deal because they create content for an audience, so we also need to raise awareness among content consumers. Before any of that can happen we need developers to deliver the tools to make life easy for us none developer types. Maybe what we need is some way of encouraging devs to build the tools people need first. Not being a developer I can't say what insensitive is required? Especially on this type of platform because there's a major morality/principle component with respect to freedoms etc. This type of platform is something the world needs in the face of overreaching government controls and censorship. That's a big incentive in itself for many I'm sure.\n\nI also don't know how organised the development process is? Defined road maps with clear goals and completion dates would be useful, especially if non tech types can have some input as to what they feel are priorities for usability etc. via polls and maybe even some form of donations system for completed goals?\n\nI don't know the answers but hopefully together we can make it happen.",

Effectively it could be used as a free mirror and backup site. It should be an easy sell based on those incentives imho.\n\nSomething like that may short circuit the content creation process, because it's not an all out adoption from the get go, and hopefully over time creators would migrate over as Znet establishes a stronger presence.\n\nJust a thought.\n\nI think it would also be good to maintain a presence on the clear net because that's where the potential audience resides right now. I have actively looked for Znet content on the web and it's scant and mostly a year or so old. How about an active Ytube Znet channel with regular updates on development, tips and trick, new site promotions etc. some kind of news channel or something? We need to create a buzz to stimulate interest.",

Kind of puzzling to think that they are using the platform to exercise their free speech, while attempting to control others ability to speak freely. Some people simply cant grasp the fundamental principles of free speech, and how it either applies to all or it applies to none. If you censor one persons opinions based on certain parameters of acceptability, then who is to say that those parameters  wont be extended at a future date, to encompass the views of the previous censor. This is exactly what we are seeing play out on the clearnet right now, as they attempt to limit free speech to a level where it is virtually eliminated, unless your views fit the current agenda. An agenda that may change rendering your previous views beyond the bounds of the present implementation of censorship rules.\n\nThey have worked their way through all the low hanging fruit, and now their attention is turning to any Joe that comments beyond what they consider acceptable.\n\nCareful what you wish for!\n\nAs for the comment in the title of your post there doesn't seem to be any substance offered by you to substantiate your proposition!?

(formerly gnostic media) they say there are maps showing the empires extent but i havnt seen them as i dont watch the video feed. they linked it to a re-writing of history in which the dark ages are a fiction dropped into the history books, perhaps with the intention of hiding the tartars. not sure i believe that myself as where i live there are a LOT of churches and castles built in the dark ages with historical records carved into the stone of these buildings. i would be more impressed if i could see and read and touch tartar structures the way i can with stuff from the dark ages.\n\nHere's just one of many maps available https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6405/137106206.7d/0_89bd7_6083ac87_orig.jpg\n\nJan Irvin (Gnostic Media) referenced Fomenko several times about 12 to 18 months ago. Fomenko has authored a large number of books which layout his ideas of a New Chronology. Part of his theory is that the Greek and Egyptian history we are given is incorrect, and he asserts that both existed at the same point on the time-line. Iirc he says something along the lines of the so called dark ages being a hodgepodge of tales and lore etc. used in an attempt to fill in blanks to help create the current official western historical narrative. Basically the various periods have been juggled about to establish our so called ancient historical chronology. Fomenko has a background in mathematics and he used maths to try and validate and establish historical claims based on events such as eclipses etc.  He cross referenced historical records from different periods and cultures while looking for various data points which could be used to substantiate or discredit through identifying contradictions and or parallels the official records. I believe he has quite a substantial team of academics and scholars as part of his team who collate and process the data, in order to build a time-line based on natural events and cross referenced historical records in order to create the New Chronology.\n\nI haven't personally spent much time reading Fomenko's work beyond gaining a basic understanding. But from researching other historical material it wouldn't surprise me if some of his claims and theories have some substance to them. The history that is presented with respect to Prydain/Albion (Great Britain) and the supposed Roman conquest seems questionable, along with Persian history and their iterations with Romans and the Greeks et al. Then there's the migration of the Tribes and Blood lines, Babylon, Sumerians and Atlantis etc. which raises the question about the rise and fall of past civilizations.\n\nHere is a video which covers an alternative view of British history https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBLTkT5GQkA \n\nOne thing is for sure what he think we know about our history is highly questionable. Just looking at the way relatively modern history has been corrupted and manufactured gives good reason for us to question the ancient  history given to us in the mainstream history books and education. It would be foolish to think that older history is accurate, especially when the written records back then were limited to nobility and the church/priest classes, who kept information under tight controlled, and used it to serve their own ends. What does the Vatican have stashed away in their hidden archives? Sure to be some interesting stuff in the bowls of the Vatican volts after centuries of looting and plundering. \n\nNapoleon didn't spend years in Egypt mapping and documenting everything they could find for no good reason. The Egyptologists soon followed in his wake most of whom were aristocratic Europeans or academics with wealthy patrons. Is it wise to accept their interpretations and claims? The Pyramids are still a mystery along with other amazing architectural wonders dotted around the middle east, Baalbek for example.\n\nAnd then there is stuff like the Chieftains Museum, also known as the Major Ridge Home, is a two-story white frame house built around a log house of 1792 in Cherokee country (today it is within present-day Rome, Georgia). It was the home of the Cherokee leader Major Ridge...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chieftains_Museum_(Major_Ridge_Home) .\n\nYou would have to be crazy not to think there is something seriously amiss with the historical narratives we have been given imho. I'm not defending or discounting anything Fomenko claims because it's all open to further iquiary as far as I'm concerned. I don't accept/trust anything from mainstream sources anymore, because they have a very poor record of delivering honest accounts of current events, let alone ancient history!",

Especially those countries close to where the proof/evidence should be readily available. You can't prove a negative so you have to ban all discussion of it, and bombard the public consciousness with BS through education and the media.\n\nName one other historical event that is treated in the same way? Which other event has had more films and TV shows mention it either directly or indirect. How many museums have been built in countries with zero connection to an event in order to establish a historical narrative?

Besides, there are even more modern horrific things taking place in Syria that are very similar to the holocaust. Here's an example: [...]\n\nThat comment might have some merit if we actually had access to the real history to learn from. You can learn nothing from false recounts of history. This is relatively recent history that has been bastardised, imagine how fake phony and false the so called ancient history we are given must be.\n\nIf AH and by extension the Germans were the bad guys and they lost how is it that the same shit carried on after the end of WWII?

				"body": "You seem to be ignoring the fact that Germany had colonial interests, and they also committed atrocities if we can believe all we are told, or perhaps you're not aware of Shark Island for instance?  Britain and France aren't the only guilty parties with respect to colonialism and the associated atrocities and abuses of foreign populations in their own lands. The British and the French gain more attention because they were among the more dominant participants, along with the Spanish and the Ottomans, at least with respect to the past few centuries. The British and French attempted to present themselves in a good light through the falsification of history. The Spanish and the British were among the first to establish concentration camps, yet the history books would have us believe it was the concept of AH. The Boars would probably have something to say about that particular narrative. Having said that Shark Island creates a different perspective to throw into the mix.\n\nThe primary beneficiaries behind colonialism were the corporations, such as the British East India Company and the Dutch equivalent et al. Not the general population of each individual nation (at least not directly). The royals, nobility and political classes were the major shareholders in those corporations. And they also controlled the domestic economies, media and education systems of the day. Nothing much has changed except maybe the overt power of monarchs.\n\nCan you provide irrefutable evidence that AH ordered anything akin to a 'final solution' (TM) because afaik no such documentation has been presented to date. Yet we are told the Germans documented everything, they were ultra efficient the way they administered every part of every process. So where are the countless documents referring to the 'final solution' (TM)?\n\nBritain or should I say certain members of the British establishment instigated WWII by doing deals with the Polish government. WWI was instigated by the British establishment in league with the the French using Belgium as a catalyst. The British people never wanted to enter a war with the German people. The British government propagandised the British public with false claims in order to demonise the Kaiser and the German people. In just the same way as they use the media to create false narratives to this day.\n\nThe point here is that it's not the people who are to blame, it's a tiny minority of individuals in positions of power that engineer events in order to achieve their own objectives, at the expense of the people. They control and create the historical narrative in order to disguise what really transpired. We can't learn from history if the historical record is a fictitious lie! It really doesn't matter what country did what, to who, for whatever reason if the data used to establish the case is fabricated nonsense. \n\nIf the Germans were the bad guys and they lost WWII why have atrocities continued to occur? If the good guys won surely the world would have been at peace following the victory of WWII. The Palestinians wouldn't be subjected to a process of genocide, at the hand of those claiming to have been victims of such treatment themselves. That right there should be a big red fucking flag! \n\nThe Holocaust (TM) isn't a trick it's a fabrication and a perfect example of how the media and education is used to create a false narrative. It serves as a demonstration of the corruption that exists in academia, politics and the legal system etc. All of which filters through to mass media and the school system which is used to indoctrinate whole generations into believing nothing but lies.\n\nThere are also other lesser know aspect to the general scope of international politics, which revolve around secret agreements between states, and the processes of international bankruptcy etc.  There is also the possibility that ancient treaties/agremments are still in place, and carry significant weight in the global power structure. Agreements between the Vatican/Rome and the British royals/the Crown (which are not one in the same) for example. There is also good evidence that there are secret societies who's powers transcend religious, political and geographic boundaries. The Masons, Jesuits and Knights of Malta et al are active organisations deeply entwined with the process of government and corporations.\n\nAnd lets not forget that AH rubbed shoulders with many world leaders, the Pope and cardinals, royalty and corporate leaders spring to mind.  He was presented as man of the year in Time Magazine, and George W Bush's grandfather was found guilty of trading with the enemy as a result of his support of AH and his government. IBM were trading with AH's Germany, and Standard Oil were supplying fuel additives which the Luftwaffe required to keep airborne.  \n\nSo it would appear to be far more complex than you are suggesting. By the way I agree with you're stance with respect to the atrocities which are occurring at present. I just don't agree entirely with your rationalisation of events and the cause behind them. A lie and or falsification is quite simple a distortion of the truth, and as such we cant use false history as a guide to learn from. Maybe you can explain the value of adopting a lie as the foundation of truth and progress, assuming you (the party presenting the lie) are not a beneficiary of the results of the founding lie? Of course we could be arguing cross purposes, if that's the case I apologies for elevating this mole hill to the status of a mountain.   \n\nAs for modern day atrocities they aren't being ignored because of the Holocaust (TM) being a trick and a distraction per se...the same media media and governmental powers intentionally use any event to divert attention away from the real stories behind current events, or they fabricate and sensationalise events in order to ferment and or escalate situations for their own advantage. False claims of gas attacks and fabricated new stories from NGO's such as the White Helmets are used to create propaganda, and false historical records for our consumption, and the consumption of future generations. It's up to us to prevent these false narratives from gaining traction and becoming established facts, when they are clearly fake and false accounts of real and/or staged events. We (common people) have become increasingly successful at exposing the lies through independent reporters, genuine first hand accounts captured on camera, and shared awareness on social media and internet services as a whole. That's why we are currently witnessing a massive escalation in the levels of censorship unfolding globally. This isn't about individual countries it's about absolute control of all countries. \n\nThere has been a massive shift in human consciousness in the past decade and especially in the last three years or so, across borders, cultures and ideological boundaries. The old systems of control are less effective than they were, and less people are open to the deceptions presented to them. It's just a matter of time before the peoples of the world reach a tipping point and cause an unstoppable shift away from the old systems of control.\n\nWe are is a race to reach that tipping point, before the old guard can put the breaks on it. Which they are trying very hard to do right now without great success, which means they will get much more dirty and aggressive in their methods of control. That's when levels of injustice and atrocities will increase in frequency all over the world. In the past the uprisings have been relatively localised (manageable), but for the first time in history people on every continent are rising in unison. That's going to be extremely hard to police and control, without something major occurring to prevent it from gaining momentum organically. It's at times such as these that wars are instigated, in order to create an environment to increase control domestically and abroad. It's easy for them to commit atrocities under those conditions to remove dissenters, and implement new frameworks of control on the remaining population/s. The first sign will be probably be in the form of increasing requirements/demands for identification to access services and for travel etc. I wouldn't be surprised if there will be a requirement for unique identification in order to access the internet before too long. I would also not be surprised if the UK and France are among the first countries to try and impose such draconian measures.  All for the sake of the children of course. ;) \n\nWe need to start pointing fingers at the real cause of all these events. A government doesn't represent the sum of the people or a nation. The traitors and criminals in positions of power need to be held to account for the crimes they commit in our name. We are all accountable for our own actions no matter what our position is with in a society. Unfortunately our judicial processes have been broken, and those in power think they can act with impunity with out fear of being held accountable. Fixing that aspect of the system would put us on the right track towards a solution imho.",

The system is broken and for the most part due to social engineering projects, which were imposed upon every generation. The only difference is the lies changed while the agenda of control carried forward as intended. We are approaching the end game which is why western society is totally dysfunctional, with generations incapable of defending themselves.\n\nUntil people can determine fact from fiction and know their own mind we're screwed. People also need to grow the fuck up and accept personal responsibility for their own actions. The problem is social engineering has caused successive generations to enter an ever increasing states of adolescence.  \n\nThe only reason people are broke is because the wealth of nations have been stolen!\n\nMy point is that this is not an intergenerational issue (which is a divide and rule tactic), it's a matter of mass populations falling prey to a system of control that is becoming less and less dependent on large populations.\n\nSocial media has made it far easier to steer large groups of people into different beliefs, that appear to be organic on the surface,  when in reality they are highly engineered in order to achieve changes in society. The problem is people don't know how to think, so they fail to understand that they have been manipulated into behaving in a certain way. And that all starts as soon as you enter the STATE education systems. A sound education with a solid understanding of logic and reason is the last thing those institutions will provide.\n\nPeople who poses the power of free thought are the greatest danger to a system that relies on the ignorance and compliance of the masses.\n\nThe likes and followers bs is effectively a drug just as rewards etc. in games are a drug. Each event causes an endorphin hit which rewards and there by reinforces certain states of behavior. Not unlike Pavlov's dogs or Huxley's soma. People are playing in a massive interactive social game and they don't even understand that that's what they are engaging in.\n\nThe answer is to stop fucking playing, accept responsibility for your own shit and take back control. Instead of disassociating yourself from other people based on bs like generation gaps, wealth, social class and nationality etc. join them, and put the skill sets each generation poses to good use, in order to create the future that will benefit us all. If we don't stand up for each other then we will all fall together regardless of what generation you think you belong to.\n\nIt's a fucking set-up and it's so fucking obvious it's not true. Yet people continue to blindly walk into this shit ffs!",

It is required. [...]\n\nIt's hardly a conspiracy theory, a simple study of education, news, music, movies and TV programming makes it quite clear how it is done. Tavistock is absolutely for real...at one time they managed to include me in their mailing list for about a year. Pretty much everything they sent through about their courses was about social control - mostly geared to wards children and the family in 2009 or thereabout. There is plenty of other evidence which exposes numerous other groups and organisations.\n\nI think that you're mistaken with respect to the way people and societies behave when left unfettered. On the contrary when they aren't pushed towards a process of self destruction they cooperate and interact for the benefit of their family and by extension their local communities. We have obviously been successful at developing socially or we wouldn't be here today. It also wouldn't take such an effort to disrupt our natural social development if we were the lowly creatures you seem to be suggesting. \n\nSocial engineering is not necessary unless you wish to have control over the actions of others for some reason? We have been brainwashed into believing that humans are dysfunctional by nature, when in realty the disruptive behavior has been artificially created by groups who wish to hold dominion over their fellow man. Organic social development is an entirely different situation which would have very different results imho.\n\nPavlov proved that given the right stimulus natural behavior could be altered for ever especially in early development. \"Give me a child until he is 7 and I will show you the man.\" ― Aristotle didn't pull that notion out of his arse. Teach children that there are no defined sexes and some with weak minds will become transgender candidates. The vast majority of children do not grasp the concept of the sexes until they reach puberty or therabouts, when left to their own devices. So called educators fucking with their heads from a primary school age is absolutely proof of social engineering.    \n\nWherever you go in the world the vast majority of people want the same basic things from life such as peace and security in life and property, access to food and water, and a successful future for their children. \n\nChildren do not discriminate by nature, they learn that behavior. Children have an inherent understanding of right and wrong until they are corrupted by external influences, or at the point that they discover the justice system is corrupt. Peer pressure is a corner stone of a functional social groups in human societies no matter what size of group. That natural system of control has been systematically undermined through social engineering. First through the implementation of  political correctness, then through to the current state of so called hate speech laws, the forced wholesale acceptance of the LGBTP agenda and current economic migration laws etc. None of those conditions would exist without governments and NGO's et al forming policies and implementing legislation.  Broadcast media sets the stage by normalising the situations first by including camp characters into shows, followed by full on gay couples etc. While at the same time heterosexual relationships have increasingly been portrayed as dysfunctional. Virtually every movie in the past fifteen years has had the hero character replaced by a heroin that has magical powers beyond any realistic expectations. This is intended to devalue the male role while delude women into the belief that they can perform the traditional roles of men. The reality is they can't as they are nether mentally or physically equipped to do so, with the exception of an outlier here and there. Even then butch women can't physically perform the roles a male can perform, having said that there are plenty of males who struggle to compete at even an average level of physical performance when up against other men. But even those under performers will out perform 98 percent of all women in physical tests. \n\nIn addition to that movies are used to create emotional responses, through visual stimulation and music that is carefully orchestrated to induce specific moods and feelings, which would be far less likely to occur in the absence of the musical accompaniment. Disney is a gateway into this level of emotional control aimed at catching the minds of children at an early age, and forming emotional responses through anthropomorphic depiction of animals and inanimate objects (a mind fuck). Not only does this distort the natural development of normal human emotions,  it also damages their perception of reality. By fucking design! That has an extremely detrimental impact upon society as a whole, while appearing as innocent entertainment on the surface. It is anything but an innocent by product, it's a highly orchestrated means of social control. We are paying the price for allowing the likes of Disney to dominate children's media. It should be pretty obvious how the likes of Disney are manipulating society by observing the changes they have implemented in franchises like Star Wars for example (it doesn't get much more obvious than that).\n\nThen you have movies like Alita Battle Angel where social engineers are normalising human and android emotive and sexual interactions. This is just one movie in a long list that have progressively sort to bring about the general acceptance of ai/robotic interactions. It's also intended to predicatively program  people into accepting the merger of man and machine. All of the above is exactly the message presented in Alita Battle Angle. There are entire generations who have been subjected to that message. Those same generations have been brought up in front of a screen of one sort or another. They are also dependent on technology to such an extent that the merger is almost complete, with the mobile phone virtually being an appendage for many already. It's their personal identification number that tracks their every move, while monitoring their social activities, moods, thoughts and responses. The current technology is already refined enough to predicted their behavior with a relatively high degree of certainty on an individual and group level. Crowd dynamics and herd mentality have been extremely well studied and well understood for the past fifty years at least. Real time metadata analysis has simply taken things to a whole new level (ripe for exploitation).\n\nHumans are like virtually every other life form on earth they always gravitate towards the path of least resistance for the most part. The relentless quest for convenience is paving the way for our own demise. The easier they can make things the faster we devolve. So in some respects you may have a point, but only when people are kept in a mindless state, where they are unable to understand their own potential. And while all the time there are groups who wish to control them retaining the power to manipulate them. Escape seems relatively futile, but not impossible.\n\n@re4tsf9e You do relies that an appeal to authority is a logical fallacy? You also relise that the majority of living things are comprised of 75 percent water and the remainder is made up of common naturally occurring elements? In reality that doesn't leave much scope for vast differences in generic composition among living things. Add to that every atom that ever existed since the point of creation is still present within our atmosphere. All those atoms are just part of a long process of repeated cycles of regeneration from one form to another. Everything is connected, it's simply unavoidable!\n\nWhat makes you think we don't live forever? \n\nAs a species we think we understand things, when in reality we assume to know too much, as we simply don't know what we don't know.",

If you're doing all the work and he earns 10x more than you you can do the same job for 8x less and still earn more. Of course you could be greedy and keep the cost at the same rate. But that would make you no better than the guy you're moaning about, while making you far less competitive. You could employ someone else and cut your workload and if you paid your employee the same as you you would still come in cheaper than the guy you're working for, assuming you avoid the temptation to capitalise on your employee. Under a capitalist system you have choices and the hourly rate can be adjusted to suite market demand etc.\n\nOf course you could go for a socialist/communist model where you earn the same as everyone else and any profit/efficiency gains you make can go towards paying other peoples UBI (people you don't even know).  You wont have the option to adjust your rates, so anyone else in your market will be offering exactly the same value as you, unless you work harder for the same money. \n\nI didn't say Capitalism is the best by the way! I said it seems to be the fairest and most sustainable model, especially if it's conducted in a truly free and open system. Capitalism has already out performed Communism under the corrupted and manipulated system we have been operating in so far. Imagine how much better it would be if the markets were actually free and open, and without monopolies and mega corporations. \n\nThere is another factor which runs parallel to the market, and that's Banking based on fiat money and fractional reserve practices. That screws the entire system from the get go through artificial inflation/devaluation among other things.\n\nSome form of Cooperative system based on a Capitalist market could be a pretty sound alternative to an all out Capitalist v Communist/Socialist system. Coops already exist with in our current Capitalist system and they seem to work. Employees holding shares in the business they work for seems to have some built in advantages for all concerned imho.\n\nGreed and laziness will be present in any economic system. A Capitalist Cooperative system would probably help make the distribution of wealth fairer, and lazy employees would suffer from pressure from their peers. Corruption will be present in every system to a greater or lesser extent. A fair and just legal system could help combat corruption if the corrupt are held fully accountable for their crimes, unlike in our present legal systems. \n\nIf there is a better system then feel free to explain your preferred approach to the problem?",

Yet another student from Trump University\n\nIf you were a student of anything you would realise that Co2 is a fundamental building block/element of life. You might even understand that the percentage of Co2 in the upper atmosphere attributed to human activity is 0.04%. You would also understand that 0.04% is an insignificant portion of the sum. A rational mind would ponder that and wonder why anthropogenic global warming is even a thing? Given the global political strategy on the issue of 'man made global warming' it should be obvious that Co2 is being used to introduce a global TAX on human life, while also preventing the masses from living in relative comfort. It should also tell you that there is something seriously wrong in education, academia, scientific research and the media.\n\nThe oceans, volcanic activity and many other naturally occurring activities are the major drivers of Co2. Without Co2 there would be no life period. Why aren't scientists and the media discussing the current solar minimum? Why isn't the education system discussing the solar minimum, along with its cycles and effects throughout history?\n\nAnyone who believes anthropogenic Co2 production has any significant global impact while ignoring the influence of the sun has far greater problems to worry about than global warming. Regaining control of your own mind might be a good start, and getting free of the blame and guilt culture would be another step in the right direction.\n\nIf you're so knowledgeable on the subject maybe you could provide the top ten counter arguments against the theory of so called man made climate change/global warming? Hell lets make it real easy provide sources to the top five arguments opposing the official climate change position. I presume you can do that without having to do some research?\n\nPlease explain why the climate change debate only has one side presented in media and education etc? Why did the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia falsify data to support/create their bogus reports? False information that the IPCC relied on to manufacture their reports I might add! Try researching Climate Gate 1 and Climate Gate 2...the data dumps are still available on the web. If the data is valid why would anyone need to falsify it or cherry pick the data?\n\nDespite the ever increasing levels of censorship the information is still available to those willing to research and understand what's really going on!",

While I like the idea of cryptocurrency and it's separation from governments, it's just to abstract...too far removed from the physical world of value. [...]\n\nIt doesn't get much more abstract than the current banking system. Most people are already happy accepting zeros and ones in the digital realm as a cash replacement. Most people have no real concept of what Money is or how it's created etc. To add to the problem there are now two generations of people who have had virtually no experience of dealing with real tangible cash fiat or otherwise. They have been trained to deal with electronic payments, vouchers and tokens of one sort or another. Their concept of ownership has also been distorted...Steam for example removes the ownership of real tangible goods in the form of a boxed game that you can sell and loan etc. like you would a physical book.\n\nThe biggest problem with metals such as gold and silver is market manipulation. The gold and silver markets prices are completely controlled and probably always have been. The Hunt brothers attempt to gain control of the silver markets is just one example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXpNfNAyo9M . JP Morgan employees are currently under investigation for price fixing silver https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSkTJvZIJmA .\n\nThe problem is lack of education, people don't seem to understand the dangers of a cashless society, and the level of control over their lives it gives to governments, banks and corporations. Every digital transaction leaks meta data about every aspect of your life. They know where you got the money, they know when and where you spent your money and they know what you spend your money on. If they consider you unworthy they have the means to prevent you from accessing your money at the click of a button. They also have the means to remove money directly from your account for the payment of fines and taxes etc.\n\nToo many people have been suckered into the trap and it's going to be difficult to reverse the situation especially with younger generations.\n\nWe are already too reliant on digital payment processes and close to the point where we are tied into a full on social credit style system similar to that in China. The current credit score system in the West is not far short of a social credit system already, and it won't take much to implement a switch over to fully controlled societies throughout the western world.",

The BIT used the ridiculous predictions presented by Niel Ferguson and his team of so called experts at Imperial Collage as part of their data used to advise the UK government. The BBC (government propaganda wing) pushes out agendas established by the BIT. https://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk/about-us/\n\nThe behavioral scientists/psychologists et al within BIT are the ones who create terms such as social distancing, and drive AstroTurf moments and  concepts like Save the NHS and clap along's at 8pm Thursdays for example. The BBC and corrupt media en mass pick up those terms and concepts and proceed to force them onto the public repeatedly 24/7 until they establish them as the new normal or accepted norms. Major corporations and NGO's et al also pick up the phrases, concepts and redefined words and introduce them into their corporate jargon, documentation and policies further ingraining them in order to establish social changes.\n\nIt's not exactly difficult to see and understand how the system and process works, nor is it difficult to identify those involved as they work in closely linked networks where the same actors are linked and appear consistently.    \n\nThe UK government established the 77th Brigade formerly known as the ‘Security Assistance Group’ they are a military unit tasked with managing the digital domain including social media etc. The tag line on their website is 'Influence and Outreach'. https://www.army.mod.uk/who-we-are/formations-divisions-brigades/6th-united-kingdom-division/77-brigade/   \n\nCommon Purpose (CP) is another aspect of the applied psychology system present in the UK (they also have a global presence). The purpose of which is to establish networks or key personnel within the public and private sectors, including local and national government and the police. Once they have embedded themselves within the organizations they set about destroying them from within. One of the mantras of CP is to lead beyond authority, and their training program is based on the use of NLP in order to re frame the views and opinions of CP graduates. CP employ Marxist style ideologies such as those discussed by Saul Alinsky author of the book Rules for Radicals, and the basis of Hillary Clinton's senior thesis.

Unless you are a celebrity or on an FBI watchlist. Or just really unlucky. At the end of the day.. your data is just a grain of sand in a vast desert of irrelevant noise. So cheer up.\n\nThat's not quite how it works is it?\n\nYour grains of sand are being stored in a desert but those grains or yours are unique to you and can be sifted out and isolated. The issue is if and when you become a person of interest all that data can and will be used against you.\n\nYour data is used commercially to extract wealth from you in some form or to steer and manage your life in some way. Later it will be used to control your life entirely along with everyone else's.\n\nImagine you need health care and the insurance company or health provider checks your data. Every Friday you buy a pizza, six pack of beer and a tub of ice cream. You only exercise on a Sunday morning when you carry your rubbish out to the curb. The rest of the time you sit at a computer reading and playing games and maybe working now and then. The insurer or healthcare provide decide to decline services to you and flag you on the system so no one will treat you.\n\nGiving away any data in the digital domain will have long term consequences. And that data combined can and will have consequences for all of us whether we provided/leaked data or not.\n\nGiving your data away is like shitting in a public swimming pool - eventually it effects everyone else!\n\nAs for your Youtube comment...it maybe be hard to get views on a channel, but it's real easy for Youtube to police, censor, shadowban and monitor all that content including the interaction in the comments. They have AI that traps copyright audio and video, they have AI that converts speech to text for the CC system and obviously a text file to sniff through. They have AI that traps key words on black lists, and if appropriate bans the video or appends an info panel instructing the user to use their mandated source of truth. ",

[...]\n\nAs I understand it Patrick tried to get whistle blower protection, but as a private contractor he didn't qualify for protection. He has tried to get himself called to give testimony at one of the congressional hearings, but no one has called him in (wonder why?). He has more information but he cant make that public unless he is called in to give testimony. The ShadowGate Doco only contains information that's available in the public domain, which keeps him legal, while trying to gain exposure of the information he has to a wider audience. I would also expect him to have a dead mans switch, and given his level of access I'm sure he has plenty of meaty bones to throw out there. Bumping him off may not be the best option for the vermin that may wish him harm.\n\nTore is in much the same position although she didn't go for whistle blower protection afaik. She has also offered to give testimony and hasn't been called. Hardly surprising as those hearings are nothing more than dog and pony shows for the masses. Tore claims to have lots of dirt on some major players and no doubt she has a dead mans switch in place also.  \n\nMillie subcontracts to InfoWars/Alex Jones (who is a shill without question imho). Millie doesn't seem to have figured that AJ is a snake yet for some reason? Plenty of other independent contributors to IW/AJ sussed out that he was a snake and severed connections with him. ShadowGate is an independent production not an InfoWars project.\n\nGiven that the information presented in ShadowGate is verifiable it seems a bit retarded to see people calling them out based on the documentary. It's even more retarded to read comments and opinions from people who haven't even watched it, based on their own prejudices and bias.\n\nThe ShadowGate documentary presents the information in a clear and concise manor, for the general public to consume and understand. It shouldn't be hard for anyone of average intelligence to understand the implications of having private corporations operating at this level of integration, within Government, Security and Media.\n\nNone of the individuals involved in the project hide their support for Trump. This isn't a Trump issue this effects Democrats, Republicans and every American citizen who votes or runs up against the corrupt system. In fact the implications of this reach way beyond America, and into every country, whether that country has a direct US, UK/Commonwealth or Israeli presence or not!\n\nThis is the shit that is eating away at the core of our governments, and it's the mechanism used to manage, insight and maintain conflicts throughout any sovereign nation they target, including domestically in the case of the US and UK et al.\n\nIf people cant grasp the seriousness of the information presented to them then they deserve everything this nefarious system throws at them.\n\nSmell the fucking coffee folks, this shit is for real, and the fuckers running that shit are playing for keeps!\n\nFor the record I'm not an American, 'n obviously never voted for Trump or anyone else for that matter.

That pushed the release date in to August. \n\nOn August the 14th the documentary had finally been rendered and was ready for release. Millie's husband had seeded the file and Tore was downloading it during the time the police arrived on scene at Millie's house.\n\nThe Indictment: https://www.scribd.com/document/472730527/Millie-Weaver-Indictment\nArrest Footage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjfVrZsLEk\n\nFrom the footage of the arrest Millie posted it's clear that the attending officer was there for one individual afaik Millie's husband. Next thing the officer is calling for more cars to arrest Millie and her brother. The officer has no documentation and informs Millie that she would get the documentation at the jail. Effectively she was arrested without charge (unlawful/abduction). That was an unlawful arrest as the officer never stated what the crime was.\n\nLater charges of burglary etc. were made against all three victims of this unlawful arrest. The processing systems suffered some sort of outage, during their processing. Magically the burglary charges morphed into a robbery charges, along with other drummed up offenses. Remember the alleged victim has dropped all claims, so there is no victim ipso facto no crime!\n\nOf course it was just a coincidence that just happened to occur right at the time the video was finally ready for release - nothing to see here.\n\nThe attending officer didn't seem in the least bit prepared to conduct a lawful arrest, which isn't the slightest bit suspicious and downright unprofessional - move along now folks.\n\nFor anyone capable of rational thought it shouldn't be too challenging understanding what was taking place and why.\n\nHave any of the distractiors and detractors actually managed to disprove any of the claims in the ShadowGate Doco, or are they having to rely on ad hominem attacks, and character assassinations?\n\nBonus supplementary video that supports ShadowGate - 'The Tyranny of Technocracy\" https://www.bitchute.com/video/qBH3PKNkuiPr/",

For example if the object of a forum is to encourage quality debate there needs to be a method to remove irrelevant nonsense which is intended to damage the discussion.\n\nIf someone wants to create a moderated forum that should be their choice. If individuals wish to participate in a moderated forum that should be their choice. Provided the terms are defined so that all parties understand the conditions there shouldn't be an issue. If the moderator does a poor job of moderating in a manner that the participants do not agree with they are free to leave and create their own forum.\n\nWhy should some one create a forum and build it up if any arsehole can pop in and uncontrollably shit post all over the place driving out genuine participants?\n\nHow do you propose to deal with Pr0n and CP spammers et al if you have no means of moderating the content?\n\nAs the OP states moderation are user controlled options which makes the application far more usable to everyone. The creator has the choice of moderating or not that's freedom. Only offering a non-moderated forum really isn't offering the same level of freedom.\n\nIf ZN is going to have any chance of a successful future there needs to be applications that regular folks are happy to use in the way they see fit. I have been watching ZN development since late 2015 iirc because there are communities on the clearnet which need to move to a safe environment for free speech. I can't try to encourage them over here because they can't safely manage their existing communities.\n\nIdeally they need to manage who becomes a forum member, and have the ability to moderate content as they are used to on their existing platforms.\n\nZN still isn't ready for prime time due to a number of issues which may or may not get resolved from my perspective. I'm not a developer so my opinion from a technical/coding perspective isn't really worth diddly squat. \n\nWe are running out of time for many of those types of communities if they don't have a viable solution to move to soon then they could simply be knocked off the clearnet one by one. Many governments are busy creating legislation to clamp down heavily on free speech platforms.\n\nI don't have anything against unmoderated forums, and I stand for free speech, but I also understand that there are times when some degree of moderation maybe desirable.",

They are free to expose and call out the moderator of the other forum without any fear of moderation/censorship. \n\nThe reality is that you will never create strong healthy forum communities without moderation. Human nature is what it is and there is no escaping that. Not only that there will be others trying to game the system with all kinds of bots and shit. \n\nI haven't been able to treat ZN as a viable solution primarily because it doesn't provide the options people on the clear net expect. They want the option to manage their user base and moderate content. They also need good documentation to help get them started. Most forum owners aren't developers or tech savvy come to that, they just want tools that allow them to manage their communities. The same goes for content creators and bloggers.\n\nThe progress of ZN development has been slow and relatively stagnant with the exception of a few projects. The adoption and retention rates are virtually nonexistent. People on the clearnet are screaming out for a reliable free speech platform now more than ever. \n\nHell, ZN had an ideal opportunity to gain some traction when the chans were taken down, but that opportunity sailed on by, because ZN in its current state isn't ready to rumble.

I'm not a developer so I can't comment with respect to technicalities and performance. I understand the concept of what you are suggesting, and your reasoning. It's not me who has to put the effort in to coding though. It's also a matter of timing as there may not be much time left - certain sites really need to find a fall back position now. I have been looking for a solution for the past five years or so without success. From my research ZN seemed to have the most potential. Unfortunately it just hasn't progressed very far from a real world users perspective. I'm not trying to dis the developers as I know there are devs putting in the work. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any coherent and coordinated plan. It would be nice to see one application fleshed out and functional enough to encourage and retain creators and users alike.\n\nDiscussing censorship and moderation is pretty academic if there is no content or user base to even care.  \n\nWe are in a precarious position politically on a world wide scale.\n\nI don't think there is much more I can add that will be of any value to the conversation without repeating myself.",

[...]\n\nIt's not quite as easy as that imho. I agree that content is king, but ZN isn't ready for prime time for a number of reasons. To encourage content creators there needs to be applications that are functional and easy to use ZeroTalk++ looks like it could be headed in the right direction. Next there needs to be some good quality documentation for noobs, which give detailed instructions on how to use ZN, which should also include explanations about how and why to use hubs etc. Security should be covered as part of the into. A guide to using markdown and media management etc. needs to explained with examples which are easy to follow for folk who are used point and click wysiwyg editors.\n\nThere also needs to be a more formal project management with defined goals. Ideally developers would work together on specific milestones in order to get important features ready for prime time. ZN needs a clearnet presence such as an active developers blog and YT or other mainstream video channel. That would hopefully encourage new developers to contribute and attract the attention of creators and users alike.\n\nThere isn't much current ZN content on the clearnet and most of what is out there is out of date, superficial with very little in the way of detailed guides. We need video guides that give in-depth details on installation, security, interface features, site cloning, file structure and management, backups for site data and user data, site development, guides for the popular/core ZN sites like ZeroTalk/ZT++. We also need some solid working examples which we as a community actively contribute to and promote.\n\nIf ZN is going to make progress and attract devs, creators and users we need a more professional approach.\n\nKey developers need to create an outline of where we are at and where we are headed. We need to know what the situation is with nofish with respect to future development.\n\nMaybe we need the Dev guys to take a fresh look at the whole project to determine whether ZN in its current form is workable in the long term? Lessons have been learned and there maybe better ways to achieve things using different coding approaches and concepts which would bring improvements? I'm not a coder so I have no idea what is and isn't possible nor where the pitfalls lie.\n\nWe also need a formal means for interaction between users and developers. We need to identify exactly what users want and need and priorities those aspects.\n\nSorry for the jumbled collection of thoughts.

				"body": "@krombopulusmike \n\nNo, I said that 'moderation of a forum is NOT censorship of the platform'. I.e. the host of the forum has a choice as to what is relevant on that forum. If a member of that forum feels they were censored they have the ability to create their own forum on the same platform, in order to freely express their opinion, and expose the other forum. The host of the original forum doesn't have the ability to censor the aggrieved party on the forum they create to expose them.\n\nA forum is the equivalent to an individuals home and the platform is the public square. Preventing free speech in the public square would equate to censorship, because it restricts individuals from presenting their views freely to a broad audience (the public). A forum is an area open to individuals who choose to participate in a discussion within a group that has boundaries, established to maintain civilised relevant discourse.\n\nImho, it's not my responsibility to decide what others should think whether they are weak minded or intellectual giants. It's up to me to present my opinions supported by evidence and reason in a way that may help others understand my views, so that they may use that information to form their own opinion on the matter.\n\nModeration is about keeping the conversation relevant, on topic and within the bounds of civil debate.\n\nCensorship is about the removal of content which maybe be deemed objectionable based on political, ethical, moral and military grounds etc.\n\nBoth maybe open to abuse. The issue here is context with respect to censorship in its extreme, in order to eliminate opinions and ideas. Moderation on the Zeronet platform is limited to the owner of the site/forum and not the entire platform. A moderator can't censor others using the platform, there is a distinct difference, which you and other seem to fail to grasp!\n\nHere's a very simple example of the concept:\n\nYour mum decides to create a forum for women in her local community and she lays out the rules of membership.\nMembership is open to local women of all ages, to discuss knitting, sewing, gardening and general women's issues.\n\nSome Guy from a neighboring town decides to join the group, and he starts opening topics about satanism, male prostrate cancer and engine tuning etc.\n\nYour mum removes his irrelevant topics, and reminds the guy about the rules and scope of the forum. All of which he had failed to comply with!\n\nThe guy is disgusted at being treated that way and accuses your mother of censoring him.\n\nYour mother explains that he was aware of the conditions of using the forum when he joined, while informing him that he is free to open his own forum to discuss the topics which interest him.\n\nThe guy creates his own forum and posts content explaining how badly treated he was by your mother.\n\nYour mother takes offense at the accusations and post a rebuttal on his site along with her own. \n\nThe guy deletes your mothers post from his site, while your mothers site still presents her argument on her site.\n\nNeither of them can censor the other as they are only in control of the data on their own site/forum! \n\nIpso facto the platform offers uncensored free speech, while individual sites may moderate the material they host as they see fit.\n\nZeroNet offers freedom to the users to create and host their own sites, which they are free to maintain as they see fit.\n\nThat is my argument, not the nonsense that you are attempting to attribute to me!\n\nAs for your OP I could question your motives based on the logic or lack there of in your argument.\n\nYou have created a strawman argument that is attempting to associate multiple parties to some conspiratorial plot to undermine freedom of speech aspect of the Zeronet platform. You have intentionally engineered your strawman to draw geekless into your your narrative, in order to accuse him of plotting to undermine the ZN platform. You have provided zero evidence that geekless has any association with any other party! Furthermore it could be argued that you are intentionally trying to engineer a situation that undermines the development of the ZeroTalk ++ project, and by extension the health and growth of the entire ZN platform.\n\nThe moderator functions which geekless has included in his ZeroTalk ++ project are not there for the purpose of censoring the ZN platform. To make such a claim is delusional at best and downright dishonest in reality. The moderator features are user definable and the impact of the moderation is limited to the individual forum created by the individual user.\n\nThe only aspect of your accusations that has any merit in the slightest is your claim that there is some form of organised contributory effort by two or more of the parties identified by yourself.  Which is hardly a revelation nor a display of cunning detective work. It's pretty obvious that there are connections between two or more parties based on the use of language, posting styles etc. Most people should be able to determine that there is a group effort involved or an individual with multiple accounts trying to game the system. It's hardly something new to ZN, it's a pattern of human behavior which predates the internet ffs! \n\nYour post isn't the first that has attempted to accuse geekless and discourage him from developing his project. That seem like a far more troubling situation, given how active the development of ZeroTalk ++ has been and how functional it is becoming. Zeronet needs a functional forum to encourage contributors and build communities, so I have to question your real motives in attempting to damage the progress of geekless's work!?\n\nFrom my perspective you are intentionally attempting to make unfounded association between geekless and other parties with the intention of harming the progress of ZeroTalk ++. Instead of trying to create drama why don't you be productive and fork ZeroTalk ++, and remove the moderator features that you don't like? That's the freedom that the ZN platform offers us all, so why don't you  use the freedom ZN affords you? Geekless has already given users the freedom to select options to manage the moderation of their ZT++ installation.  So ZN users may not be so quick to choose a fork that removes their freedom of choice.\n\nAs for little groups or individual users with multiple sock accounts fucking around in circle jerks...who gives a fuck? After all it's not like they are hard to spot if you're paying attention! Creating new anonymous accounts with a few clicks is another freedom offered by ZN. Live with it!",

[...]\n\nBecause that statement is fundamentally untrue. The reality is that there has not been a truly free capitalist system, the closest it may have come was probably the late 1700 and 1800's. Primarily during the development of the industrial revolution. When it was possible for individuals to develop ideas and bring them to local/national markets independently, without overreaching legislation etc. The legislation crept in to restrict independent businesses from expanding, and allow larger organisations to form monopolies which could afford the expenses required to comply with  legislation. Today many large corporations actually create the legislation required to protect their interests via lobbying etc. The monopolies simply buy out individual and family owned businesses, hoovering up innovation either for profit or to prevent new ideas/products from impacting existing profitable markets.\n\nThat's an over simplification, as there are many other aspect of the capitalist systems we have today that have lead to stagnation, and decline (by design). Such as education, poor nutrition and health systems, predatory lending/banking and treachery within the political and legal systems. Another damaging aspect has been the undermining of free capitalism with the implementation of socialist ideologies (by design).\n\nFor capitalism to succeed there needs to be a level playing field across all aspects of industry, politics and civil society. Under socialism there can never be a level playing field, because it requires the productivity of one group to be plundered in order to support another group. The plundering is managed by yet another group which decides who shall be plundered and rewarded, while they rule over everyone else living in luxury. Try reading reading Animal Farm!

Although I agree with you to some extent as the major players throughout the British Empire were generally syndicates/corporations such as the East India Company et al, which were controlled by the old money families.\n\nAmerica offered greater opportunities for the working class immigrants...at least the ones who were free of indentured servitude and an established class system. In reality there was always a class system in the US it was just more subtle, mostly due to the absence of peerage and titles. Despite the lack of nobility etc. a class structure was formed, which is why their are so many family ties between presidents, bankers and industrialists.\n\nAll the so called cycles of war and depression etc. have been choreographed by the same groups in order to redistribute wealth and regain/maintain control.\n\n\n> “A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.” Taylor Caldwell [...]\n\n\nBritain is currently undergoing such treachery at the hands of the same secret societies, which have operated throughout history, with the Brexit and Covid farces being the most recent esamples. It would appear that those same forces are also hell bent on attacking Trump. Regime change is part of their mo.\n\nWith respect to Education compulsory education for children between the ages or 5 to 10 was established in the 1880's. Prior to that English records show systems of education dating back to the Saxons. After the reformation reading levels increased significantly with increasing accessibility to Bibles written in common languages. Working class people broke into the religious classes and became ministers mostly under Protestantism. Under the expansion of Protestantism learning to read became much more accessible to the less privileged. All of my great grand parents (Protestant English and Irish) could read, and they were born in the 1800's. They were a mix of farm laborious, sailors and one merchant. I'm not sure that we can trust what history tells us about the general reading standards of the past.\n\nIn many respects the standard of education in the 1800's was far higher than today with respect to knowledge required for daily life. Read John Taylor Gatto's work https://www.johntaylorgatto.com/  and Jene Odening's discussions on the Trivium https://schoolsucksproject.com/tag/gene-odening/ .\n \n\n> [kapec](#comment_53_1CQ14MAUEp55ijU6rQLQ9vZdzxCQe9s1SF): This will always end up this way, with exploitation of people, we can't pretend that human greed has any boundaries because it does not. Those \"lagre corporations\" already grew into such proportions that they can create laws, or treat president as a puppet. What good is president for when he has no power to do stuff he was chosen to? It's not democracy anymore. [...]\n\n\nIt is a legal requirement for a  Corporation to operate for profit and in the interests of the shareholders. That is a major problem when it comes to what maybe in the best interests of communities and societies as a whole.\n\nFor example when there are savings and efficiency gains within a production system a corporation will reap the rewards for the shareholders. They will lay off staff and consolidate operations rather than distribute the gains among those who actually provide the energy. That has a social impact and undermines the progress of the majority  by design. Government and Taxes also play a role as the distribution of wealth is further managed by the same groups in power.\n\nIn the industrial revolution it was common for employers to establish communities with social infrastructures etc. which were a benefit to their employees and the wider community. Granted some of those employers acted out of malevolence as providing services generated a deeper reliance on the employer. There was a minority of employers who acted with benevolence and in the interests of their communities (Almshouses for example). At that time many companies were private businesses and not corporations. I'm not condoning charity as a means of social responsibility. Many individuals of that time had a very different view of religion and their relationship with god and acted as their conscience dictated. Corporatism removes certain freedoms by design. I agree with you Corporations have grown such an extent that they can control whole systems of government. That is by design!\n\nCapitalism doesn't require corporations to function, in fact corporatism is highly damaging to a free capitalist system by its nature. Corporations and the legal framework supporting them was created to prevent free and open markets. Corporations are controlled by their Memorandum of Incorporation and then further by Government Legislation and Statute. That's why businesses are required to follow stupid bs like the current Covid-19 regulations. That shit wouldn't fly in a free market, where individuals made their own decisions. Once a business is licensed and or incorporated they lose all freedom by design.\n\nThat again is an over simplification as there are other factors such as financial/banking systems, faulty economic ideologies taught by corrupt education systems etc. Then there are the impacts of NGO's and Trusts etc. which all influence government and economics in order to shape societies.\n\nAs for your \"what good is a President when he has no power...\" comment, that depends on what your understanding of the form of Government is. With respect to the American Republican form of Government the power of the president lays in the people. It is up to the people to manage the Government as they are the servants of the people. The problem is the American Republic has been undermined by traitors at every level of government including President's. Whatever your views are on Trump he is the closest thing America has to a de jure President that represents the American Republican form of Government. The guys behind E-clause probably give the best representation of that here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaVKZSP9W5mve4KHlkezOSQ\n\nAs for Great Britain it has all but fallen, as our individual sovereignty is invested in the reigning monarch who is supposed to protect our laws and customs. The current monarch has failed to honor the coronation oath, and has been usurped by traitors in government. Here's an example of the evidence to support the usurpation of the monarchy https://www.thebernician.net/parliament-appears-to-have-deposed-qeii-of-sovereignty/ . The people are supposed to be the last pillar of protection through the power of jury nullification in a de jure common law court. The English legal system and constitution has also been undermined, as the system has unlawfully rendered common law juries (de jure) redundant. And as such the people have no lawful means of redress against a treasonous and corrupt government. The same situation exists in America as the same power of nullification exists under the Republican form of government, but traitors in government and the judiciary prevent the people from accessing it.\n\n\n> [kapec](#comment_53_1CQ14MAUEp55ijU6rQLQ9vZdzxCQe9s1SF): That's not the problem with capitalism nor socialism, it's the problem of central planing and a fact that if something gets too big it cannot be managed efficiently without creating social unrest at local levels. The USA was created in such an event. And even now you can see how coastline states are developed in comparison to how middle states are underdeveloped.  [...]\n\n\nThe problem is that the whole thing has been stage managed by secret systems of control, which permeate every aspect of our societies. They create systems which are designed to fail, and out of those situations they create they redistribute and consolidate wealth and extend their control. They are currently attempting to crush the last remnants of western capitalism in order to move towards a socialist technocracy, which will be controlled by the very same groups and secret societies, only on a far more granular level than ever before, now that they have the technological means to fulfill their age old aims/agendas.\n\nThe only thing that will stop that from reaching fruition is going to be we the people! And in that regard people across the world are stirring on a massive scale. Hence the global Covid nonsense, which is intended to contain the rising masses, while destroying economies and national governments. I'm not so sure that they are going to succeed in keeping things contained much longer.\n\nThey aren't interested in National governments any longer, they want to distribute power to city majors. That will reintroduce the Feudal system of governance at a local level, which will in turn be controlled by a core technocracy which will most likely stem from the UN, or a variant of the current stricture of the UN and associated organisations such as the WHO and World Bank.\n\nThe Technocracy will almost certainly contain an element of some form of socialism in the early stages, in order to maintain some control over the masses through appeasement. Ultimately they don't really want the masses which require and consume resources. I doubt that element of socialism will stand the test of time, just as previous examples have failed in the past. It's just a means to an end, and an the easiest to sell to the feeble minded.\n\nWe all have to take personal responsibility for our own lives, and by extension our communities and societies as a whole.",

				"body": "@cathannaerra\n\nWe would probably need to start by dealing with the Vatican, Pope and the Holy See, as everything leads back to Rome.\n\nHere are just some of the critical issues that lead us all to Rome... \n\nThe Treaty of 1213 between King John and the Pope\nPapal Bull Unam Sanctum, Pope Boniface VIII November 18, 1302\nThe Vatican and Popes between 1350-1550 AD enacted the Papal Bull Unam Sanctum and Cestui Que Trusts\nThe secret Treaty of Verona, 22nd of November, 1822\nThe Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)\n\nPending One World Religion Treaty planned for September 2020\n\nKing John Surrendered his Kingdoms to the Pope in perpetuity in 1213. John, his heirs and successors became agents of the Pope in perpetuity. The Trust/Contract exists between the heirs and successors of John and the Pope. In order to break the Trust/Contract the succession of one or both lines needs to be broken.\n\nUnder the Unam Sanctum 1302 the Pope claimed ownership of all life on earth. We the people need to question the validity of such a ludicrous and unlawful claim. According to Christian text the creator gave man dominion over the land, air and sea, and created all men equal. We man/the people/living souls trump any claims as we are the heirs and successors of Adam and Eve. We all hold equal title of the original Trust between the creator/God and man Genesis 1:28. \n\n> Genesis 1:28\n\n> King James 2000 Bible\n> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth. \n\n> Dominion; LAW - Land, Air and Water\n\n> Jurisdiction over the land\n\n> L = common law = Rights, Property and Equity established in the 1st testamentary trust\n\n> A = ECC/Cannon Law = Trust Law\n\n> W = Admiralty/Commerce = Contract Law\n\n> In order of authority. \n\nUnder the Cestui Que Trust the Pope pronounced us all lost at sea (dead). We the people need to challenge such a ridiculous and unlawful claim. Quite clearly seven billion or so living souls may take issue with the obseredety of being declared lost at sea/dead. Any contract requires the informed connect of the parties and full disclosure. Failure to disclose the conditions of a contract renders it null and void from its inception.\n\nThe 1822 Verona Treaty effectively renders the American Constitution null and void. America is subject to the Pope via the English Monarchy acting as agents of the Vatican/Pope. Because the Pope owns all life on earth. The Pope had previously claimed to nullify Magna Carta 1215 which is the foundation of both the English and American constitutions, as well as the constitutions of all British commonwealth nations. Which is strange as British and American governments and judiciaries appear to observe aspects of MC 1215 and the Constitutions when it suits them? Both Constitutions are being increasingly undermined in recent years and never more so than at present.    \n\nThe UCC is the LAW under which all corporations engaged in commerce conform to.    \n\nAll of the above can be applied to Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the rest of the world, as far as the Vatican, Pope and Rome are concerned.\n\nAnd for those calling out the J's they are the money changers, bankers and agents of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nDo an image search for 'meets the Pope' and just look at who is kissing the ring of the Pope. It becomes pretty clear that leaders of every Nation and Religion are represented in the results! That should be a good indication of who they all answer to.\n\nOne World Religion 2020 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cio9j7WuQ5o \n[ The video covers many key aspects of the current state of OWR, and is not intended to be representative of my views in anyway. ]\n\nAlso bear in mind that Trump had a Jesuit education. He appears to stand for the American Republic on the surface, while other actions of his seem to align with the agenda of the Vatican, and the Pope? History would suggest that we are going to get screwed over.  \n\nThe Vatican and the Pope don't represent the creator (god) nor peace, their history clearly demonstrates that. https://i.pinimg.com/564x/b4/8c/cf/b48ccf4d62fed1427b1aba82c2053945.jpg\n\nRome represents power and control, and Rome will obtain/retain it by any means necessary. Abortion and Euthanasia are just tools which help them achieve their objectives. Covid is yet another tool in their arsenal. \n\nIt really doesn't matter if you're religious, agnostic or atheist etc. it's not what we may or may not believe individually. This is what the vermin we are up against believe, and how they attempt to justify their unjustifiable crimes and nonsense, under papal decree/colour of law.",

What if 10 other persons also have them? [...]\n\nI'm not sure how anyone owns zeros and ones on some piece of remote storage as it has no physical or intrinsic value in reality. The ledger and audit trail is the only tangible proof of it's existence and ownership/title backed by the faith of those willing to engaged in a particular crypto coin. In much the same way as the traditional credit based banking system functions today. It's backed by nothing other than promises and the faith of those engaged in it, there is zero substance.\n\nWhen you screw with peoples perceptions/understanding of reality anything is possible in the minds of men. In the end reality wins every time! 10 x nothing/fiat is worth nothing in reality, while 10 x ounces of gold is worth what people value 10 ounces of physical gold to be, in exchange for a unit of goods/property or a unit of their life (time and energy). Gold and other substances are tangible and can be fashioned into something useful/practical in the physical realm, so there is some form of real value. In a famine a handful or grain is going to be worth more than a handful of gold - that's reality. People, especially in the West, have been conditioned to believe in fiction as if it is their reality, and the scary thing is how easily fooled most people are.  \n\nIf ten people hold the keys then it's no longer an individuals private property is it? So no one has exclusive ownership, they hold an interests/share. And if one party believes they hold exclusive ownership and nine others also claim ownership theft or fraud is taking place. Which would be 'suspicious activity'.\n\nMy thoughts weren't based on some airy hypothetical, they were based on the assumption that the individuals have a genuine honest claim. Personally I think anyone using an exchange is foolish. And I don't have much sympathy for someone complaining when they swim in a pool with sharks and get bitten. It also defeats the object of crypto when people try to conjoin it with the fiat currencies they claim to be working against.

The Roman church and more specifically the Papacy have declared to hold ultimate power and dominion over all life on earth, as evidenced in Papal bulls and originally in the Unam Sanctam.\n\nWhy do the heads of virtually every faiths, including Jews, as well as national political leaders, pay homage to the Pope and kiss the ring, if the Pope and Rome aren't at the very centre?\n\nThe catholic church is the ultimate secret society, with a massive surveillance/intelligence network. The closed confessional was the original invasion of security and privacy, and international metadata harvesting organisation. To think they haven't retain that power would be foolish imho, and they don't need the confessional with modern technology.\n\nThe Pope also intends to be the head of the emerging One World Religion.

A OP6 is a pretty snappy phone and for £200 it's hard to beat. The Dual sim is also something I find useful.\n\nOther negatives the screen is bonded to the body, and the battery is built-in, so replacement is not as easy as it was on older models. The camera isn't as good as those on high end flagship phones, although it does a decent enough job imho. It's not fully waterproof.\n\nThere are some compromises if you go the de-googles FOSS route, especially if you rely on some of the popular apps on Google Play.
