And if he wins the dem primaries then basically the entire democrat base will be voting him. [...]\n\nAll? Not just some of them but all? Based on what polling data? Or are you plugged into the psyches all of the 'burned Trumpers' ? I consider myself very far left, and I'm planning on voting for either Buttigeig or Warren. So where does that factor in? \n\nNo amount of defense spending cuts, libertarian privitization, or austerity measures will pay for his UBI scheme. I support the idea, but our 60 yrs. and older Congress don't. Yang is an outsider to Congress and D.C., so unless he has career members of the House and Senate backing his agenda, he'll be a 4 year lame duck presidency.",
