				"body": "> Does it mean that my IP address is actually broadcast when making requests on ZeroNet?\n\nSort of. Whenever you need a resource you have to get it from one of the connected peers. That peer now knows your interest in the material. You don't broadcast your IP when you request things. Your ZeroNet client will submit its IP to the public tracker servers. Any client can now ask these servers for the IP pool of a certain site. If your IP is in that pool it means you have content for that site you can distribute. It doesn't necessarily means that you are actually using the site yourself.\n\nOnce you have downloaded the resource, you no longer need to ask others. The primary problem is that right now I can probe each tracker for a questionable site and they deliver the IP list to me.\n\n> Page response time is not limited by your connection speed\n\nThis is a lie. Only things that are cached are not limited. Other things, like content updates or you posting something are indeed limited by your connection speed.",
