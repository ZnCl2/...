They're still there.\n\nWhere are the bodies / ashes?\n\nIn the stream next to the camp.  You can smell it to this day.\n\nDid they make lampshades and soap out of jew skin?\n\nWho gives a shit.  They were dead.\n\nWhy does the death count of Auschwitz permanently get corrected down (initial claim: 4 million, current official numbers: 1.1 million), but the total number of dead jews always remains the same 6 million?\n\nBecause Jews think they are 'better' than the 7 million Christians that died there too.\n\nWas it really possible to tell the difference if they burned a jew or a russian by the color of the smoke?\n\nNow you're just being a fucktard.\n\nHow did the masturbation machines work?\n\nYou are officially a fucktard.  I'm done.",

National Socialist German Workers Party were as far left as you can get, short of Communism.  In fact, the Communists are historically and presently 10x as deadly as NAZI's ever were.  But they are both left wing.  The right wing wants the least amount of government possible aka the 'leave me the fuck alone' policy.",

Alt right is just anyone who is a nationalist and willing to engage in identity politics on behalf of white people and white interests. That's all it is. They can be capitalist or socialist. It doesn't make any claims about economics. It's a big tent philosophy.\n\nThat doesn't make sense when you look at all forms of government.  You are talking about culture, not law.  The smallest minority.  The absolute \"identity\" is the individual.  You can not submit to a group identity and support individual Rights.  The realm of right vs left  is a sliding scale of maximum government to minimum government.\n\nWhen you start conflating 'nationalism' or 'identity' with law or commerce, it doesn't make logical sense.  There is one culture to be sure, but that isn't a legal system, method of trade, or account for the legal protection of any individual.",
