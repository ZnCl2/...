			"body": "It seems to be kicking off finally, like even if it is not fully p2p, there are lots of open source protocols and servers now, and even federated like nextcloud or disroot (for cloud services), open protocols for communications like [Matrix], social networks fully decentralized like scuttlebug (patchwork, manyverse), and some federated like pleroma, mastodon, peertube, and even fucking blockchain like this one, lokinet, lbry. There is even a browser that natively works peer to peer, beaker, I can just wonder what would happen if all those teams came together, specially the ones that aim at a fully decentralized and p2p internet.",

Stay away from 08chan and the like and you should be fine. Eventually you’ll run into block lists designed to prevent you from inadvertent seeing porn and whatnot, those will be your best friend.\n\nWhy stay away from 08chan and what is it?",

Maybe the only silver lining is that it doesn't really need any money (since the owner is rich or something) and is not under the influence of the US (it is based on Rusia) so they are not likely to just give away your data like any other US based company, (at least to the US), but be sure they do have it, they just probably don't share it, anyway, that's why I don't like it.",

When I enter the valley from the hills, the brown air that hovers above the city is appalling. That's what inspired the micro-particulate sensor. The CO2 and VOC sensor was inspired by my long history of jobs that have probably been shaving extra time off of my life with the chemicals that I have been exposed to. Plus, I just find micro controllers (Arduino) to be a lot of fun to tinker with, and I just love building useful things.\n\nThat's amazing, I would at least couple it with a mask tho with filtering.",

One project I have in the works is a GSM module I wanna tie into an RPi. That way I'll have a phone still, but I'll only be on the grid when I want to be. Get some IR emitters on a pair of glasses, headphones, or a hat and all of a sudden it's a little harder to track you. Especially if they're just using facial recognition algorithms. Depends on how smart the algorithms are written, and how often they get flashed so their \"weirdness tolerance\" gets set to a higher bar.\n\nThen you may be interested in this ;)\n\nhttps://changelog.com/podcast/428",

And they aim at different use case, matrix is more like a discord substitute whereas session is more like a WhatsApp killer, and in that regard briar already does everything session does and more, another contender is jami but they are just starting to introduce group chats as of this year https://jami.net/swarm-introducing-a-new-generation-of-group-conversations/",
