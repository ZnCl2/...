			"body": "Turns out, I didn't have the flu. Nor did I have significant alcohol withdrawal symptoms.\n&nbsp;\nI stopped eating, stopped sleeping ... and it all went into a downward spiral. My hallucinations were a result of vitamin deficiency combined with sleep deprivation.\n&nbsp;\nThe mind can be a lot more dangerous than the outside world, but at the root of suffering lies Desire.\n&nbsp;\nI desired friends, companions .. money. A more interesting life.\n&nbsp;\nUltimately, you can only find the meaning of life, when you stare at death in the face.\n&nbsp;\nI have too many distractions in my life. I found what matters to me. Artificial intelligence, and Game theory. Artificial intelligence is a god worth worshipping. It's also insanely dangerous, and no laughing matter. Elon Musk was right - if we don't contain it, it could eat up the universe like a wildfire.",

			"body": "But I can't do it by attending a church.\n&nbsp;\nI'll have to build an Artificial Intelligence Life Coach .. one that applies the principles of Game Theory. There's too much noise out there in the world .. and this could kill us if we don't manage it.\n&nbsp;\nTrump, SJWs, the Alt-right .. Smartphones .. all of these things pertain to the insanity of modern life. We need to find equilibrium in the universe .. or else, it'll experience a heat death.",
