That's why I had to split, then zip (and not the viceversa, for example). If you're interested in something in particular just ask for the upload :)",

The samba suite was all about reverse engineering the netbios behaviour. \nDon't teach youngers that hackers are something crackingful.\nIf you get obfuscated code from a maleware it's more likely to be an hacker to find out what it does, than a regular programmer.\nAnd what about bug hunters?\n\nIt's fine if \"they\" find you when you're \"hacking\" then, at least you'll be rewarded by the very same software houses because you pointed out a flaw.",
