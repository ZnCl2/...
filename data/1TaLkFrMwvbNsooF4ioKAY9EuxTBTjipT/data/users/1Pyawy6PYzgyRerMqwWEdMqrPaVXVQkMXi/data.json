But no, they have to make it political, its never about the people.\n\nthat ghanja is illegal in india, in the country of aryuveda, is such a crime, such an abomination, such a treason, such weakness, such shame... there is a moment there is only an uprising that will root out those thieves and their cohort of leeches. I hope that one day india will return to it's roots and become again a free country, until then buckle up, if they already made a plant of the creation illegal, what else could they be doing?",

The records then show the USTR does exactly that, telling Mexico its actions on glyphosate and genetically engineered crops raise concerns \"regarding compliance\" with USMCA.\n\nAlmost all of that is yellow corn for animal feed and industrial uses. López Obrador's commitment to reducing and, by 2024, eliminating such imports reflects his administration's plan to ramp up Mexican production as part of the campaign to increase self-sufficiency in corn and other key food crops.\"\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/16/revealed-monsanto-mexico-us-glyphosate-ban\n\n \"respect Mexico's sovereignty and refrain from interfering with its right to enact health-protective policies\"—specifically, the phaseout of the herbicide glyphosate and the cultivation of genetically modified corn.\n\n------\n\nFirst of all I am so sorry to use this language. \n\nNow I read this, and I am in awe before Mexcio ! I am fully on board. first weed, a plant of the creation, now banning toxic cornering and corrupting of life gmos? \n\n3rd step is to abolish all capital gains tax (later explained)\n\n4. translate continuously the whole laws of mexico to english... (I know it's sad, but you will understand too)\n\nnow the warfare phaze...\n \nTom Vilsack \n Katherine Tai",
