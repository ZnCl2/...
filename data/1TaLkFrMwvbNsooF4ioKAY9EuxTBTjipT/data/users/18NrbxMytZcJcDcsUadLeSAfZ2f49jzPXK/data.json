			"title": "The Venus Project",
			"body": "The Venus Project is the most controversial project I've ever seen.\nIt's based on 110% logic, so it doesn't look like bad science fiction, but what about culture of people, who will leave in this paradise? \n\nFrom the point of view of the man of our century [I like this amount of 'ofs' in one sentence ; )] better humanity will live by the better laws of morality, laws of beauty, so can we understand them? There may be some sort of rejection from us, even if we know, that this is the future and we are the past. Kind of scary, to be overboard. From some moment you can't influence life and the future, because it isn't yours anymore, so your presence will cease to make sense.\n\nWhat do you think about it?",
