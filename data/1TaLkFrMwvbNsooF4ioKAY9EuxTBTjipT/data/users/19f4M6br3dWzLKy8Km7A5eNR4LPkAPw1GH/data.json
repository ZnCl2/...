Currency can't have a legacy that is traceable and that is what makes Bitcoin a security, and a damn good one. Monero or ZCash are better currencies because with encryption and anonymous options they are fungible. Dash is in the running too, but has a few centralization issues.\n\nHe is right but it is not just bitcoin that is the only crypto currency.",
