Fact and Figures - \"We are bearing witness to the downfall and destruction of our heritage, to the end of the age of enlightenment. May homo sapiens live up to their name and put an end to this senseless self-destruction.\"\n>The WHO posts COVID study by world-renowned Stanford epidemiologist - Just 0.05% of healthy under-70s who get COVID-19 will die from the disease, true fatality rate unknown because many are never diagnosed.\n>No need for vaccines, COVID pandemic is over, says former Vice President of Pfizer - \"You do not vaccinate people who aren’t at risk from a disease. You also don’t set about planning to vaccinate millions of fit and healthy people with a vaccine that hasn’t been extensively tested on human subjects.”\n>Top pathologist claims coronavirus is “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public” - “There is utterly unfounded public hysteria driven by the media and politicians, it’s outrageous. Masks are utterly useless...they are simply virtue signalling.\"\n>John Hopkins publishes, then retracts, study examining 2020 death rates - “These data analyses suggest that in contrast to most people’s assumptions, the number of deaths by COVID-19 is not alarming. In fact, it has relatively no effect on deaths in the United States.”\n>President of the Bulgarian Pathology Association says \"no one has has died of the coronavirus,\" calls the WHO a “criminal medical organization” for creating worldwide fear and chaos without providing objectively verifiable proof of a pandemic.\n>Major study finds masks don’t reduce COVID-19 infection rates - \"In fact, according to the data, mask usage may actually increase the likelihood of infection.\"\n>COVID-19 PCR tests are scientifically meaningless - \"The COVID-19 death statistics comprise also patients who died of a variety of diseases, redefined only because of a “positive” test result whose value could not be more doubtful.\"\n>The missing COVID virus - \"SARS-CoV-2, the pandemic virus, has never been proved to exist. The CDC used an arbitrary computer “tinker-toy” process to invent a description of the virus.\"\n>Only poisoned monkey kidney cells ‘grew’ the ‘virus’ - \"The shocking thing is that the virologists found that solutions containing SARS-CoV-2 — even in high amounts — were NOT infective to any of the three human tissue cultures they tested.\"\n>The WHO admits high-cycle PCR tests produce COVID false positives: The WHO said that after thorough investigation it \"confirmed that PCR tests were not always being used appropriately and in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\"\n>Current PCR Testing Produces 97% False Positives",
