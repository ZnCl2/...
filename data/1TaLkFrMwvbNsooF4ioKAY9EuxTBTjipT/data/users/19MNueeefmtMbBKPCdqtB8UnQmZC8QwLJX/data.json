KxoNet is a collection of many services, including Plugin Store, KxoID, KxoBlock and so on. And those blocklists weren't even finished AFAIK.\n\nHaving a CA run by someone who's not a hardcore free speech activist is not advisable in case they start preventing people from getting certs for stuff they said elsewhere or certificate revocation becomes a feature.\nOr worse, begin doxing people with privileged information obtained through the required plugins.",

				"body": ">Krixano left ZeroNet and I doubt he'll return anytime soon, so you can't say that KxoID is hosted by non-hardcode speech activists\nHe's the one with the private keys to update the code for the site (and maybe associate plugins, I don't know who controls those). So even if technically the code is being run on random people's computers, what code is being run is controlled by him or whoever he decided to lend the keys to.\n>Also, certificate revocation isn't possible the way ZeroNet works currently\nThat's why I said \"if it ever becomes a feature\".\n>and, anyways, old certificates can never be revoked.\nWhy not? Just make ZeroNet fetch a blacklist signed by the CA from somewhere. All it would take is nofish pushing an update that adds that feature, or the maintainers for the required plugin to get KxoID certs (which again, for all I know might be controlled by the same guy who set up KxoID) which would prevent people who have themselves gotten KxoID certs to recognize blacklisted users as valid.\nBy making these lists he expressed at the very least an intent to make it easy for other users to block people he disagrees with. Making it mandatory for people who use his ID service to subscribe to those blacklists is just a step away.\n>Finally, there's no way to avoid requests being decrypted by the registrars\nI never mentioned encryption. I'm talking about the plugins pinging a clearnet address with your IP, your master seed, your bank account, or what have you. Plguins (at least as far as I understand it) are omnipotent. I wouldn't really want to have somebody who subscribes to leftist ideals so much that he goes out of his way to maintain wrongthink lists to be able to push arbitrary code to my computer.\nEspecially with all the stuff that's going on right now, case in point being Stallman's words being spun by the media to get him kicked from the FSF.\nHow can I trust that a guy who makes lists of people saying bad things about the jews won't get contacted by a journalist some day promising to make him famous or give him some money if he doxes all those bad people over there saying bad things about the jews?",

Registrars only get the 3rd key. It's enough to register a username, but it can't be used for anything else.

If any developer who contributed good code was allowed to have power over the project it would become rather easy to subvert. Just invest enough into improving it until you have majority control and then begin taking bad decisions. Sorry to insist, but just look at how RMS was kicked out of the foundation he himself created, Linus was forced to step off from his leadership position, F-Droid was forced to kick out Gab, etc. Ideally nofish wouldn't have his real life identity out there, but at least now that his identity is known he should refuse to make concessions to astroturfers trying to get him to do stuff like Theo de Raadt does (not saying you are one, just saying giving out control makes their job easier).\nProbably the only reason the Tor project has remained censorship free is that government agents need it to remain hidden when collecting intelligence online.",

It's a trade off between risk of policies changing and fixing bugs faster and possibly more features.\nThat doesn't have anything to do with KxoID, true, I just bring it up because OP did.",
