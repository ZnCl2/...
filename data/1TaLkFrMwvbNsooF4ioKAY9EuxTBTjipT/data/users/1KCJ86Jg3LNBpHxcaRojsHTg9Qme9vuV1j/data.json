			"body": "Hi! Recently I've got the itch to dive back into Diablo and I was thinking about plaything through all 3 in chronological order. I've discovered that old software no longer works on Mac due to the switch over to Intel. I've done a little research but as of yet I haven't found a decent solution. SheepShaver is an option but from what I've read it isn't made to emulate old games and won't work very well.\n\nAnyone out there know how to emulate older Mac games?\n\nThanks!",

Happy to seed this one. Just randomly stumbled upon it while looking for new zites to seed.",

But I believe it's important to know the biases of those conducting/funding a study, especially with statistics which can be so easily manipulated. So long as his methodology is fine, then all is well. Knowing his biases means I've got to keep an extra eye out, just as I would reading a study funded by Greenpeace on GMOs. It doesn't automatically discredit something in its entirety, not at all, but I think it's fair to keep in mind. \n\nAlso, no joke, I think it's interesting that Jared Taylor seems to consider Jewish people white. That's not something I would have expected.",
