			"body": "After the brutal Hong Kong security law marched into the civilized world, Hong Kong's cyberspace may collapse.  \n\n**Blessed by the constitutional system on Gun Rights and Human Rights, America’s internet will not collapse so easily.  **\n\nIt seems that due to the brutal GFW system that covers too many terrible facts, quite many ordinary people in the USA don’t see the dangerous toxicity of Coronavirus.

Trump refused to wear masks in public, but Vice President Mike Pence insisted on wearing masks. Finally Donald Trump had to change his mind.  \n\nSo several months after Covid19 outbreak in the USA, Donald Trump finally **put on face masks** in July. \nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53378439   \n** Coronavirus: Donald Trump wears face mask for the first time ** \n\n##**Data Kills **\n**Data don’t kill people directly. Those who maneuver data improperly may kill many people. **\nAt the early stage of Covid19 pandemics, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen sent messages to the USA that **the toxicity of Wuhan virus is very dangerous**.  But that important message was ignored by some politicians. \n\n\nLeaders who underestimate the trend of data development **don’t murder people directly**, but the wrong signal produced by the malfunction of data analysis may result in wrong actions by many ordinary people. \n\n## **Donald Trump is NOT the worst … ** ## \n**Apparently, Donald Trump is not a great leader, especially at the unprecedentedly–severe stage of history with highly-poisonous pandemics going out of control!   However, this message won’t put all the blames on Trump, since Donald Trump is still NOT the worst choice for American people.  Compared with other candidates, Donald Trump doesn’t have too complicated business relationships with East Asia, which is heavily polluted by the terrible virus produced by the atheism gang. **  \n\nThe fact is that despite many people being awakened up by the dangerous situation, which harms  America's finest tradition that respects Gun Rights and Human Rights, \nInvestigations Into The \"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\" For Medical Malpractice & Crimes Against Humanity \nhttps://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/we-call-investigations-bill-melinda-gates-foundation-medical-malpractice-crimes-against \nthe situation of cyberspace monopolized by Google, Microsoft can’t be changed in short time.  \n\nEven Donald Trump’s fighting against those \"fake media\" can’t change this situation quickly. \n## ** So what will happen if America’s internet is also collapsed? ** \n\nIn such case, the decentralized website of Zeronet https://zeronet.io/ will serve as a good solution for people to transmit revolutionary messages.

			"title": "The Biggest Enemy of Donald Trump …",
			"body": "\nThe Biggest Enemy of Donald Trump is neither Joe Biden, nor the dictator Xi Jin Ping — the hooligan leader of the atheism gang in Asia, but **the capricious mentality of Trump himself**. \n\nThe Biggest Enemy of Joe Biden is not Donald Trump either, but Biden's distorted pursuit of wealth that involves very complicated business relationships with East Asia, which may ultimately result in some people finally to be charged with   ** \"treason\" against America **. \n\nSome capricious words and behaviours by Trump did incur troubles against many people, and against Donald Trump himself.\n\nHowever, some of his remarks hold reason, and should be treated seriously. \n\"If I don't win the election, China will own the United States — you will have to learn to speak Chinese!\" Trump said.\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/trump-says-americans-will-learn-to-speak-chinese-loses-biden-2020-8\n\n###**To have to learn Chinese? That’s just a minor point!! **\n\nIf America is totally polluted by the atheism virus, with American society ruled like the atheism gang as that in East Asia, with the so-called term \"Chinese Model\", then the number of **infected patients** would be tremendously reduced immediately (**highly possible to be “Zero” infection**), NOT due to good vaccines developed in time, but due to **media control that forbids report of any negative news** which may harm the dictatorship by the atheism gang!\n\nFurthermore,  in order to protect the glory of the ruling party, the facts that hundreds of thousands of patients died of Covid19 would not be reported either, maybe just with a few cases allowed to be reported, so as to accompany the propaganda on the ruling party's care on its own people! \n\n###The large number of people who perished would be totally silenced down, just like former whistle-blower Chinese Doctor Lee Wen Liang, besides millions of other people … \n( about 20 million mobile users disappeared by the end of March  https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/20/3/23/n11965551.htm ) \n\nThe above is just the consequences that can be seen, then there will be many **indescribable, unreported consequences**, such as organ harvest, with healthy people disappeared thoroughly in the world, while organ transplant business going bustling in various hospitals … \n\nThe notorious GFW has covered too many facts of cruel truth unknown by ordinary people in the USA.  The merchant-minded President Trump, apparently not with vicious purpose to cover the truth, but with some money-worship mind just in order **to keep the stock market from panic**, pretended not to see the danger of coronavirus, and just called it a variation of common flu.  It caused confusion in the society, and reduced the vigilance of the majority of American people.  USA failed to take precautious measures like Taiwan did, and the virus spread out of control.  Due to over-preference on the stock market performance than the safety of people’s lives, Trump's mistake led to contrary results, with big plunge of stock market that may trigger other troubles as well.\n\nTrump's mistake can be termed as **a serious negligence** of his presidency work. \n\nCompared with other crimes such as **treason against America**, Trump's mistake is not so serious.  \n\nIn short, due to the coronavirus spread too wide, Donald Trump is certainly not a great leader, however, **he will NOT be the worst one**  in America's history.  \n\n##In fact, Donald Trump is himself a victim of the virus. \nHe simply underestimated the poisoning power of the GFW, which covered too many true death polls in East Asia that were unimaginable even for ordinary Chinese people, not to mention American netizens. \n\nSome of the technocrats who gave advanced technology and equipments to the atheism gang in China should be more seriously blamed or punished, since **they did it on purpose**. **It’s more vicious than Trump’s mistake**. \n\nThings are improving.  Police is banned from putting a knee to a person's head or neck \nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/us/schenectady-police-officer-knee-on-man-video/index.html \n\nSeveral months after Covid19 outbreak in the USA, Donald Trump finally put on face masks in July.\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53378439 \n\nThanks to the powerful constitution system, no leaders can distort America's society at their will. After many troubles were caused by his own capricious words and behaviours, Donald Trump continues to grow on his first presidency. \n\nHis mistake doesn’t go so far as treason against American people. Since he is not the worst choice, Donald Trump deserves people’s support for a second presidency.  \n\n**It’s not because so many people love him, just because he is NOT the man who deserves the deepest hate by people living on this planet …  ** \n\n[Some special information ](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1B4vYHwkCywhjs3GMxFSvdCraYj5dh9LTV/?Topic:8_1PUkWFbzkD4dyRZ2vH3G8WeQw4m2UVPA2p/Some+special+information+on+Coronavirus)",

What Karl Marx worshipped might be either a \"Specter\", “Ghost” or “Devil”, or a distorted “God” image in his soul, or any other object, by enhancing the communism promotion to a \"Specter” level, such mentality is itself against the doctrine of “Atheism”.  \n\nReligion-level communists are themselves against atheism dictatorship.  Chinese Dictator Emperor Xi Jin Ping’s father Xi Zhong Xun was another famous example on this aspect.  **Communism often emphasizes equality on wealth, which is itself contradictory to brutal dictatorship that can easily distort justice**.  So when the notorious Cultural Revolution occurred, simply triggered by the natural instinct of conscience to protect his belief of communism, Xi Zhong Xun himself fought bravely against the oppression by the atheism regime. \n\n###The biggest failure of communism is that communism is itself contradictory to atheism.  \nVery brutal absurdities occurred then.  **All the dictators demanded their subordinates worship the supreme leaders as a \"Sacred\" \"God\" or \" Holy Authority\"; meanwhile, on the other hand, in their daily life, they should not treat any thing as \"sacred\" or \"Holy\", since which could easily overthrow the ideology of \"atheism”**.   \n\nNo one can totally represent God.  However, long-term, passionate efforts on any topic will result in a special realm that’s **going with unlimited approximation to God’s altar, even including atheism**. \n\nFor example, many atheists believe atheism should be taken as the highest principle of truth. By that logic, in order to protect their highest truth, they should not retreat from protecting the truth with gun rights;  then the scientific logic automatically applies — without monopoly of gun rights, no one in America can execute dictatorship as brutally as the atheism gang does in China, by any concept — including **medieval Christendom or modern atheism**.  \n\nAntifa and some riots behind by the movement of Black Lives Matter may be supported by very complicated operation of the atheism gang. \n\n**Communism can destroy many things once its inherent self contradictory troubles go out of control!! ** \n\nThat’s why American people should keep high vigilance against Antifa, besides the serious infiltration of American society by various viruses produced by the atheism gang, including the anti-religion cultural virus disguised as atheism, besides **the dangerous coronavirus **.\n\n[Some special information ](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1B4vYHwkCywhjs3GMxFSvdCraYj5dh9LTV/?Topic:8_1PUkWFbzkD4dyRZ2vH3G8WeQw4m2UVPA2p/Some+special+information+on+Coronavirus)",

Lol 😆 :)\n\n[New Functions on ZeroNet …  — Pin comments to the top ](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1597641256_1GVfTPghbWnBKbRWpYpkRCKgMi4wFecie2/New+Functions+on+ZeroNet)\nIt’s suggested the post creator be allowed to pin about 3-5 messages to the top.  \nYoutube may allow only 1 message pinned to the top? Since they allow the video owner to delete vicious comments, so 1 message at the top will be enough.  At Zeronet,  since emphasis is put on uncensored freedom, it’s suggested that about 3-5 messages be allowed to be **pinned to the top**. \n\nWith the function of **Pin comments to the top**, good messages can be pinned by the message composer at the top, easily visible by audience.  In this way, a few powerful messages will beat down hundreds or thousands of rubbish comments. \n###The above is just a kind idea for Zeronet’s long term prosperity. \nIf there’re better ideas, please share it.",
