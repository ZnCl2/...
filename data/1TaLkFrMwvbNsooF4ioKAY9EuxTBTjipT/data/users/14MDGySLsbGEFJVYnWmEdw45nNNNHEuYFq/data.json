The first year is going to be extremely difficult, the second year year and beyond will also be difficult. Give it several more years.  Im on my third year and its a struggle still. my life is still extremely up and down.  I have my moments as does everyone else who has lost family from murder or suicide.   Its not going to be easy and like you, I have my days where im hoping for the pain to end.  I have almost nobody in my life which makes it that much more difficult.   Eat well, exercise, get a lot of nature.  Join a local survivor group and see a psychologist.  At the end of the day it comes down to you figuring out how to work with what you have and setting some goals while learning to deal with the cards you have been dealt.  Ask the creator to hold you and give you the strength to carry on.  Also, fungi works.  When you are ready, research it.  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/czp3xq/johns_hopkins_opens_new_center_for_psychedelic/\n\nFrom a fellow survivor",
