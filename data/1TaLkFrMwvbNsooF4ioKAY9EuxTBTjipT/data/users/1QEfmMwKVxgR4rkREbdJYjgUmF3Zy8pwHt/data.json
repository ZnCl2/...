Telegram secure chat is a wee bit better, but not that much better than it would earn to be called \"useful\". XMPP/OMEMO is quite good, but not widespread. That's about all, other are useless. If you want anon use Wire, if you want more security use Signal, if you don't care much about metadata (who do you contact) but want user friendliness use Whatsapp.\n\nZeronet is not a chat network, and it's not a peer-to-peer data exchange. At least not in that sense. And zeronet \"chat\" gets basically into a shared, displayed database.

Same goes with most of the chat out there. Moxie is a curious beast indeed. ;-)\n\nTox is the one I've just mentioned, and Wire is halfway there, since you can use email registration; it's obvious why Wire gets used and Tox isn't: the complete anonymity requires really uncomfortable handshake for first contact, not to mention that's its a way to easy to lose and that means starting the hi-there-where-are-you handshake all over again. :-) [Tor messenger was unusable last time I checked and Riot isn't existing just quite yet.]\n\nAll in all: the list above isn't the \"worst tech\".

You are very naïve if you think Linux is an unbreakable fortress: I see hacked Linux boxes all the time.

Within ten minutes all the disks are scanned, and data is pulled in order of importance. Seen that \"in the wild\".\nAnd I don't give a fuck about what you believe in, either about me, or anyone else, but I don't quite like that you hint ignorant people that they're safe because you say they are.

You may or may not be aware that English is two language to learn: one written and one pronounced. They have little relation to one another. I would say no matter how many funky \"positive\" examples you try to pull up your sleeve it's all just irrelevant minorities to the huge disadvantage of a spelling distanced from the pronounciation. I don't know how many languages you speak, I happen to know a few, and possibly English spelling is the worst of all. And, as I said, probably Russian is one of the nicest spelling-wise (but I believe sanskrit would even better, it's also using a phonologically systematic writing system, beyond closely following the spoken language).\n\nSo,  what I mean is, when I need a language to communicate I don't give a flying fuck how does it support language history, ancient usage or local accents. These are nice to have, unless they block the primary usage which is clear, simple, effective communication. In case of English they very much obstruct learning and communication.\n\n(And it's even worse, as I heard, since plenty of people with english as mother tongue haven't learnt grammar, they just try to get along mimicking what others do. I've learnt some grammar most of the US people can't even reproduce. Okay, accepted, apart from my continuous errors, I haven't said I'm perfect. :-))",

Granted, they have been taught some really basic stuff, but far from what we have here around in our mother tongue. But maybe they were special, or exceptions, or lived in weird places, or forgot about it, whatever. I'm not them. They seemed pretty sure what they were talking about.\n\nMy experience showed that sometimes I've been using a tense my correspondent were not able to construct, and had vague image about its meaning, and he's been living in the US since T+0. It was some very weird experience.\n\nAnd I'm aware that English pronunciation have rules, I've been programmed some speech synth on C=64, and had to find the rules by myself, but if you look at Russian you'll see what I mean by \"unreasonably diverted from spoken language\".

It's not a bad language, a funny mixture of frank, scandinavian (or norse), french and eventually latin, possibly not much worse than German or Swedish. The structure (analytic constructions) are much easier to learn than agglutination, probably this helps the native US speakers to stay alive who are not the brightest persons on Earth. :-P It's using latin alphabet so writing is easy to learn for the western people (or, actually, nearly anyone but the Indian and Chinese). It'll do.\n\nI'm not a fan on slavic people, but their language is okay. Spanish and Italian is not that bad either but I'm not familar with the word stems, so lots of work to learn. But all of these are vastly easier for me to learn than some weirdo-looking one like Japanese, Chinese or, say, Urdu. Not to mention their absolutely wasted writing systems. (Hmm, to be honest, devanagari is one I really like, but not Chinese or Japanese.) And obviously the total dictatoric and oppressive  Chinese political system doesn't help to get to like it more.

This is not the best medium to have a serious discussion, anyway.\n\n>First, You are putting a lot of weight on these so called \"acquaintances\". Try some research - you can clearly see that English Grammar is taught in schools in Britain, it's part of a new curriculum they started in 2015.\n\nYou really must be kidding. So I'm wrong since it's part of the curriculum since, uh, two years?\n\nTo be honest, the long discussions about language have happened a while ago, I guess it's been almost a decade ago. What I say isn't about the current snapshot of the world, it was about people who were grown up there, and speak English as their first language; and these people were all well educated and several magnitudes more fluent and knowledgeable than my poor self. Advising me to research isn't quite fair: I am in no position to know what's been changed recently, and I have no means to research the linguistical knowledge of the population of the age group 30-99. You state that real grammar have been taught for the last 40+ years, I have heard it the other way, and I have no means to prove me right or you wrong. \n\n> I doubt this very much. I think you are lying so hard about this.\nOh that's nice. What's the point arguing with a _liar_, then, friend? (Just for the record: I am not.)\n\n> And I do hope you aren't talking about some tense in another language that doesn't exist in English (not all languages have the same tenses).\nNo. I look up the terminus technicus, stand by.\nThanks for waiting. So it's called \"verb tense\", and there are stuff like \"future perfect continuous\" or \"conditional tenses\".  Something like this: https://www.ef.com/english-resources/english-grammar/verbs/\n\n> I also hope that you aren't talking about them not knowing the technical terms of these tenses.\nNo, that would be unfair. \n\n>Sorry if I don't believe you considering the main mistakes in your English have been how you construct verb phrases/tenses.\nAs this one surely was. I already tried to mention that my grammar is crap and I ain't no native speaker, and my level of English is absolutely not the best possible, and I also make quite a few typos and lazy to read it over and fix. It doesn't change my _knowledge_ though, and since I am pretty interested in linguistics for the last few decades we may say that I have some vague ideas what I am talking about. \n\nWhat languages do *you* speak? On what level?\n\n> What is really pissing me off is how you are looking down on native English speakers because, as you suppose, they don't learn grammar in schools. \nYou are very mistaken here, since this is really far from my opinion. I really love to hear British speakers (and I don't mean TV talking heads but simple, everyday British/English people) since they use the language a way I really like. They haven't got much knowledge about the grammar and the grammatical rules but that doesn't influence their absolutely proper language usage. My opinion is not about their inferiority or superiority, but about the language as being one running much more uncontrolled than lots of other languages around, where people are taught in elementary schools the basic rules and they are aware (on some subconscious level) that there are rules and they kind of keep them working, while English feels like mutating much more than it'd be optimal. This is just a feeling from an outsider, I really cannot even tell you why I have this feeling.\n\n> Obviously they have learned the grammar otherwise they would not know how to speak the language. \nThis is, my friend, a total bullshit. I speak languages without knowing the grammatical rules, just based on the patterns I've learned and the phrases people most often use. Obviously grammar stick after a while, but not as a science but an instinctional mindset. Most of the speakers probably don't have the faintest idea about linguistics as a science, and its rules or definitions. (Again, this is not my peer-reviewed PhD but my opinion.)\n\n>It seems you are also making the assumption that learning grammar in schools is actually effective/useful. \nYes.\n\n>However, there have been research studies that say otherwise.\nOtherwise? You learn grammar and you start speaking worse? Can I doubt this \"proof\" please?\n\n> Also, I'm not completely sure if you know what grammar actually is. \nObviously. You seem to be a pretty unsure person.\n\n> The grammar of a language encompasses the majority of the language, including its sounds (Phonology), word-structure/building (Morphology), word-order/sentence-structure (Syntax), word-meanings (Semantics), and everything else (Pragmatics).\nMy original comments were, if you're into scientifical linguistics, about phonology, and this debate was about morphology, morphophonology, syntax and orthography (in case of Chinese). But even if these are all so nice words, I would rather prefer to talk about \"grammar\", and let the context sort out what I mean. \n\nAs closing: don't act like a minority and don't get offended. I either think you're all shit or think that you're all just humans like me. Either case it's really pointless to prove you're not something you aren't.

It obviously doesn't make one a liar, and vice versa.)\n\n> Did I ignore it.\nAbsofuckinglutely. You noticed it then ignored in the next moment.

Then you would not see racist comments like mine (and the world would actually be a better place).\n\nYou are narrow-minded, and I mean it literally. \"Nigger\" is a US term and a US specific racism, and it is meaningless outside that huge shithole. You believe that your racism is universal and that it does have a point, while it never does, really. Skin color [or any kind of hereditary origin, really] does not relate to any human ability or attribute, and it's usually only good for the really simple minded people who cannot comprehend any complex problem. Skin color is damn visible, and simple, doesn't quite require any serious brain activity to decide whether one is a member of the hated group or not.\n\nYou may even meant native people versus foreigners, but it would be similarly stupid since \"white\" people are the foreigners and indians are the natives, so logically white people should get the fuck outta America, north and south both.\n\nIn reality though crime is usually committed by all kinds of races, and it is connected to economical and social factors; some of these factors are strongly depend on \"white\" people,  so when you think \"niggers\" are the problem in fact it's the opposite: _you_ are the problem, since their problems root in your activities (or lack of).\n\nBut I do not believe in racist people listening to reason, so just thinking out loud for now. As for me, I would prefer shooting 5000 supremacists to shooting many millions of black people. Much more economical, you see. And much smaller price to pay for the world well being. :-]",

That's been fine until after the war ended and the guns did not quite return to the, um, donors. They have been kept, and a shitload of them. And they were used to make acts to make it possible to buy even more.  In the end they possibly owned more than the police and military together. And it took some 50+ years to slowly get rid of the people with guns. \n\nThe US is full with guns and if they simply make them illegal they would possibly start entering the black market, make loads of money which could be used to buy even more, just the same as it happens with drugs. I'd say they should be strictly registered first, and repeated that it would not make them illegal; and after a few years with the registry they could be restricted and if someone cannot show the registered stuff they could get fined, go to jail or shot on site, I don't quite care. But obviously only after gun-wielding politicians and their rich cronies were all gone.",

Censorship would be literally bleeping out the word faggot. Forcing political correctness would be censorship.\n\nI believe the problem is mixing these up, or maybe that different people connect different meaning to the same word, and plenty of people mean \"censorship\" when say \"PC\". \n\nBut along your examples, what do you think when you are forced to say \"homosexual person\", since \"gay\" implies men and it is slang; and what when someone figures it would be incorrect to say \"homosexual\" since it acquired just the same negative connotations as \"faggots\" and \"gays\" and you have to use \"sexually different preferenced person\", until it gets used in the real world, acquire connotations then you can move on a longer, more complex and more meaningless phrase? \n\nA lovely example are gypsies and Eastern Europe; the word gypsy have all the context of wandering, poor, sometimes petty criminal people, with specific prejudice applied, so the PC leaders thought let's play on language and call the gypsies \"roma\" (or, even \"minorities\", in a context where there is only one minority and that's the gypsies). Small problem though: almost one third of them originates from an absolutely different tribe (or whatever the PC word) and they speak a different language and they would never call themselves roma since those are their, um, kind of opposites (if not enemies). So, PC people make 2/3 gypsies satisfied and 1/3 angry. And even that only for a few years, maybe decades, when the words acquire the __same__ connotation, since these are associated with the __concept__ behind the words and not just to the words themselves. In the end we have a new, PC phrase meaning just the same, except that it could be used as it wasn't. \n\nIt's the same as writing \"f---- you you a------!\" where I know what it means, you know what it means and possibly everyone else know what it means, and we still all play PC. And it's not \"censorship\" as in removing content by a __third party__, it's been removed collectively in the name of PC.\n\n_update:_ by the way \"forcing\"; it is possible to create an environment of __fear__ or __pressure__ where people are afraid not to censor out or replace words. They bleep out their own words. Is that censorship? Where's the thin line?",

If the system is **good** enough, if it's supported on a wide range of platforms, if it offers services and features to a wide range of people then people may start migrate over.\n\nI have seen it several times. We had a national social network, everyone was on, then they started to pump advertisments in, and I mean everywhere, like 15+ flashing quarter screen picture, and people wondered where to go, and the people with _most_ friends moved over to facebook and pulled the others through, and that was the end of the local one. Took no more than a year.\n\nIf diaspora would work flawlessly and if it were offering great services people would move over. But it's often crappy, unreliable, and the offerings are negligible. Being technically advanced is almost no factor for the average people. They would send the picture of their genitalia in open public, believing only the blonde next door see it. But if they can draw a hat on their dick they're happy. It's great. Image manipulation, mmmmh! *facepalm*",
