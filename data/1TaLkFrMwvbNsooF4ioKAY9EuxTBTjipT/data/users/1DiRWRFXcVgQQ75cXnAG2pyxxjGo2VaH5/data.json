			"body": "Zeronet is an amazing project. However, it isn't exactly built with total anonymity/privacy in mind.\n\nSome ideas I've been thinking about...\n\nProblems:\n\n* ZeroID is a centralized service, you can host your own instance, but then people have to use it.\n* ZeroIDs cannot be deleted or renamed.\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n* A) Create a Zite with shared/throwaway ZeroID. Users will upload their private keys (not for security obviously, just for throwaway accounts), and share them with others to use. The more people that use them, the greater the anonymity (mixing principle).\n* B) Get username cloaks/delete options built into ZeroNet\n\n---\n\nProblems:\n* WebGL, Angular JS, and other modern javascript \"features\" are very bad for anonymity due to their vast browser fingerprinting capabilities\n\n* Hotlinking to images, clearnet pages, and even CloudFlare has already been occurring on some ZeroNet zites. \n\nPossible solutions:\n\n* A) Convince zites not to use aggressive javascript where it's not needed, and not to host content outside of ZeroNet\n\n* B) Create a \"content-filter\" for ZeroNet the blocks aggressive APIs and any outbound connections that are not to 127.0.0.1:43110 for security reasons.\n\nProblems:\n\n* Zeronet's \"GeoIP database\" (found in the sidebar menu by swiping the \"zero\" to the left\") shows your exact location even if using Tor on the WebGL earth\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n* Determine if this is in fact an IP leak, and if so get it fixed ASAP. Since --tor mode should not leak IP to clearweb.\n\n----\n\nMight have missed some things, but that's what I've noticed so far. Thoughts?",

Do you have any better ideas that doesn’t involve going back to religious dogma and shaming people for wanting sex?\n\n\nDue to the “one flesh” aspect of marriage, the need for oneness and harmony in marriage, and the lack of any real need for polygamy, it's better to remain monogamous.  In view of the problems it causes (jealousy, strife, contention, broken families, etc.), it is no wonder that polygamy was unknown among the Jews after the Babylonian exile, and monogamy was the rule even among the Greeks and Romans by New Testament times.\n\nThere’s a reason why the government has never permitted relatives to marry, nor upheld the legality of polygamy... Traditional marriage is the naturally and scientifically verifiable familial foundation (defined gender roles: woman/wife/mother-man/husband/father). On what grounds is THIS essential biological/foundational model overridden? Ultimately, “government has a compelling interest in a legal record of procreation (this is further indicated by the doctrine of presumed paternity), and in creating a lasting environment where children will thrive. The fact that one must obtain a court order to divorce and the existence of tax-based incentives for marriage are other effects of the government’s interest in marriage.” A stable and successful nuclear family dynamic has always been the central barometer indicative of a thriving country.",

How about using the democratic process to decide what we have for Thanksgiving dinner? Majority rule determines whether everyone has turkey, or ham, or duck, or capon. Once the vote is taken and, say, turkey wins, everyone is obliged to serve turkey... That’s one important problem with democracy: *It creates an aura of moral legitimacy for acts that would otherwise be considered tyranny.* ~ [Do We Want Democracy](http://capitalismmagazine.com/2002/06/do-we-want-democracy/)\n\n...\n\n> Life and happiness in this life under any political system directly depend upon how much our individuality (versus the crowd) is retained and to what extent we throw off manipulated illusions...\n>\n> The more one’s mind is immersed into the crowd, of course, the more one loses his individuality and independence of thought. The more we become a part of the crowd, the more dependent we become on authority. And the more dependent we become, the more defensive we are when presented with new information contrary to “conventional wisdom.” Simply stated, the crowd syndrome inoculates us against reality...\n>\n> By virtue of the fact that the elite (government and the banksters) has the power to create money, all wealth flows away from the producers to the nonproducers. Modern money (nonsubstance) expropriates wealth. Translated, this simply means that one class of people perpetually steals from the other class. This makes them natural enemies. ~ [Personal Liberty](https://personalliberty.com/the-politicians-and-the-manipulated-crowd/)",

It has been reported that Edison failed over 6,000 times before perfecting the first electric light bulb.\n>\n>\n> On one occasion a young journalist challenged Edison saying to him, \"Mr. Edison, why do you keep trying to make light by using electricity when you have failed so many times? Don't you know that gas lights are with us to stay?\"\n>\n>\n> To this Edison replied, **\"Young man, don't you realize that I have not failed but have successfully discovered six thousand ways that won't work!\"**\n>\n>\n> Because Edison believed an electric light was possible, he refused to give up. He tried countless types of material in his search for a filament that would work. He sent men to China, Japan, South America, Asia, Jamaica, Ceylon and Burma to search for fibers to test in his laboratory--all to no avail.\n>\n>\n> On October 21, 1879, after thirteen months of repeated failures, Edison finally succeeded in finding a filament that would work. While experimenting the thought came to him, \"Why not try a carbonized cotton fibre?\"\n>\n>\n> After going through two spools of cotton, he eventually perfected a strand only to break it while trying to place it in a glass tube. He refused to give up and persevered with this idea for two more days and nights without sleep. Finally he succeeded in placing a carbonized thread into a vacuum-sealed bulb! Eureka! It worked.\n>\n> **Perseverance pays.**",
