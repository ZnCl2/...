			"title": "Biography of Negro 1",
			"body": "'''Biography of Negro 1''' modified from Marcus family (modified from Chen She family).\n\n==Content==\n\nNegro 1, is a native of New York, nicknamed A. Negro 2, is a native of District 2 of New York, nicknamed B. After graduating from high school, the black 1 worked in a department store. One day, he sighed and said to other employees: \"If anyone gets rich first, don't forget to get rich later.\" Other employees laughed at him: \"We are all workers, how can we be rich? What?\" Negro 1 sighed: \"How does the red-winged blackbird know the ambition of the bald eagle?\"\n\nIn 2020, the earth's new crown pneumonia pandemic. Hundreds of black people crowded in the slums of New York's 3rd District. Black 1 and Black 2 were their community leaders. Because of the epidemic, the places where part-time jobs are closed, there is no money to pay the rent, and the landlord will be rushed to the street if they cannot pay the rent. Black 1 and Black 2 posted on the Internet: \"Now if you start to work, you will die of illness, and you will starve to death if you don't go to work. It's all death. You die for the American people, can you?\"\n\nNegro 1 said: \"The American people have endured the oppression of the deep government for a long time. I heard that the current Trump administration came to power by deceit, which is unpopular. The former President Obama and Senator Sanders are good people, and the people say they are Very wise. Some people say they are capitalist reformers, and some people say they are socialists. Today we call on the people in the name of the Democratic Left, and there must be many people responding.” Black 2 thinks Black 1 is right. Just go to the community pastor. The community pastor knew their purpose and said, \"Your method is feasible. But have you asked God?\" Black 1 was very happy and said, \"This is for us to get some liberation theology first.\" So they just said Posting: \"Jesus is black\", and let Negro 2 rap in the alley on the side of the street. The lyrics are \"It is not that the people are afraid of the deep government, but the deep government is afraid of the people.\" The deep-seated government of the United States was very frightened and has been pretending to observe two people.\n\nBlack 1 and Black 2 have many online fans. One day Trump was ruling the country on the Internet again, and they went to match Trump’s fans. Some Sichuan fans were very angry, and they took out the banner of the Southern Slave State Alliance and ultra-nationalism and called for America to be great again. Black 1 and Blacks 2 Just hang up their posts and these Sichuan fans will die socially. So the two people convened the anti-extremist nationalist alliance and said: \"Now Trump wants to make the United States great again, that is, whether we choose to starve to death at work or to die at work. If the producer can live, even if he can't live, he will have to do great things. To be famous, everything in the United States is created by the producers. Is the authority of the deep government approved by the majority of producers?\" Everyone said, \"We will do it with you!\" So they pretended that they were helping the Democratic left in the 2020 election. Down with Trump, uprising in the state 1. In the beginning, only a few people in the communities were in uprising, and now the whole United States is in uprising.\n\n[[Category: Politics]]",
