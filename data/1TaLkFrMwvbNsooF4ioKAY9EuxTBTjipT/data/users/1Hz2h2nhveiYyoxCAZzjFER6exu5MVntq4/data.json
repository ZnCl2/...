Whatever. It's the first poster that has motivated me to figure out how to block/ignore users.",

In 2014, they were given the chance to leave the UK, and chose to stay because a majority of them realized that being the bitches of the English is better than being independent nobodies. \n\nScottish women don't need independence. They need thick English cock and a load of English baby batter in their wombs. Rule, Britannia, rule!",
