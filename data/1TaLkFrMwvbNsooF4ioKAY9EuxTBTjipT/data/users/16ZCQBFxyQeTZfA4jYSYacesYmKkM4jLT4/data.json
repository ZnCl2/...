			"body": "http://127.0.0.1:43110/1DoxbinuaNEdDagSpPmbCEkKHB1FW9RzzJ/\n\nFor those of you who don't know the history of Doxbin, here's a small sum-up: \n\n- First Doxbin was created a few years ago, it was a website where one could post a dox of someone. \n\n- A Dox is a gathering of informations about someone. It is mostly publised against the doxed person's will. It has various uses, one being the infamous 4chan pizza bombing. \n\n- The website was closed, iirc it was raided. \n\n- We later have a new Doxbin on the DarkNet. Raided again. \n\n- We, again later, got a new Doxbin on the clearnet, of course heavily moderated, not much you can do with it. \n\nAnd now there's a DoxBin on ZeroNet. Spams will be deleted but other than that as long as users that wanna post a dox containing weird stuff post it in the \"Weird\" category, everything should go fine. Also, AFAIK, it's the first DoxBin to allow publishing files, such as images / videos. \n\nI hope it will be well received, if there's any question/request/discussion needed, don't hesitate to ask in this thread. \n\n- UnVengeurParmiDAutres, uvpda@zeroid.bit.",

Why don't you post some?\n\nThat's true, I got a dump of the old doxbin, but their picture-less. I'll see if I post them. \n\n> [kaffie](#comment_841_1NWh3WAty57FH8at1WtrZigMrdhrDkuPzh): doxxing is kinda fucked up. And I say this as someone who pushes for big brother skynet-style surveillance. Expose/share data, but safety through privacy is currently pretty important.\n\nI agree, it's fucked up, but every legit Doxbin was taken down. This project is a part of the fight to make Internet remain undestroyable. IMO It'd still be cool to see some doxes to see the project running, tho.",
