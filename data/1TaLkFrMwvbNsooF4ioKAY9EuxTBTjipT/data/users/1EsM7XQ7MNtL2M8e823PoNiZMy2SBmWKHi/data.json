			"body": "Im net to 0net and also new to hosting a website and have zero programing skills at that. 0net attracted me to if for the ease of creating my own website, and a decentralized one at that!! I did a quick clone of a 0chat to see how it all worked and it wants me to open port 17693 on my router... My concern is that by doing this then hackers can get in through my site.\n\nIs this concern correct? Or is it not the case due to 0net being decentralized??",

In the 1970s Sociologist Patricia Bidol defined it in a book \"Prejudice plus power = Racism\".  [...]\n\nRite on. Based off what you said, i would have to say that the white man is totally being discriminated. If you think about it many many white Americans live in areas with little to no blacks therefore the out of sight out of mind takes over and those people dont know or really care... but black take everything national straight to the new where they end up sparking every other black to rise up simply because its another black saying it... I feel this is wrong... Or am i really a racist at this point??",

[...]\n\nnaw all i did was come into the office after a delivery and they were all talking. I just mind my own business and then all of a sudden this black guy points to me and out rite says \"your a racist\" i looked at him like um ok why? This other black guy started to chime in saying yeah he is. I looked at him, said. Im not a racist, what makes you say that? he replied \"your white, so your automatically a racist and started laughing\" see my problem with this is that in America this can lead to serious problems for me. And its next to impossible to speak against is because they will just turn it around and use it to prove that i am one... I fear that if something is not done about this, then it will lead to a nasty future where the whites are not persecuted, and ultimately discriminated against... Now again i dont think im a racist but since this was about a week ago now, i have to say im feeling a little PISSED!!",

				"body": "This is a great topic!! Im not a coder and wish i was just to be able to participate in what i see at the best thing to happen since the internet release!! Playing around on 0net reminds me of being 7 years old again when the internet was brand new to most people. Now with 0net i have the same sense of complete freedom that i had when i was 7 before google, comcast, and other big corps ruined it with control and allowing government access... This whole project is exactly what the WORLD needs the internet to be... DECENTRALIZED and free of censorship and control!! I did not know all this posted in this topic but im glad i read it...\n\nYou had me at \"SUPER NET\" with 0net being what it is, it only makes sense to make the whole thing truly decentralized including people able to control it!! I vote it becomes completely open source, and here's why...\n\nIm a businessman i understand MONEY! I dont know shit for code thats what all of you are for. Because of this i have to believe MONEY is the reason @nofish is holding onto all the control. He's betting on 0net growing quite large and is waiting for a time to start charging for access... I can already see it now. With this being said i MUST refer you @nofish to what a mentor of mine taught me about making REAL WEALTH! \"it's better to take a smaller piece of the pie, and not have to do the work, then it is to take the whole pie and do it all\" This is extremely important to understand... In business you simply CANNOT get to where you want to be without having a team!! The bigger your team is the more MONEY you will make! If you was to work with these dev's that seam to really want to make 0net a \"SUPER NET\" then let the money guide you...\n\nAgain im no coder so idk how you all do things but in a business sense maybe set it up like this if possible.. @nofish keep CEO rights. In order for a new dev to join the mix they much bring value to the table in the form or a MVP (most viable product) aka a ready to deploy update or whatever to the system to improve it. Then that dev is brought in and added to the \"Equity Share\" so when the time comes to charge for access then @nofish gets his fair share and so do the other devs equal amounts divided up among all involved...\n\nOverall when i found Zeronet and then IPFS i knew the same why i knew btc was a good investment in 2010 when i first bought in... I KNOW 0NET AND IPFS WILL CHANGE THE WORLD FOR A VERY LONG TIME!!\n\n@nofish as a self made millionaire (the hard way) i vote that you do this, i would. Partners are a good thing...",
