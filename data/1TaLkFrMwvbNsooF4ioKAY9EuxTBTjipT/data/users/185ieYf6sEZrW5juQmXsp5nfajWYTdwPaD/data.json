The problem of the democracy that you think we live on, is that it does not scale (it didn't work that well in old Greece, imagine in a current state with +100k souls)\n\nWhat happens, democracy is a peoples dream, you get to say yes or no for each law and you have (as individual) the last word. Then what the  governments did in the modern ages was very simple, they replace the meaning of democracy to get you confused. Don't get me wrong, I rather prefer to live in the current system than a democracy, just to give you a hint, a bad actor (like the mafia) would also have a say on something ... and if they want to push their agenda they will .. and I rather prefer to have a system where eventually you can get back to your representative via lobby or on elections.",

This is why you need to be able to have your own beliefs while at the same time work with everyone else.  this is why countries come together to form bodies like the UN, NATO, and BRICS. On a smaller scale, the states in the united states come together to form the united states.  this is why governments exist in the first place.  im not sure what is happening in catalunya most likely because it does not make a good story for the news.  can you explain what is happening please? si es mas facil para ti, hablo espanol.\n\nEasy to explain, it is just the standard pre-dark period of time Spain faces each cycle.\nFirst cycle is during the short first Spanish Republic  11 February 1873 and 29 December 1874 during that short time the federalism idea on Spain spark and some regions ofc Catalan region too, decided to become a country, then it came a military dictatorship and undid everything leading Spain to a restoration of monarchy and back to square one. \nSecond cycle was in the \"recent\" second Republic 1931 to 1939 where the catalan decided to again set the path aside and break with Spain, after that a cruel civil war in Spain lead to Franco's dictatorship and 40 years of repression (btw it was also from within the same catalan too). \nNow after the longest period of peace in Spain, they are showing the true face, dictatorial system based on the will of brainwashed people. \n\nWhen you read the actual history, catalan is always been Spain but they always tried to set themselves apart mostly when Spain lost all its colonies, they subscribe to all the totalitarian ideas from the Nazis to the extreme right anglophone, they come from the idea that they are genetically superior to the rest of the Spain (anglophone extreme right) to that the will of the chosen people (Nazi). They also have an extreme vertical structure where the top decides and the rest follows, and if you try to rebate they simply outcast you.\n\nCurrent status, Catalonia has the highest independence, they even REJECTED more independence from Spain back in the 90s when they offer a new financial system where they will only pay a fee but they govern their own destiny. Now they complain to one of the top 20 democracies of the world of being totalitarian, but the joke comes of the referendum they voted, they technically voted for dropping the current democratic system with their rights and european citineship for a dictatorship, it clearly states in the document that they will reject the supreme court of catalonia and impose its own, selected by the leader of the party. As any person will understand, a democracy won't allow to get dropped and go for a dictatorship.\n\nNow one of the prosper regions of Spain became nothing and a beautiful city like Barcelona is no longer a place to go.",
