Can you tell me where you can read IPs?I'd feel more secure if I could run ZeroNet within Tails, where every connection is made through Tor. However, what is encrypted today may be decipherable in some future, and governments probably log every piece of traffic. Thus I wouldn't trust encryption as a means to achieve secrecy (and don't know what to trust). [...]\n\nI dont know how to specifically read a certain user's ip, but if you go to 127.0.0.1:43110/Stats or whatever your devices ip on where zeronet is running on, you will see a list of peers, sort of like when downloading torrents.
