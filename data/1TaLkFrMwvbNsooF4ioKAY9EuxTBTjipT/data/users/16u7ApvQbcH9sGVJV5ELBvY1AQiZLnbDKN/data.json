			"body": "Hi all.  I would like to introduce the first in-browser WebTorrent based decentralized torrent site: The Offline Bay\nhttps://theofflinebay.org\n\nSearches and results are fully decentralized via a 'database' torrent.\nContains 5 million alive torrents (out of 55 million). The Pirate Bay contains 1.5 million alive torrents for comparison.\nFully downloadable (700 MB) for a fast, portable, and offline version that requires NO installation (.html based).\nSaves downloaded parts of the 'database' torrent in-browser.  The more you search, the faster it becomes.\n\nCons:\nA search with results can use several MB of bandwidth.  This amount of bandwidth makes loading take a few seconds depending on download speed.\nDomain and homepage are centralized.  Both will be decentralized in the future.\nIn development, minor bugs.\n\nFire away with any questions or comments. I don't count torrent-paradise.ml as being decentralized due to IPFS not being supported in most browsers, whereas WebTorrent is supported in all.",

The console is full of errors like this: [...]\n\nThanks for that.  The only way I can see around this problem is to have a separate database torrent (1.4GB) which is only used by TOR and Brave Shields Up users.

The plan is to open source the javascript, along with the torrent/tracker data (over 62 million torrents so far) so others can build their own torrent site from our data.  If there's demand, probably an open source torrent site so anyone can build a fully fledged torrent site easily, which was the original project but I focused on a decentralized site instead.",

I use two trackers at the moment (one hosted by myself) but need to increase that amount for redundancy.\n\nTo test it is working, open another tab and make the same search, or a search that returns the same results and you should upload to yourself.\n\nThe main selling point of this project is that it requires no download, and no special requirements at all. The database is decentralized, meaning the the core data of the site (the torrents) are safe from censorship.  While the domain or host could be targeted, the core data will remain intact, and anyone can easily host the 1MB .html file or share it around (you can save it to your desktop and it will work as normal - you can't do that with any other torrent site).  There is not decentralized updating at the moment, but I will be able to implement this through Web2Web.\n\nThis database has 7 million 'alive' torrents (the pirate bay is around 2 million alive for comparison).  The amount of torrents I'm tracking is 73 million, of which I have searchable titles for roughly 30 million.  So about 3/4 of my torrents are excluded. This database gives even the biggest torrent sites in the world a run for their money.\n\nI would like to introduce a live database that is updated real time (70 million torrents) and have this decentralized database as a backup.  The only reason I haven't so far is because I need to filter out cp in real-time, but I'm working on that issue.",

I'd rather just host the .html file using GitHub pages/Cloudflare and have no server at all.\n\nFor anonymity you can download the offline version, which I (indefinitely) no longer support, as it doesn't use any internet.",

The central server is only helped with seeds when too much users use the service on heavy traffic. If the central server shuts down, the entire service shuts down slowly. Where users do not  seed the full content, just parts of them, none of the services there decentralized. Web torrent are not a solution to that to the users 100% keep online the content without a central non-stop running server.\n\nThe database is decentralized.  It relies on people like yourself to host the database torrent in a WebTorrent supported client such as WebTorrent Desktop or BiglyBT. Currently there are about 3-4 WebTorrent seeders of the database in torrent clients (not browser).\nYou can find more information and the database torrent download link on the 'Search' page at theofflinebay.org (next to 'About Us').  I will make this more obvious on the website next update. Thanks for the feedback.",

Maybe the offline version of the site and DB seeding should be better promoted, so noob people know what to do when the site is not working.\n\nThe standalone version (no internet required) is 700MB and the P2P database (WebTorrent) is 2.2GB.\nThe infohash of the standalone version is  f87e7d05996e5cc13d6d0246cc0939f678a81865  so just download it in any torrent client and then open  '_The Offline Bay' (.html) within the downloaded torrent.\nI'll improve clarity next update.

(yes, it goes via DHT, so wss not needed)\n\nYes you're right about that.\nYes, it is a cold backup and it will not have the latest torrents or peer counts, but still useful to find content as older popular torrents usually remain popular.  I update it every so often, and that requires people to download the new database torrent. (They can continue using the old version if they like)\n\nThere are two versions of the website, P2P and Offline. I understand it is not very clear at the moment, I will address this in the next update.\n\nThe 2.2GB database torrent is for the P2P version only.  This can be access via theofflinebay.org or via a locally saved .html copy of theofflinebay.org. To save this .html file on your computer, go to theofflinebay.org and:\n1) right click\n2) save page as\n3) save as type: 'Web Page, HTML only'\n\nThe 700MB offline version is completely standalone using 7,125 files to store the database.
