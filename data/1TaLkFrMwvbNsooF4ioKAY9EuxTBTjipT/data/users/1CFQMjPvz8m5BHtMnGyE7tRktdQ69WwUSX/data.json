And I already gave a pretty fair example of how environmental costs are handled in a free society. People want clean air, people want clean water, people don't want mercury and coal dust dumped in their back yards, and if you privatize these costs with DROs, then suddenly you have people spending money on protecting the environment, and that money is invested in R&D and infrastructure to limit environmental damages; and the companies with the best R&D divisions sell the best technology to other firms and so on.I don't know what you do for a living, I don't want to make any presuppositions, but I do think that people who don't work natural resource management have been painted an inaccurate picture of how procurement companies function. I manage forests and timber/fiber plantations, and here in the southeastern United States, 95% of forested land is privately owned, it is productive, well kept, and sustainably managed because people harvest the wood on it. You hire timber cruisers to assess the property, some trees are taken for lumber, others are left to regrow the forest. Meanwhile the government managed land out west is Hell--theirs is used more for grazing than forestry of course but compare the value of an acre of government land set aside for ranchers to graze cattle on to an acre of privately managed land, it's night and day. [...]\n\nThanks for a response which demonstrates you actually know what you're talking about. One of the problems of our current electoral system is that your opinion on this topic only carries as much weight as the next brainwashed group-thinker. It's not granular so that those in the know get to determine how an industry e.g. timber, is properly managed. Instead people look for one 'dear leader' who can take all the responsibility and do all the thinking for them (and end up just telling the ignorant what they want to hear). The best way I'm aware of to make that transition is to abandon traditional politics as we know it altogether and allow our spending to do the 'talking'. If some of the contributors here had to put their money where their mouth is, it wouldn't be long before they had very little currency left to do any damage with their shallow and irrelevant thinking.

It's weakness is the ideas that form the basis for it's existence. The idea that you somehow formed a contract with it to be governed by it. The idea that it can manage economic affairs better than people left to freely negotiate their own contracts. The idea that you cannot be secure without it. The idea that it is the ultimate authority. Not having a good grasp of these topics and making them more widely understood is what's brought us to this. That they now have a microphone embedded in every corner of our households is just a nasty symptom. A 'subversive' conversation in your house is not so much of a problem if there are millions of 'subversive' conversations taking place every minute of the day. Until 'want to get rid of Government altogether' and phrases like it become an everyday expression, it'll stand out like a flagpole among all the conversations about football, Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. There will be tacit support for your being removed from the 'civilized' World e.g. Assange. Until people understand why we have to get rid of Government itself they'll continue to  believe 'why should I care, I do nothing wrong'.

They often conflate the unlikely possibility of being shot by a psychopath (especially if you're armed) with the very real possibility of being shot by the State (which is actually the same thing). HK is going to show us what globalization is really all about. I hope I'm wrong.\n\n'Hong Kong is more an asset than a threat for the Chinese'\nRight now HK is a political liability for China. They will happily torch the place to demonstrate to their own people the futility of resistance.
