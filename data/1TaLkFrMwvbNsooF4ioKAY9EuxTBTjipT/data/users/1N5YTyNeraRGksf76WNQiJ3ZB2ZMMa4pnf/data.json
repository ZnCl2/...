			"body": "Hey Guys,\nWho is better at this topic can help me out? My question is, I want to support Zeronet main site and my site to seed them from a VPS, but not sure how to open up the Zeronet on linux (CentOS) where I have only a console and no UI..? Is that possible? And if yes how? Because to seed a website I have to open it in my browser right? But how can I open it if I have only a console available? Might be a stupid question, I'm just a beginner with linux console(s). \nThank you!",

[...]\n\nSorry for the late answer, I just realised I didn't answer..\nYes, of course I'm running the official latest version of ZN.\nTOR was disabled because if I select Always, my NZ not working still, so either I select Enabled or Disabled but not Always. Not sure what the issue is, always just the same errors which I pasted before... nothing really special I think or maybe I'm missing out on something idk. And as far as I know TOR should be properly implemented in the latest version. Or do I have to install anything manually?\n\"In order to load Syncronite trackers, you have to visit that zite and load it.\" - Yes, of course I knew that but at the beginning nothing was loading/opening.. after the main site loaded.. and now it looks like this: https://i.ibb.co/RP1Fg9d/zn.jpg Still not the best because of fewer trackers but at least is working now.\nThe server is in Germany.\n\"Good to see someone who not give up and make effort to run ZN..\" - Yes, It's been a while I'm here and I really like the idea and the platform and everything and I really don't want this project to die and I wish more ppl to join.

So I didn't knew that I have to install TOR manually :D Sorry, I know is so lame but I'm just learning linux and stuff like that :)\nSo then I managed to install TOR.. but then it was still not ok something, so some debug error fixing and guide on ZN Docs and I made it work so this is what my console says: https://i.ibb.co/Qv7mJL0/s1.png\nBut there is an issue, it says I have to upgrade.. but I got much more trackers working (looks the same as on my win) as before and now it shows TOR Connected (250 OK), you can check here: https://i.ibb.co/5Yv9fD0/s2.png\nSo now I can say I think is working ookaayy.. but :D fuck.. should I upgrade to V3.. Idk again how :D and as I heard just a  few ppl on V3 and no trackers or something like that and they changed back to V2..",
