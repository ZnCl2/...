			"body": "美国训练出来的网特伎俩 \n\n1、不论什么新闻，跟帖顶的最多的，转的最多的，绝不是和新闻有关的，基本上都是一些其它方面无关的负面消息。\n2、要充分利用中国的社会矛盾刺激网民的情绪，越激烈越好，使网民一盘散沙，内斗相互残杀窝里反，并将矛头引向政治制度，引向国家分裂3、对于任何中国的决策、行动、政策，都要煽动网民与之唱反调，增大其施政难度。\n4、对于中国取得的任何成就，哪怕是一点点进步，也要极力贬低，最大限度地打击网民的对国家的信心。\n5、要扳倒中国，首先要摧毁中国人的信仰、摧毁中国文化。所以美狗们尽量贬低中华民族，打击民族自尊心，避免民族主义情绪的形成。让中国人自虐、自我丑化，从而证明中国人是劣等民族、无法与欧美抗衡。\n6、尽量用消极、自暴自弃的态度去影响中国网民，使之看不到任何希望。比如鼓吹“极端个人主义”、“人不为己天诛地灭”，来抵制“正能量”。\n7、在剥夺中国网民希望的基础上，极力鼓吹美国，使中国网民渐渐把希望寄托于美国，从而达到影响和渗透的目的。\n8、对于任何正面、积极的言论都要予以打击，扣上奴才的帽子，将其与普通网民割裂，消弱其言论的影响力。\n9、冒充中国人，有组织地对于中国的社会矛盾和黑暗面无限放大，进而抨击政府，降低其公信力。\n10、不断转移话题、不停掀起地域攻击、挑起民族矛盾，进而达到分化、分裂中国之目的。\n11、造谣生事，编造些子虚乌有或者道听途说的消息作为自己的论据，妖魔化别的国家和中国。\n12尽量利用民族问题发动攻势，挑动大陆各民族矛盾，对有关民族事件进行夸大、火上浇油。\n13由于中国的老百姓容易迷信名人，美狗利用名人语录来阐述自己的观点，必要时也可以修改或杜撰一些名人语录，妖言惑众。\n14美狗们充分利用QQ、短信等手段，发展队伍，特别是那些生活不如意者、被处分、判刑者，很容易被美狗煽动加入它们的行列。\n一、美分党的基本逻辑： \n　　不分黑白，中国政府说什么都是错的，做什么都是错的！ \n二、基本手段 \n　　1、制造民众与民众、民众和政府对立。时常制造一些话题，让他们的人民公开讨论，在他们的潜意识里种下分裂的种子。特别要在他们的少数民族里找机会，分裂他们的地区，分裂他们的民族，分裂他们的感情，在他们之间制造仇恨。 \n　　2、丑化他们的领导、他们的政府。我们的记者应该找机会采访他们，然后组织他们自己的言辞来攻击他们。强调执政党的腐败、堕落与无能，一定要引发他们的人民对自己政府的信任危机。 \n　　3、大力宣扬美式民主。一有机会，不管是大是小，有形无形，就要抓紧发动民主运动，无论在什么场合，什么情况下，我们都要不断地对他们的政府要求民主和人权，对他们的人民宣传他们的民主和人权受到无耻的压抑。只要我们每一个人都不断地说同样的话，他们的人民就会怀疑直至相信我们说的是真理。 \n　　4、毁灭他们民族的自尊心。让他们的人民（特别是青年人）鄙视自己的民族，自己的祖国，让他们意识到自己的民族有不可修正的劣根性。\n【对付政府的好办法4——片面夸大A】尽管凡事都有利弊，每一个政策都是权衡利弊的结果，但我们要揪住不利的一面不放，如果弊端太小就无限夸大，上纲上线。≈≈注意：尽量避免美国政府曾经犯过的同样错误，不然就搬起石头砸自己的脚了。 \n　　【对付政府的好办法4——片面夸大B】要抓住共产党历史上犯过的错误，无限夸大，上纲上线，集中刷帖，给老百姓造成共产党只干过坏事的印象，让老百姓忘记共产党带领他们走向复兴这件最重要的功绩。≈≈注意：尽量避免美国政府曾经犯过的同样错误，不然就搬起石头砸自己的脚了。\n【对付政府的好办法5——断章取义】如通读全文的意思是：M国想让中国死很多人，以此制造恐慌，但是我们能做到死不了几个，不会陷入恐慌，M国鬼子及代理人做梦去吧！——那我们就截取其中一句，“死不了几个”，歪曲他的意思，并指责他反人类！——本条精华：歪曲别人的思想，自己批判自己！\n",

Use go-ipfs first.\n  - [ ] For compatibility, implement all existing APIs\n  - [ ] Plugin system, and put new features here\n    - [ ] Plugin: Store/Import/Export peers (Installed by default, new peers written every download)\n    - [ ] Plugin: Peer search, Ask other peers search something for you (Installed by default)\n    - [ ] Plugin market, a index site. List of submitted plugins\n- [ ] Hybrid nodes by running both protocols\nSame as [webtorrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent)\n- [ ] Desktop/Mobile clients, dedicated for some features.\n  - [ ] a. Support only upload and download, easy to use\n- [ ] Distributed search engine\n  If we want it grow bigger, we still need search engine.\n  Some nodes in the network with public IP can become crawler node, and others can backup the data.\n  This is not fully decentralized, but much more useful\n\n## Sandbox\n\nZeroNet uses iframe to separate origins, butit sometimes makes development inconvenient.\n\nSo, for IPZN, except iframe way doing that, we can write a browser plugin.\n\n### Embeddable site (e.g. disqus)\n\nThat's easy, just set a cors which allows accessing of all sites\n\n## Plugin\n\nWe have two levels of Apps.\n\n- Plugin\n- Sites\n\nA plugin can be anything executable.\n\nTherefore, we need **a system verifying plugins**\n\n## Anti-spam\n\n- Blocklist\n  Change on API: Really rejecting blocked users content (Stop after receiving metadata)\n- **Conditions set in site configuration**, e.g. drop message from user a if too frequently\n  Verify the signature first, then check if it matches the condition.\n\n## User content\n\nThe significant difference between ZeroNet and IPFS is user content.\n\nHow ZeroNet do:\n- When you publish your content, it signs and send it to known peers\n\nWe will make changes:\n- To be efficient, we can **send meta data of user cotent**, then other peers check the anti-spam rules and determine if it should receive it.\n\n## ID system\n\nID system is to connect username and publickey, and sometimes it can be used to anti spam.\n\nUnfortunately, ID system will be a single point failure of ZeroNet.\n\nSo, we should **allow usage without an ID**.\n\n### Domain system\n\nID system is similar to Domain system, also a touchy problem.\n\n- Namecoin costs a lot of space\n- Cache of Namecoin looks silly\n- DNS network isn't decentralized\n\nAddtional domain systems can be added by plugins.\n\n## Desktop/mobile clients\n\nBT is still the most popular p2p software, why ?\n\nSince IPFS is too difficult to use for users, the first one we should develop is download/upload client.\n\n### Download/Upload client\n\nSupport both IPFS and IPZN links.",
