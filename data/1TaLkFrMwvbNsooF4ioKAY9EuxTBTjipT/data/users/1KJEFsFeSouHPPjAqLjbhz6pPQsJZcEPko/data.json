Maybe we can call it ZeroTalkFriendly, ZeroTalkGeek, or something.  I miss the atmosphere we had here a month ago.  I know there are some small zites still around that haven't been tainted but nothing where all the original ZeroNet people go.  I hate the idea of moderation, but maybe it would be worth it on just one ZeroTalk clone to screen out the 8Chan people who just won't behave.\n\nIf you don't like ZeroNet and its 8chan like nature then either learn to accept that as part of the culture or go back to the surface web.",
