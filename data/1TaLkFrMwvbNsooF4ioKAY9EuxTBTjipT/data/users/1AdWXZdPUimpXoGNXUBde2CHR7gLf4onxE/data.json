After six months on the ground I'm thrilled to present #Borderless, the biggest & most comprehensive documentary ever made on the European border crisis. I want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has made this possible & am so proud to release the movie totally free! It has been a long, painstaking journey and I truly believe now, we have created something incredible that will help shine a light on such an important issue. I want to make sure as many people are able to see this as possible, so again, we have made Borderless completely free to watch. \n\nPlease share this important documentary with your friends, your family and coworkers - you might be surprised! If you enjoyed the movie and would like to tip the creators we would appreciate that as there was no profit made.

Its really all about his tweets over there anyway. Anyone who is more popular than he is gets a ban. Seriously that's what it looks like to me. Only time will tell on this one.",

I only had maybe 30 followers on my personal twitter account, probably less, but some of my twitter-gems did reach larger crowds (nothing that'd put me in any big-league range, honestly... if I saw a tweet of mine make it to the epic scale of 2000-3000 viewers it already gave me delusions of grandure... heh... meanwhile my 17 year old nephew has tens of thousands following his tweets about his shitty unpacking video's on youtube)I'll be laughing my ass off when eventually Jack has a brainfart and bans himself, thinking that account is getting too close to his own \"popularity\". The self-inflicted butthurt will be huge that day.\n\nJakko Dorcey sets the twitter narrative of the LibTards and he tells his little SJW admins to go out and ban anyone who is not a Communist or who does not worship Xi Jinping from China. Oh and you have to be muslim as well. Twitter is a total joke. People get banned for absolutely no reason at all. So why would anyone want to be posting anything on a Nazi site like that. Maybe some day I will get an account and troll the hell out of everyone but its such a waste of time with all the bots there as well.",

Already now ZeroNet has perfect capabilities. It is necessary to define flawless functions and promote it. Time will show what functions in zeronet are needed. Nobody would know, let's say BitTorrent, if their creators would seek best possible functionality, universality or some other perfectionistic features to the end of time.What about web browsers. They face severe concurrence, and should be interested in adding new features. Why not ZeroNet? Let's say possibility for every user to create desk-board, with public links, personal information, blog and share it with other browser (and zeronet) users, friends. That would be just simple ZeroNet site. Just a little bit cooperation. Creating user friendly stile blog is not a big deal.Maybe it is not the best offer, and somebody else can offer the better one, but I think promoting is a good offer.\n\nZeronet looks like it would be perfect for News and news leakers.

And in a decentralized web nothing can be centralized. That is impossible.Linux has many problems with all of the forks. Ubuntu itself has coding problems. And Ubuntu itself deleted many old drivers. What happens now? Every distro, coming from ubuntu, has the same problems to solve. That is a bad way. If you like to see a smooth system, give a look to OpenBSD, which is small and fast (server). Actually there are too many different Linux systems on the market. Many users are going to the BSD's because of less forks. I went away from all the *buntus and friends many years ago.BTW: The first Desktop environment was the Apple Lisa 1983. Microsoft started 1985 a desktop. All before Linux was born.\n\nWell we have another fork that runs rpm's and that is from fadora, or redhat. There are choices out there. All of the Linux distributions are better than Windows and mac in my view. None are perfect.. Yet!.. The best gui was kde version 3.7 but they killed that one. It was before the time we invented the fork. Linux is a work in progress. New coders of Linux usually end up with a systems that looks like Android. A Linux back end coded like WinBlows. Anymore it seems that we are just coding to just code and not sticking with the things that work the best. Gnome 3 for example is a wasted mouse movement gui dragging program.

Its a good idea but a nightmare to work out the details unless they all used some token system. Kinda like a token ring bot that would distribute the zite number to the exact owners destination because of a key. The token could be fully encrypted and only the owner of that zite could authorize its viewing. Just another night mare idea to code or it may have already been done.

I have seen reports of other ones as well. I do not think that anyone has compiled a complete list yet. The outage range from entire sites being shut down such as facebook was down for 24 + hours and sites like liveleak.com had very crazy drop outs of malformed pages. Unless some were doing server updates the outages seem all to be around the same time line as the NewZeland shooting.

Basically, a zite can request ZeroNet to install a plugin from a zip file - this way we can have zites like KxoNetwork have an \"install\" button. Then ZeroNet will give a notification in the top right asking if you want to install the plugin. Then, if the user clicks \"yes\", ZeroNet will unzip the folder and place it into the plugins folder automatically. [...]\n\nWe also want to include an uninstall option as well.  Just incase a plug in causes problems, or the user does not want to use that program as well. There needs to be a plug in manager of some kind. This would stream line the process and give new users the ability to control there plug in experience. (This Sounds so scripty..)",

I have been working with open source for 20+ years on Linux. I have done allot of debugging and hardware testing. If you think you can make a better browser just do it because they all suck. The hardest thing with coding is knowing when you have hit peak design levels to user usage. I call it perfect code layout design. When you hit that peak fork your next version because it will start to decline in usability. Its a very noticeable problem with open source programs and it needs to be addressed as a development issue. Better known as peak program and then go to a static bug fix. Then next version if you plan one should be either a fork or experimental design. However with browsers it is a constant evolution in bloated code. (Currently)\nAnd please code menu's and not one menu that does everything under the sun but you cant find anything. Best thing is user choice. And avoid at all costs the gnome 3 style.

Would still like to give it a go if i can figure out what's stopping my install.\n\nKeep playing with it and submit bug reports. I rarely use a smart phone anymore. Way to many problems with privacy.",

One only has to look at the IRA and  you find it does pay to bomb and kill people you get invited to the USA to meet the president . some days I wonder how things would have been if my ancestors had been mass murderers and child rapists who knows I could be a king. but I guess they was good white slaves making money for the bankers and the odd lord or knight.\n\nI just had a week of death threats because I ran across the Hidden Linux os inside every computer. I found it quite hilarious. There games don't not intimidate me at all. In fact it just proved the accuracy of the story more. We don't have any privacy. Its to bad because there will be a Zero day event and everything will go out. Just do to some agencies stupidity to force companies to put back doors in hardware.",

All the rest of this anti jew stuff is traced back to the SPLC who are paying people to create global racism for the Rothchilds so they can keep there power. I know there plan, and allot more. I have been a target for well over 40 years. I am far more brutal than they are with forcing power down peoples throats. I never miss a target. And those that have seen my work go insane.",
