Implementing a good objective function is nearly impossible, as the real world is hopelessly complicated, and any AI that's smart enough will typically find a way to trick the objective function into thinking it is doing something good. When it comes to superintellegences, not even humans are good enough objective functions, as the AI will do something you don't like the moment look away, and it will be smart enough that you will never find out.",
