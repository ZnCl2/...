				"body": "Something needs to be done. ZeroNet can't be controlled by nofish only, and we all understand that. Once again, I don't have anything against nofish, the network he created is wonderful and we should remember that.\n\nHowever, we should move forward. Several people (including me) have asked nofish to decentralize the development process somehow, but none of us got a reply.\n\nThis thread aims at finally doing something. It might not be the best solution, and I understand it. That's why I said \"one possible way\". I'm ready to change anything if you think that's the worst way.\n\n---\n\n> [caryoscelus](#comment_165_13oRBYqNeUr6Tvgt4KkAT9FT4XRiKFBjnE): Seriously though, i don't think i need to write out reasons against using vote count to put trust into someone on an anonymous network.\n\nSeveral people have already mentioned that point. I wasn't sure how bad it was, but looks like it's really bad and we should take it into account. What would be the right solution? To make nofish choose someone? That's a great idea?, but you better make nofish notice the problem first. \n\n> [caryoscelus](#comment_165_13oRBYqNeUr6Tvgt4KkAT9FT4XRiKFBjnE): but if we'd have at least a few active developers, things would be much simpler\n\nZeroNet development goes really weirdly. Sometimes it's very fast and new features get implemented every day, and sometimes nothing happens for a whole week. I've went through at least 30 issues and PRs on the GitHub repository. All of them were either ready to be merged or were outdated. If other people could merge & manage issues, we could handle them a lot faster.\n\n> [caryoscelus](#comment_165_13oRBYqNeUr6Tvgt4KkAT9FT4XRiKFBjnE): The problem is largely this (granted, it does not count py3 contributions, but did anything change dramatically?)\n\nZeroNet core contributions aren't the only contributions. Take a look at plugins & zites that people make. Also, most of the code was written once and isn't (actively) changed.\n\n> [kikeslayer](#comment_3_176w2WC17nRS1oHt7HouaKQjfFx2eLuiZy): I checked the ZeroTalk forums for some of the other languages I speak. I didn't see this posted in any of them. Do only English-speakers get to decide the future of this network and the software? Or will they get some information about it in their own languages and an opportunity to vote when we--rightful rulers of ZeroNet by virtue of our knowledge of Ye Glouryous Englisch Langwidge--have hashed out all of the parameters?\n\nThat's because I only speak English and Russian. I wrote this topic in English and then translated it into Russian, it's on a couple of Russian topics now. This English topic is where the voting stuff should have happened.\n\n> [kikeslayer](#comment_3_176w2WC17nRS1oHt7HouaKQjfFx2eLuiZy): If I were nofish, I'd scuttle this idea, at least without serious modification, and frankly, I'd be pretty offended if it were proposed in this manner without having been run by me first. But maybe he'll think it's peachy.\n\nHe's done that already. There were several requests from me and other people. All of them were ignored.\n\n> [pineapples](#comment_76_19XCfah7iuo9zYqk7GoTDXVNp4p5BpEH1T): just clone any of those sites and control it yourself\n\nGood solution. Except one point. How many users will those sites get? ZeroTalk is mentioned everywhere, ZeroHello & ZeroUpdate address is hardcoded, etc.\n\n> [geekless](#comment_65_1GooUE19488nDwG3TdkM8seYAHct4gjkq4): Applications should be compatible and interchangeable in the same way as text editors are compatible to each other, or web browsers, or email clients etc.\n\nUsers want a single click solution. You just download ZeroNet and it works. Will they choose a home screen except the default one (i.e. ZeroHello)? No. Still, that doesn't help with ZeroNet development itself.\n\n---\n\n@geekless I'll answer your questions about multisign in the next comment.",

[...]\n\nNothing like this is possible in ZeroNet.\n\nPopups from other sites aren't supported, you will have to draw them yourself and just simulate what the sites would do.\n\n> [fantoski](#comment_62_191qyhaRxXEx1bdtG65iQvFddtXBjgo6j3): Does that allow me to write in the DB ?\n\nThere are two problems here. First, CORS is only for reading, so you can't write anywhere. As geekless said, you can sometimes use merger site api to write. The second problem is that you can't write to the database in ZeroNet: instead, you edit JSON files that are then mirrored to the database by ZeroNet core itself.",
