Thanks, it solved my problem :-)\n\n\n\nThe problem I was having.\nI use Mullvad and they have an option to open ports, but you can't choose the port number yourself, so you are given a specific number. The error came when the Mullvad client is connected. In the top of the Dashboard page it said the port was closed. And when I try to publish my website this error came:\n1) Content publish fail.\n2) No peers found, but your content is ready to publish.\nWhen I turn off the VPN the port says it's open and I'm able to publish content.\n\nNow that I changed the port number to the one I got from Mullvad there is no problem.",
