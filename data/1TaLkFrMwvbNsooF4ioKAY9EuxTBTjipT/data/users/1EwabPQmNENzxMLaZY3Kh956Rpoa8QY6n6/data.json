Not sure how we would turn blue states red with the demographic change in the US but I get where you are coming from. I think a lot of people who are pro balkinization think that once they secede all of the issues will be over, which is ridiculous. They will not stop hating you or wanting you dead just because you are not technically part of the country. I know black pills are not helpful but neither is not recognizing the situation we are in. IDK Glad someone is fired up tho...",

I know the riot app doesn’t exist anymore, What are you using for mobile?\n\nSure! I use Element which I think maybe used to be riot but it works all the same. I stood up the server on my own domain and everything pretty much worked. I can reach chats and people on other servers just fine and run a private E2E chat with me and some friends that lives on my server. Of course the data being on the server is not ideal but I own the server and it is encrypted. This is the best privacy/usability compromise I have found. I was even able to get normy friends to put element on their phones and once the got matrix.org ids it is all pretty intuitive for them. I just make sure to stress that this is a step in the right direction not a silver bullet. \n\nI am also on mastodon but I haven't stood up a server yet.",

It also helps with normies to tell them it is like discord and not IRC lol",
