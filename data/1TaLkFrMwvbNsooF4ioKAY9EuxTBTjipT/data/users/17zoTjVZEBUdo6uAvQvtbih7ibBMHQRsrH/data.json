Basically by the dark ages I'm referring to the time when we lost lots of historical texts. Off the top of my head, I can say that Stobaeus' Florilegium is only available in Latin and German with bits in Ancient Greek, no English translation exists. Those two ancient languages aren't exactly prolific any more and the most popular language learning website, Duolingo, refuses to add Latin despite there being plenty eager to make a course. [...]\n\nif i understood you correctly, you mean something like the scarcity of seeders to seed rare stuff, which is pretty much analogous to a dark age where no one (or very few) preserved some texts, am i correct? well you need people if that's the case, at least one to keep it going, and i think we can start arguing from this point.\n&nbsp;\none interesting thing we could do (which i thought of it now) in contrast to 'one individual seeder' -- which is pretty much the 0Net philosophy -- is to bundle stuff to require users to have more than one archive, which also contrasts seed ratio requirement which some trackers use, and there are interesting ways to enforce that, ZeroUP for instance requires minimum 10mb files (which some have argue that it prevents many small individual files).\nif you think about it, the idea of a website follows this implicitly, you can't just get one picture, you must download\nmany files.\n&nbsp;\nso my point is, grouping stuff enforces you to have more than you need but that helps everyone, but that only increases the initial idea of 'one seeder, one file' to 'one seeder, many files'. there are many constraints with this idea, for instance, file size can become a bit of an issue.\n&nbsp;\nbut back to your point (your question), we can question based on the technology itself, as @leftside argued, archive.org isn't decentralized. or we could go back to the idea of the technology itself, purely based on preservation, because IPFS and ZeroNet have been designed already so we have to develop the philosophy of preservation around that.\n&nbsp;\njust some random thoughts, scrutinize them.",

Those disk space could be used in a more profitable way by saving more various data rather than clones. [...]\n\nThis efficiency is pretty nice but it should also give users control to allow for different 'philosophies of archival'.\nso we can enforce certain rules to make sure that data isn't lost, for instance, what if a blog comment snapshot from a period time, that no one wants, gets lost because no one downloaded and the blog owner didn't care or suffered data loss, which may be only a few kb in size, in this case it would make more sense to say to the user \"set your disk limit, at some point we will transfer older backups of our files to you, which you can see and will have complete control and knowledge of it\". now that may sound pervasive but it can allow for clever storage:\n&nbsp;\n\nSay i want to seed everything from ZeroTalk, i set my disk limit to 10gb, at some point i will reach this limit, then ZeroTalk asks for more, to which we could say \"hey, check how many seeders certain snapshots have, i want to help those with less\", that way data is dynamically downloaded based on seeders, with the purpose of efficiency and preservation. one obvious problem is that it will delete/download some snapshots automatically, but in this case this is better than never downloading older backups or simply downloading everything and reaching disk limit rather quickly. all of this, of course, with preservation and data distribution efficiency in mind.",

Moreover Espinoza makes ontological argument that can be follewed separated by any time or place such as Zhuangtzi. By saying that his arguments fall short you're saying that there could be a morally justified slave guild type society, where I think this unacceptable. Also the arguments of Rothbard, if brought to their natural conclusion, will bring upon a true thecnocratic society in the form of a Neofeudal Commonwealth, such I think would benefit more our society than every other that came before. Moreover the arguments of postmodernist have been provern empirically wrong nowadays by the current state I'm whitnessing with my own eyes in Europe. The Rape of Cologne, the State of Malmö and others exemple that NPC calls \"victories\" are the defeat of the motherland Europe. I dunno for what your banner flies, however I know for sure that the red banner should never ever fly upon the world once again.\n\nwhile you are right about Espinoza, you are conflating the definition of 'ontology' with actual physical laws, any ontological argument can break at any point and (ontology) it is not only criticized by many philosophers after him, but considered antiquated (Bertrand Russell). if you think his arguments are the reason for the end and/or justification of slavery, you may need to revisit slavery history.\n\nsecond, you are misguided if you think that liberalism changes in a post-industrial society, the focus on the individual, or some arguments like Baudrillard's *The System of Objects*, stand still as long as it remains in its nature of consumerism and individualism.\nwhile I'm not a postmodernist i would like to know which arguments that were proven \"empirically\" wrong and how does it relate to the topic.\n\nthird, you didn't address your contrast of Marxism with Rothbard, JBP or Espinoza, but many people ~~JBP~~ confuse Marxism for postmodernism, if that's the case...\n\nAlso there are many things to consider, as you pointed out, the transition to a post-industrial society can possibly make any Ethical framework break apart, for instance, conservatives still try their ideology under liberalism which we can see that causes antagonizations in our society, i'm not criticizing them here but conservatism is not very compatible with liberalism.",

Gathafi? Maduro?

[...]\n\nyeah it is political interference but on the issue of trade itself (there would be political interference either way) censorship and political interference fall on the same category of trading with someone and losing something, while they are different in effect they are both negative aspects of dealing with a particular country concerning trade and i would argue that whatever bad a country does inside its territory as long as it is not exporting its way its better then losing political and economic independence.\n\nChina is big enough... so is the US. when such countries become dependent enough the \"rules\" of trade may very well kick in but we aren't there just yet so there is no point because right now China can provide trade and finance without political interference.\n\nbut lets not fool ourselves, China is way behind the US and it needs its trading partners as much as any other country, the US is just trying to stop China's growth.\n\nbtw i read a very interesting paper (thesis) a while ago titled \"Japan-bashing : how propaganda shapes Americans'perception of the Japanese\", its a very interesting study with stats and everything about how the media, corporations and businesses when threaten by a strong economic competitor got all frenzy and nationalistic about its economy. its mesmerizing how it can also describe the global political situation through a lens from the past.\n\nConsider that no country would like to cause conflict between its people *if* it isn't necessary or beneficial, China's censorship is a bit radical but necessary, certainly not beneficial, all countries have to make similar choices. future prospects should lie on well thought out arguments concerning material conditions and not frenzy and conspiratorial propaganda or evocative imagery that people bare in their minds from popular opinion and culture.",

If anything, founders of small startups would benefit from that extra cash the most, and thus be more likely to hire people. ..which is funny because the exact same argument is made against UBI as well, and yes, you do have to think carefully about how you plan to fund it and which tax system you plan to use. VAT tax seems like a good place to start. People also say that UBI will lead to inflation. Then again, the same could be said about ANYTHING that puts more money into peoples pockets. I'd say minimum wage is more likely to cause inflation than UBI because you're artificially controlling the price of services.\n\nthe issue is that there is always tax avoidance by the super rich and the burden will always fall back on the poor and middle-class, if you can't tax the rich directly its likely that the UBI will increase prices.\n\n>Under a UBI that would be less likely to happen.

The most fundamental unit of existence is a species or ethnicity - an ideal that projects itself onto the world and lives and evolves. Species/ethnicities communicate through various means and spread the information that each one discovers to the other lifeforms in its ecosystem. Males are the ones that find and defend the truth/new information and females are the ones that nurture and proliferate it. Here's the problem: you are 'males' but you are feminized and fucking retarded, you make no effort to understand anything for yourself, just consuming and consuming like a fucking abominable swine. This necessarily makes you a cancer on the race, literally nothing other than a vector for sickness, a bleeding sore leaking blood and festering.

Obviously the worker is not in a position to actually enforce its interests so that the \"social security\" would cover a kind of health-care services that actually are needed to solve the problem, but the dumb workers, who signed the bad contract at first place, do not think that much, so they believe the communists. At some point the communists themselves live lavishly from tax money and \"fair leaders\" and the worker still struggles to pay for the food, shelter, medical services, transport. In Estonia, the start in the 90-ties was excellent, but knowledge about the fact that there will be the white collar crooks, who will abuse the situation, was lacking, so by about 2017 the situation with some of those workers was so bad that an ordinary city monthly bus ticket would have cost the worker about 1/3 of its net salary, about 100€, so the communists, in various parties, decided that since the worker pays about 50% or more of its salary to the state anyway, it is monetarily more beneficial to pay that 100€ from tax money just to get the ~150€ tax money from that worker in stead of letting the worker quit its job and start protesting and demanding social_services and consuming Police_repression_workhours without paying any taxes at all. That's how the year 2020 capital of Estonia, the Tallinn, got its \"free public transportation\".\n\nwho are these \"communists\", how does what they do relate or derive from a communist philosopher such as Karl Marx?\n\n> It was possible in the 90-ties because the state was so poor that THERE WAS NOT EVEN MONEY FOR THE POLICE. Russian mobsters roamed around, the owning of firearms became very popular, the business of private security companies flourished and sometimes tourists literally thought of an ordinary private security company escort convoy as some military escort. At first the Russian mobsters extortion policy worked, after all, there literally was no Police to stop them, but at some point people had enough and the Russian mobsters ended up in a forest with their legs shot. That's all official history and just one story out of many.\n\nThat was the direct effect of the neoliberalization of post-soviet Russia done by westerners, you can find many research of this topic online, here's one sample: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230524439_13\n\nThanks for the info about Estonia, i will definitely read more about its departure from the Soviet Union.\n\nAs for the rest of your argument, theres two thing i want to touch upon, first its your idea that a transition to capitalism (i think that is what you meant) or at least to transition from having a government to not having one.\n\nYou are clearly advocating for a sort of darwinism, best of all wins (smartest, etc), i won't try to guess your political position but i will rather address your points individually\n\nHardly has it ever been the case that people won't use their collective power or won't run under a banner for the greater good of the community. if you respect freedom of association you can't prevent \"dumb\" people from doing so, or a smarter person from using dumb people to do that.\n\nWestern philosophers had very different views on how society should organize or what kinda of religion/spirit is the ideal for everyone's best interests, either people are lazy or incapable they are still able to conduct their lives and work towards something under their own philosophy, you have nothing but one philosophy too.\n\nalso, why smart? would smart win most of the time or live better? what does a smart person do that would make them rise above the rest? higher iq isn't smart-er because there's rich people with low-iq.\n\nwhatever is smart for a market society is whatever makes money, but is it smart to waste your life to get money, or to live luxuriously? or to simply be happy? but while many pursue happiness while other pursue financial gains, wouldn't that enter in conflict when the \"smarter\" marketeers sell more and out-compete the ones looking for happiness? if so, the people going after happiness weren't being smart because they choose happiness instead of financial gains, in that sense there isn't being \"smarter\" but just being able to conduct your life amidst a dog eat dog society, there is no \"being smart\" but rather doing anything to survive, which wouldn't exactly lead to happiness. in this society it may be smart to live less because you may want to work for a while and later give it all up to live like a king for a while.\n\nand for the above to the possible, people would have to ubiquitously accept this single philosophy of \"being smart\", but being smart may very well mean not accepting your idea and destroying it with whatever means possible.\n\nalso you can guess that not a lot of people share this same idea of yours, that should be a warning to why it may not work...",

Nor did I say that smartness is defined through financial wealth. Material wealth and financial wealth are 2 separate things.  [...]\n\nif anyone is reading this, my reply is specifically to sfs9, sorry to disturb this thread, **ignore this comment**.\n\nthanks for your reply, just one thing to note is that whatever system you want depends on some force to make it happen, some sort of agent, that is my problem with this idea that people in isolation under one single banner without organising to gain power and to implement their system has never worked, not for long at least. (however i'm not saying that no one should attempt to do it).\n\nthat case of Estonia and the then valueless ruble is actually a perfect example of value and investment coming from somewhere, from whatever relation gives value to whatever currency. after wwii, Germany was torn apart, one of the reasons to why west Germany was superior to the east is because of American investment. it works on some nations and not on others, it really depends on that nations capabilities to sustain itself, always with a strong government to suppress opposition while capitalism develops.\n\nmy point was not about happiness but that people have different ideas and depending on their material necessities there isn't really an ideal solution, thus material conditions will drive people to different philosophies, giving force to different kinds of societies.\n\nas for your point about communism, you do realize how Russia and Slavic countries were doing before the October revolution, right? its interesting to call communists parasites where the feedstock to sustain the first (capitalists) world countries come from third-world countries. the Soviet union didn't extract value from south/central america, middle-east or Africa, nor did Cuba, North-Korea or China, the capitalists countries such the US did, Japan did, and who benefited? \"friends of the king\", if you think communists are parasites, idk what to call capitalists then. if you think they were after power, why did they oppose the strongest military force in the world (US), if Cuba or North-Korea are after parasitizing their people why wouldn't they simply hold power while being friends with the US like Saudi-Arabia does?\n\nbtw this is partly brickbat because accusations without evidence calls for that.",

I mean seriously, this isn't a ZeroNet problem, it's a TOR + email problem. If Alice has 100 trusted friends and she sends half at random one version of her next email address, and the other half the other version, and she repeats periodically, very soon she can use a process of logic to figure out who is spamming her email. (It's faster if she has 100 versions). And if her friends have no trouble emailing her for copies of a file, then the file will be moving. Repeat with the 100 friends' email addresses forming a chain of forwarded messages, perhaps with minor automation. So if you want to stop the network, you're basically talking about banning TOR by spamming it, banning unmonitored communication period by spamming it. Hopefully there is some partisan resistance.\n\ni see your point and i agree partially, crime does have a tendency to sophisticate itself, but then crime is marginalized because it becomes less accessible, drawing it into a corner of absolute obscurity, and you cannot prevent that which you don't know about, at least that reduces crime and gives people an illusion of \"order\" which makes them fear the punishment for doing something bad. i'm not talking about being complacent to a government or force, i'm taking about extreme stuff like this \"nth room\", i fell that i have to reiterate this point over and over again...\n\n>he problem with \"DDOSing to stop Nth room\" is that it very rapidly turns into \"DDOSing to stop any network that allows encrypted files to be exchanged without looking at each one and giving it thumbs up or thumbs down\"\n\ni don't see how that follows, the \"nth room\" is a very specific issue to which many people online would help ddos, would these same people go further and do that to other stuff that isn't even related? and even if they did, this supposed action would likely be politically motivated which in turn would definitely create a pushback where no one benefits from the attacks, but a lot of people would benefit from ddosing things like \"nth room\", again, assuming ddosing is practical for such a situation.",
