When mysteries are replaced with knowledge, the religion that we used to explain the mystery is replaced by knowledge.  But I expect there will always be mysteries remaining that will be fertile grounds for religion.  The more we learn, and the more enlightened we become, the more enlightened our religion becomes.  Carl Sagan defined God as the laws of nature.  I suspect that was not just a euphemism for atheism.  I suspect that he was as serious and committed to understanding his god as some fundamentalists are to understanding theirs.
