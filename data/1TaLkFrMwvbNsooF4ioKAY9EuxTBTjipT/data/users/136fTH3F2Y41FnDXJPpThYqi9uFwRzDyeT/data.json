If TOR isn't doing that, then you shouldn't be using TOR at all.\n\nTor does not secure the traffic passing through it; those concerned need to encrypt the traffic. As for anonymity, there is more and more research citing that anonymity is not guaranteed by Tor. On a positive note, as the NSA presentation indicates, it is far from simple to deanonymize identities of individuals who are using the Tor network.",
