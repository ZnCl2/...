However, they have quarantined it and stopped it from reaching the front page, while allowing smaller socialist subreddits to continuously block up r/all.\n\nThe subs that they recently banned (mde clones and some others) were all banned on the premise of inciting violence, which is bs. Reddit admins are clearly pushing an agenda.",
