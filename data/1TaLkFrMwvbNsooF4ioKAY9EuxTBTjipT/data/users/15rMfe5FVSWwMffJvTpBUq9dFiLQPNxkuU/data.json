			"title": "Zeronet's Monetary System: NANO",
			"body": "What should the main crypto coin be that we start to accept and mass adopt to be Zeronets primary coin of use??\n\nMy vote is for NANO: heres why...\n\nIm a business man i understand MONEY! I know what real money is, i know what real assets are, and i know how to gain a LOT of both... Nano out of all coins (all i have seen at least) is the best thing to happen in the money space since the discovery of GOLD!! \n\nNano is the purest and closest coin to gold and silver (I know there are gold and silver backed coins) MONEY is what we all want but few of us actually know what real money is. Real money is the “PEOPLES MONEY” aka “GODS MONEY” Gold and Silver its the only form of money that has ever truly worked in its pure form.  NANO in order for it to be consider money it needs to meet 8 requirements… 1. Medium of exchange 2. A unit of account 3. Portable 4. Durable 5. Divisible 6. Fungible (interchangeable) 7. Store of value 8. Max number reached (I added this) NANO meets all these requirement and in a very spectacular way!! NANO can work offline only needing to update every so often, is instant transaction, decentralized, green (the reason POW coins will ALL eventually fail)!!! I have been in crypto since 2010 and other than btc when I first found it nothing has gotten me as excited as this!! Since 2016 my websites all have a 20% discount if you pay in NANO and is the only coin I accept and also one of the only coins I hodl!! As the world continues to learn how paper assets are created by the devil himself more and more people will turn to NANO through their education about what real money is… You see… the reason why gold and silver is the only real money until NANO is because it boils down to this. You have yours and I have mine, if I pay you, then you have more and I have less. SIMPLE. Its mostly called gods money for this one reason. There is only x amount of it in existence and the price only fluctuates with supply and demand. Until paper assets started to dictate the price, gold and silver only went up in value when the population grew and only went down when the population shrunk or more gold was mined. All the more reason why I listed number 8! \n\nThis is my suggestion for anyone making a site that sells products on Zeronet! I would love to hear other ideas on what coin should be use primarily cuz well FUCK BTC it will die eventually due to time, and cost to run alone.",

I don't care for your free market hot take on how the invisible hand selected the group of plutocrats and pedophiles we see in the higher echelons of power today. The fact is that this group has a disproportionate amount of power which it uses to abuse my people and dispossess of them from their ancestral homelands.I would ask why you're making the Ayn Rand argument and an apologist for capitalism when it comes to one very specific group who holds a disproportionate amount of wealth and institutional power. This being your suggestion they've earned their position in the bourgeois through their high IQ and ability, which is a free market argument that they obtained their power and privilage through meritocracy.\n\ni dont quite follow your statement entirely (low iQ i guess) but as far as disproportionate wealth and power goes... 2 years ago i was $28,000 in debt and lost my job... out of sheer refusal to accept defeat i rose up slowly. It was incredibly hard work but i managed to do it... With the last $500 i had to my name i started a business, after incredible hard challenges i now make in 1 month what would of taken me almost 4 years to make!!\n\nI did this 100% on my own, no silver spoon, no college education, no credit score... I DIDNT HAVE FUCKING SHIT! So when it come to arguing that the capitalist are somehow just handed their power, or deprive others of it is just simply BS!\n\nYou dont ever hear us talk about it cuz for many of us its hard to admit or hard to relive, but for the sake of helping others to understand ill say it now...\n\nThey dont tell you, we lose friends and family members. They dont tell you, how many sacrifices we make, they dont tell you, how we have to work 22 hours a day. They dont tell you, how many times we cried on our knees praying for help that never came. They dont tell you, that we failed (i failed 12 times before i made $1M) They dont tell you that you have to eat pbnj, Ramon, n bologna for years (i cant remember the last time i went out to eat) They dont tell you, that the employees have a better life than we do!! They dont tell you, that this is the hardest thing you will ever do in your life! They just dont tell you this shit... I could go on but i think you get it now... Sure some of use capitalist are born with a silver spoon \"Trump\" but majority of us worked incredibly hard for it and because of that is why we also defend capitalism because we dont want to see something that was so hard for us to master fall to shit birds. 🙏",

Why can't the federal reserve loan to the public at 3%, eh? I guess they get these sweetheart deals by pulling their self up by the bootstraps.Additionally, the capitalist class has pushed for open borders in order to drive down the wages of working class by increasing the supply of labor. We've only seen the cost of living increase while wages have stagnated or decreased. The only costs which have decreased have been for entertainment.\n\nThe federal reserve cant do what your wanting because if they did the entire house of cards would collapse. See ever since 1971 when Nixon took us off the gold standard. At the exact time is when the US government gave itself the right to print any amount of money they wanted to... In order for that money to no inflate (well not as bad...) they gave the banks whats called Fractional Reserve Banking... This give the bank the power to loan out more money than what they actually have in reserve. By doing this the bank is essentially creating the money that the government already printed and was inflated but now deflated back to level consensus.\n\nSo basically the bank can loan you 100$ for every 10$ they have in assets... And with this power of knowledge if you are ever sued for defaulting a payment from a bank simply require a jury of peers and explain this to the jury and say i will agree to pay but only what i actually owe them and thats 10%... \n\nAs far as the cost of living goes... This ultimately boils down to the most simple business anyone can start, even with ZERO knowledge on markets.. Thats buying property and then charging whatever price you want... I have seen massive fluctuation in house costs simply based on types of people owning the property... In Indiana a 2,000sq home costs 130,000$ but if you go to a place like New Mexico the Mexicans with zero business knowledge are charging 350,000$ for same size and type of home... its the financially uneducated that are being greedy... So if you live in an area that has ethnic minorities that own the housing, then yes your cost of living will SUUUCK!! Im just talking about this from my own observations of living in many different states...",

Even back then i lived by a saying \"work smarter not harder\" many ways of interpreting that quote... \n\nBut when i got into business for myself and was struggling a mentor of mine basically told me the same quote just a little different \"the poor leverage their time for money, the rich leverage their money for time\" If you follow this quote then you can easily understand how Howard was able to leverage his money to buy him 389 times... MORE TIME!!\n\nIts frustrating that so many people look at rich like were greedy getting paid so much more than the small guy... but in reality YOUR the greedy one!! What jobs do you provide to others? How many charities do you donate to? How many families are not starving because of the jobs you provide???? No none rite... all you do with your money is buy food of YOU, buy a car for YOU, buy a house for YOU! Someone asks for some money, you say you dont have any... \n\nAsk the richest person you know if you can buy them dinner, take them to a place that you need to walk by some homeless people... see what they do..???? Compared you what the rest of you would do... Justify not giving them money because oh they will just by booze (then you by booze) or they will just buy drugs with it, some lame shit to make you sleep better at night...\n\nBefore this gets to long, one of the things on my bucket list to do... is to pick up a random homeless person and without giving them anything more than a room for 3 days and some money for clothe.

Most people will never have enough money to start a business and even less people will ever get a job good enough to allow them to do so. It's just common sense.\n\nSo you dont think you could save up 500$?? Cuz thats the exact amount i started with... Now i make ~230,00$ per month! Here are some screenshot for you to see proof. \nhttps://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPqZpVheM4PQkbfGnbtqaDF4ni86vzxg34f4fmZDtekM1\n\nHere are some hard number FACTS for you... 90% of the world wealth is controlled by only 10% of the population and 90% of that is controlled my 1% of the population!! These are real facts look them up... But now ask yourself, WHY??\n\nThe answer will piss you off but tough shit you need to hear it. This is not directed @buckfruck just saying in general... \n\nThe answer is because 90% of the population is FUCKING LAZY! They want easy money. They dont want to take risks. They dont want to sacrifice. They dont want to WOOORRRKKK. So they are left to pick up the scraps that us rich decide to give them.\n\nBut hey i totally believe in \"competition breeds excellence\" so if anyone is interested in  DOING THE WORK then you can be making number just like i do in the link above... I started off with 500$ of that 250$ went to pay for the coaching i got from my mentor Seth Kniep where i simply followed what he taught me and IMPLEMENTED it see thats the thing... People say they want to be rich but when they got to jump in the deep end head first they STOP... nope thats to much risk for me... See you will always have risk EVERYTHING has risk! Anyone can think of a million reasons why not to do something but they never stop to think of the WHAT IF GOOD?? What if this does work and it changes my life, what if this does work and i can by a Lamborghini, what if what if what if?? see how you just changed your mind from negative to positive and now you really wanna at least try...??? here click this link and get started.

The internet which by nature was intended to be open and support freedom of speech, on of the main liberties the government is ACTIVELY trying to get rid of. Along with right to bare arms, right to the pursuit of happiness, freedom of religion, freedom in general... That are setting us all up in some very shady way... allowing 9-11 to happen so they could launch NSA and CIA spying on people for \"national security\" or making a law that child porn is illegal just to get inside peoples minds like somehow a young girl that wants to be a model is hurt mentally by taking nude photos common fuck off this is a set up to lead into the removal of pursuit of happiness. Every year they either create or allow a mass shooting in some school, church, or most recently a Walmart... Wait why a walmart?? oh yeah its because the other places that we meant to strike you down emotionally was not working... So they changed their script to target the majority... Cuz who in America is not in a Walmart on a weekly basis??? just 2 days after the shoot i took my mom to one and she was looking all over for a shooter, she even told me i dont feel safe in here... \n\nThis scares the fuck out of me people!! This last shooting in El Paso just might lead to the take away of our gun... When that happens America will instantly try to become the next Hitler. Dont take my word for it do your own research its almost on a biological clock that at certain times throughout history someone in power attempts to take over the world.\n\nSo having something like zeronet!!

Like its now a new crime to have a fucking brain of your own!\n\nI 100% support Zeronet AND Tor!! The world that brought us into modern day society really only had one law... \n\nTHE LAW OF THE JUNGLE - it dictates this: Dont fuck with the wrong person because you dont know who he know or what hes capable of just like he dont know you, who you know, or what your capable of... This renders every possible illegal action to a stalemate and Ultimately leads to a better society cuz no one would do shit to fuck with someone else unless it was REQUIRED \"Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth\"\n\nWe never really had problems like we do in society today. Until the rich started to make their own security force AKA police that then lead into judges, lawyers, politicians, and lastly GREED. People go to jail now with ZERO proof, people are sued for ZERO proof. IT horrible!! and havign a place on the DW to find out who is actively fighting back is the only chance we have... Im not tyring to radicalize anyone here but common you got a brain.... tell me shits all hunky dory????",

The world is at a very trick time rite now. The internet which by nature was intended to be open and support freedom of speech, on of the main liberties the government is ACTIVELY trying to get rid of. Along with right to bare arms, right to the pursuit of happiness, freedom of religion, freedom in general... That are setting us all up in some very shady way... allowing 9-11 to happen so they could launch NSA and CIA spying on people for \"national security\" or making a law that child porn is illegal just to get inside peoples minds like somehow a young girl that wants to be a model is hurt mentally by taking nude photos common fuck off this is a set up to lead into the removal of pursuit of happiness. Every year they either create or allow a mass shooting in some school, church, or most recently a Walmart... Wait why a walmart?? oh yeah its because the other places that we meant to strike you down emotionally was not working... So they changed their script to target the majority... Cuz who in America is not in a Walmart on a weekly basis??? just 2 days after the shoot i took my mom to one and she was looking all over for a shooter, she even told me i dont feel safe in here...

				"body": "oh god now you got me started..\n\n1. I was not a racist until recently i even did a ZeroTalk thread about it something like Unwilling racist...\n\n2. Niggers are now the new racists they can simply flip, misinterpret (do to lack of education) or intentionally lie about what was said simply to RUIN a white mans life, career ect... proven by taking the NON racist comment Trump has been recently accused of saying \"go back to where you came from\" is not racist unless your a nigger with an agenda to ruin a white man... If he was to say \"go back to where you came from nigger\" then it would be...\n\n3. Niggers are strong arming bosses and companies to give them power positions over whites simply because the company or boss does not want to get mixed up on discrimination...\n\n4. Niggers have an entire month dedicated to them... WTF... if this was done by a white man they would cry \"thats racist you dont own the months of the year\" \n\n5. Black ONLY college -  well this one is self explained\n\n6. Niggers ruin fast food!! - I simply CANNOT for the life of me no matter where i go order a hamburger with NO pickles at ANY place that employs a nigger to make the food... its not possible. (😂 but now when they fuck my food up, i take the sandwich back so the cameras can see, then i shred it in my hands and throw it all over the walls and in the back. Beg if you clean enough of this up then you will start making the food rite)\n\n7. Dear white people (Tv Show) - have not watched is REFUSE to watch is.... dont care what they say its RACIST AS FUCK. im pretty sure the world would come to an end if i made a tv talking about exactly what i am saying in this post and called it \"Dear Black People\" hell i would probably be murdered for it 🤦‍♂️\n\n8. A cop of any color cant do their job - its true these stupid dumb niggers are even brazen enough to high behind discrimination to get out of committing a crime!! Its by no mean as popular on the news as a white cop arresting a black man/ killing him. But if you dig deep you can even find where these human race version of aids are actively fighting their own kind FUCKING AMAZING and white people are the fucked up ones... 👌\n\n9. We have to pay for insurance when were young and perfectly healthy - Obamacare requires that if you have a job you must also pay for health insurance... WHY??? so us young and health white people pay for the niggers drug overdosing visits that happen all day every day!!\n\n10. Ruined our progression - Historically speaking look at where we were as a country before black rights and look at where we are now... of course a nigger will say were way better look at all the tech and shit we got... NOT WHAT IM GETTING AT... sure tech has hyper propelled us pretty far in the last 30ish years. But im talkin about OUR COUNTRY like prosperity, food to eat, thing that are not dictated by tech... WE HAVE devolved!! Were going backwards bitches!!\n\n11. NAACP - The NAACP is nothing more than an organized terrorist group, that is hell bent on destroying America and the people that made America GREAT!!\n\n12. Excessive breeding - if i was a bible thumper i would call this a sin of fornication. These nigger fuck worse than rabbits...  we have all heard the joke about mexicans piled into a car... Have you ever been inside a NIGGER DEN???? wall to wall a see of dirt!! They have no conscious thought about the life they bring into the world and how they expect to take care of it... NO thats cuz niggers ONLY think about what is good for them.. ME ME ME ME ME\n\n13. Last point im tired of typing - WHY ARE THEY EVEN HERE - Ok so heres were the REAL problem is... We the white man brought i farm equipment over from Africa 300 years ago... then like 150 years ago we decided it was time for a farm equipment upgrade. We no longer wanted to pay to feed the cattle... So we set our livestock free. When they were set free they ultimately had two options... stay here and conform to the white mans way of life as a free person, or GET THE FUCK OUTA HERE and move back to Africa... They chose to stay here, why? Cuz America was the best country in the WORLD!! So like a typical NIGGER DOES they took advantage of the situation and decided to stay... But they somehow think that, they get to turn around and fuck with the white man now... People we are so close to a race war i can feel it in my bone... And these niggers dont know what the fuck their up against.... STUPID DUMB NIGGERS where the one with the GUNS!! cuz you cant afford to buy any ✌️",

Words mean little when interacting with people.  If you are at work and not happy or angry with something your co workers do you need to be calm yourself before you approach them.  If your intensity level is at a 10 then your words mean nothing.  Right or happy?If you are feeling happy or calm when you bring up issues and remain calm and help them draw their own conclusions rather than simply telling them they are wrong, it might be more effective.   People are easy to repel with body language even if you are right.  Just work on calming yourself and avoid arguing.  Suggestions are received better than random instruction.  It just takes some practice and the key is yourself.   Perfectionism does not bring happiness or impress others.  Need a better balance.\n\nthank you.

One thing you might find interesting is CBT(Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) You could research it online.  I have found it to be most useful for myself.  It's a simple concept that takes practice.  In essence,  Its about our own thoughts and how quickly we react to beliefs that may or may not be accurate.  Its about slowing down the process and basically questioning everything. And being aware of our many automatic thoughts that happen very quickly and go unnoticed.  If we can have better control of our automaitic thoughts.. we then should have better control of our automatic reactive behavior.   And in theory.. life, interactions, and stress levels should automatically get better.  I think they should teach it in school, but it would go against the status quo.  It's worth checking out if you have not already.\n\nwow ok so basically this CBT is what prompts our impulsive behavior? I will check it out thank you",

He's exactly the type of developer I really love because all he gives a shit about is creating his vision, rather than dealing with any drama. It does mean he's a bit of a ghost though. Not childish, just kinda apathetic towards the community. If everyone stopped using zeronet, I really don't think nofish would care much. But maybe that's me reading a bit into it.

That is quite terifying. That ZeroTalk, ZeroMe, ZeroID, ZeroHello can be maliciously modified (all its users content), malicious code put into these sites?I think nofish should improve this so the things are more decentralized. That should be priority on the network which main selling point (per my understanding) is decentralization, right?

I didn't have the time to write a detailed explanation for it yet but you can use this bash script to turn a fedora30 templateVM into an ZeroNet templateVM. Please remember to set your netVM to sys-whonix.If feel free to ask me if you have any questions.\n\n> [pexo](#comment_140_1DfrA2M9Qra6stqT6tzwNMYNweswY54KAC): blog\n\nWOW very good brother thanks for the link!
