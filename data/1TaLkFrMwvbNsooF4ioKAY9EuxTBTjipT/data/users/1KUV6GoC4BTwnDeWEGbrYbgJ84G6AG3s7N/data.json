If you let your browser connect to local services, that opens the door for remote websites, which you access over Tor, to give you instructions (e.g. via javascript, but not only via javascript) to make local connections and then send that info back to the website.\n>\n>In the most benign case, you're setting yourself up with a tracking marker (\"there's that weird person who allowed connections to 192.168.1.1 again\"). In worse cases, you're opening yourself up to permissions surprises and attacks that start with the word \"cross-site\" or \"cross-protocol\".\n>\n>For an early example of a similar bug that bit Tor users, see https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2007-September/000078.html\n>\n>All of that said, if you still want to shoot your feet off: in about:config, there's a network.proxy.no_proxies_on option that you can set.\n\n>For even more details, new in ESR68, there is now a network.proxy.allow_hijacking_localhost option, which we needed to fix for Tor Browser: https://bugs.torproject.org/31065\n\nIn general TOR and Zeronet do not work well together, because Zeronet requires Javascript, which can expose client details to sites.
