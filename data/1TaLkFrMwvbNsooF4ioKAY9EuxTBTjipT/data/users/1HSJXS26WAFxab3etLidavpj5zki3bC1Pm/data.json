Posting your public key to verify it is you not only runs the risk of the user accidentally posting their private key, but it also uses storage. Users only have 50K of posting storage by default, and including your public key in every post will cause you to use more storage than necessary\n\nEvery time you post a message on Zeronet you post your public key. It's part of your url for that message..ðŸ˜€",
