[Mozilla killed LibreFox](https://github.com/Librefox/Librefox.github.io/issues/1#issuecomment-459003210) by the way.\n\n>@colbycdev Mozilla, contacted me to avoid copyright and trademarks violation, i still did not have a final answer from them until then i would prefer minimizing the edit and forks, they are watching ;)\n\nHere are some lists to make a better choice:\n\nhttps://digdeeper.neocities.org/ghost/browsers.html\n\n~~https://clarkycat.neocities.org/browser.html~~ (Only lists Icecat and LibreFox and some addons)\n\nhttps://spyware.neocities.org/articles/browsers.html",

I wonder if they really have trademarked the word \"Fox\" in the browsers market, I doubt it. There has been a long-time fork of Firefox called Waterfox which is much closer to the \"trademark\" but they haven't done anything about it, I think this shows that Mozilla doesn't want privacy-friendly forks of their browsers to exist, or maybe it was a mistake from one of their employees.",
