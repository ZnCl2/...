She's an American citizen working out of Berlin? Has published instructions on how to move to Germany as a \"freelancer\". 30 yo? There's a story here - but I haven't been able to find it. Suspect she's queer.\n\nShe's effective tho. Apparently has managed to strip Breitbart of 70% of their revenue, and has doxed many others. Certain Breitbart must know a lot about her since she hurt them so badly.\n\nThat story about \"people who live in glass houses\"? Karma should visit this bitch.\n\n\nhttps://www.thedrum.com/news/2019/09/04/sleeping-giants-breitbart-and-brand-safety-its-not-our-job-police-your-ads\n\nhttps://nandinijammi.com/about/\n\nhttp://voxday.blogspot.com/2020/01/fight-back-or-else.html\n\n\n\nTrying to find this \"Legal Legion of Evil\". Might send them money.\n\nI have made it very, very clear that the Legal Legion and I will vigorously exercise our legal rights whenever an individual - whether she calls herself a reporter or not - or organization attempts to interfere with our various contractual relationships. And if anyone doubts that we've laid more than a few legal traps in preparation for those inevitable attempts, well, perhaps you should go and talk to Patreon about how much they are enjoying their current dance with the Legion.\n\nAnd since we're on the subject, if you are a New York, Georgia, or California lawyer who is interested in collecting skulls and scalps by putting in some pro bono time with the LLoE, get in touch. I can assure you, no one is having more fun these days than the Legal Legion.\n\n\nWould enjoy seeing her bogged down with legal debts for a decade. That would take her just past the point where reproduction becomes impossible - even with artificial assistance. She needs to die a bitter old spinster. Karma satisfied.\n\nYou don't take prisoners with censorship. Should always be a fight to the death....",

And few have the guts to stand up to such peer pressure. Particularly media fanned peer pressure. Accordingly, if your job was as useless and worthless as a royal - you would be scared too.  :)  Gravytrain upended.\n\nIf females can bleed - they can breed. Though too early breeding can do serious damage. That's why families once had a say and some restraint on the blind reproductive drive of males. They also demanded that their kin gain the ancient protections of marriage before sexual access was granted.\n\nAnd that's the real problem here. Epstein was getting females on the cheap (or trying). Now that many of those females are well on their spinster path - they want revenge and money. It's that simple. Endless rationalizations will be aired to justify what they see as \"mine\"....and rest of us get to listen endlessly to this rubbish.\n\nAll was avoidable had Epstein simply become a citizen of a country where polygamy is legal - and just married them. Might not have worked for Andrew tho :) His \"job\" would have excluded such benefits :)\n\nThings were so much simpler in Khan's time. If he wanted a woman - he just took her. Chances are he previously killed all her male relatives anyway....\n\nhttps://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/06/09/genghis-khan/\n\nI hate watching prominent males cower like Andrew. That alone is reason for the royals to get rid of him. He should have instead simply stated that he liked women and wanted more of them. Then let those heads explode.\n\nAnd is some journo or activist had become a menace to him - he should have fucked their wife or daughter. Been that sneaky neighbor dog......",

A thief is a thief. Clarity is seeing a thief as a thief and reacting to that. I'm not responsible for more thieves being born black. Bury them with the white thieves.\n\nOur modern problem is too little violence. If you were a police officer pulling over a guy in the '50's - you knew he might be a survivor of Iwo Jima. They didn't take prisoners in that war. So you knew it might not be difficult for such individuals to add another notch and you would have handled them accordingly with respect and firmness. No police criminality.\n\nCops today know that the supply of such people has declined...so they are just more free to abuse. And they do.\n\nThat nigger took the bicycle because he knew he'd get away with it - not because of some systematic oppression he was dealing with. There's no need to overthink this.

While killing someone is never routine and always has unforseen consequences (any lawyer will tell you that) - it's also true that ALL homeowners reliably are acquitted or never changed. Google it. It happens and it works. Even the lowest guy on the totem pole gets off under castle laws.\n\nNow if you live in a state without castle laws, well....that's your rut. Enjoy it. Or change it. No need to live in a shithole country.\n\nThere was a case two years ago where a sheriffs deputy broke into a home at 2AM seeking to serve a warrant. He was shot and killed by the homeowner. Sheriff's department wanted this guy badly. He had a history, and had killed one of THEIRS.\n\nGrand jury refused to charge him. It was dropped.\n\nSubmission to bullies and criminals is a drug.

Citizen anger and personal weapons will be on display - but nothing else. Virginia's governor thanked the NRA this week for an earlier peaceful protest. These are everyday people, and I suspect there will be kids.\n\nThe issue is quite simple. Rightly or wrongly - these rights exist.  The only way to take them away is to amend the Constitution. It cannot be a duty of citizens to constantly re-litigate rights they already have. Winks and end runs around the Constitution simply aren't allowed - so Virginia IS breaking the law here. Attempting to use the raw naked force of the state to take rights away.\n\nThe Constitution is our fundamental agreement. Eliminate that - and literally anything goes. Outsiders really have no grasp of how the Bill of Rights has always exerted control over us. Our last civil war was fought simply over the inconsistencies between that document and slavery's reality. Likely 90% of the population didn't give a damn about slaves....but the mental gymnastics required to justify those practices just became too onerous.\n\nCitizens DID give a damn about our own lies. Became weary of lying. Ultimately, our lies were purged by force. No one had any idea the purge would prove so costly. In today's equivalence, 6.2 million people were killed. WW2 was far less expensive.\n\nI don't expect violence at this protest. DO expect many future Wacos if Virginia State police attempt to seize guns from homes. Violence will flare very rapidly should that happen. There was already an incident 2months ago in NY state. Our luck will not last. There is real danger if they attempt to collect those guns.

If people believe that the cops are going to do the right thing, the protesters are going to do the right thing, the city/state/federal government is going to do the right thing, then it is easier for them to remain disciplined and do the right thing themselves.

[...]\n\nI'm not certain that marches have the impact claimed. Letters, phone calls, and visits to state legislatures have more impact.\n\nRemember this a while back when some state legislators were working through some liberalization bills, but the purists appeared in droves. As I told my own representative, \"gun owners need to be more careful about frightening momma and less caught up in zealotries du jour\". Those who have never been around guns often fear them.
