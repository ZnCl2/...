			"body": "I'm looking for a censorship free community. I'm not personally interested in anything that would be censored, but it's the principal of the thing. I firmly believe that all information should be allowed to be shared. The benefits of truly free speech outweigh the obvious costs.\n\nI tried Dread, Aether, Freenet (can't get it working), and I'm checking out Dispora now. But I keep going back to the censored trash that is reddit. \n\nWhere do you all hang out? Someone invite me please. I can't be the only person who values free speech and privacy, and still wants a community, right?",
