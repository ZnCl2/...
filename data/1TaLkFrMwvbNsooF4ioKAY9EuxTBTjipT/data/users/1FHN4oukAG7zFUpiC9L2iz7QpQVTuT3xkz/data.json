Our conclusion is that if something wrong with anyone who in charge of forum, chan, whole zeronet or anything else, other people can fork or rebuild with backup files. It's much easier to keep backup of zite than internet website. People inside GFW have experieced much tough situations than something you worried about, everything will be OK, believe us ;)",
