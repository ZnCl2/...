				"body": "the problem with filtering: you always have False Positives\nboth Black Sheep and White Wolves\n\nthis is why we have Two Stage Tests in Test Theory\nStage One = inclusive, find many positives, but also tolerate false positives\nStage Two = exclusive, filter out the false positives\nother names: mutation + selection, eugenics + euthanasia\n\nif the Four Quadrants are distributed equally\nStage One will select 3/4 = 75%\nStage Two will select 2/3 = 66%\nso Stage Two usually has higher selectivity\n\nlook at humans\nsome prefer tolerance, others prefer separation\nsee Melting Pot vs Cultural Mosaic\nor 'Left' vs 'Right' hand path\n\nhow to apply that 'useless theory' to bitmessage?\n\ni would call it The Caravan Moves On\n\nthe caravan travels between desert and oase.\nin the oase,\nyou have plenty resources, you are more free to play.\nin the desert,\nresources are limited, you are forced to prefer farsight.\n\noase translates to Public Chan or Blacklist Mode\nwhere newcomers can play = introduce their talent\n\ndesert translates to Private Chan or Whitelist Mode\nwhere trusted peers enjoy security\n\nalso look at other Secret Societies\nand their hierarchy = pyramid\nfrom tolerant outer circles\nto exclusive inner circles\n\nhow to integrate Black Sheep?\nyou need Talent Scouts in the outer circles\nwho are trusted by inner circle peers\nand have the hard job to 'stand bail' for their newcomer\n\nhow to fight White Wolves?\nkeep it small\nif a group grows 'beyond reason'\nor as soon as a White Wolf becomes black -- move on\nsplit the large group in smaller fragments / compartments\nand 'regroup' only the good apples\nand maybe push the Wolf to outer circles,\nwhere he-she-it can 'explain' or 'excuse' his trolling\n\nperiodic testing .... sleep wake cycles\n\nalso look at tags, or genres\nwith sub-genres merging into new genres, etc.\n\nhow is this different from a Web Of Trust?\ncos a, it is more forgetful\nand b, this model needs different Social Roles\nwhich are constant over time\n\nagain, look at humans\nsome make better Talent Scouts\nothers make better Insiders\n\nthese Social Roles are very limited in numbers\nonly four roles should work = Four Elements\nso you get Flat Hierarchies and good load balancing\nwith easy access to 'the one responsible' for his group\nin contrast to imperialism and religion\nwhere 'the one responsible' is always too far away\nand in the end, no one is responsible\n\nmy world view overrates Inborn Dualisms\njust like other views overrate Inborn Equality\nto me, that is also an Inborn Dualism\nto the others, it must be a Mental Disorder\nto me, different Typical Stress Response\n\nfor more insight, read my #alchi code\nhere is one 'synth draft' in the tor network\nhttp://m6su7s3ir7dxggwg.onion/haades/alchi\nmy model of group dynamics, game theory.\n\nso much for my first post here ^____^ \n\n#tldr\n\nalci",
