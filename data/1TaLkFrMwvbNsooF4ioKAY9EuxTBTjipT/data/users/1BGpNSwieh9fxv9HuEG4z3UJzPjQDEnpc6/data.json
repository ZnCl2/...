What happens if someone tries to do something malicious here or anywhere else?\n\nI'm thinking of XSS, SQL injection, no rate limiting present and so on. Basically OWASP stuff.\n\nMore specifically: then anyone who would download the zite would get that malware or the contaminated db on their home computer.",
