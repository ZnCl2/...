After billions of years, all these years alone in space, no TV, no radio, just empty , oh my mistake there were not even space and universe before Big Bang, don't know where bitch was was before Big Bang, anyway all the years finally he came up with the idea of creating humans and watching them doing things private. :) \nIf God exist then who created to him/her? If no one created God? Then how can it be a thing without a creator?\nIf God can exist without a creator, then simply everything and can do exist even without a creator.  \nAssume a creator (X) did exist Big Bang, how could he have survived the explosion??? OK, let say is all powerful and he is survivor,  he played with explosive thing, things did explode, what can  we say he had no mother to tell him not play with explosive thing. The questions is there billions of galaxies out there in space and countless planets why would God/X choose this planet earth?\nWhat would be the reason????\nWhat would be the reason for us humans to create an imaginary a God? \nMaybe law and order, man shall not kill, that is a good thing don't you think??? \nWe we needed him once, when humans were savages, cannibals. Well good for X, he was finally good for something. But do we really need X today???",
