[...]\n\ni understand your misunderstanding. as a former ancap, i would like to share my thoughts on libertarian socialism and its modern analogues. \ncritiques of capitalism establish that capitalist society necessitates a worker class and a capitalist class, with variants in each of those two major classes. the class of workers provides labor to the property-owning capitalist, who manages the workers and provides resources for them to combine labor with. typically, the pursuit of profit by the capitalist class leads to the excess value produced by the worker being stolen by the capitalist, someone who we as a society had decided to acknowledge autocratic ownership of the means of production by. this form of theft is no better than that of taxes by the state, even if the benefit is the asserted economic efficiency.\nmodern leftism has manifested itself in a variety of ways, such as marxism-leninism, marxism-leninism-maoism, juche, stalinism, etc. these are the ways that have resulted in governmental censorship, mass death, etc. i propose an alternative, anarchist-communism, where we view all unjust hierarchy as needing of purge, where productive use of the means of production establishes ownership, and society freely organizes into localities where democracy can thrive. in such a society little work is needed to produce the necessities of life, as the surplus value generated by the worker is no longer ripped from their arms and thrown to the capitalist or the state, and instead returned to the community that sustains the individual, that distributes all that they produce and trade without motivation by profit, but by motivation of existence. this society already can produce such high quantities of goods and services that without the parasites, society can ration out its produce generously. \nmy explanation may have been a bit lengthy, so i apologize. such a society requires a tremendous change in the consciousness of humanity, to build cooperative bonds, to educate the masses. but it is not impossible. \nif you are interested in reading, try \"the conquest of bread\" by peotyr kropotkin.",
