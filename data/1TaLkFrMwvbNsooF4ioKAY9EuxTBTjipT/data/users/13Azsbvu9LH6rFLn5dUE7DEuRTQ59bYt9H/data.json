			"title": "New Templar Order",
			"body": "So, I'm doing a bit of research as a side project into what the templars have become. I'm already aware of the organisations such as OSMTH, OSMTJ and this mystery site; https:www.knightstemplarorder.com/ . Whether this site is some elaborate scam or a troll I can't tell, mainly because there's elements of truth in the site too, which also reinforces the scam theory, but also claims to have a membership and works discretely. The entire site is just a confusing mess of ideas and lorem ipsum, and I'm heavily inclined to believe that OSMTH isn't as innocent as they appear to be. \n\nIn particular however, there is one term of the order that strikes me; \n>The Order shall not raise any standing army with the intention of conventional warfare\n(which has many, many loopholes)\nAnd according to their site, they both despise modern (and traditional) Islamism yet preach against racism, and apparently is doing \"aid work in Iraq.\" \n\nFurthermore, there is the claims I've been reading (forgot sources) that the templars were involved in conflicts during WW1 and 2 to defend Europe, (along with names I can't remember), meaning that they were operational after decomissioning, and in 1969 they were recognised by the UN and Switzerland as an official NGO. I believe this was on their website or one similar, but I will update if I find it again.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

				"body": "I'd have to agree on this in all honesty, but only to a certain extent. \n\nFirstly, yes; in the past we used religion to explain away concepts we had no scientific understanding of, i.e; how the sun rises and sets every day, or how storms are made. The only thing we haven't explained away is the afterlife and it's for that reason that I believe there may be a scientific explanation to life after biological death that we have not either discovered or are aware of. It's also for that reason why I do believe humans will conquer death one day, but I'm getting sidetracked. \n\nSecondly, the reason why people see themselves as having such a personal relationship with God is because it's a dynamic relationship with the self; the ego. It's why theists say they have the same opinions, intuitions etc as the theist. The theist *is* God, in a sense. What is really happening when they say 'God helps them in life' is really just them helping themselves but devoting that help to an external power. But of course they'll almost never accept that, because (mainly but not limited to) Christianity teaches its followers to be weak and feeble to be 'good.' \n\nFurthermore, people who often believe in God do so in fear. The most common belief is that the believers think that God is a monster, and that all he wants is people to worship him for days and years on end. The theist thinks that living in fear of a powerful being for a reward when they die is a good thing: that their benevolent creator has no integrity and would torture people who don't believe in him. They *worship* someone that tortures people out of love because they think they don't have a choice and they refuse to believe anything different. Why? Again, out of fear. I do find theists who think that are some of the most insulting people for this reason. \n(I should also add that I don't hate every single theist that would be retarded)\n\nI can go on forever how people use God to justify their actions, how God can be used to justify murder etc, how religions was used to influence people politically especially in ancient times, but that's not the point on why I'm writing this. (I actually have no idea on why I'm writing this, probably as revision on what my opinions are because I never care enough to remember them).\n\nI'm also going to add that we shouldn't stop people believing in God or criminalize it, since that wouldn't solve anything. Best we should do is continue advancements in science to just make religion obsolete, but until then, leave the people to believe what they want until then. So many people would rather want to fight their perceived enemy rather than advance their own knowledge to beat the opposition in the most efficient way possible. I honestly think that people don't want to really 'beat' their enemy, just shout them down as a means of feeling good about themselves. \n\nAnyway that's my essay done, hopefully I made sense. I'll probably come back in 5 days time and reword everything I said.",
