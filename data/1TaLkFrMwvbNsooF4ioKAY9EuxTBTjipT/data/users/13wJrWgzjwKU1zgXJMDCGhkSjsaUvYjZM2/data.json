			"title": "Voat, the ‘Censorship-Free’ Reddit, Begs Users to Stop Making Death Threats",
			"body": "The Reddit clone Voat has reportedly been contacted by a “US agency” about threats being made on the censorship-free website, according to its founder Justin Chastain.\n\nIn a post on Wednesday, Chastain (who goes by PuttItOut on Voat) told users they need to “chill on the ‘threats,’” as the platform had been officially approached by an unnamed agency over some of its content. Chastain said he didn’t want to litigate free speech, but that Voat would cooperate with law enforcement and remove “gray area” posts if asked.\n\nVoat users took offense to the perceived curtailing of their ability to post racial slurs and endorse violence.\n\nThe first comment on Chastain’s post opened with an anti-Semitic slur and call to exterminate Jews. The Voat user cited a 1969 First Amendment Supreme Court case involving a Ku Klux Klan leader who gave a televised speech targeting certain races, arguing that the court ruled a threat needs to be specific in order to be illegal. The user then gave an example of a specific call for violence against a specific synagogue on a specific day. This comment was still up at the time of writing.\n\nVoat was founded in 2014 as a free speech Reddit knockoff and became an enclave for far-right topics. Many of its users had jumped ship from Reddit, which was beginning to ban vicious communities such as r/FatPeopleHate, r/CoonTown, and one Qanon subreddit, r/GreatAwakening—also coinciding with the advent of deplatforming, which has successfully cut the reach of people like Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos and their extremist ideologies.\n\n“Again, who contacted you? A US agency? Voat’s financier?” one user wrote, to which Chastain replied, “Yes,” specifying that an agency had reached out.\n\nChastain could not be reached by Motherboard, and it’s also unclear which comments were allegedly flagged as threats.\n\nBut in the past, the FBI has taken an interest in online postings by far-right communities and users. Last year, FBI officials infiltrated Gab, another “free speech social network,” to investigate an online acquaintance of Robert Bowers who is accused of murdering 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe FBI did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s questions about whether it had approached Voat or Chastain.\n\n“We always err on the side of not removing any content (don't even remember when I last did) but things are getting hot and it's important we understand this as a community,” Chastain replied to another user.\n\nThe future of Voat has been hanging on tenterhooks for several years now. In 2017, Chastain told members that licensing and hosting costs were unsustainable without outside funding which the site was struggling to secure; no longer relying on PayPal donations since the payments platform cut ties with Voat over “obscenity.”",

			"title": "“I’m taking my life because of my work at France Telecom. It’s the only reason,” the note said.",
			"body": "The toll is shocking: 19 suicides, 12 suicide attempts and eight cases of serious depression among employees over a three-year span at France’s main telephone and internet company.\n\nA long-awaited trial began Monday in Paris accusing telecom giant Orange and seven former or current managers of moral harassment and related charges. The company — then called France Telecom — was undergoing job cuts and modernization efforts at the time of the suicides a decade ago.\n\nUnions say France’s big companies haven’t learned any lessons from what happened at France Telecom, and about 200 activists demonstrated outside the courthouse Monday to urge a conviction.\n\nThe defendants include the former president of France Telecom, Didier Lombard, former human resources director Olivier Barberot and former deputy executive director Louis-Pierre Wenes. They spoke briefly one by one Monday at the trial, which is the largest to date in France for moral harassment on a company-wide scale.\n\nThe defendants are suspected of having “degraded work conditions of personnel that risked hurting their rights and dignity, altering the physical or mental health (of personnel), or compromising their professional future.”\n\nFour other officials are suspected of complicity in moral harassment.\n\nIn France, moral harassment can be punished by a year in prison and a fine of 15,000 euros ($16,790). Orange itself is also on trial, and the court could order the company to grant additional damages to each civil party in the case.\n\nAn investigation into the wave of employee suicides between 2007 and 2010 was opened following a complaint from the Sud union. At the time, Lombard allegedly referred to the deaths as “the fashion.”\n\nLombard, who was replaced as France Telecom chief in 2010, has denied all the charges. He attributed the suicides, attempted suicides and cases of depression to “local difficulties with no links to each other” and no relation to the company’s job cuts at the time.\n\nThe indictment lists the employees who took their lives or tried to, some on the job.\n\nMichel, 50, left a note about his decision to end his life on July 29, 2009, according to the prosecutor’s report. Michel’s note denounced “the permanent sense of urgency, overwork, absence of training, the total disorganization of the company” plus “management by terror.”\n\n“I’m taking my life because of my work at France Telecom. It’s the only reason,” the note said.\n\nA month earlier, Christel, 37, slashed her veins in an apparent bid to kill herself in front of two superiors who told her hours earlier she would be transferred. In March 2009, 52-year-old Herve was preparing to jump from an office window but the noise he was making drew others to his rescue.\n\nJean-Michel, a father of three children, was 53 when he threw himself in front of a train on July 2, 2008, while on the phone with two union delegates.\n\nFrance Telecom, once a state-owned monopoly, transformed into a private company in the 2000s. Lombard launched a restructuring plan aimed at shedding 22,000 jobs, but most employees were still considered civil servants and so were protected from layoffs.\n\nAs it sought to reduce staff, the indictment says the company imposed “excessive and intrusive control” on employees, assigned workers to demoralizing tasks, failed to provide training, isolated staff and used “intimidation maneuvers or threats and pay cuts.”\n\nLombard’s lawyer, Jean Veil, says his client is innocent because he could not possibly know what was going on in France Telecom’s vast network of more than 100,000 employees.\n\n“Mr. Didier Lombard is suspected of harassment of people he never saw,” Veil said in 2012, when Lombard was handed preliminary charges. “Now there’s a surprising accusation.”",

By the dictionary, duende means elf, goblin, or woodland spirit but that is honestly more of it etymological root rather than current usage. This article touches on how most of currently usage could be translated as meaning roughly \"an emotional response to art.\" So taken as a whole, the phrase roughly means: Emotion (in response to art) without Fear.\n\nhttp://www.camdamage.com",

			"title": "She Told Him to Kill Himself. He Did. Should She Be Held Responsible?",
			"body": "When Massachusetts police announced in 2014 that they were charging a teenage girl with manslaughter for goading her boyfriend into suicide with a series of bullying texts—some of them as he sat in his pickup truck, debating whether to switch on the motor that would poison him with carbon monoxide—there seemed little doubt of her guilt.\n\nNot necessarily her legal guilt. Though 39 states have laws against assisting or encouraging suicide, Massachusetts wasn't one of them. And Michelle Carter was not only miles away when her boyfriend, Conrad Roy III, turned on that motor, she was just 17—a year younger than Conrad and certainly not a parent, teacher, or custodial adult. Telling him to go ahead and kill himself seemed like a mordant and horribly reprehensible exercise of First Amendment rights. To turn on its head an ancient parental rebuttal to the my-friends-told-me-to-it defense: If your friends told you to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge, would you do it? And even if the answer is yes, is it their fault?\n\nBut there was a second charge against Carter, even if it was only filed in the court of public opinion: that she was a \"heartless bitch,\" as one reporter interviewed in the HBO documentary I Love You, Now Die called her, adding, \"this coercive ice queen who killed a guy in order to become popular.\"\n\nOn this, the case seemed open and shut. The texts from Carter that cops found in Roy's phone, sent over a period of months, were colder than an Arctic night. When he said he wasn't sure how to do it, Carter's reply sounded like a macabre take on Paul Simon: \"Drink bleach. Why don't you just drink bleach? Hang yourself. Jump over a building, stab yourself, idk. There's a lot of ways.\"\n\nAnd in another text to a friend after Roy's body was found, Carter seemed to confess. \"His death is my fault like honestly I could have stopped him,\" she wrote. \"I was on the phone with him and he got out of the car because it was working and he got scared and I fucking told him to get back in.\" Small wonder that a local woman asked by a TV reporter what she thought of the case replied, \"You little snot, how could you do that to a human being, you piece of crap?\"\n\nIn fact, there was a lot more to the story, as the fascinating and often horrifying I Love You, Now Die—one of three two-part crime documentaries HBO will air this month—makes clear. Carter and Roy played out a fantasy that they were a millennial Romeo and Juliet, their passions fed by anti-depressants and a mutual fascination with suicide, wooing each other not with poetry but plagiarized texts.\n\nLiving in different but nearby towns in the southern leg of Massachusetts, they met in Florida, where their families were both vacationing and almost instantly bonded, in no small part over their social anxiety, clinical depression, suicide attempts (one for her, at least four for him) and disturbingly dark worldviews. When Roy confided he'd seen the devil—it's not clear if he's speaking metaphorically or literally—Carter quickly declares she does, too. \"A lot, actually,\" she adds.\n\nBut their relationship was almost entirely digital. After returning home, they met no more than five times over the next two years, yet bombarded one another with thousands of texts, many of their lines purloined from the teen-angst TV musical Glee. How much of their hellbound race was real and how much was fantasy—and whether they understood the difference—is an open question.\n\nWhat is clear is that Carter didn't plant the idea of killing himself in Roy's head. If the texts themselves weren't convincing enough that he was obsessed with the idea, the videos and notebooks full of suicide notes and bleak self-appraisals like \"There's something wrong with me,\" surely are. But if Carter wasn't the intellectual author of Roy's death wish, neither did she report it to his parents or doctors or anybody else who might have helped him.\n\nAnd in the final two weeks before his death, Carter seemed to actively encourage him, badgering him about where and when he planned to follow through on his threats: \"The time is right and you're ready, you just need to do it!\"\n\nShe even seems to have staged a sort of dry run 48 hours before his suicide, texting other girls at her school that her out-of-town boyfriend had disappeared and she was afraid he had killed himself. \"It's all my fault,\" she wrote. \"I was supposed to save him he needed me. I let him down.\"\n\nActually, as Carter was well aware, Roy was very much alive and deluging her with texts. Her attorney and expert psychiatric witnesses would later heap scorn on the prosecution's theory that she was setting herself up as the \"grieving girlfriend\" who needed social support, but they didn't have any alternative explanation.\n\nThat wasn't the only weakness in their case. Carter's most sensible defense—that words are not weapons, whatever she may have told Roy, he didn't have to do it—had been obliterated before the trial when the Massachusetts Supreme Court refused to quash her indictment.\n\nInstead, they argued that the single most damning piece of evidence against Carter—her texted confession to a friend that she ordered Roy back into the carbon-monoxide-filled car when his resolve wavered—was a lie to gain perverse sympathy (oddly mirroring, in a way, the prosecution's \"grieving girlfriend\" scenario). And perhaps if Carter made that claim from the witness stand, it would have worked. But she didn't testify.\n\nThat sealed her fate, legally; she was convicted of manslaughter. And in the court of public opinion, she fared even worse. \"If you're gonna do a last tweet,\" Carter wrote to Roy, \"can it be about me?\" The rest was silence.",

			"title": "Devoted grocery store worker fired for chasing shoplifter kills himself",
			"body": "A British supermarket worker once commended for his “outstanding service” killed himself a week after he was fired for leaving his post to chase a shoplifter, according to a new report.\n\nShaun Winstanley, 49, from Staining near Blackpool, Lancashire, worked as a customer assistant at the Tesco Express chain for 17 years and won several awards, The Mirror reported Monday.\n\nBut on Jan. 2, he ran after a shoplifter at the store — an act that the company said put both himself and a customer in danger, according to the report.\n\nThe supermarket chain fired Winstanley on Jan. 14 — and despite his attempt to appeal the decision, the company decided to uphold it on Feb. 6, the outlet reported.\n\nHe was found dead on Feb. 13, and an investigation determined that he suffocated himself at home, the outlet reported.\n\nWinstanley had a history of mental health issues that escalated in May 2018 — when he was robbed at gunpoint, according to the report. His condition gradually deteriorated, and his firing only made things worse, an investigation into the death revealed.\n\nHis heartbroken stepdaughter, Siobhan Winstanley, 28, testified that she wrote to the supermarket chain after her father’s death — only to be told the matter was closed.\n\n“It is very raw and very difficult for us to come to terms with,” Winstanley said, according to the outlet. “He was of the very strong opinion that [suicide] was a selfish thing to do, so obviously it’s not something he would have done lightly, knowing he had children.”\n\n“I am angry at Tesco,” she added. “We have got our father in an urn in our living room. I sit there every morning with my coffee and look at him and wonder maybe if things had been different, he would still be here. I think there needs to be an awareness of mental health and I think employers need to be doing right by their employees.”\n\nA friend became concerned after he didn’t hear from Winstanley for days after his dismissal, the investigation also determined.\n\nThe friend visited the home on Feb. 13, only to find the door locked, lights on and his pal’s Bichon Frise dog, Benji, barking. He knocked, but received no response.\n\nAn arriving detective, Col. Carl Harris, testified that he found Winstanley’s body on the floor in a lounge area of the home. There were no signs of any injuries, or any disturbance, he said.\n\nCoroner Clare Doherty ruled Winstanley’s death a suicide, according to the report.\n\n“A friend spoke with Mr. Winstanley on Feb. 8 and he expressed thoughts of self-harm,” Doherty said. “It seems to tie in with the fact that he had appealed the loss of his job and he had not been successful in that appeal on that day.”\n\nTesco is “extremely sad to hear about the death of Mr. Winstanley,” the company said in a statement.\n\n“Unfortunately, we are unable to comment on individual circumstances relating to our colleagues.”",

			"title": "Farmer convicted in massive organic food fraud dies by suicide",
			"body": "A Missouri farmer who was sentenced to prison for racking up millions by falsely advertising organic food has died by suicide, a coroner said Tuesday.\n\nRandy Constant, 61, was found dead in a vehicle in the garage of his Chillicothe, Mo., home Monday evening, police said.\n\nInvestigators had held a news conference in Iowa hours earlier announcing Constant’s prison sentence.\n\nThe Livingston County coroner said Constant died from carbon monoxide poisoning. The finding was confirmed by a post-mortem examination at the University of Missouri Medical Center, he said.\n\nProsecutors said Constant falsely marketed non-organic corn and soybeans as certified organic on a massive scale. His sales amounted to 7 percent of organic corn grown in the U.S. in 2016 and 8 percent of the organic soybeans.\n\nConstant also owned an Iowa-based brokerage, which sold his grain as feed for chickens and cattle. Those animals were then marketed for their meat and meat products that were advertised as organic.\n\nU.S. District Judge C.J. Williams said Constant did “extreme and incalculable damage” to consumers who were fooled into paying extra to buy supposedly “organic” products like eggs and steak. Instead, they purchased food that relied on farming practices like the use of chemical pesticides to grow crops, he said.\n\nA federal judge sentenced Constant at a hearing on Friday for leading what prosecutors dubbed the “Field of Schemes fraud.”\n\n“We are still in shock and disbelief over yesterday’s events, when my husband took his own life,” Constant’s wife, Pam, said in a statement. “I know Randy was deeply ashamed of his conduct. As much as we tried to be there for him ... it was clearly just too much for Randy.”\n\nShe said he would be remembered as “a wonderful father, community leader, tireless volunteer and my beloved husband of 39 years.”\n\nConstant had been free on bond since pleading guilty to wire fraud last December and had cooperated with investigators since 2017.\n\nConstant's lawyer, Mark Weinhardt, described his client last week as a “pillar of the community” who had served on the school board and donated his time and money to local causes and the Methodist church. He said he was stunned by the contradiction between Constant’s record of good deeds and his lengthy fraud sheet.\n\nConstant’s death came as prosecutors publicized his prison term, which they said would deter other farmers from defrauding the National Organic Program.\n\n“Randy Constant and his co-conspirators lied to the American public and cheated thousands of consumers,” U.S. Attorney Peter E. Deegan Jr. said. “For years, Constant put personal greed and self-interest above all else.”",
