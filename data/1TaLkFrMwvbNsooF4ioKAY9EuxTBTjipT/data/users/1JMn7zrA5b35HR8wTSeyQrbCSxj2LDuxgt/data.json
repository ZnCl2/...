			"body": "I run a small privacy focused business offering a \"BS\" blocking VPN service as well as webhosting/servers. We do a lot of I2P stuff, some Tor stuff and even a little Yggdrasil stuff but don't really donate any spare resources to Zeronet and I'd like to change that.\n\nWhat does Zeronet need the most right now to help the network? Does location diversity matter much with ZeroNet? (Ex: Needing trackers or peers in under represented locations?)",

I know there exists a I2P to ZeroNet bridge. Yggdrasil just pushed a big update and I need to reconfigure my existing things to be compatible. But a Yggdrasil ZeroNet instance shouldn't be difficult and could be useful!",
