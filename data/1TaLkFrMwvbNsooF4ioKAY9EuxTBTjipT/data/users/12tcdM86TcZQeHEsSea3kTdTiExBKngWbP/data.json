			"title": "Fuck SystemD",
			"body": "((Non-autistic rant edition))\nWe're so fucking sick of systemd shills and defenders who think that systemd is perfectly fine when in reality it takes up so much space on the system and is the shittiest init system ever to be written; systemd is literally hitler. \n\nNo software should be 1.8 millions lines of code, have its own libraries, then core utilities, targets, its own services, and create so many dependancies that it becomes way too hard to remove. The argument that \"you can just change distros, you have choice!\" doesn't really hold up when you realise they're just becoming complacent and not realizing that choice is being able to install any linux distro, and run any init system you want; choice isn't giving up because you've toiled so long to try and remove it and just switch to another distribution. That's not what Linux should be. But systemd violates this.\n\nSo let's say you finally bite the bullet and try to use systemd. Well good luck because they changed the grammar of the arguments, your old systems no longer exist and everything is now a systemd utility. System Event Log? Nope, that's journalctl now. Mounting filesystems? Nope that's another systemd utility. Want to mess with your services? Well it's no longer sudo service (((service))) start it's now `sudo systemctl start (((service)))\n\nPortability is also another issue; it's impossible to port any kind of config you create, and you'll just have to set it all up again on your next system. OpenRC; a largely hackable and flexible init system handles portability and configuration excellently. And if you configure it correctly you can have you system boot in 10 seconds, which is impressive. No other init system is as bad with this as sysd, and this is a major oversight that should have been seen to during its inception.\nAnd Lennart does deserve a LOT of criticism for his behavior, I don't care what anyone else says. The origin of sysd, which has close ties with Red Hat (That one company which works closely with the US Govt and is a big part of Linux) is equally suspicious, and does make for the perfect conspiracy; a way for Nation states and private companies to control Linux and its users. \n\nAnd on top of all this, while trying to remove your cucked piece of software you end up rebooting, hopefully following all the steps, you removed the bloated piece of shit that is BASH, replace it with ZSH, then reboot and, everything's broken! So. You try to rebuild your broken system, typing in commands for hours on end to try and regain what you once had and then you reboot and then your bootloader got fucked, you can't take out your hardrive to fix your xorg/Wayland files because it won't eve be recognized. And so you finally give up and switch to a systemd-less fork of what you were running before but you realise all the software you wanted to use before is changed and everything feels so different and foreign so you give up on that entire line of distributions altogether and go to Void. \nAND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON VOID.\n\nFuck systemd.",

[...]\n\nDon't get me wrong, we do need something *like* systemd for linux and especially BSD, but SystemDicked itself is garbage. Something like journalctl can be implemented much better than it is with SysD and definitely should be made and implemented, but having a monolithic system that you can't remove in your computer that only saves you a few seconds of typing in a command isn't worth it. (zsh is much better for finding files by the way, but either way POSIX is pretty shit). \n\nCan kind of agree with you on the scripting part, but at the same time, SysD accomplishes writing scripts for every other sysd system which is great until you realise that it's essentially creating its own sort of ecosystem. And having linux being polarised between sysd and non-sysd distros isn't great for anyone. That combined with how quickly it was introduced, and who's behind it only leads to suspicion. And because of sysd's size it's also hard to audit; lest we never forget that god awful bug where jornalctl would allocate memory on the stack back in 2016.\n\nAs for its init system, in Lennart's post 'Rethinking PID1' he noted that in respect to MacOS' launchd system, he wanted to minimise the number of services started on powering on the machine to reduce boot time, but sysd barely accomplishes this, if at all. Most it does is restart services if they crash and has a command to reload the service, which is again, barely an inconvenience in spite of just disabling and re-enabling it.\nMy gentoo installation with OpenRC on a HDD was faster than my current Debian installation, which takes ~40s to bring me to lightdm.\nNot to mention the god awful security risk of running NTP over PID1. \nSysD's service management is.. okay at most. (Not going to bring up the fact that it was ripped off of launchd because it's kind of irrelevant in the discussion). \nOpenRC works much better mainly cause of its portability and has a decent service model. I don't want to sound like I'm shilling it, but it's the best example I can use since I have experience with it. Sysvint is equally good respectively.\n\nAgain, we need something *like* SysD, but this implementation of it can respectfully go fuck itself. And fuck LP.",

There was also the promise of a long, loving, stable relationship by being caring and understanding relationship and that the girl will love them for being soft but caring. So these men became soft, caring, loving etc from early on, and working honestly and hard. Then in whatever recent year, women turned around and said 'God why are men so soft? We prefer stronger men who can protect us...' yada yada. So all these young men who wanted be the perfect man for this, now fictional woman are left by the wayside by the Chads.\n\nYou don't have to imagine how this makes them feel, it's the same reason why doomers exist; young men who've been left behind the world and can't adapt.\nAnd so the awkward young man goes up to any normie, or anyone in conventional society in general and asks 'how do I get a girlfriend?' And this is where the 'just be yourself bro' meme comes from. Because their current self is not wanted, and god knows if they even know who they even are. So they try to do everything and just end up failing of course, and when they do fail, they're just left by the wayside by the rest of the people in society. And when he gets mad and frustrated at everything that's happened to him, he of course, gets mad. And then of course, that only generates a negative response towards them; it's society out-casting them for not being able to fit in. They're rejects. 'Losers.' And of course there's a ton of meme advice they get too that I'm not even going to start to get into. 'Just lift bro' and all that shit.\n\nAnd so they go to obscure places on the internet to talk with other young men who face the same problem until it just becomes a circlejerk of hating the world, themselves, others, pretty much anyone. And all that hatred just feeds into itself, and going to these places on the internet it not only their relief, but also negatively impacts their psyche. \nThis equally isn't good because- fuck it I'll just let Contrapoints talk about the rest cause I'm too tired for this shit;\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD2briZ6fB0\n23:44 - 30:25 are the only parts really relevant, and you can skip the bit in between. She doesn't really get a lot of the rest right in my opinion.\n\nFinally, the reason as to why they're hated so much is for the simple reason that the masses (society) is bored, and have no clear goal. So they give themselves one; to fight off a common enemy. That new target, is the incel community. In other words, normies are demonising the people they indirectly created and treating them like literal terrorists in the name of self righteousness and wanting to be good people. It's all a sick ego boost.\n\nSo yea, incels in a nutshell. Hope you enjoyed my little blogpost. Also fuck normies.",

Not surprising a lot of people go missing there.\n\nIf you have/could point me in the direction of evidence for that it'd be greatly appreciated. That would also explain R29 and solve that mystery.

I haven't heard of any route 29 disappearance although twitter always has a missing picture posted about every month now. If you could share some of your research with me I'd love to help!\n\nIf you still know anyone in the area, ask them about anything suspicious pertaining in the Newport News area; the US Navy has a port there which is a likely suspect for the transport of the abducted people.  If anyone's been contacted via phone calls or text messages by someone they don't know tell them to stay away from it, and ignore them. \nThe research we have is fairly limited, and most of it has been posted here already, which is why the information we're looking for is of such high importance cause at the end of the day, word of mouth doesn't account for much.\n\nI'm currently looking into previously owned properties by gangs near the area too, and one particular group which may have some affilitation with all of this.
