I have no sympathy for those who encouraged the creation of this coercive monstrosity (EU) but whom only claim credit when it does things they support.\"Concentrated power is not rendered harmless by the good intentions of those who created it\" - Milton Friedman\n\nThe EU is absolutely disgusting.
