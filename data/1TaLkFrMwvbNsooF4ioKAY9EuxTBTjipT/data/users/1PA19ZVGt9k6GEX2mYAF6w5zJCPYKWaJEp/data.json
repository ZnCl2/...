People go to work, take care of their kids, go out to a bar to have a drink with friends or whatever. It's like small town America, but people generally keep their bullshit to themselves instead of making a cause out of everything like back home. Maybe Shanghai or Shenzhen is more exciting but I haven't made it out that way yet.\n\nIt's a good place to have a family, though. I remember going out with friends one night and getting a bit drunker than I'd care to be. On the way back, I cut through an unlit small alley. Now remember, this is in the center of a city that rivals New York or Los Angeles in size. Anyway, up ahead there was a group of guys in black leather jackets smoking. So, I'm thinking to myself that they'll probably cause some trouble with me the lone white guy walking drunk as hell pass them. I get up to near them and one turns to me and makes eye contact, smiles and lets out a half assed hello. I wave and smile as I walk by and they all start laughing. Seriously the safest place you'll ever go. No melon munchers nor bean biters. I love it here, but that's just my experience. Some people come and don't care for it.",

Despite how the Western media makes it sound, China isn't North Korea. Hell, I've never been so I don't even know if North Korea is really like that. But I sure as hell know what life is like in China and it really isn't bad at all. Boring? Maybe. Orwellian? Hell no.

All they will accomplish is forcing China's hand like with Xinjiang. Is that what Hong Kongers want for themselves?

[...]\n\nLawl, you're a comedic genius. \n\nAnd yes, I can comment on where specifically you are spreading disinformation:\n\n\"There are numerous ways of getting in trouble in China. A lot of people resent westeners a hatred which is fed by almost every movie that the government produces.\"\n\nThere are numerous ways of getting in trouble in any country, it's called breaking the law. A lot of losers from the West come here and think they should be treated as some type of royalty because of their misconception of China as a poor country. This jackasses think they can go around smoking joints and working illegally and then are so shocked to find out that China doesn't need to put up with their shit.\n\n\"In the nightclub scene a lot of Chinese hate westeners for taking the prettiest women. They'll approach you offer to buy you drinks and when you are quite drunk, then they'll kick the shit out of you.\"\n\nMost Chinese women I see with foreigners in clubs are ugly skanks, like the white trash that date black guys. No one is jealous. I've watched another American guy come into a club drunk as hell and started trying to hit on some guy's girl. The guy asked us to handle him and we told him to calm down. He kept making an ass of himself and the dude knocked him across the face. What a poor Westerner, the Chinaman should have just let himself be cucked, right? Faggot. Also, offering you free drinks? Those evil fucks.\n\n\n\"Then there is the government and the police themselves. They're behind most of the crimes. If you displease somebody in government, for any reason, they can make life very hard for you. The authorities themselves will vandalize your property, kill your pet, etc. The Communist system has no feedback mechanism so there is no where to complain.\"\n\nI don't even know how to reply to this bullshit. With the club thing, at-least I had some basis of understanding where you could be coming from. This is straight up pulled from someone's ass.\n\n\"If you want to communicate with others, all communications are heavily monitored by state agencies. If you go to church and make friends there, the government will be deciding who you are allowed to be friends with and what you can talk about. If they don't like who you are talking to they'll block all telephone or chat communication.\"\n\nYeah, it's terrible. A government monitoring their people's online activities. No Western government would ever do some shit like that... *cough.... As for deciding who you are friends with, more poorly written fanfiction on your part. People here are friends with whomever they choose to be friends with. I have friends on all political spectra, even some Chinese who disagree with the government.  :O < (that's me making a shocked face). If you've been arrested for causing public disturbances, yeah, I could imagine you being kept from social media. But fuck those people anyway.\n\n\"China is not a good place. If you stay there long enough, you'll realize that.\"\n\nYeah, ten years here. A buddy of mine has been here fifteen. All I've realized in that time is that a lot, not the majority mind you, but a lot of faggot foreigners that come here seem to think they are owed something by China and its people. When they realize Chinese men and women aren't just waiting to be cucked by foreigners, they pout and complain before moving to the Philippines or some other shit country where they'll be treated as special.\n\nSo yeah, again, you are a liar and a piece of shit.

They value education, they value hard work, they value reason and logic, they value basically everything the West did up till the point the West decided it was more important to embrace diversity and empower the women than to encourage critical thinkers and hard workers.\n\nPlus, I think of it like this: what are you fighting for? Your people, your blood, right? In the U.S. it's taught that authority is an enemy, that smart white men are always the villains, and that being a hard worker or a good students makes you a loser.

Besides Chinese, most of my friends are Slavs; Russians and Ukrainians, or Brits. Good folk. The Americans that come to China are generally faggots; such as this one cunt here who was arguing that only whites could be racist (she was white, obviously).\n\nAs for Balkanization, I think it will never be allowed to happen. In the next twenty years or so, America will have it's last White male president. After that, the country and military will be controlled by leaders that will need to use you as a means of keeping the GDP acceptable. Read about Catalonia in Spain. \n\nThe obsession for the far East, that's more a Japanese thing. China is like Detroit in its heyday; industrial and with opportunities to get a good job. Japan is like L.A., full of faggots. They attract different types. I never planned to marry a Chinese nor settle here; things played out that way, but I just came for a job.\n\nBut about the cutting bait, I don't think it will ever just be an obvious moment.

Have you noticed their taste for large women, their taste for strong women, for financially independent women? Why? Well, those traits make perfect sense if you intend to mate with a female and then leave and not help raise the resultant child. A big woman must have food resources, a strong woman can protect her offspring and independent women will not need your help raising a child.\n\nWhites, Asians and Arabs on the other hand also generally share a certain taste in women: thin, dependent and physically weaker than ourselves. Why? We enter into a contract with them whereby we provide protection and support and they offer exclusive access to their vaginas and commitment to maintaining our households. \n\nWestern and Eastern society both relied on this model. We rear our children with attention and the division of labour between man and woman has allowed us to improve our lots from one generation to the next.

There is no doubt in my mind that a father who takes advantage of his daughter, even one who is nominally over 18 and an \"adult\", is committing an extreme abuse of power that can be criminally penalized.  The notion of prosecuting the daughter utterly sickens me, even before her confinement to a location leaves her vulnerable to murder.  (Katie Pladl)  To me, prosecuting her is the same sickness as laws against homosexuality, and giving her baby, if she had one, a special exemption from abortion laws meant to preserve human life is to say it is an untermensch that should be exterminated for genetic inferiority.  Yes, the risk of genetic disease in incestuously conceived infants is much higher.  But those babies who DON'T have a genetic disease have had their DNA \"wrung out\", so to speak, and we now know they don't carry harmful recessive genes in full randomly chosen one-fourth of their genome. [...]\n\nYeah, I also find the whole concept pretty disturbing. However, I don't believe it is the power dynamic that offends, more an instinctual repulsion to the idea of mating with your own offspring. For example, a man, in sleeping with a slave of his, doesn't elicit any of the raw disgust that the concept of incest does for me. I think it's simply evolution telling us that we'll fuck up our offspring and lower their reproductive fitness.",

Incest makes more of them meet up, but this is something that would have happened anyway at some point.  So if you assume we're going back to the Stone Age, nothing of value is lost.  If you think we are headed to gene therapy utopia in two generations, maybe it's a nasty thing to do.  But even if it is a nasty thing to do ... how does it compare to old men siring babies (higher mutation rate) or old women delivering them (more Down syndrome)?\n\nIt's a numbers game. I think that's why historically cousin luvin' was fairly acceptable, incest between siblings was looked down upon and incest between parent and offspring has always been considered sickening. Parents and offspring share 50% of their chromosomes. \n\nAlso, old men siring babies has never been a problem.",

But children also share 50% on average (AC shares A with AC, AD and C with AC, BC: note you have to count AC-AC as a possibility because there's nothing to keep the random passage of genes from repeating)  So both parent-child and brother-sister are \"first order relatives\".  Parents are only more sickening because of the abuse of power and abandonment of the parent's role, not genetics.\n\nWhile it is possible for siblings to be 100% related, it is also possible for them to be 0%. I think appearance would be one indicator and I'd find a sexual pairing of siblings that looked similar to be more off-putting than a pairing that were very different in appearance. \n\nWhat are your feelings about Woody Allen marrying his adopted daughter?

While there are more abortions happening amongst the poor, they also have a much higher reproductive rate in general.

Also, their lot in life is largely owed to their genetic potential. So, the priority should be on reducing abortions for the in-group high-income women and also increasing their rate of reproduction in general.

Animals that have a stronger tendency toward calorie -dependence are not rewarded more than animals without a tendency toward calorie -dependence as the later doesn't exist. We are all equally calorie -dependent and those that can satiate their desire reproduce their DNA and those that don't die. \n\nAll life is greedy. ",

				"body": "https://study.com/academy/lesson/average-age-of-marriage-throughout-history.html\n\n\"Still, while marriageable age was rather young, not everyone married at that exact age. For instance, in ancient Rome, a society who did keep extensive written records, someone was considered eligible for marriage at age 14. For many families, this was the perfect time to arrange a marriage for your daughter and son, but for some families, there could be an advantage to waiting. If a child had political, social, or economic opportunities, there could be advantages to holding off on their marriage for a few years until they achieved a greater political, social, or economic position. So, ages of marriage varied widely across the modern world, but on average were still young by our standards. \"\n\n\"One of the first times we see a major concern about the age difference between couples is in England in 1275 CE. In a law prohibiting rape, it was also declared illegal to 'ravish a maiden' within a certain age, with or without her permission. That age was determined by jurist Sir Edward Coke to mean the age of marriage, which at the time was 12. This still seems young, but it's one of the first times we see a strict age limit placed on marriage or sexual interaction. This was the beginning of our modern association between the age of marriage and age of consent.\"\n\nAge of Consent in European & American History. Portugal, Spain, Denmark and the Swiss canons, initially set the age of consent at 10-12 years and then raised it to between 13 and 16 years in the second half of the 19th century. Historically, the English common law set the age of consent to range from 10- 12.\"",

Women shouldn't be controlled against their will anymore than men should be controlled against their will, however it is prudent to recognize the differences psychologically between men and women, and how people react to both the sexes. Look up \"Women are Wonderful Effect\" to see how biased most people are for women. This plays out practically in the fact that women have a natural social advantage over virtually all men, but then they also want the social advantages men have created via society WITHOUT the responsibilities that go along with it (They want equal pay, but don't want to take stressful/dangerous jobs, they don't want to be eligible for the draft, they want gender quotas in jobs and universities of their choice instead of it being merit based, etc). [...]\n\nSociety controls us against our wills daily. You can only eat, smoke, watch, do or say what has been allowed you by your government and social norms. All rights are given or taken in response to force. Men have force, females don't. Their only rights are the ones we give them. So, why do we give them rights that disadvantage ourselves?
