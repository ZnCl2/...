See Zerobiztalk for real solutions : http://127.0.0.1:43110/1KpLYGMGkVSMyHjJzBhSFvN8qXK1xXExpN/\n\n> [elr23423nksdasd](#comment_5_1KFTNuxkQipsabR2q9XhxxTTtqn9QiSxeP): Jeff Bezos just bought a 500 millions $ yatch, by exploiting (looting) from \"we the people\", are you going to go after him? I just think it's funny people still think communism is a big threat a hundred year later, while completely ignoring the actual current problems and voting against their own interests (and not knowing what communism or marxism is, it's just anyone I disagree with). The irony of falling for propaganda while trying to fight propaganda.\n\nSpecially for those interested about yachting : http://127.0.0.1:43110/1KpLYGMGkVSMyHjJzBhSFvN8qXK1xXExpN/?Topic:1621673858_1ATMPS5rPc8as7ywdMTXMHD4bkX2wfuwmE/I+need+your+help+to+buy+myself+a+big+yacht\n\nMay I ask you one question as you seem very jealous of the success of Jeffrey Preston Bezos the 1st... Is his shipboat (I guess the rocket fleet still need more debugging) an ICE boat or a real wind boat? \n\nWhat is his plan when marxists - non humans to be exterminated - pretending to use \"science\" (http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1621828480_17acbn9sNyYyLJrLfSz3KJxqonKZtgVxCD) to forbid him access to CARBON based energy stored to follow the UNO agenda goals of their 2020 marxist agenda (which consist in destroying the first world (which has invented everything, from rockets to internet) so that the african supremacists that the Obamas supports, can garner the resources and growth necessary to conquer all the white and asian worlds as they did in South Africa?\n\nI understand that for little zealots and weak minded intellectually deficient obedient and docile trained in helplessness serfs trying all to play the UNO game it's hard to understand the real big picture, that marxism, as said by :\n\n > [tomy](#comment_3_19LwzciybkicS9FUmkaZL6jDSm6tY5dUs): fundamentally marxism isn't an ideology, but a mean to gain power[...]\n\nIs really just that.\n\nI will let the PR teams of JB come and clean you intellectually first... but as a defender of the free well regulated market, I must just remark that AMAZON never forced you to do anything, I don't say that JB or some marxists having infiltrated his orgs haven't abused their total domination of the market, but that all was achieved with your full consent, with all his customers, choosing his and his shareholder services, rather than competitors. \n\nIf yours and billions of individual book trades had gone to Barnes and Noble. JB empire would have never took off.\n\nBut I guess, he offered, a better, faster, stronger, more resilient and cheaper service, and you, as idiotic serfs, were unable to find a better paying job, or raise among the ranks of his org.\n\nSo like defeated worthless shit, you wish to use marxism to fulfill your objectives, and LOOT jeff... to take his yacht and make it a \"collective boating experience\" with one of you as the captain getting JEFF room... \n\nwe know how full how you function, how your little brains work... We are the market. And contrary to your belief we don't loot, we kill, and what's left is fought again, to declare once again a right full owner.\n\n\n> [elr23423nksdasd](#comment_5_1KFTNuxkQipsabR2q9XhxxTTtqn9QiSxeP): The irony of falling for propaganda while trying to fight propaganda.\n\nso let me tell you, for me, it would be a pleasure to kill this thing that you use as a corpse. how are you gonna censor me for writing what you hate, what doesn't fit your propaganda? but rest assured, I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN and KILL YOU, not as a man, and fully legally.\n\nA good marxist is a dead marxist.",
