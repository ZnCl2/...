You do realize that there are millions if not billions of people that are well educated, wealthy, and own precious metals. That information literally tells you nothing about numismatist.\n\nIt most likely doesn't tell anything to almost anyone. But it might tell something to someone ?! Are you quite sure that you are 100% anonymous?!\n\nConstantly bragging about being wealthy and owning metals on a platform ZeroNet is indeed retarded.",

I don't think you would pay taxes on that income either:)\n\nrenters can easily become a headache too :)",

Having to pay others would not be ideal.  With good renters and some luck i've seen this work well for some.  Good retirement plan\n\nI don't care about retirement planning because i don't know if i make it to retirement :)",
