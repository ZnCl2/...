			"body": "## AnnounceShare\n\nhttps://github.com/geekless/ZeroNet/tree/AnnounceShare-rework\n\n* Allow sharing trackers of any supported protocols, not just `zero://`. (Right now it includes BitTorrent over HTTP(S) and BitTorrent over UDP.)\n  * The supported protocols are autodetected, not hardcoded, so the modification of the plugin is not required in the case of implementation of new protocols.\n* Working trackers are now counted on per protocol basis. The plugin tries to maintain the up-to-date list of functional trackers for each available protocol.\n* Be more conservative on removal trackers from the list. Don't delete trackers on errors if no successful connections have been established recently, in the case of the network connectivity issues.\n* Other small code refactorings.\n\n## TrackerList\n\nhttps://github.com/geekless/ZeroNet/tree/TrackerList\n\n(The plugin is disabled by default in the source tree. Should be enabled manually before running ZeroNet. The branch also contains the updated AnnounceShare, no additional merging is required.)\n\nTrackerList is a plugin, that fetches a list of trackers from any external source (URL or local file path) and adds them info the AnnounceShare list. If the trackers are functional, AnnounceShare spreads them throughout the network to other peers.\n\nBy default, it fetches the data from https://github.com/ngosang/trackerslist.\n\nThe reworked AnnounceShare is required for TrackerList to work. It is also required on a peer, looking for new trackers, in order to be able to receive non-`zero://` trackers. (The old AnnounceShare forbids other tracker protocols.)\n\nPlease test and report any issues.\n\n## UPDATE:\n\nAnnounceShare will be forked and renamed to TrackerShare.\n\nTrackerShare, TrackerList, gitcenter's PeerMessage and BackgroundProcessing will be packed together with the core and provided as a preconfigured distribution. A least, it will be available as a source archive and a docker image for Linux. (A bundle for Windows is possible too.)\n\nTwo more plugins are in development by me now as well.",

			"title": "The centralized parts of ZeroNet",
			"body": ".\n### ZeroID\n\nCurrently, there seems to be no reliable solution for that. My drafts: http://127.0.0.1:43110/1BLoGBTid3NhGu8ts3fAfHJprnbrH3wfTV/?Post:41\n\n### ZeroTalk and ZeroMe Hubs\n\nWhile the major features are decentralized, the user space limit management is centralized. There is a script somewhere that runs periodically (once a month or several months, I guess) and adds some space for every user who is about to run out of space.\n\nI don't see the point in this approach.\n\nA new user comes to the forum and quickly runs out of the default 50k. S/he tries to contact to @nofish, but no luck. S/he asks others, but no one can help them. So the new user concludes that ZeroNet is inconvenient and impractical.\nS/he either leaves ZeroNet or decides to give it one more chance and registers another ID.\nThe second ID runs out of space as well.\n\nFinally, after some suffering, if a user is persistent enough, s/he gets more space \"for some reason\". In fact, no reason, just a dumb script.\n\nWhy do we need that suffering part, and why not just give a user a default megabyte or so?\nAnd why should we have this single point of failure at all?\n\nThe script doesn't solve any actual problems.\nSpammers are still able to register lots of IDs, so the 50k limit is not a problem for them at all.\nIt's just ordinary users who are in trouble.\n\nBTW, @gitcenter sucessfully tested the automated flood attack against this forum several years ago.\n\n### ZeroSites\n\nIf you navigate to ZeroSites, you see that each zite has 2 numbers: \"stars\" and \"peers\". The latter is collected by a server and injected into the ZeroSites DB in the centralized way.\nZites are ordered by \"popularity\", which is `MIN(200, peers) + star * 20`.\n\nPreviously, the peer stats were updated every few hours. Now it's long broken. I [reported the issue](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroSites/issues/14), but no luck.\n\nZeroSites engine also has no check for the data relevance. As a workaround, if statistics have not been updated for a while, we can just ignore it. But that simple solution is not implemented.\n\nA more sophisticated way is to make a new plugin for the core engine that integrates ZeroSites DB and Bootstrapper (peer tracker) DB. So any tracker with this plugin enabled can provide the actual stats. And a user chooses to trust it or not.\n\nThis stats problem doesn't look like a big issue, but it shows what may possibly happen if the server-side part of ZeroID or ZeroTalk goes down. Such flaws mustn't be present in a decentralized network.\n\n### The default site list\n\nIt's not a centralization issue per se, but it adds some more problems to what described above.\n\nWhen a new user installs ZeroNet, s/he sees a list of \"default\" zites in the left bar. The contents of this list is controlled by a single person and not by the community. I'm really not sure how this can be addressed, and if this should be addressed at all, but the infrastructure of ZeroNet is totally centralized and is ran by a single person.",

I added a simple configuration option, so now you can choose the sorting order: `last_activity` (default), `topic_creation`, `topic_author`, `comments_num`, `votes_num`.\n\nI run [OpenNews 🇷🇺](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Nowr5oVEdbU5ZTQBriRd2jJVj2vhsDJd4/). You can see an example of using the sorting option there. The settings are in [content.json](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Nowr5oVEdbU5ZTQBriRd2jJVj2vhsDJd4/content.json).\n\nBy the way, previously I also added an option to adjust view of the topic list: brief (just a title of each topic), normal (the same as on ZeroTalk), long (formatted content, limited by height), full (formatted content fully). As you can see, the stickied topics are displayed as \"brief\" on OpenNews, and ordinary topics as \"normal\".\n\nIf you set topic_list_mode=full and topic_list_order_by=topic_creation, you may use the forum engine as a collective blog. The topic list will be displayed in a manner similar to what is normally used for blogs.\n\nThese settings are currently available to the zite owner only.

Or \"sync over Freenet\". Or maybe the offline update mode aka \"sync this node from a USB flash stick\".\n* Bringing support of more crypto algorithms besides good old Bitcoin's elliptic curves.\n* Implementing the multisign support of the root `content.json`: *right-way-this-time*. The current implementation is broken.\n* Fixing various flaws in user-level muting/blocklisting.\n* Implementing the darknet mode aka friend-2-friend mode, so one can use ZeroNet in a RetroShare-like manner.\n* Bringing support of flexible zite-level control over user space limits etc, so zite policies may at some extent be scaled and controlled by its users, when the owner abandoned it.\n* Implementing a declarative API that makes possible running a zite with dynamic AJAX updates and without executing an untrusted zite-level JS code in your browser. Running an untrusted code should be an option, not the core requirement.\n* ...etc\n\nNot my goals:\n\n* Breaking things just because they are implemented \"in a wrong way\".\n* Rewriting the engine in a shiny new programming language.\n\nP.S.

			"title": "nofish implemented a misfeature for wiping inactive users (??!)",
			"body": "Folks, some controversial news...\n\n### ISSUE 1\n\nIf you [look here](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/data/users/content.json), you see the following data block:\n\n```\n \"user_contents\": {\n  \"archived\": {\n   \"1165u6pt5mQNFjyhMVwy6azB7bZuQGLA9b\": 1523088096,\n   \"125b8FxS36xSSCHkvZEhimvF5KPxjckS7o\": 1523088096,\n   \"127tNdRpqjPKrVbgYNJHyvHV2Hz43VApCK\": 1523088097,\n   \"128SPB2TNDuT8sxcTRZ83BaN2T72c7QHDC\": 1523088099,\n   \"128Vo1cvEvptz267w81cHfpqENkVUk8NXv\": 1523088096,\n   .\n   .\n   .\n   LOTS OF IDS HERE\n   .\n   .\n  },\n  \"archived_before\": 1523088096,\n```\n\nWhat does this block mean? Here is what documentation says:\n\n> `archived` - Delete the specified user content directory that is signed earlier than the specified timestamp (key: directory name, value: timestamp)\n> `archived_before` - Delete all user content directory if that is signed earlier than the specified timestamp\n\nMy first thought was nofish made some script for moving old data into zite-controlled files to make free room for new posts in user files. But it doesn't seems to be the case. ZeroTalk has no additional data files besides user-provided ones.\n\nWhich means that any users that had no activity sinse `\"archived_before\": 1523088096`, i.e. **Apr 07 2018**, are erased from the forum. No posts, comments, likes, anything. Any topics that were created by those users, aren't accessible any more, even if those topics contain long and meaningful discussions.\n\nWhat we can guess is that there is some script somewhere, that runs, or used to run, periodically and updates the `archived_before` field, wiping all the data of inactive users. We have no clue if the script is still active or not and when it gets activated the next time.\n\nThe only way to make sure your posts are safe is to visit the forum every few months and post/like anything in order to renew your activity status. Wow! Not sure about you guys, but for me it's definately not a thing I expect from a p2p storage that was designed to keep data almost forever. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this \"feature\" doesn't documented anywhere in the forum.\n\n### ISSUE 2\n\nThe next level:\n\nThe misfeature was misused for banning users from the forum. You can ask, what happens if one assigns for a user an archivation date in the future? ZeroNet wipes the data and also refuses accepting and relaying user's data until the specified date in this case. And this means: a temporary ban.\n\nOf cause one also can \"archive\" (ban) a user forever taking a date in a distant feature:\n```\n\"128Vo1cvEvptz267w81cHfpqENkVUk8NXv\": 9999999999\n```\n\nThe latter is no news, since the ban can also be set up by user-space control policies. (No space -> no posts -> ban). But the old kind of ban is pretty straightforward: a user is either banned entirely or not. No temporarily ban is possible (at least, without additional scripts). So it is intended primarily for bots etc, and not for \"punishing' users. The temporary ban opens up new opportunities for censorship.\n\nI am not claiming that nofish applied the temporal ban for any user. It looks more like he used to block only bots. But he (or an owner of any zite) has the capability of doing that.\n\n### OK, WHAT WE SHOULD DO?\n\nMy question is, is this \"archivation\" feature more for good or for evil? What should I do with it in my fork?\n\nKeep it as is, since it can be used for implementing the real archivation of the user generated content?\n\nOr disable it, as it can be easily misused intentionally or accidentally?\n\nP.S.\n\nMaybe \"the depth of diving into the past\" should be controlled by a user? User will have an option of choosing, if s/he wants to download a zite with the full history or from a selected date.",

So, how does running a ZeroNet zite give me any real protection that running my own clearnet website doesn't, other than site name continuity?\n\nWhat's the point of a website that keeps being shut down over and over again? You consider it pure theoretically, and we have it in practice in Russia. Many popular websites were blocked in that way. Online libraries, opposition media etc. There's no point of a media that has no stable domain name, it is not visible by search engines and so on. Finally, the law now provides the conception of \"forever ban\" for a illegal site, so any copies on any domains are to be immediately blocked once noticed.\n\nOn the other hand, ZeroNet sites are addressed by bitcoin addresses, so that is pure math, and it cannot be banned by any government as long as they cannot ban math calculations. It is also not possible to shut down the hosting, since the site is hosted by a large number of users located all over the world in different jurisdictions. If at least one copy remains available, there again will be dozens of it soon.\n\nZeroNet provides the ability to keep the data potentially forever as well. It no longer matters that your hoster is down for some reason or you forgot to pay for the next month or your bank delayed the transaction. It also doesn't matter if you have lost interest in your websites, or hospitalized, or maybe you died, who knows. ([balancer73's zites still keep working six months after his death](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1BLoGBTid3NhGu8ts3fAfHJprnbrH3wfTV/?Post:45) and will probably work as long as we have any compatible browser to visit them.)\n\nZeroNet is also a kind of transport to be used in the poor connectivity conditions. Updates can be delayed for any time, but never lost and to be transmitted once the connection is possible. They can be transmitted via 3rt party peers by many hops, and finally you get them. ZeroNet-like network is probably the only possible kind of communication [in the deep space](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1SunAWK2VUT9GQK32MpwRfFPVgcBSJN9a/1GooUE19488nDwG3TdkM8seYAHct4gjkq4/1549542994).\n\nWell, in my opinion it is absolutely clear that ZeroNet is the future and the client-server websites are a soon-to-be-obsolete technology.\n\n> Also, given that ZeroSites could refuse to put a link to your zite, how would you let people know where your zite is?\n\nThat is the issue. I see no technical way to resolve it. I think we need many different zite directories run by different people, who hold different political views, religions etc, so a zite hardly to be banned in all the places. There at least are ZeroSites, 0list.bit, ZeroCentral etc.",

Is it because there is too low number of these so it allows easier blocking?I think zeronet should work on 150kbit/s mobile internet with 500 sites.\n\nTorrents have been in use for ages without such kind of problems as the tracker network bandwidth.\n\nThe request from a client is just a simple HTTP GET query, and the answer is a short plaintext document (`bencode`d) contaning the list of peers.\n\nWhy should we artificially limit ourselves to zero://, which are now just 10 or 11 all over the network, while we can utilize [several dozens](https://github.com/ngosang/trackerslist/blob/master/trackers_all_ip.txt) trackers as well?\n\nAnyway, ZeroNet connects to several hardcoded torrent trackers in the default distribution, so I have absolutely no idea, what's wrong with the PR.",

It may get down, blocked, hacked, DDoSed etc.\n\nFor what purpose do you update the tracker list in the core distribution then? \"We have zero://zero.booth.moe, it does work, and that's enough\" - according to your logic.\n\nTalking about zero://, it seems to be clear for everyone including me and you, that the purpose of AnnounceShare is to improve the network connectivity and stability by automatically spreading out the working trackers over the network. But when we talk about torrent, a user \"should be fine\" with the hardcoded list. Uhh?\n\nSorry for the conspirology, but it smells really bad.

And if we don't need them, the plugin has nothing to do with them.\n\nIf the project goal is not creating a network of the maxinum connectivity and stability, that is able to find content delivery paths in any possible conditions, but developing a sandbox, isolated from the real world, creating vendor lock-in techniques, playing the \"I do everything by myself\" games or other obscure things, then okay...

(That's required in the current design.) They can be merged from different hubs. Again, to prevent censorship. And also, to make possible merging different user ID providers and engine extensions.

It wasn't censorship-free in the first place any way.\n\nIt's possible to use ZeroNet for building both moderated and unmoderated applications, and we should clearly distinguish one from the other. We shouldn't call something unmoderated just because someone has the power to moderate it, but promises not doing that. It should be based on the math.\n\nSo now we have no true unmoderated forum here on ZeroNet.",

In the case of this forum, it's just because it's not your forum, and the data you post here is not your data any more as soon as you press the Submit button.\n\n.\n\nI believe it was a mistake when ZeroNet developers made ZeroBlog, ZeroTalk and ZeroMe completely different and independent engines. And especially, the poor integration of ZeroMe and ZeroHello's subscription feeds.\n\nI have already published my thoughts on how we can organize the network in a more integrated and at the same time in a more free way. I repost it here:\n\n.\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1SunAWK2VUT9GQK32MpwRfFPVgcBSJN9a/1GooUE19488nDwG3TdkM8seYAHct4gjkq4/1583932254\n\n*An author deleted [the topic](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1583926359_1G9KPmTFFXgarsKRjpPuvRd13mYf8aDm3E/), so I repost my comment here:*\n\nJust few days ago, the similar idea was discussed on a Russian Linux forum in the clearnet.\n\nMy thoughts on ZeroMe design:\n\n* The registry address shouldn't be hard-coded in the engine sources. Registries can be added dynamically via the merger feature.\n  * In order to support various user ID providers and possible future extensions of the core design.\n* The existing collective hubs should be used as a cache to keep recent entries.\n  * There also may be thematic hubs, similar to user groups and communities in the clearnet social networking apps.\n* Each user has their own personal hub.\n* When you post a message, it lands to your personal hub as well as to any number of collective hubs, at your choice.\n* An owner of a collective hub can ban you or censor you, but since there possibly will be thousands of collective hubs run by different people, it's practically impossible to ban you from the network.\n* Even if you're banned from a hub, people, who have been subscribed to your personal hub, are still able to read your posts.\n* Comments and likes aren't necessary to be saved at the same hub as the original post. (That's required in the current design.) They can be merged from different hubs. Again, to prevent censorship. And also, to make possible merging different user ID providers and engine extensions. A reader can choose in the settings, if s/he follows the censorship policy of the post author, or prefers merging comments from various sources regargdless of the author's hub config.",

I changed my mindset when @nofish clearly stated that the site owner has the full control over user-level certs and data, and it's by design. It makes no sense to limit the owner's power, since she controls the JS code of the zite. So she's able to hide, modify or fake any data at the application level.\n\nSo censorship-free applications should be constructed in a such way where each user has the full copy of her data under her own primary key.",

Users just migrate to a new zite in a few days or weeks leaving the tyrant alone.\n\nAnother example:\n\nThe admin of http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Apr5ba6u9Nz6eFASmFrefGvyBKkM76QgE paid very little attention to the forum, not updating the engine for years.

Now, that has slowed to hours. \n\nMaybe it's because ZeroTalk lacks many features people are used to, and its development stagnates for years? People don't see any progress of ZeroNet.\n\nWell, I remember the high activity on ZeroTalk too. There were many posts in Chinese. Then they migrated to a separate subforum. Then, to a distinct copy of ZeroTalk, I guess. But even without users from China, the main forum was active. There were many discussions every day.\n\nThe same in ZeroMe, not only ZeroTalk. New posts appeared every few minutes in the \"Everyone\" feed previously. There were many posts both in English and Chinese, I guess, 50%/50%. Now ZeroMe looks extinct. Is GFW now totally impossible to pass, or Chinese people just have disappointed of ZeroNet in the same way as English-speaking ones?\n\nAnother reason I know of is lack of news about ZeroNet in the clearnet. We just have no significant releases and there's nothing to post news about. Just look at various federative networks, IPFS etc. There ARE news about those on many websites, but not about ZeroNet. Nobody knows about us.\nThere is a reason why Ubuntu makes releases twice a year no matter if they have any significant progress or not. It's kind of advertising, to be visible to people.\n\nbalancer73 and me tried to promote ZeroNet at www.linux.org.ru, a large Russian-speaking community. Several people came here from that site.

We should actively promote ZeroNet and P2P technologies in general, explain people that the federative approach shares the same flaws as centralized services and also has somewhat worse drawbacks. Federative social media can be easily taken down, can be censored, users may be banned, and users don't control their data.

[...]\n\nI missed that long post somehow. My answer is: any big work can be done by little steps. Provided that someone actually makes those steps.\n\nI've spent the last week and a half digging into the network code. You can see my progress here:\n\nhttps://github.com/zeronet-enhanced/ZeroNet/commits/massive-rework\n\nThe problem we are struggling with is not nofish, but time. There are only 24 hours in a day, and most of them, one should do something for living. I'm not aware of your progress, but what about me, I'm not physically able to write code any faster compared to what you can see in the git log above.\n\nFor example, tomorrow I'll be busy all day, the day after tomorrow I go to dentist, then, Saturday and Sunday both are fully scheduled as well. So tonight is the last time I can pay some time to ZeroNet development in this week.\n\nBack to the topic: as I said earlier, ZeroNet's now working \"somehow\" and nobody knows exactly how and why. The code needs reviewing and auditing. Many bugs have been lasting since the beginning of time, and there are lots of relatively new regressions as well. The poor network connectivity is what we used to, but that's not how a P2P network is intended to work. It should be fixed before we move any further. ZeroNet is not even under attack yet, but performs bad on its own. \n\nAnd we should stop talking about new features until the existing features are fully debugged and proved to work. If one is going to be a ZeroNet developer, he or she should take the responsibility of the existing code base. It is not a question of who will have priority in what. It's a question of how to make a damned thing working.\n\nI've made a lot of changes to the networking logic related to pulling and pushing site updates between peers. It performs much better in my test cases now, and the overall network connectivity should get better after these changes appear in the release version. But I'm still facing freezes and instability from time to time, so there is still a lot of work there.\n\nNow I need a break from this network stuff, so I switched to the Content module. I'm going to implement multisign support... I mean, **working** multisign support instead of the broken one we have right now. A site owner will be, at any time, able to grant and revoke the right of signing the root content.json to any number of keys.\n\nIt will probably break the current multisign implementation, but since it's broken in the first place, I guess nobody uses it, so nobody will be affected.\n\nI also need to finish debugging a couple of plugins I plan to integrate to the repository, and then I'll be able to make a release.\n\nAs you can see these changes are not so fantastic as those you talked about in these days. But that's the real level of coding I can provide.\n\nI'm upset of you not sharing my views on ZeroNet development, but, well, so I will do it on my own. Hopefully there will be a community around ZeroNet development some day.",

Is it safe to continue using these zites? They can be erased at any time, if the keys are in wrong hands.\n\nFortunately, ZeroID keeps working. But can we trust it?",

So, if I have a large folder with books, and I want to share some books over ZeroNet, I go to an improved version of ZeroUp, point ZeroNet what books I want to share, and it remembers their file paths and represents them at the API level as if they were physically located under ZeroUp directory.\n\nWhen implementing the content-addressable storage, you have to implement the file path virtualization at API level anyway.
