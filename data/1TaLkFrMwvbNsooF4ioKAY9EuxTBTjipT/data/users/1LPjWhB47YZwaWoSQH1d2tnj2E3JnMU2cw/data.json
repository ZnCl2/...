Do you really want to fuck up China, one of the last places where men control shit, so the whole world will be under the influence of Cuckywood? Be smart, jump ship. The United Faggots of America are doomed.\n\nI see your point I am just not willing to concede that the US is that far gone yet. As for china there are better patriarchal cultures to model after if it cam to that.",
