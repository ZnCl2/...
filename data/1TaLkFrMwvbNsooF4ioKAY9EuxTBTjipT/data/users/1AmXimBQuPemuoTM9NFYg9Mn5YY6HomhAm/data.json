			"body": "## Why use [Name.TRUST](/1PtFxzJ8NECkYQzziGWoEfzScD6NiEgqDY) instead of ZeroName?\n\n*   It's free!\n*   It's single-BitMessage/WebForm. You don't have to start a local Namecoin client.\n\n## Are there any pitfalls?\n\n*   You have to install the  [Name.TRUST](/1PtFxzJ8NECkYQzziGWoEfzScD6NiEgqDY) plugin to access  [Name.TRUST](/1PtFxzJ8NECkYQzziGWoEfzScD6NiEgqDY) domains;\n*   Or you can try [ZeroNet RDP Fork](/1GbHs9D4YvkTHscZPXXwDCWYxW1CHS9rfn);\n\n## Can it work when I'm offline?\n\nYes! It will. Registered domains are stored in  [Name.TRUST](/1PtFxzJ8NECkYQzziGWoEfzScD6NiEgqDY) site.\n\n## How do I start using it?\n\nVisit [Name.TRUST](/1PtFxzJ8NECkYQzziGWoEfzScD6NiEgqDY). Press Install button to install the plugin. It will ask you to restart ZeroNet, do it. You'll now be able to access Name.TRUST domains, e.g. name.trust, rdp.trust, blog.rdp.trust and others.\n\nIf you want to register a domain, scroll down to \"How to add a domain?\". You will see the steps to register a domain. Make sure there are no typos -- domains can't be unregistered or edit again.",
