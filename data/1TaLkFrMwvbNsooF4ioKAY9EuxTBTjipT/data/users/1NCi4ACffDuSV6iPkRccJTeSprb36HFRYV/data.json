			"title": "ZeroNet and Zites to close Distributed Green Energy Gaps - Corrently Corp",
			"body": "Corrently is a new kind of Green-Utilitiy company that aims to empower individuals to create value by consuming green energy. Sounds strange? No it isn't... the challenge with renewable energy is that you do not burn something - beside money at the time of investment. However this causes a lot of downsides that we close with a financial model that got derived from the German feed-in tariffs. \n\nWe love ZeroNet ... Why? Because in the last months it closed the gap of having distributed notes (generators, consumers, etc... ) and a central need of consensus (Blockchain). We used it mainly to do all the Peer2Peer exchange of JSON, Data-Files... Now we started to develop our first real Zite with a bit of HTML. However we would like to do serious business and no quick ICO hype. \n\nFor the forum: It would be nice to get a bit of your expectations on how a utilities company could get reputation inside a more or less anonymous world like ZeroNet and Blockchain?\n\nDo you see how we are using the technologies? Do you have any topics - or ideas, remarks we should be aware of? \n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/corrently-corp.bit/\n\nRegards,\n Thorsten",
