Each server is run from ZeroNet.exe, and as long as there is a single user with that running, all zites and pages that the user has visited are available to everyone on the ZeroNet mesh. There is no \"centralized\" anything in ZeroNet afaik, just a bunch of users hosting local servers, downloading the entire domain they visit, and occasionally updating them as they leave the program open.",
