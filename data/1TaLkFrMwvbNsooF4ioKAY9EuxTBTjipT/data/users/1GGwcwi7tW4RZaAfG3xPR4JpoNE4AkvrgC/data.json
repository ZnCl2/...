How would you store information that would last 100000 years? Every form of storage we have will fail even after a few hundred years.\nAncestral or genetic memory has already been shown to exist in a number of organisms. And not some wordplay either. Real environmental information that can be transferred. I'm not really interested in the scientific eunich approach to consciousness. The nihilism and arrogance that goes with it is like asking a virgin to describe what sex is like. They cannot describe it or any experience without nihilism. We've had a few hundred years of that stifling thought already. I will not hold my breath when the scientific eunichs become the nothing they so desperately described, themselves.",

I did that for about two years until my lymph node on my neck got swollen and wouldn't go down. I went to an ENT for an examination and he couldn't give me an prognosis of what caused it without a biopsy because much like other exposures to chemicals; vaping, the metals used for the coil, the additive, and chemicals used for the dyes and flavoring were not yet regulated nor given any long term studies. [...]\n\nI can understand this but there is a few guidelines I would recommend:\n\n1. Stick to high quality flavors, VG and PG. European or US made only. \n2. Avoid Nicotine. It does not play well in vapes. A cigarette is honestly healthier than vaping nicotine. Every negative study about vaping is usually a cheap juice or a nicotine containing juice.\n3. Avoid butter/cookie/nut flavours. They're just bad for you. These synthesized flavors were never meant to be heated and inhaled.\n4. Stick to plain fruit flavours. Good quality only. If a flavour gives you issues. Isolate it and avoid it.\n5. Use Smok Beast tanks with prepacked coils. This might seem a downgrade, but if you count up the amount of time you spend building coils and packing cotton and then prepping it without spilling, it is way easier and cheaper to just use the prepacked Smok Beast coils. Never had any issues with them. Many issues with RBA however. Have tried over 5 different tanks and various high quality coils and cotton. I just don't like it. \n6. Use a lower wattage - 60W max. Just enough to atomize and get the flavour to come through. You don't need to rip clouds like a steamtrain. Your batteries (between charges) and coils will last longer too. \n7. If you're still having problems, try reducing the PG to a low amount. \n\nThis is what worked for me.",

The vast grasslands we see now, and all areas that are now suburban are literal deserts. No animals. No food. \n\nPlant trees. And not monocultures. Random indigenous trees. The animals will return.

This \"contemplation of navel\" cult in the west should have run it's course by now....Old. A conceit.\n\nI agree. The West has the lowest pollution in the world. Yeah, pollution. The real metric that we should be evaluating environmentalism by. True environmentalism. Not the fake carbon tax generation do gooder scheme that governments are peddling. How can paying tax save the environment? It can't. The poor and middle classes are not the people at fault here. And yet every blame of the environment is heaped on those who literally have no say in what happens. Those who pollute the least have to take the blame and take responsibility. How about those who pollute the most take responsibility? Getting the average guy to drive electric cars is a drop in the ocean next to the huge freight ships with their faked emissions diesel engines. Or the millions of aircraft that fly every day. But even those are not even a large contributor. Look at the massive pollution caused by mining processes. Look at the refining processes for rare earth metals. Or even worse the petrochemical industry. That is where the true blame should lie. \n\nBut onto the next point. The West should not reduce its birth rate. In fact the West should have as many children as possible. Asia and Africa should reduce their birth rate. They are overpopulated. They are the polluters. \n\nThe Earth would be far better off if humanity as a whole was reduced to under 100000 people. Nature would recover again.  \n\nNo one talks about going after the big companies or big banks. And that is why any political solution is controlled opposition. You will not be allowed to address the true cause of the destruction of the environment. Economies are structured to maximize GDP. Civilization is not civilized at all. Barbarity after civilization has fallen will be a far more beautiful thing to see. The consequences of the industrial revolution has been catastrophic on the environment.",

It's acquired through Googling.\n\nThere is some evidence that consciousness isn't located in the brain. The efficiency at which the brain operates at does not match the latency restrictions of your neurons. There is also the RF transmission latency problem, where brainwaves move far slower than the rate at which it is processed. Yes your brain emits RF transmissions, which although it cannot be decoded, holds some visual representation of your thoughts. Any one area of the brain also doesn't hold certain information. Rather it is multiple duplicates. There is also the research done on how the brain functions during anesthesia. Of course I can't prove it, but I'm 99% convinced that there is a dimensional aspect to consciousness and that it isn't localized in the brain.",

A lot of what we call genius scientific discoveries, for example.. are really just accidents and coincidences... and most geniuses around the world go unnoticed.\n\nI agree. We know very little about how the brain or consciousness works. Though there is many hoaxes and things that are simply untrue, the more I study it the more I am convinced of the metaphysical nature of reality. Quantum entanglement itself is proof that there is far more to reality than what we can observe with our current senses. In December a university made the first quantum entangled network, isolating an entangled particle and using its lack of latency to switch packets on a network stack. It is real. What else is also entangled? What lies behind the nature of our reality that was once seemingly ridiculous folklore, but could in fact be real, but not in the way we think. More in a metaphysical sense. Of course nothing can be proven yet, but it is crucial that we hammer on these questions until they bear fruit. There is something very important to be discovered there. \n\nJust in my own journey, I've gone from disregarding all that was not empirically true, to realizing that academia is made up and that it is inherently politically biased and in fact an enemy of humanity. The empirical method does not rely on consensus. In fact the greatest breakthroughs were made by going against the grain and walking the unbeaten path. I do not think we should at all ascribe any authority to academia, especially if most research is paid for by governments that expect political toeing of the line. Academia is not an authority. This is even more apparent if you realize that the institutions we built are now entirely against us. It is time we abandon them as they've abandoned us.",

So you admit that they ARE true dissidents. I'm of the opinion that if you agree with the government, and its propaganda machine, ie. entertainment then you're not a dissident at all. You might as well just say outright that you don't have an original thought at all and you're just parroting what you've been told like the good model citizen you are. \n\nHave you considered at all that if the government can lie to you about everything, that perhaps they are lying about Nazis as well? Your entire opinion of National Socialism is not your own, but propagated to you. Movies, Games, Books, Entertainment. Everything, even 80 years later is still inorganically fervent with propaganda. Imagine if we did the same with the Roman Empire? What of the Ottoman Empire that brought genocide all over much of Eurasia for the better part of the 19th century. Zero propaganda about them. Think about it. Why are they so bad that millions of dollars are spent trying to tell you they are bad. Do you trust your government that much that you eat up their propaganda without question? How can you be shocked about real projects like MKULTRA, yet when it comes to Anti-Nazi Propaganda, you eat it up. \n\nEvery time you from now on see Anti-Nazi propaganda you're going to think about what I said here. You're going to think about how comical the propaganda is. And how fake it is like anti-drug propaganda. \n\nA true dissident always does and thinks the opposite of what they are told. If they say Nazis are bad, then as a true dissident, they MUST be good. Bigotry is not only a mark of courage, but necessary in the onslaught of propaganda.
