I guess I should set 'no proxy' for 127.0.0.1:43110, but can't find where I can do this in browser settings.\n\nthere's a Q in the FAQ about this, I'm using the latest Tor Browser thanks to that. You need to go to \"about:config\" and set \"no_proxy_on\" to \"127.0.0.1\". Then you'll need to trust javascript from localhost in the noscript button.\n\nCheers!",
