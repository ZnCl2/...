When this law Will be approved also using a drop or aubergine emoji on a girl Instagram profile potentially could be illegal (misoginy) the same for writing things Like \"bella figa\" (beautiful girl) or using memes Like \"the black of whatsapp\" or with trans or ill people...potentially anything that isn t \"politically correct\" could be illegal.... Here these delirant guys are telling that any compliment Hide a \"rapist\" or a criminal...maybe we should Ask why...or asking What Will be the next target! Vaccines?

Anything new is worse than the first. In fact, all the improvements are going in the wrong direction, or are we being controlled? And remote-controlled? Who's controlling us, trying to get us into the field? Is this really a coincidence???Blaming China for this is ridiculous, and grossly exaggerated. There's an evil spirit in our midst, doing the devil's work. I wish I was wrong. I have a question for you poles? What do you think? Greetings...................................................................Wszyscy chcą zmian w ZeroNecie. Mam wrażenie że nikt z was się nie uczy historii? Wszystko co jest nowe, Jest gorsze od tego co Było pierwsze. W zasadzie wszystkie ulepszania idą w złym kierunku, Czy my jesteśmy kontrolowani? I sterowani zdalnie? Kto nami steruje, i stara się nas wyprowadzić w pole? Czy to jest na pewno przypadek???Obwinianie o to Chiny jest śmieszne, i mocno przesadzone. Wśród nas jest zły duch, Który robi krecią robotę. / chciałbym się mylić /. Mam pytanie do was Polacy? A co wy na ten temat myślicie? Pozdrawiam.\n\nFor now zeronet Is Alive...but we must upgrade to onion v 3 to allow zeronet ti Survive! Without tor zeronet Is dead!",
