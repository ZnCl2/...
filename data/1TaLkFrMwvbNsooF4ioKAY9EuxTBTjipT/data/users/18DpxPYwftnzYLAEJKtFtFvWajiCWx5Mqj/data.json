It signs everything fine but then I get the big 'ol red error that it can't be published. Is there a problem with the latest download? I've read reddit and github and I've tried both with and without tor enabled and didn't make a difference.",

It ends up creating a corrupted user.json. Unticking the option brings it back to normal. Merging will have to be done manually best I can guess as previously state but things like syncthing or whatever your preferred provider should be fine to sync the folder if you know how to access it without triggering the above bug.",
