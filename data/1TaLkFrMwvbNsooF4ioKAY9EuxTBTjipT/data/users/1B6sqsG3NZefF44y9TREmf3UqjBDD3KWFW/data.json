After all the exact same happened to the \"normal\" Internet, too. Also no one would have thought that it would be possible back then. It's all just a matter of time and popularity.\nIt's false hope if you really believe there is something better, as long people/politics/money are there, NOTHING will change.",

Just back this file up somewhere else, then visit the zeroid site with user.json deleted and you will generate a new identity, new user.json. Switch them as needed. Just don't lose them, there is no way to recover them.\n\nThanks. Nice to know. Actually that should be an essential feature since it makes sense that a user can switch ID to circumvent Metadata collection on a user. In current state a user is pretty well track able.",
