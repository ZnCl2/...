				"body": "I don't think loneliness is the sole reason behind what is causing so much societal distress in the West right now, but I do think it is part of the problem. It's important to note that you aren't the only person who feels this way; the people around you aren't shallow and emotionless. The vast majority of people feel a strong need to be loved, to have companionship, and to be successful. It's very human to feel this way. Sure, some people aren't this way, but most people can relate to you on some level and have felt what you have felt before. People still actively engage in meaningful relationships today, just as they had before. Nothing has predominately changed. But, I think digital technology has provided an outlet of social interaction that negates the need to actually muster up the confidence to interact with other people. This can cause deviants who have a very difficult time interacting with others, and have developed an anxiety around it, to become even more entrenched in their lack of social interaction. Instead of going through the distressful, and often exhausting process of learning how to interact with others socially, they can just sit behind a blue computer screen. This reduces the amount of interaction they get and the quality of that interaction, as there is no real relationship developing, and visual, impersonal cues can't be delivered through conversation on the Internet as they normally would. Another problematic development in modern civilization is the decay of old social support structures, particularly religion. Staff in religious institutions used to provide a sort of social support network for individuals in mental distress, providing them the therapy required to soothe whatever distress they are experiencing and help them solve their internal issues. Even something as simple as confessions to a priest can be very therapeutic, and religious institutions often provided much more than that. They provided a community that would welcome others with open arms. They still largely function the same way today, but religious devotion is on the wayside. There isn't really any other equivalent to this, and it can lead to many people lacking the social support and community they need to be mentally well. Some say that there has been a corrosion of morals and virtues, which is very arguable, but I believe that is a very different discussion. It's not something that is causing great distress for the individual on a day-to-day basis. If anything, it can be seen as part of a larger problem. \n\nI think one of the best methods of analyzing the structures and the latent functions of a society is looking at how it uses money. This isn't to say that money is everything, because it isn't, I think its ultimately only a means of exchange and nothing more. But it is still important. Money is what enables us to buy and exchange goods, to lay stake in our own interests and ownerships, and pursue opportunity and hobbies. The vast majority of us perform labor in exchange for wages, so we can do exactly those things. Our society is built around money. And over the course of recent decades, economic ideology and policy has dictated that the way we use money has changed. We moved from a savings financed economy to a debt financed one, and we have shifted from large government economic policy and projects to support our society to a limited focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability through manipulating the instruments of currency and exchange. Having a debt-financed economy puts a large burden on the individual, a sort of burden that humans are naturally incompatible with. In order to buy necessary things, like a vehicle, or an education, or an insurance plan to foot massive medical costs, an individual has to go into debt or buy a subscription. In a subscription, you don't truly own anything; you are just paying a bill to renew a contract. In the case of debt, the individual somehow has negative value, that must be consistently and slowly payed back in order to have a contract of exchange completed. While in debt, an individuals freedom of opportunity and pursuit of happiness is limited. They can only do what little they can while not risking a scenario where they fail to meet their debt-obligations. They can't say, maintain a hobby that cuts into the funds they have to reserve for their monthly payments. Or, they can't pursue new opportunity by putting in the initial investment required for fostering that opportunity as it would draw upon the funds they have to reserve for their debt-obligations. This is differentiated from a society that operates on savings, where these sorts of things can be done without the limiting factor of debt. Let alone the stress this creates which will take its toll mentally, the constricted ability to pursue hobbies or opportunities or interests is worse. It's like you are placed in a sort of box, and your vision is tunneled. You can only continue down this path where your obligations are slowly fulfilled before moving up in society, or transitioning into a different role, unless you are genius or lucky enough to create enough wealth for you to pay off these debt-obligations quicker. This makes people frustrated, unhappy, and discontent with society as a whole.\n\nThe logic behind what has led to a debt-financed economy rests in Neoliberalism. Now, I don't mean to use this term disparagingly, because it has been eschewed into different meanings as time has progressed and the word has moved across national borders. Its a branch of economic ideas that encompasses a spectrum of different thinkers, and nothing more. Laissez-Faire Liberalism was and is blamed for the catastrophe of the Great Depression, which led to many intellectuals shunning the idea of liberalism altogether. However, in Germany, the United States, and elsewhere, a group of thinkers emerged who wanted to reconcile the ideals of Liberalism with a modern economy. Once it gained traction in roughly the late-1940's and early 50's, they adopted the name Neoliberal - literally new liberalism. To them, the solution to the problems that caused the Great Depression wasn't a big government leading large projects and implementing overarching plans for an economy, it was a society where the interactions between the free-market and the government were mediated through the use of macroeconomic instruments. Where the free-market failed the interests of society, the government would intervene, they originally said. Though, this phrase has sort of lost its meaning as Neoliberalist methodology has constricted government intervention to a few blunted economic instruments. Neoliberalism quickly overtook Western policy think-tanks and supplanted itself as the predominate economic ideology in the West. It's important to note that economic theory is still ideological, and based on axiomatic concepts that build upon themselves. It isn't a hard science, nor will it be until we have the behavioral models to make it one (which will be a long time.) The Soviets had extensive economic theory, all tracing back to axioms that stemmed off of Marxist-Leninism. They were wildly successful in narrow contexts, such as the industrialization of underdeveloped societies, and maintained an impressive record of macroeconomic stability. Yet they had a fatal flaw that the entire theory overlooked. In their attempt to maintain macroeconomic stability, they not only surrendered their liberties and rights to a more oppressive and totalitarian state, but they also created economic stagnation. They could not move past the smokestacks and steel factories that characterized the Soviet economy, and they lacked an economy that spurred innovation. The reasons for this are complex and too extensive to be included in this discussion, but it led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. They were confident in their economic theory, but they still collapsed, even with the second largest economy on the globe in 1992. In context of their macroeconomic figures, they were very successful through the course of the Cold War. But even these figures were largely rooted in an ideological context, and they only reinforced their own ideology through limiting their analysis to only these figures. This isn't much different from the mental exercise you will see Neoliberals, and many economists from any background, doing today. \n\nNeoliberalism created a methodology that limited Government intervention in order to not limit the efficiency and innovation of the free market. They limited government intervention to policy on currency, interest rates, and regulations. Intervention centered around propping up the failing parts of society, not letting it fail and building up these parts again with better government foresight and initiative. When the United States abandoned the gold standard, which was a good decision to make, the Treasury was free to print however much money it wanted too. This has led to inflation. And more importantly, it led to a disconnect between the growth of productivity and the growth of wages. Essentially, the cost of living has become exorbitantly higher, in contrast to a growth in productivity that one would expect to proportionately grow wages and reduce the cost of living. This has become worse with time. One of the instruments of the Treasury to respond to economic crisis became Quantitative Easing, which was unconventional in its time, but now has become conventional economic policy. Quantitative Easing is where a Central Bank buys a predetermined amount of financial assets to prop up a sector of economy, this has famously been supporting the United States financial sector since 2008. In total, Central Banks around the world have created $20 trillion through this once *unconventional* economic policy. This has led to even more inflation, which recently led to the Feds deciding that they would have to increase interests rates to reduce inflation, and caused a correction on the stock market. In order to stay in pace with the economy, an individual must now go in debt to buy things like a house or a car which would have once been easily obtainable with little or no debt. Had wages grown in proportion to productivity, this would not be an issue. This has created a debt-financed economy, at the expense of the well-being of the individual. Ultimately, I think the polarization we see in politics today is an expression of outrage in the overarching system. They want change, but they can't seem to find a way to introduce change into a government dominated by career politicians and two political parties that are almost identical in ideology. So, in expression of outrage, they try to find attach this problem to tangible issues such as feminism, racism or class conflict. We saw in the US election that voters tended towards candidates who promised to tear down the 'system' and start anew, candidates like Bernie Sanders or Trump. It wasn't a Russian operation that caused this, Russia is one of the least influential parties in Washington, it was a predominate feeling of discontent gripping the population. One of the biggest problems we face today, at least in the context of America, is the fact that our politicians distract from these very real issues by making an appeal to individual identity politics and emotionally charging subjects. Things like Feminism, Racism, and so on. These things cultivate a loyal and outraged voter-base, and they distract from the issues plaguing the overall ideology of our state. Things like Russian collusion help create an outside force to rally against, and allow politicians to role-play as brave patriots standing up to those who seek to threaten our democracy without actually doing anything to help the country. Its a distraction, and it will only create more discontent.",

				"body": "It's important to note that some of the broader consequences of the economic policy I described in my previous comment is the decay of things like safety-nets, protection of the consumer, the decay of infrastructure, and the collapse of a nations manufacturing base as companies pursue lower wages overseas. While an economy may be growing through economic figures, it is still digressing from what a healthy economy actually looks like. One of the reasons nationalism has become more prominent in recent years is the realization that the transition of manufacturing bases to other nations overseas is unhealthy for a nations sovereignty. I daresay that companies that don't exploit a lack of regulations are actually led by bad businessmen. If they don't take innovative opportunities, however immoral they may seem, they will fall behind the curve to their competition who actually does. It's a race to the bottom for a reason, because if you don't participate in the race, you will either fail to bring the valuation of your company up to outstanding shares or your growth will stagnate. This is why regulations prohibiting the loss of manufacturing bases overseas are important, and why regulations are important in every sector. GDP may still be growing, but the fact that we lack a strong steel-manufacturing sector to fall back on when tariffs are put in place is very telling of the impact these sorts of economic policies have. Important and essential sectors of the economy are abandoned, and the working class is left in a worse position than it was before, where companies are either exploiting low wages overseas or relying on immigrants who will accept lower wages.",

				"body": "I don't think Vladimir Putin is issuing threats to the world. I think the problem is that jingoistic statements are made in the West, to which the Russian government responds with a statement essentially saying that any sort of act carrying out the supposed statement would be met with retaliation. The opposite occurs, too, with Russian media sensationalizing statements taken out of context from Western leaders. A threat isn't actually being made, the vast majority of 'threats' that appear on Western headlines are promises of retaliation in the context of self-defense. For an example of this, Nikki Haley recently said in a United Nations Security Council summit that the United States 'will' attack the Syrian government should they use chemical weapons. The Russian Foreign Ministry then responded by reminding the United States of the assets they had in place in Syria, that would be attacked if a war were initiated with Syria, and would be forced to retaliate against U.S. forces. British/American media then interpreted this as a threat from Russia to attack the United States in the Mediterranean, a huge divergence from what was originally said. \n\nWhat we see in our daily digest is a statement made that looks aggressive, unprovoked, and irrational. Headlines are *crafted* to make it look like a threat. It's propaganda that casts another nations leader as irrational, and malicious, and this is usually never true. Leaders of nations are always looking out for their own self-interests, not seeking to sow chaos and disorder. This is even true with nations like North Korea. \n\nTry not to fall for this. The vast majority of media is subject to moneyed interests and has invested time and effort into upholding a narrative for their shareholders or their own personal biases. The New York Times was famous for falling into the trap of essentially creating an environment in the United States where, in the lead up of the Iraq War, many people advocated for it. The NYT's had its hand in misinformation, advocating for a war that it now calls a mistake. If something is depicted as stereotypically evil, then it's probably being misrepresented. ",

				"body": "> azz: Self-defense is when you stole your neighbor's territory\n \nIt's a lot more nuanced than simply aggregating nations who take others territories as aggressive ones. Every nation seeks the security of its own nation, first and foremost, to ensure its prospects for survival. It cannot predict the behavior of other nations, and cannot truly know the interests of other nations. For that reason, it must act with suspicion in regard to others and build security and defense forces for the possibility of interests colliding and boiling into war. In the case of Russia and others, territory is offensively taken for the sake of securing their own interests and balancing power into their favor. The United States invaded Iraq and other Middle Eastern nations for the sake of securing the region under its own influence, although this has backfired somewhat. Russia invaded Crimea in response to Ukraine abandoning its neutrality, opening the possibility of NATO dominance over the Black Sea, giving NATO even greater leverage over Russia and enabling it to sanction it more heavily in the event of interests colliding. Self-defense doesn't amount too much when, in both Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova, sectarian tensions had been boiling for decades and were sparked off by colliding NATO and Russian interests. Crimea had formally been an autonomous region before this status was abolished, sparking large outcry of the Russian nation, and several campaigns were held for secession in Donetsk and Crimea. In Georgia and Moldova, Russian ethnicities revolted in response to the collapse of the Soviet Union and these tensions simmered for years until being provoked again. \n\nIn fact, Russia had many opportunities to more aggressively expand its territory. More than half of Georgia fell under its military occupation during the 2008 War, and the war-making capacity of Georgia had been destroyed in totality, which would have enabled Russia to seize and annex the nation with ease. This never occurred, however, in anticipation with Western cooperation. In Ukraine, Russia could have aggressively supported the Donetsk rebels, but instead only light support was lensed and the rebels were forced into stalemate in compliance to Western demands for stability in Eastern Ukraine. Each time, this decision was made because it was thought that the prospects of survival for the Russian nation were greater without strong tensions developing between Russia and Western nations. Perhaps with the collapse of the possibility of Western and Russian cooperation, the Russian government will decide to slowly dismember and absorb Georgia piecemeal, support a political revolution in Ukraine, while strengthening political unions like the Eurasian Economic Union to further its own interests. But we have not yet seen anything trending towards this direction. \n\nSuffice to say, Russian interests are not diabolically evil as some would like to depict. Issuing threats actively does not help Russian interests, which is why this is something you don't see them do often, but responding to threats in the context of self-defense for the sake of constructing a deterrence is. It's not a matter of the West helping nations defend themselves against an aggressive Russian oligarchy, but a matter of security competition and colliding interests. ",

				"body": "I don't think so. What brought the Soviet Union down was a sort of rigidity and economic stagnation not present in China today. As another user pointed out, China is currently economically strong, and there isn't general discontent among the population. China opened itself up to reform under Deng Xiaoping without sacrificing its political stability, but even in China, this economic reform had its consequences (see the 1989 Tienanmen Square protests, a reaction to the inequality spurred by Deng Xiaoping's economic programs.) The Soviet Union industrialized through communism in a successful fashion, but never diverged from this kind of centralized economic policy. It's economy became entirely characterized by smokestacks and factories, and never grew much beyond this. Resolvable economic issues, like strict unemployment policies or liberalization, were never challenged and left broken. Stagnation intertwined with a rigid Communist Party avoiding any reform only made economic problems worse for the Soviet Union, and by the time someone tried to resolve them, it was already too late. Economic restructuring always requires some sort of societal struggle and suffering, and in the case of the Soviets, it was a massive amount of suffering due to the fact that economic reform was never undertaken sooner. People tend to think of the dissolution of the Soviet Union as a single event, but it was really a multi-decade affair. Social issues slowly congested the political functioning of the nation, and the economy never moved forward as a consequence of the Communist economic policy, and this created impetus for people to surmount a revolution that dissolved the Soviet Union. It's important to note that, in the case of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, no sort of populist uprising really occurred. Regional politicians, like Yeltsin and Nazarbayev, began distancing themselves from the political machinery of the Union after the failed KGB coup de'etat in 1991, and the Soviet Union was then reformed to the Commonwealth of Independent States. Politicians had the legal right to proclaim independence from the Soviet Union as per the 1977 Brezhnev-era Constitution, which became a very important factor in what would have been an otherwise completely illegal affair. This stems off of the fact that the Soviet Union, due to the nativization policies of the Communist Party, was always seen as a multi-national Union of nations -  not a single homogeneous entity. The CIS was supposed to function as a reformed Soviet Union, essentially characterized by a common-market and military among the nations of the former - now refurnished - Union. For countries where the CSTO and EEU overlap with the CIS, this is the current case. The dissolution of the Soviet Union has been a long, drawn-out, multi-decade process still continuing to this day. The institutions left behind by this Union still haven't fully disappeared in both inter-national and intra-national contexts, and in some respects, have even been resurgent. \n\nThere are several factors that will prevent a revolution in China like the Soviet Union. To start, China has already successfully moved past its period of economic reform. This is where the Soviet Union failed to persist. Secondly, China is a highly centralized nation. The Soviet Union devolved authority to national SSR's, which enabled local populist politicians in each SSR to enact policies independent of the central Communist Party once the Soviet Union began dissolving. Since this doesn't exist in China, every politician is subordinate to the central Communist Party, and hence does not have the sort of freedom granted to the politicians of each SSR. There is no venue for populist frustration to be vented. Thirdly, there is no nationalist fervor or general discontent among the population that would provide support for anybody who would try to organize this. The Communist Party maintains a veneer of political diversity and dissenting opinions by regulating an amount of political dissent and diversity deemed acceptable by the Politburo. ",

We need incentives to work, and I think one of the biggest disservices modern governments do to the most disadvantaged and unfortunate portions of their populations is providing them welfare. While, on the surface, it's branded as a 'safety-net' to help them get back on their feet - this only helps in an individual scope and is subject to the whims of the individual. This is actually an excuse for the government to stave off the need to address systematic political and economic issues that are keeping these portions of their population at a disadvantage. To fix these problems would require politicians to engage in actual reform and sociopolitical restructuring of these communities, which is a daunting prospect for them, especially when they rely on moneyed-interests and the ballot. Instead of just giving cash handouts, the government should assist by dealing with the source of the problem directly - not just delaying the problem for future generations to deal with. Welfare is a capitalist eschewing of socialist ideals. This is why they skirt away from ever calling their policies 'social-ism,' they call it 'social democracy.' Because it is not socialism, and it is not within the interests of the disadvantaged communities. They make this important distinction themselves with their own rhetoric. It's a weak compromise between two different perspectives on how an economy should function. \n\nWe are naturally spurred forward by an incentive to better ourselves. Welfare eliminates this incentive, but it also eliminates the incentive for the government to address the problems plaguing the communities it is supposed to represent. Instead, factories should be built, districts should be re-zoned, political corruption should be eliminated and public services should be improved. These are actual, material changes that impact a community positively. It is not just a facade of temporary prosperity put up through a monthly dispensing of cash, which barely suffices to cover basic needs as it is.",
