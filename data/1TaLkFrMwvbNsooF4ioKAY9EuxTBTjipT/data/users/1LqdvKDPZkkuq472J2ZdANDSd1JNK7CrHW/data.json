And fill it also using anonymity services (coinjoin/coin mixing, see oldest comment in this thread ).\n\nyes, but why bother with proxy, coinjoin, mixing and Bitcoins outrageous fees to get \"mixed\" coins that can be distinguished from unmixed coins, that can eventually put you in trouble afterwards?\n\nIn Monero all coins are equal and they have no tx history and average fees are below 1 cent, not 15$ like in Bitcoin",

Because everything like downloading, file parsing etc. is done client side. The sample link posted loads a lot of data simultaneously.\n\n> Firefox developer console (F12 key) shown Uncaught RangeError: invalid or out-of-range index\n\nI'm getting that error as well.
