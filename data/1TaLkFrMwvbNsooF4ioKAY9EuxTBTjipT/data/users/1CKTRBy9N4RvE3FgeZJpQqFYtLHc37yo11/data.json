			"body": "Why is globalism a problem?\n\nThe goal of globalization is the \"denaturation of man for the benefit of an undifferentiated planetary man.\"\n\nFrom Ignatius of Loyola, to Jacob Frank, to Claude Henri de Rouvroy (Count of Saint-Simon), to all the excited leftists of the last 230 years*, to the theosophists, to all the new-age currents of the 20th century, and now to the Social Justice Warrior movement,\nmadness only passes from hand to hand. But it's still the same madness. It is well beyond some masonic trends and groups or even purely jewish cabalistic movements.\n\nWhat amazes me when I read all these people, and I first realized this when I read Loyola and Jacob Frank,\nis that the words and even the articulation of the words between them are the same and yet time separates them. This proves that madness has something fundamentally UNIQUE about it.\nThis is something that psychiatrists are well aware of, even if they develop categories in the manifestations of their patients, they know very well that \"madness is ONE\".\n\nConspiracy circles mistake themselves to understand this. And that's also why they're going into the theories of a localized plot. \nReality is quite different, evil, as religious call it; is, and has always been, THE MADNESS. \nThis madness is not specific to humans, but is found in all other animal species.\n\n\n* a good book on left-wing freaks is: Fire in the Minds of Men by James H. Billington\nhttps://archive.org/details/fireinthemindsofmen2/page/n3\nto understand that all the so-called revolutionary movements of the 230 years are the origin of a few enlightened (illuminated illuminati) people, as these people like to call themselves:\npure madness, but there is really nothing we can't do, everyone's nature is quick to madness, MORE FOR SOME THAN OTHERS.",

Go see the work (Cosmic Mildew 2.0) that does (1)\nyou may understand that biologies are different. \nAnd that according to my theory, which overlaps with his, biologies are probably infested by parasites that make them react \"in a gregarious way\".\n\nYou will notice if you have not already noticed, a very small proportion of people \"really individualized in their behaviors and ways of thinking\".\nAnd that public education strengthens \"the gregarious spirit\".\n\nIt's always about an \"we\", \"we should\", \"we must',\" all socialism revolves around that:\n- Remove 'individual forces' and MOVE THEM towards the GROUP (aka SOCIALISM aka DEMOCRACY)\n\nThat's why I react so strongly to 'all the indoctrinated socialists' I meet, but I have the same online behaviour as in life. I don't let this kind of thing go by.\nIt's viceral (biological), it always has been.\nPeople like me instinctively don't like everything that is collective.\n\nFor example, I am awfully uncomfortable in a group.\nI have always preferred individual activities.\nI am a born leader and generally take charge the group, no matter where I have been.\n\n- Democracy itself, masquot of the Freemasonic Sect (hence the link between LIBERTY which is DEMOCRACY and vice versa), \nSect that for me created Socialism From Scratch, and the need to make societies IS AT WORK BEHIND IT:A COLLECTIVE HIVE MIND.\n\nOr at least a group of individuals, who through the pyramidal structure of the Masonic sect works behind.\n\nI can't prove everything, but I know that our human history is common, because architecture and symbols are the same 'all over the world'.\n\nNor do I exclude globally a conflict between two factions:\n- one globalist, (and gregarious and socialist and democratic),\n- and the other patriotic, nationalist, defending the values of the family symbolized in the 20th century by the 'fascist currents'. Movements always crushed by globalist forces.\n\nAgain, I cannot prove all this, because the individual intellectual work is too important. \nBut I am not the only one working, others have come 'to the same conclusions'.\n\nAnd sooner or later if these hypotheses are confirmed;\nthen we will seek out by factions, those people who orchestrate in the shadows. I have no doubt about that.\n\nBut I am beyond personal attacks, on the contrary they amuse me. A personnality(person) is an illusion. \nA person does not exist biologically.\nAn individual exists biologically exists, it is a reality, not a person.\nSo I'm having fun \"with this kind of attacks\".\n\n\n(1) :\nhttps://invidio.us/watch?v=Fb7LEZUZErI mirror video of\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa346x9hzqOrP6TiGiNt0Hw\t\t\t\nhttps://vk.com/videos213579480?section=album_2\t\t\tcan't download or see without account\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/channel/ludin_rusi/\t\t\t\tno video in it",

I have no way of knowing whether writing an article critical of Google will affect my search results,\nBECAUSE GOOGLE DOESN'T SAY.\n\nANOTHER TACTIC BEING EMPLOYED AGAINST INDIVIDUALS\n\"\n\nBut the same thing was done for modern operating systems, back then the linux distributions were based on respect of the User.\nAnd respecting his Privacy Was Not EVEN something conceptualizable.\n\nToday all major distributions have been hacked by a whole bunch of trojan horses, the main ones being systemd and gnome.\nBut there are dozens of them, something completely open as linux has become completely CLOSED.\n\nIt's silly, BUT PEOPLE LOVE 'THE HERD SPIRIT'.\n\nAnd open source in general I don't talk about it, the only reason it still holds a little bit, is that projects are not centralizable. Except for a few nodes like github (bought by Microsoft obviously).\n\nI URGE ALL ZERONET DEVELOPERS AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE NETWORKS\nto review their ways of seeing things,\nand to understand:\nthat to let the wolf into the sheepfold, this network will end up like the others, in the oblivion of a technology that WAS PROMISING FOR THE INDIVIDUAL.",

As a natural product of this practice, a secret theological system was formed, in which God was regarded as a Big Man, and vice versa, man was regarded as a small god. By analogy, the Universe is considered as a human being, and the human being is considered as a miniature universe. The Big Universe was called the Macrocosm, the Great World or the Body, and the Great Life, or the spiritual essence controlling its activity, was called the Macrosoft. Pagan Mysteries mainly concerned the conversion of neophytes in light of the true relationship that exists between Macrocosm and Microcosm, in other words, between God and man. The key to this correspondence between the Microcosmic Man and the Macrocosmic Man was the most valuable acquisition of the initiated.\nIn \"Isis\" Blavatskaya summarizes the pagan concept of man as follows: Man is a small world - the microcosm within the larger universe. Like an embryo, he is suspended by all spirits in the microcosm matrix, and while his body being (earthly body) is in constant harmony with his home planet, his astral soul lives in unison with the sideric anima mundi (world soul). It is in it, and it is in it, because the penetrating element of the world fills all space and itself is space, only infinite and infinite.\"\n\n\"Commonly regarded as political theorists, the Gentiles gained such a reputation not because they worshiped more than one God, but rather because they personified the attributes of this God, while creating a pantheon of subjugated deities, each of which manifests a part of what the One God represented as a whole.\"\n\nWhat's wrong with these people.\n\nwhen in reality it is:\n\"PAST INITIATORS WARNED THEIR STUDENTS THAT AN IMAGE IS NOT REALITY, BUT SIMPLY AN OBJECTIFICATION OF A SUBJECTIVE IDEA.

Which was limited itself to seeking content,\nand referencing it, WITHOUT JUDGMENT.\n\nThe google algorithm rightly called page ranking is not intelligent at all, and just killed the internet.\n\nThere too I have no illusions, too few intelligent people populate this world, and could reverse the trend.\n\nThe problem is not just in the internet, but in the general context of this world, everything today revolves around this stupid referencing.\n\nFor example, a fashionable product without any technological merit, can overnight a quality based well manufactured product.\n\nI remember products that lasted more than fifty years, now it's over. \nIt is not the industrialists who produce badly, and who are pure swindlers in pulling the prices of the raw materials. \n\nBut indeed this society which put forward as principle of existence\nsomething as sterile as the page-ranking as a working model to organize itself. it says how dead it is.\n\nThere are much more intelligent civilizations that populated this earth before us, \nbut our decline may well come not from a destruction of Nature, which is perhaps cyclically programmed for great cataclysms,\nbut rather in our total collective idiocy.",

But not in a democratic society. In this one, people don't have their feet on the ground. They were not educated for this, but educated to dream. Most of them do not have a psychological maturity, for example to respond to a psychological attack. And stay motionless when it happens.\n\nThere is a difference between an Initiatic society and a democratic society. \nDemocratic society provides dreamers, all you have to do is look at school curricula. It's condescending; \"basically we live in the most enlightened society in the world\".\n\nThe Initiatic society does things differently. It takes the young person, and catapults him through the initiations into adulthood.\nThe real supporters (owners) of the democratic society do not want such a society. It is obvious that a truly adult population is the opposite of 'what these people want'.\n\nTo finish the portrait, and to avoid the remark I always hear, yes, \"but there will be a popular surge\".\nNo, this is not possible, because nature makes different kinds, different psychologies. And in these, it makes a part of warriors capable of defending themselves, but this is only one part.\nMoreover, if you read past stories and tales, you can see that the warrior class was quite different within the community. There will never be enough warriors to overthrow the current power worldwide.\nWhat can happen, and has already happened, are autonomous groups that are formed to take local power. That's already more achievable.\nThe warrior is a pragmatic person, and does not like dreams too much. He likes \"achievable objectives\".\n\nThe objectives you hear in the alternative community are objectives, which have only one goal:\nTo sustain the democratic society by contributing to it. \nIf you contribute to improving something that you don't have control over, then it's not feasible. It is purely an intellectual work, a dream. That's what these people do, thinking they're doing something else. They were educated to intellectualize things, not to act.",

Tavistock is absolutely for real...at one time they managed to include me in their mailing list for about a year. Pretty much everything they sent through about their courses was about social control - mostly geared to wards children and the family in 2009 or thereabout. There is plenty of other evidence which exposes numerous other groups and organisations.\"\n- They have to do that, if those people behind, don't orchestrate the game like that, it 'would be even worse'.\"\nThese people 'Have The Experience of Past Civilizations', humans 'never having evolved that much'\nand 'remain primary and religious'. They therefore 'KNOW THEIR ENEMY', and must 'CONTROL HIM'.\n\n- Perhaps in a few years you will understand 'what I have understood'. \nIt takes time, then you will see why 'those people in the shadows' 'do what they do'.\n\n\"Pavlov proved that given the right stimulus natural behavior\"\n- Like all people, you take the problem 'in the wrong direction': \nand don't understand that it is this body 'that you are' that is taken by \"automatisms\".\n- It is therefore these resistances \"that must be overcome\":\nthe awakening is not \"that of an individual\"\n\tbut that of a biologic body caught in a \"cycle of thoughts\". Perhaps one day you will understand, if you persevere in 'deconstructing the Religious Thought'.\nWhich it 'HAS NO CENTRE', and which the Secret Societies \"HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST from Time Immemorial\":\nyou've Got The Wrong Enemy like almost 'everyone else'.\n\tBut how would you know that, you're not 'out of the circle' yet.\n\n\"Teach children that there are no defined sexes and some with weak minds will become transgender candidates. The vast majority of children do not grasp the concept of the sexes until they reach puberty or therabouts, when left to their own devices. So called educators fucking with their heads from a primary school age is absolutely proof of social engineering.\"\n- I woke up 'on my own', and made 'my own initiation'. I did not need people, but relied on the words of \"those who had already gone \"through this\"\". That's \"how it works\".\nThat's why the fight continues 'in the shadows'.\n\n\"Wherever you go in the world the vast majority of people want the same basic things from life such as peace and security in life.\"\n- They don't, they spend 'all their time destroying'.\n\n\"Children do not discriminate by nature\"\n- There is no purity in the child, the child has the same desires 'as an adult', as pervert and twisted 'as an adult, and is 'as envious as the adult'. Greed is 'not the problem'. No greed=no life. Every form of life 'knows this', except the religious.\n\n\"Children have an inherent understanding of right and wrong until they are corrupted by external influences.\"\n- Nothing is external.\n\n\"Peer pressure is a corner stone\"\n- Peer pressure is 'what life is all about'. Nothing wrong with that.\nNo pressure=no Learning.\n\n\"political correctness\"\n- Religious thought does this, you'd be surprised 'how the body reacts once the intertwining of thoughts is removed': IT'S A BEAST.\n\n\"Even then butch women can't physically perform the roles a male can perform\"\n- You're confusing everything. A woman 'has no need to have the physical power of a man'. There are lots of women who 'have power in institutions'. And power can be exercised through a 'woman' as well 'as a man'.\n\n\"In addition to that movies are used to create emotional responses, through visual stimulation and music that is carefully orchestrated to induce specific moods and feelings, which would be far less likely to occur in the absence of the musical accompaniment. Disney is a gateway into this level of emotional control aimed at catching the minds of children at an early age.\"\n- Yes that's what they do, those who want to wake up, Can Wake Up.

Modern programming languages, frameworks and APIs have powerful means to create sophisticated solutions for various kinds of problems. Sometimes developers might feel tempted to write “clever” solutions that use all these complex features. The KISS principle states that a solution is better when it uses less inheritance, less polymorphism, fewer classes, etc.\nA solution that follows the KISS principle might look boring or even “stupid” but simple and understandable. The KISS principle states that there is no value in a solution being “clever” but in one being easily understandable. \nRationale\n\nA SIMPLER SOLUTION IS BETTER THAN A COMPLEX ONE BECAUSE SIMPLE SOLUTIONS ARE EASIER TO MAINTAIN.\"\nTO MAINTAIN.\nTO MAINTAIN.\nTO MAINTAIN.\nTO MAINTAIN.\nTO MAINTAIN.\n\n\"This includes increased readability, understandability, and changeability. Furthermore writing simple code is less error prone.\nThe advantage of simplicity is even bigger when the person who maintains the software is not the one who once wrote it. The maintainer might also be less familiar with sophisticated programming language features. So simple and stupid programs are easier to maintain because the maintainer needs less time to understand them and is less likely to introduce further defects.\"\n\nToday, the vast majority of Linux users do not know how their systems work.

A DELIBERATELY -> PERPETUATED -> DECEPTION.\n\n\nPS:\nWomen have their roles in the couple, but the male role that is given to them in modern societies 'IS A DECEPTION'.\nIf you look at the male and female sides, you will see that women do not have the same inpulsivity as men. \nThe man must defend, the woman protects. Giving a male role in society DAMAGES WOMEN'S BIOLOGY.\n\nMan has no difficulty in rising in tension because he has more testosterones, and must use them otherwise they are too many. Testosterones: hormones produced as its name suggests in the gonads (male and female).\nBut \"Testosterone circulating in the serum of an adult male is on average seven to eight times higher than in women.\"\nYou understand the Difference.\n\nThe goal of having a moral and a healthy religious institution is to \"not INVERT the VALUES OF BIOLOGY\".\nThis is what all the people who push experiments TOWARDS DEVIANCE, and who always find the support of a few sects, are striving to do, always have if you read the texts.\n\nThe human body is a complex subject, but if you don't understand 'how it works', you don't understand 'your own reactions',\nby pushing towards the religious worship of the divination of one individual: A God and and Other Divinities; THEY HAVE PUSHED PEOPLE 'OUT OF THE RELIGIOUS SPECTRUM', \nand the people who ORCHESTRATE behind (especially at some level of masonry but probably in 'other instances' unknown 'to the general public') \nKNOW -HOW to INFLECT THE EDUCATION of Children \nTO PERVERT THEM-.",

This is a waste of time and represents an 'unnecessary danger to those who do it'.\n\nThere is an expression in my country that basically says that Freemasonry does not govern the country well, but defends itself well.\nHacking the system will only bring you trouble and 'legal problems'. Moreover, it will only constitute a good big case against you, because once they are spotted, they will accumulate the pieces against you the day they need them.\n \nIt is therefore completely unnecessary, and deprives the community of 'living forces' that would be useful FOR BETTER PURPOSES.\n\nA much smarter thing to do is to be forgotten about the system. And at the same time \"CONTINUE YOUR HISTORICAL RESEARCH\" because our history is completely distorted.\nIt is distorted because basically what is told has never existed or is so distorted that it no longer represents 'anything concrete'.\n\nThe more forces, the more individuals who continue their research on it, the more likely we are to discover \"what really happened\".\n\nOnce we find out what really happened, then we can take action because we know WHERE TO HIT.\n\nAs noble as the political and hacker fight is, it is futile. I still have many friends in these circles and I know that they are wasting 'their time'.\n\nI respect them because they are noble people, but their struggles are futile and fruitless. We went through it throughout the 20th century, all resistances were overcome and always easily.\n\nWe have to do something different, and search, AND FIND information by cross-checking all the material that can now be found online.\nAnd find out WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.\n\nWe need to be smarter that the ones who behind control.\n\nInvidually people have to learn to control their passions, and to become less reactive.\nThey must domesticate themselves.\nIt's the only way we will to beat them. By raising an army of people with enough \"self-control\" \"to defeat them\".\n\nA GOOD WARRIOR IS A COLD-BLOODED FIRST.",

In order to create a system-wide configuration, follow the steps outlined in Locking preferences:\n\n1. Create /usr/lib/firefox/defaults/pref/local-settings.js:\n\npref(\"general.config.obscure_value\", 0);\npref(\"general.config.filename\", \"mozilla.cfg\");\n\n2. Create /usr/lib/firefox/mozilla.cfg (this stores the actual configuration):\n\n//\n//...your settings...\n// e.g to disable Pocket, uncomment the following line\n// lockPref(\"browser.pocket.enabled\", false);\n\nPlease note that the first line must contain exactly //. The syntax of the file is similar to that of user.js. \n\"\n\nPS:\nI keep palemoon only for the modularity, and the fact that all the new mozilla versions are too difficult to tweak.\nI have no confidence in everything I can't set up. And everything has been done in recent years was to remove \"the easy setting\" of all browsers in circulation.\n\nbasically these are \"turnkey products\", from obscure associations or companies in which we should have \"absolute confidence\", because they say they act upon concepts.\nI have a long tradition of political fight and this kind of practice always ends up returning to socialism and democracy, which are one and the same thing.

Go see the work (Cosmic Mildew 2.0) that does (1)\nyou may understand that biologies are different. \nAnd that according to my theory, which overlaps with his, biologies are probably infested by parasites that make them react \"in a gregarious way\".\n\nYou will notice if you have not already noticed, a very small proportion of people \"really individualized in their behaviors and ways of thinking\".\nAnd that public education strengthens \"the gregarious spirit\".\n\nIt's always about an \"we\", \"we should\", \"we must',\" all socialism revolves around that:\n- Remove 'individual forces' and MOVE THEM towards the GROUP (aka SOCIALISM aka DEMOCRACY)\n\nThat's why I react so strongly to 'all the indoctrinated socialists' I meet, but I have the same online behaviour as in life. I don't let this kind of thing go by.\nIt's viceral (biological), it always has been.\nPeople like me instinctively don't like everything that is collective.\n\nFor example, I am awfully uncomfortable in a group.\nI have always preferred individual activities.\nI am a born leader and generally take charge the group, no matter where I have been.\n\n- Democracy itself, masquot of the Freemasonic Sect (hence the link between LIBERTY which is DEMOCRACY and vice versa), \nSect that for me created Socialism From Scratch, and the need to make societies IS AT WORK BEHIND IT:A COLLECTIVE HIVE MIND.\n\nOr at least a group of individuals, who through the pyramidal structure of the Masonic sect works behind.\n\nI can't prove everything, but I know that our human history is common, because architecture and symbols are the same 'all over the world'.\n\nNor do I exclude globally a conflict between two factions:\n- one globalist, (and gregarious and socialist and democratic),\n- and the other patriotic, nationalist, defending the values of the family symbolized in the 20th century by the 'fascist currents'. Movements always crushed by globalist forces.\n\nAgain, I cannot prove all this, because the individual intellectual work is too important. \nBut I am not the only one working, others have come 'to the same conclusions'.\n\nAnd sooner or later if these hypotheses are confirmed;\nthen we will seek out by factions, those people who orchestrate in the shadows. I have no doubt about that.\n\nBut I am beyond personal attacks, on the contrary they amuse me. A personnality(person) is an illusion. \nA person does not exist biologically.\nAn individual exists biologically exists, it is a reality, not a person.\nSo I'm having fun \"with this kind of attacks\".\n\n\n(1) :\nhttps://invidio.us/watch?v=Fb7LEZUZErI mirror video of\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa346x9hzqOrP6TiGiNt0Hw\t\t\t\nhttps://vk.com/videos213579480?section=album_2\t\t\tcan't download or see without account\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/channel/ludin_rusi/\t\t\t\tno video in it",

It was before my time.\n\n      https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/what-i-learned-about-the-internet.html\n\"What the Internet Used to Look Like:\n\nThe internet was still composed mostly of the websites of hobbyists linked together by telephone lines. Company upper-level managers were just beginning to wonder if they could make some money from it. \n \nAs such, the internet WAS SO VARIED \nTHAT IS WAS HARD TO CHARACTERIZE.\n\nBack then, ANYONE WAS WELCOME ON THE INTERNET. \nTHERE WERE NO REAL RULES OR LAWS governing what you could do. \nIt wasn't even illegal to HACK into SOMEONE ELSE'S COMPUTER network and create whatever havoc you could think of.\n \nThe internet grew mostly because commercial companies found ways to offer internet services that people wanted: \nfirst, information and email; \nlater, social networking and shopping; \neven later, VOIP telephone services, music, movies and all the other great stuff we have now.\n \nWhat the internet Looks Like Now:\nBut the bottom line is that Google doesn't have to tell you anything. I have no way of knowing whether writing an article critical of Google will affect my search results, \nBECAUSE GOOGLE DOESN'T SAY.\n\nANOTHER TACTIC BEING EMPLOYED AGAINST INDIVIDUALS\n\"\n\nBut the same thing was done for modern operating systems, back then the linux distributions were based on respect of the User.\nAnd respecting his privacy was not EVEN something conceptualizable.\n\nToday all major distributions have been hacked by a whole bunch of trojan horses, the main ones being systemd and gnome.\nBut there are dozens of them, something completely open as linux has become completely CLOSED. \n\nIt's silly, BUT PEOPLE 'LOVE THE HERD SPIRIT'.\n\nAnd open source in general I don't talk about it, the only reason it still holds a little bit, is that projects are not centralizable. Except for a few nodes like github (bought by Microsoft obviously). \n\nI URGE ALL ZERONET DEVELOPERS AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE NETWORKS \nto review their ways of seeing things, \nand to understand:\nthat to let the wolf into the sheepfold, this network will end up like the others, in the oblivion of a technology that WAS PROMISING FOR THE INDIVIDUAL.",

Also, if everyone used their own solutions for everything to avoid being dependent on specific project, none of them would be well tested and thus very insecure. If you want maximum privacy and security, design your own hardware, produce it yourself, write an OS and its programs all by yourself from scratch, and prepare to bug-test the shit out of them until the rest of your days before even daring to use the internet for any actual work or entertainment on such setup. When you're 90 years old, you've (maybe) finally done it! But... was it worth it?\n\nThat's a devil's advocate pamphlet, i have no illusion about anything 'related to politics'.\nPeople prefer easyness, 'not my cup of tea'. \nAll i've done was hard and complicated. At times there was no one, it takes courage and obstination. \nNow decades later, i'm free of all that shit, because 'i know how things work'.\nDon't ask me to do something 'i'm not programmed for', this world 'does not work like that'.\n\nBut as i said, if this industrialized world evolves, it will be by implementing 'more people with higher consciousness' not by politics, politics is a decoy as i try to point to simple people.

As Slavoj Zizek (a communist) says, \"today the light at the end of the tunnel is actually an incoming train\". There is no \"big other\" with which one can use to justify this or that act or atrocity, but we have to fight in order to try and build a freer, more democratic, more just world even if the odds are stacked against us. Hope of a singing future then springs if anything, from our own efforts, futile though they may seem to be. I am skeptical of this so-called \"historical inevitability\", if anything it is one potential future, though I think and hope it's where we will be (think a more realistic Star Trek like world hundreds of years from now). As for a universal symbolism we have to look at the socioeconomic forces behind prevailing civilization (historical materialism) but also within the human spirit itself. People like to be free, people like to have control over their own lives and communities. I think these are good things but you are right there are dangers and if anything the 20th century is a startling reminder of that, it's something we can never forget. My problem is this absurd notion that \"anything against individualism (or that I don't like) is COMMUNISM\". You can't do that, just paint anything you don't like as socialism/ communism. Especially since when some of the most radical individualists in human history have themselves been communists, and especially in regards to ZeroNet when we communists on here do not say or think the things you say in this post that we say or think.

If you play their game by their rules (physical violence, technology, media etc.) they're going to win every time. It's weakness is the ideas that form the basis for it's existence. The idea that you somehow formed a contract with it to be governed by it. The idea that it can manage economic affairs better than people left to freely negotiate their own contracts. The idea that you cannot be secure without it. The idea that it is the ultimate authority. Not having a good grasp of these topics and making them more widely understood is what's brought us to this. That they now have a microphone embedded in every corner of our households is just a nasty symptom. A 'subversive' conversation in your house is not so much of a problem if there are millions of 'subversive' conversations taking place every minute of the day. Until 'want to get rid of Government altogether' and phrases like it become an everyday expression, it'll stand out like a flagpole among all the conversations about football, Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. There will be tacit support for your being removed from the 'civilized' World e.g. Assange.

I'll offer an evolutionary rationale for the difference. The occurrence of skin cancer isn't a good evolutionary reason for white people and black people...let us go back to the beginning when our brains were smaller and our knuckles were closer to the ground. Black people are black because of high concentrations of melanin positioned above the cytoplasm and nucleus of skin cells. This compound effectively shades the DNA in the nucleus from the mutating effects of ultraviolet radiation lowering the rate of mutation in somatic (body) cell replication. It also shades the blood in the capillaries from UV, and it turns out that UV destroys folic acid in exposed blood, lowering the overall concentration of vitamin B-9. Low levels of vitamin B-9 substantially decrease the success rate of pregnancy. In short, people who live in equatorial land masses have much higher exposure to UV, and melanin protected blood provides a reproductive advantage. So why would people be white? Vitamin D is produced in the skin cells using a mechanism that relies on high energy photons (UV) interacting with various compounds in the skin cells. A sunscreen of 30 or above lowers production of vitamin D by 95%. Rickets is a syndrome that will kill you well before reproductive age resulting from insufficient levels of vitamin D. Therefore, white skin is a survival advantage in latitudes where UV radiation is much weaker. When black people live in far northern and southern latitudes, they need to take vitamin D supplements to avoid rickets. Now let us bring it all together. People who live at extreme latitudes having a diet rich in vitamin D (liver, fatty meats) have dark skin. Having sufficient dietary vitamin D means that melanin protected blood and higher folic acid concentrations become the primary selective force in their phenotype. This means that skin color is simply an adaptation increasing fitness in specific global climate conditions. Nothing more. Saying that white people are more or less intelligent because of their skin color is like saying people are more or less intelligent because they are tall, or they have brown eyes. This type of thinking blatantly reveals the person expressing it as either uneducated or promoting some agenda in spite of strong evidence to the contrary.\n\n\"Does anyone know why human skin color differs in such significant ways?\"\nNot just the colour of the skin, the average length of the bones, the shape of the skull, etc.\nThere is not a single human species, but many biological species. That is why inter-species pregnancies are difficult and 'you need to force them'.",

I was employed at an IT company for the last year (switched jobs) thought I was going to learn some deeper automation stuff, turns out they needed a button clicker, ended up wasting a year because nothing was open in my area...I noticed nobody gave a shit some treated work as just a social gathering place (director levels) and others  grinded to the bones..it was a pretty boomer company.\n\nyou know (you probably don't know it because few know it) but many highly developed civilizations existed before ours. I never had any expectations on this one.\nas I have always said: \"after me nothing\". \nThis one will eventually be destroyed or destroy itself, and it will not leave a anything memorable.\nBut I won't be here to see this large disaster anymore.\n\nDecades ago, feeling how it was going to turn, I took the front steps to change my lifestyle, I don't regret anything.\nAnd in some twenty years time, if it continues like this, I don't even dare to imagine HOW DYSFUNCTIONAL this society will become from every point of view.\n\nAs for work, I have always carefully avoided large companies. Knowing that I will not tolerate the atmosphere in them. \n\nNothing has changed except that the engineers who at the time were pushing up the general intellectual level, became these young brainless morons, more concerned about the appearance of their desktop, than fixing the computer problems.\nIn fact, it's this fucking generation that has only been creating computer problems on computer problems for the past twenty years. \nThese youngsters are desperately too stupid to understand anything about anything.",

A Buddhist (or just a more enlighted) interpretation would be that he is talking about a system of government that is internal to each person, meaning that it is a personal thing, not a group thing.

A person must find the steps, first.  And, the steps have to be in the right order.  Most people just aren't looking for the steps, because they haven't matured to the point yet where they realize that there are steps.  I think they understand that as it applies to child development, but they either don't see that it also applies to adult intellectual/spiritual/psychological development, or they just don't care.  With them the growth process happens unconsciously as events happen in their lives.  This is a slower process than combining the naturally occurring unconscious process with consciously looking for the steps.  It seems that almost all people die before they realize how to live.

So, people who are pushing for either democracy or communism will never get their way.  Instead of complaining about that, why not talk about something that is actually attainable--like decent healthcare, better educational assistance for the poor, less corruption in government, true penalties for giant corporations that are monopolizing sections of the economy?\n\nEverything you have just said is achievable. But not in a democratic society. In this one, people don't have their feet on the ground. They were not educated for this, but educated to dream. Most of them do not have a psychological maturity, for example to respond to a psychological attack. And stay motionless when it happens.\n\nThere is a difference between an Initiatic society and a democratic society. \nDemocratic society provides dreamers, all you have to do is look at school curricula. It's condescending; \"basically we live in the most enlightened society in the world\".\n\nThe Initiatic society does things differently. It takes the young person, and catapults him through the initiations into adulthood.\nThe real supporters (owners) of the democratic society do not want such a society. It is obvious that a truly adult population is the opposite of 'what these people want'.\n\nTo finish the portrait, and to avoid the remark I always hear, yes, \"but there will be a popular surge\".\nNo, this is not possible, because nature makes different kinds, different psychologies. And in these, it makes a part of warriors capable of defending themselves, but this is only one part.\nMoreover, if you read past stories and tales, you can see that the warrior class was quite different within the community. There will never be enough warriors to overthrow the current power worldwide.\nWhat can happen, and has already happened, are autonomous groups that are formed to take local power. That's already more achievable.\nThe warrior is a pragmatic person, and does not like dreams too much. He likes \"achievable objectives\".\n\nThe objectives you hear in the alternative community are objectives, which have only one goal:\n- To sustain the democratic society by contributing to it. \nIf you contribute to improving something that you don't have control over, then it's not feasible. It is purely an intellectual work, a dream. That's what these people do, thinking they're doing something else. They were educated to intellectualize things, not to act.",

For it is necessary to understand how the elements are intertwined, and what they are used for individually. \nHowever, with a little linux experience, it is possible. The initialization system is only one element. There is also the boot initialization which is another element before this one. So yes, you have to experiment a little. But unix is based on experimentation, and is quite flexible, since they are basically only independent elements. \nHence the interest of not doing, that has been done in the last twenty years; to assemble the elements into one another.\nThe more independent and simple the elements are, the easier your system is to understand and control.",

Tavistock is absolutely for real...at one time they managed to include me in their mailing list for about a year. Pretty much everything they sent through about their courses was about social control - mostly geared to wards children and the family in 2009 or thereabout. There is plenty of other evidence which exposes numerous other groups and organisations.\"\nThey have to do that, if those people behind, don't orchestrate the game like that, it 'would be even worse'.\"\nThese people 'Have The Experience of Past Civilizations', humans 'never having evolved that much'\nand 'remain primary and religious'. They therefore 'KNOW THEIR ENEMY', and must 'CONTROL HIM'.\n\n\nPerhaps in a few years you will understand 'what I have understood'. \nIt takes time, then you will see why 'those people in the shadows' 'do what they do'.\n\n\n\"Pavlov proved that given the right stimulus natural behavior\"\nLike all people, you take the problem 'in the wrong direction': \nand don't understand that it is this body 'that you are' that is taken by \"automatisms\".\nIt is therefore these resistances \"that must be overcome\":\nthe awakening is not \"that of an individual\"\n\tbut that of a biologic body caught in a \"cycle of thoughts\". Perhaps one day you will understand, if you persevere in 'deconstructing the Religious Thought'.\nWhich it 'HAS NO CENTRE', and which the Secret Societies \"HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST from Time Immemorial\":\nyou've Got The Wrong Enemy like almost 'everyone else'.\n\tBut how would you know that, you're not 'out of the circle' yet.\n\n\n\"Teach children that there are no defined sexes and some with weak minds will become transgender candidates. The vast majority of children do not grasp the concept of the sexes until they reach puberty or therabouts, when left to their own devices. So called educators fucking with their heads from a primary school age is absolutely proof of social engineering.\"\nI woke up 'on my own', and made 'my own initiation'. I did not need people, but relied on the words of \"those who had already gone \"through this\"\". That's \"how it works\".\nThat's why the fight continues 'in the shadows'.\n\n\n\"Wherever you go in the world the vast majority of people want the same basic things from life such as peace and security in life.\"\nThey don't, they spend 'all their time destroying'.\n\n\n\"Children do not discriminate by nature\"\nThere is no purity in the child, the child has the same desires 'as an adult', as pervert and twisted 'as an adult, and is 'as envious as the adult'. Greed is not the problem. No greed=no life. Every form of life knows this, except the religious.\n\n\n\"Children have an inherent understanding of right and wrong until they are corrupted by external influences.\"\nNothing is external.\n\n\n\"Peer pressure is a corner stone\"\nPeer pressure is 'what life is all about'. Nothing wrong with that.\nNo pressure=no Learning.\n\n\n\"political correctness\"\nReligious thought does this., you'd be surprised 'how the body reacts once the intertwining of thoughts is removed': IT'S A BEAST.\n\n\n\"Even then butch women can't physically perform the roles a male can perform\"\nYou're confusing everything. A woman 'has no need to have the physical power of a man'. There are lots of women who 'have power in institutions'. And power can be exercised through a 'woman' as well 'as a man'.\n\n\n\"In addition to that movies are used to create emotional responses, through visual stimulation and music that is carefully orchestrated to induce specific moods and feelings, which would be far less likely to occur in the absence of the musical accompaniment. Disney is a gateway into this level of emotional control aimed at catching the minds of children at an early age.\"\nYes that's what they do, those who want to wake up, Can Wake Up. What's stopping you?\n\n\n\"Not only does this distort the natural development of normal human emotions.\"\nThe body doesn't care about emotions.\nThe body does not need or 'want to feel anything'. \nYou don't realize 'how much like all religious people' you are destroying 'your body' 'with these games'.\n\n\n\"Humans are like virtually every other life form on earth they always gravitate towards the path of least resistance for the most part.\"\nYou're right about that one, but you don't understand 'where to go from there'.\n\n\n\"here are groups who wish to control them retaining the power\"\nThey don't do that, \"they preserve life\", which they have done from 'time immemorial'.\nWithout them, there will be 'no civilization'(meaning no support), 'no technological development', 'no education', 'no health', and so on.\nYou 'have The Wrong Enemy'.\n\n\nIt's all religious regurgitation for the most part.
