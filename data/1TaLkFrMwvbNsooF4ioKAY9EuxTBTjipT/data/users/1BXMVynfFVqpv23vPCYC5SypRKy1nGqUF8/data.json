As said one key problem or source of destruction of the french state was this insistance by some to insert those so called \"anti-semith\" laws... personally I fully and totally oppose them, a word or pixel, is nothing, means nothing, and then killing, slaughtering or what ever anyone is that.\n\nI think this \"antisemith\" concept was used as a primer to create a dual justice system, not to the benefits of the jews who in those laws saw solution. but on the contrary to protect the new feodal aristocratic class... \n\nit was astute from their side.\n\nwill see how big the fall of the french state operators (looting feodal princes) will be or if they will be able to consolidate before it, in some kind of monarchic system.\n\nanyway... few understand complex dynamic system and specially the need for a law system to be equitable, meaning for example that the subtrash pedo in trailer is killed the same way as a president of the usa... \n\nthat was the dream, and it turned into a nightmare, hidden and cloaked, just below the full systemic level but with enough damage to already tarnish the whole for eternity.\n\nso we have the fall of france\nthe fall of the usa...\nwill israel plunges too? only you can decide, what about the girl raped by the 20 israeli in ei lat? none Organ harvested? ahh... so you understand who to NEVER EVER DARE TO mess with... \n\nthis judeo christian culture so dear to \"mike\" flynn, this pseudo shittaxleech is such shame, I stil don't understand if he too low iq, or just a vulgar goy.",

I still have difficulties to answer properly the questions resolving around this.\n\nOne sure thing, a peacefuller and calmer relation isn't an opportunity for again what ever one world or eurasian one gov. problems aren't easier to solve with more people or more territories to attempt to manage.",
