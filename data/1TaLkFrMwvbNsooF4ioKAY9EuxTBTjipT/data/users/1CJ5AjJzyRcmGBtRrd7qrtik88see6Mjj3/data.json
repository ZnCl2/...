Hell, by this even the referer get's forwarded to the targetlink.\nAlso Zeronet has no build in encryption of local content.\nThough i see Zeronets main concept is not encryption/security but censorship protection.\nBut even censorship protection feels hard to believe for me:\n1. Admins of a site can dictate how much space a user can use.\n2. A user can easily (be forced to) delete/edit his content.",
