I also saw connected peers take a nosedive.  I was up over 8k before the update, then I got hammered right back down to 100 and it's risen back up to around 1000, now.  It could be that we're seeing an artifact of a site change propagating across a network of thousands as opposed to dozens/hundreds.  Since it's not a central server pushing the updates to everyone, everyone needs to check with everyone else to see if they are the most up to date file(s).  So long as everyone you poll for an update has the old file, you will think you're up to date - until the authoritative change takes place.\n\nI thought that was the case at first too, propagation issues.  However I can load the whole package with my first instantiation, and see new post activity there.  It's only the genericID disabled version that's hanging now.",

ZeroNet was a means to an end for him in terms of it just got the job done, and the name popularity of 8chan served to keep it rather popular on ZN, which was, itself, virtually unknown or only commented on. [...]\n\nI also think Acidman is genuine, just a bit overwhelmed at this stage.  I'm not poking him, other than the documentation aspect.  Maybe as you allude, he doesn't have the resources.

There's a trust factor involved with respect to the anon doing the development work.  This is of understated importance.  Migrating to milchan may happen, yet we've been here only a few days now.  When I tested one of your milchan boards, my post wasn't anonymous (just an example).  I'm not a fan of forking at all, and the result with 08chan is no longer open source.

Chances are, the previous owner of the property didn't have this either.  So at some point in the chain of title, a bank held the patent.  Do you think when China for example buys land in the U.S. that they're paying for anything less than the property with patent?  What happens is that somewhere in the chain of title, a buyer needs to mortgage, and that's when the bank required the patent for collateral.  Then the propery may get subdivided, in which case the ownership also gets spread out, so no individual has complete claim on the original patent.  The solution is not inexpensive, and will require a full title search to begin with.  A surveyor will need to obtain new measurements of your boundaries, and a new plat drawn up.  Then you must have a notarized copy of the original patent, and prove your subdivision with the results of the title search.  Don't even think about suing unless you have more than just the title to the property.  If you live in a city, you may not have anything better than title to a \"lot\"; subdivision of an original patent.  In this case, the city will be holding the patent, and you won't ever.",

When he stated he'll get NATO involved, that seems to mean Erdogan's men could be deployed in Iraq for the role of cannon fodder.  Erdogan gets to say he must satisfy their NATO obligations, yet can also claim to be needed to represent Putin's interests.  What if PS752 was the false flag, and by twist of fate Khamenei's missile salvo pre-empted the narrative?  It would not have been so difficult, or beyond the means of mossad to have sabotaged the plane before it left Ukraine.",

				"body": "Considering what Erdogan's troops might imply with respect to altering the mindset that only use of tactical nuclear weaponry can make such a war winnable for the U.S., was the observation I took away from Trump's speech.  Weapons will beat cannon fodder, but only in an all-out scenario.  Skirmishes and salvos are preferrable to mutually assured destruction.  So the purpose of having Turkish troops deployed, or the potential thereof in the Iraqi theater, is as a limiting effect on the perception that nuclear weapons would be required.\n\n> [sfs9](#comment_10_1Ev2p6pn33TkPNNrMbNFwSspPzivpKaTKD): They probably lack the capacity to take on the U.S.\n\nWhile I understand and concur with most of what you said, history would tend to disagree that Iraq lacks capacity.  The empire can rapidly obliterate infrastructure quite well, and can now seemingly drone anyone anywhere anytime.  That doesn't mean achieving victory over the minds of those oppressed.  Neither Russia or the U.S. could do much when faced with the Afghani Taliban, so why expect less from a people who were basically gifted a martyr?",

				"body": "Below is from Jim Stone 82.221.129.208\ntldr - If the vaccine becomes mandatory, expect to be among the dead\n\n1. In 2015, Bill Gates filed a patent on a GMO modified coronavirus.\n\n2. Three months ago, during a conference where he was preaching the virtues of population reduction via vaccines, Gates did a hypothetical model where the coronavirus kills 65 million people. That's a stretch for coronavirus, which is simply the common cold, But then again, there is that patent. And at that conference, he preached the virtues of using vaccines to reduce the population.\n\n3. It appears there was an outbreak of sorts in China, but the Chinese government is quoting very low numbers and only a few dead, while obvious hoaxers on Twitter are posting videos from all times of the year claiming they just happened and saying thousands are dying because there are dead people laying everywhere. However, every major city has that many people laying in the streets daily due to either bike accidents or car accidents or passing out from strokes - Wuhan has a population of 11 million, there would therefore, by statistic, be multiple videos of people laying in the streets for various reasons daily. You'll get that many from gunshots alone in Chicago in one day. So there's plenty of hoax fodder, quite well proven by the fact the hoaxers did not get the time of year right, they just used whatever looked good.\n\n4. BIG PROBLEM - Britain is running with this, and doing quarantines. And if they are taking it that far there's little doubt it is going to be done in the U.S. also.\n\n5. BIGGER PROBLEM: Gates has the vaccine ready to go already.\n\nHere is the end game, as I see it:\n\nThere is a strong possibility that this virus, hoax or real, is going to be used for a martial law style crack down in various nations, including the United States. If this happens in the United States, it could be used as a pretext for even heavier crack downs, complete with gun grabs and forced \"vaccinations\" - For a virus Bill Gates has patents on, PLUS the vaccine for, while he babbled all about how vaccines should be used for population reduction.\n\nBill Gates probably contracted out to China for his virus bullshit, why hire Americans to do it? Americans cost more, may have loyalties get in the way, and might speak up. They might speak up in China also, but there's that language barrier, and the guns and Trump problem is in the U.S. There's no doubt China's government hates Trump, and that's definitely playing into this scenario as it unfolds as well.",

Salvation Army for example doesn't turn down help, and having a reputable organization behind you works wonders for greasing the system.  Think about what you're going to say; where you've been living all this time with no history.  You're going to have to be able to talk convincingly face to face with a bureaucratic moron, because it isn't just completing forms.  Having no history doesn't need to be a handicap, but in your case filling in the gaps will be a return to faking it.  Can you convince someone you're gay, or another minority group to identify with?  That might be a good angle to cover for the lack of history, because you'll score needier in their eyes.  Perhaps you had a long term relationship that went sour and got kicked out?  Have you got any decent plastic ID with your preferred identity?  Your primary goal is to qualify for TANF as that's where the cash is.  SNAP, Medicare and subsidized housing come with this, but won't make up for the lack of dollars every month in your pocket.  I'm assuming you have a U.S. birth certificate, and an address, though you seem woefully underprepared for this scheme.  Maybe with determination you might pull it off.",
