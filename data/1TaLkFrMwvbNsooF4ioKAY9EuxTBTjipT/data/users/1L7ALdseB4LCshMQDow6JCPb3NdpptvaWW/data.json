				"body": "Hello,\nAccording to its official download website, Beaker Browser is \"an experimental browser for exploring and building the peer-to-peer Web\". As for ZeroNet, it's an \"open, free and incensurable network,\nbased on Bitcoin cryptography and the BitTorrent network\". Both use peer-to-peer protocols to access websites, but they aren't the same. Indeed, the protocol used by Beaker is Dat, while ZeroNet's one is BitTorrent. Dat enables you to sync your data to your peer network with Beaker and works offline and with limited connectivity over a distributed peer-to-peer network. As for BitTorrent, any file must be downloaded by several peers to be available at any moment.",
