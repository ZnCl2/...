			"title": "How to play Far Cry 5 on GNU/Linux tutorial",
			"body": "*Please note: This tutorial will not work with uPlay as I was unable to get uPlay working, so I pirated Far Cry 5 to test.*\n\n**Tested with:** \n\n- OS: Fedora 28 (KDE Plasma spin)\n- CPU: Intel i5 4690 @ 3.5GHz\n- GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1070 on proprietary drivers\n- RAM: 16GB\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n- Wine-Staging 3.8 or higher (older versions also work, but I'm not going back to check)\n- 64-bit DXVK 0.53 or higher\n- Winetricks\n\n**Optional:**\n\n- Lutris (Handles DXVK, manages Wine versions, creates Wine prefixes for you, has pretty icons, blah...)\n\n**Known bugs:**\n\n- Land and water vehicles do not steer. You need to use autodrive.\n\n**How to (manual):**\n\nStep 1: \n\nDownload the latest proprietary driver for Nvidia.\n\nStep 2:\n \nSet up the wine prefix with the terminal:\n \n- ``$ WINEPREFIX='/dir/to/wine/prefix' WINEARCH=win64 wineboot``\n- ``$ WINEPREFIX='/dir/to/wine/prefix' winetricks xact``\n- Run ``$ WINEPREFIX='/dir/to/wine/prefix' winecfg``, click on the 'Libraries' tab and set xaudio2_0 to xaudio2_9 to ``native, builtin``. \n- Download DXVK 0.53 or higher from https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases (or compile it yourself for the absolute latest version) and extract the 'x64' folder, then run ``$ WINEPREFIX='/dir/to/wine/prefix' bash '/dir/to/dxvk/setup_dxvk.sh'``. **As a warning,** that script creates a symbolic link to 'dxgi.dll' and 'd3d11.dll', so if you delete those files, Far Cry 5 will not work. If you wish to override the old 'dxgi.dll' and 'd3d11.dll' files within your wine prefix, you may do so by copying them into your Wine prefix at the following directory ``YOUR_WINE_PREFIX/drive_c/windows/system32/``, then run ``$ WINEPREFIX='/dir/to/wine/prefix' winecfg``, go to the 'Libraries' tab and set 'dxgi' and 'd3d11' to ``native``.\n\nStep 3:\n\nPlay Far Cry 5!\n\n- ``$ WINEPREFIX='/dir/to/wine/prefix' wine '/dir/to/FarCry5.exe'``\n\n**How to (Lutris):**\n\nStep 1:\n\nManage the wine runner by clicking on 'Lutris' in the top bar > 'Manage runners' > scroll down to Wine and click 'Manage versions' -> Check 'staging-3.8' or higher (please do not do anything after checking. It is downloading, even though it looks like nothing is happening) and after it's finished downloading, click 'OK'. Close the 'Manage runners' window, too.\n\nStep 2:\n \nAdd the game by clicking on the '+', set the name to 'Far Cry 5' and for the runner select 'Wine (Runs Windows games)'. Go to the 'Game options' tab and set the executable to 'FarCry5.exe' (FC5/bin/FarCry5.exe), then click 'Browse...' next to Wine prefix and create a new folder inside of the Far Cry 5 directory called 'wine' (this is the name of the wine prefix, call it whatever really) and click 'OK', then set the Prefix architecture to '64-bit'. Go to the 'Runner options' tab and set the Wine version to staging-3.8 or higher, check 'Enable DXVK' and set the DXVK version to 0.53 or higher (at the time of writing, DXVK 0.53 didn't show up in the list, so you had to manually type in '0.53' in the textbox for it to download). Finally, click on 'Save'.\n\nStep 3:\n\nRight-click on the newly added Far Cry 5 tile and select 'Winetricks', then select 'Select the default wineprefix' -> 'Install a Windows DLL or component' -> Check on the 'xact' package, click 'OK', then when Winetricks shows up again, close it.\n\nStep 4:\n\nDouble-click on Far Cry 5 and play.",

Install Wine Staging 3.5 or higher, Winetricks and Lutris, then download DXVK (64-bit). I get my DXVK files from: https://haagch.frickel.club/files/dxvk/latest/64/bin/ . If you do not trust this, feel free to compile the dlls yourself, the repo is located here: https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk . At the time of recording, I used DXVK commit 654e9e6: https://haagch.frickel.club/files/dxvk/r950.654e9e6/64/bin/\n2. Open Lutris and click on the '+' to add a new game. Once the 'Add a new game' menu is open, check 'Show advanced options'. After that, in the 'Game info' tab, name it to how you please. For the runner, click on 'Wine (Runs Windows Games)'\n3. While still in Lutris, click on the 'Game options' tab. Set the executable to either Far Cry 4's .exe or Far Cry Primal's .exe. With 'Wine prefix', that's up to you on where you want it stored. I just place it into my game directory, e.g.: /run/media/administrator/Storage/Games/Far Cry Primal/wine. With 'Prefix architecture', set it to '64-bit'.\n4. While still in Lutris, click on the 'Runner options' tab and ensure that the 'Wine version' is on Wine staging 3.5. *(Optional, for DXVK's HUD) Now click on the 'System options' tab, then scroll down to where it says 'Environment variables'. Click on 'Add', double-click the key, and add in 'DXVK_HUD'. Now double-click on the value, and add in '1'. More information on the HUD is here in README.MD: https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk . Setting DXVK_HUD = 1 is equivilant to DXVK_HUD = devinfo,fps.* Once you've finished that, click on 'Save'.\n5. While in Lutris, right-click on your newly added game, then click 'Wine configuration' to generate your wine prefix.\n6. Open a terminal, then type \"WINEPREFIX='/directory/to/your/recently/created/wine/prefix' winetricks xact d3dcompiler_43\".\n7. Change the directory of the terminal to where you downloaded DXVK (d3d11.dll, dxgi,dll and setup_dxvk.sh - Warning, make sure you save these files in a permanent place, such as your game directory. If you delete them, your game cannot start), then type \"WINEPREFIX='/directory/to/your/recently/created/wine/prefix' bash setup_dxvk.sh\".\n8. Final step. In the termial, type \"WINEPREFIX='/directory/to/your/recently/created/wine/prefix' winecfg\". In the 'Applications' tab, make sure the Windows version is set to 'Windows XP'. Now click on the 'Libraries' tab, and ensure that you see the following: *d3dcompiler_43 (native), d3d11 (native), dxgi (native), xaudio2_0 to 9 (native,builtin). If you do not, type in the textbox where you see 'New override for library' the missing override and press enter. Then click the recently added item, click 'Edit', then set the load order accordingly.\n9. Now we play. Go to Lutris, click on the recently added game and click play. Enjoy.\n\nI've noticed three bugs with Far Cry 4, one where you cannot launch into fullscreen mode as it freezes your computer, one where you cannot use the entire screen when in-game, ~~and another where the trees are not displaying correctly~~. In order to fix these these bugs, follow these ~~three~~ two steps\n\n1. Right-click the Far Cry 4 game in Lutris and click 'Wine configuration', go to the 'Graphics' tab, check 'Automatically capture the mouse in full-screen windows', then apply the changes and close the wine configuration window. Right-click on the Far Cry 4 game in Lutris again, click 'Configure', go to the 'Runner options' tab, check 'Windowed (virtual desktop)' and set the desktop size to whatever you want, such as 1920x1080, then click 'Save'. \n2. Boot into Far Cry 4, press F3 for settings, (use your arrow keys, and space for enter) go to 'VIDEO', set the 'Display Resolution' to the same as your virtual desktop size, and change the 'Window Mode' to fullscreen. If it is already set to fullscreen, switch it to another mode, press space, then switch it back.\n~~3. While in Far Cry 4, go to settings, 'VIDEO', 'Quality Settings', then turn 'Trees Relief' off.~~ This has been fixed with DXVK 0.51 and higher.\n\n*P.S. I used NVIDIA's proprietary driver, version 390.48*",

Just search for '``-Simple, CDX' emu works on FM7. I tweaked the DLC unlocker so all FM7 DLCs are now unlocked.``'. You need an account to find the download link, though. If you don't have an account and don't want to make one, grab the download [here](https://www49.zippyshare.com/v/vuroJMVq/file.html). The password is '``cs.rin.ru``'.\n\nTo apply this crack on to UWP applications, you first need to either find dumped files, or dump it yourself. You can find a UWP dumber [here](https://github.com/Wunkolo/UWPDumper). The readme includes links to pre-compiled builds. Once you've got the dumped files, you simply copy and paste the crack inside of the dumped game files and run ``InstallApp.exe``.\n\nA note from the creator of the crack, MnSXx: \"Make absolutely CERTAIN that you've deleted the signature file from the root of your game folder.\"\nThat's the ``AppxSignature.p7x`` file.\n\n*P.S. I have uploaded required files to [MillChan](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1ADQAHsqsie5PBeQhQgjcKmUu3qdPFg6aA/?:users/1H5YxVHvcfKM4STjJwyjYaBe8qbPyR6EZr:b:3c480237-7906-43a2-a568-06cd09cfcaa2) if the clearnet downloads go down.*",

Never mind the other economic benefits.\n\nAustralia already has a low crime rate, we don't have many racial tensions, we're a semi-socialist country, so we like paying taxes as it provides for our public services such as universal healthcare, Centrelink and so on.
