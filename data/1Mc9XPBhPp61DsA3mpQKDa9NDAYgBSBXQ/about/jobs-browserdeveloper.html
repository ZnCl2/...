<h1>The Tor Project is looking for a Browser Developer!</h1>
<h2>(Posted 16 Jun 2017)</h2>
<p>
June 15, 2017
</p>
<p>
The Tor Project is looking for a Browser Developer (C++ and Javascript)!
</p>
<p>
As	a	browser	developer,	your	job	would	be	to	work	closely	with	other members	of	the	Tor	Browser	development	team	on	C++	patches	to our Firefox-based	browser,	writing	new	APIs,	altering	functionality	for	privacy	and	security,	and	making	improvements	to	our	collection	of	Firefox	add-ons	(JavaScript	code).	Being	a	Tor	Browser	developer	includes	triaging,	diagnosing,	and	fixing	bugs;	looking	for	and	resolving	web	privacy	issues;	responding	on	short	notice	to	urgent	security	issues;	and	working	collaboratively	with	coworkers	and	volunteers	to	implement	new	features	and	web	behavior	changes.	We	also	need	help	making	our	code	more	maintainable,	testable,	and	mergeable	by	upstream.	The	person	in	this	position	will	also	review	other	people's	code,	designs,	and	academic	research	papers	to	make	suggestions	for	improvement.
</p>
<p>
This is a full-time position.
</p>
<h2>Required Qualifications:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	 Experience in C++ (and ideally, JavaScript). Five years of C++ experience is probably necessary for the level of expertise we want, though some of these years can be replaced with other Object Oriented Programming and/or C experience. If you meet this level of experience with C++/OOP, JavaScript can be learned on the job.
	</li>
	<li>
	 Possess a solid understanding of issues surrounding secure C++ programming and reference counted memory (at least to the level of avoiding issues).
	</li>
 	<li>
	 Be comfortable diving into new, unfamiliar codebases, looking for ways to alter and augment their functionality in specific, goal-oriented ways.
	</li>
 	<li>
	 Be familiar with web technologies and how the web works, especially the same-origin model and web tracking.
	</li>
	<li>
	 Willingness and ability to justify and document technical decisions for a public, world-wide technical audience.
	</li>
 	<li>
	 Be comfortable working remotely with a geographically distributed team.
	</li>
	<li>
	 Experience interacting with users and other developers online, including experience being confronted with differing ideas and opinions (not always in a nice manner), while maintaining a high level of professionalism.
	</li>
	<li>
	 Comfort with transparency: as a non-profit organization who develops open source software, almost everything we do is public, including your name (or at least your business name) and possibly salary information.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preferred qualifications:</h2>
<ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	 Familiarity and/or experience with writing add-ons and/or patches for Mozilla Firefox or other web browsers.
	</li>
	<li>
	 Familiarity with compiling software for the Android platform.
	</li>
	<li>
	 Familiarity with Firefox's internal architecture, including its use of multiple processes and sandboxing.
 </li>
 	<li>
	 Be intensely creative yet also ruthlessly pragmatic in your thinking.
 </li>
 	<li>
	 Possess knowledge/familiarity of probability, statistics, and information theory.
 </li>
 	<li>
	 Know enough about networking to be able to visualize what HTTP 1.1 looks like on the wire while encapsulated within Tor's network protocol.
 </li>
 	<li>
	 Experience working with distributed (remote) teams across different time-zones with people of differing skill levels over multiple mediums, including email, instant messaging, and IRC.
 </li>
 	<li>
	 Open-source experience: contributed significant chunks of code to multiple open-source projects in the past.
 </li>
 	<li>
	 Familiarity with distributed version control systems, including Git.
 </li>
 	<li>
	 Genuinely be excited about Tor and its values!
	</li>
</ul>
<p>

Other notes:
</h2>
<p>
Academic degrees are great, but not required if you have the right experience!
</p>
<p>
The team coordinates via IRC, email, and bug trackers. This position may be performed remotely, but we would be happy to provide a desk at our office in Seattle, Washington. We also have informal shared workspace arrangements in NYC and San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
The Tor Project, Inc., is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that provides the technical infrastructure for privacy protection over the Internet. With paid staff and contractors of around 30 technologists and operational support people, plus many volunteers all over the world who contribute to our work, the Tor Project is funded in part by government grants and contracts, as well as by individual, foundation, and corporate donations.
