			"body": "I've been trying to take care of myself more than the book. Basically this whole time I've been more preoccupied with improving my nutritional supplementation and had come to realize my lack of fat soluble vitamins as well as B12 was the problem. I have noticeable less headaches and nerve pain after taking vitamin B12 supplementation. I'm only starting to take ghee/clarified butter/butter oil but I need to get fermented or extra virgin codfish liver oil and optionally take high vitamin butter oil which the process is different from normal ghee/clarified butter/butter oil. I've also started to remineralize Reverse Osmosis filtered water that I drink with liquid ionic trace minerals (made by Trace Minerals Research) which happens to increase the pH levels and probably made structurized water without the huge hassle that comes with dealing with those water ionizer machines and much more cheaper too. Besides that, my overall diet and supplementation is very much above average but my body still has some problems. There's much more to this but that's going to go in the book."

			"body": "I quite frankly had a shift of mindset after April 2017\\. I want to concentrate and condense the concepts that I have rediscovered as short as possible, but that makes very short blog posts that can be summed up with a couple of statements.\n\nHere's a summary about what I've learned. Christian Ontotheology is a failed attempt to grasp Apophatic Theology, of which is ultimately secularized metaphysics of Greek Monism as well as general Eastern philosophy, of which if you really believe in Apophatic Christianity, you are really not a Christian, and if you're a genuine Christian by the book and by the spirit, you are automatically an existentialist that cannot truly ever know if you are truly saved, which means Christianity fundamentally functions through deception, using borrowed Platonic and Stoic philosophy to explain what cannot be explained by not explaining anything, and so fails to grasp the incommensurate properties of the truth, metaphysics, and physics, making fallacies like claiming the spirit is physically embodied inside a physical heart, and cannot reconcile why God would put souls in corruptible matter and why would anyone call a physical body an image of God, quantifying the unquantifiable indefinite nature of God.\n\nThat by itself sums up most of the posts made in my clearnet website. I've also explained various things on the Diaspora social networking platform. I've genuinely tried to defend Christianity, but any redeeming features within Christianity is inherently Monistic and is not properly understood through the bible alone although some traces of it is in the bible, it still gets many things wrong. I finally understand God through objective negation and subjective synthesis. Neither Christianity nor most modern cults, even most fringe cults and occult cults out there have the answers to the fundamental questions. There isn't all that much to talk about besides Monism which I plan to do my attempt to explain these simple truths in one mini book or long article, though there's a problem with that too: Kenneth Lee Wheeler does it better than I do in explaining these things, it's from his explanations that helped me come to understand the truth for myself subjectively to be able to answer the metaphysical and the physical which are united in totality and were never separated from each other. If you're stupid, you won't understand even a single phrase that he speaks. You need to really think about understanding the concepts behind the words mean and not just take them at face value of abstruse terminology that the normal fool is unacquainted with. All I can say is good luck."

			"body": "This is every post I‚Äôve made in my older domains (exousiakaidunamis.com üå†, exousiakaidunamis.xyz üí´) in one post in chronological order from the date of publication every post, not in chronological order from the latest revision. I am not going to fix any broken links for my older posts.\n\nüå†<strong>Hello there! Aug 5, 2015 @ 11:27</strong>\n\nWelcome to my blog! There's not much here so far but I promise I'll put up some very interesting material soon!\n\nüå†<strong>I don't like debates Aug 21, 2015 @ 14:21</strong>\n\nWhat I mean by debates, I mean debates that allows neuro linguistic programming, hypnotism, mood altering background music and visuals, any way to interrupt someone from sharing everything, any cheap shots against someone with dirty underhanded tactics to make them look bad, and last but not least, the voting system or the meritocracy that would potentially play a huge role in censoring sound cases wholly determined by what others think rather than letting the truth be shown and let every individual to think independently as to what they think, not forcing them to pick any side. There is no such thing as unbiased reporting, rather, a bunch of biased reports all laid out for the audience to choose to take what they wanted to take from it, not against their will. Public or private opinion is not your own opinion. Sermons and lectures may or may not allow questions, the former being the one that doesn't allow much questions, but generally they are asked at the end of the session because of how such questions can interrupt the presenter from showing everything that they know, sometimes those questions are answered in the presentation. Documentary movies, there is no questioning directly to those who had made the documentary. All of those are presented by people who wants to promote or shame the material presented, and people who are in such places are peer pressured into accepting some of the views presented. This journey is something that everyone needs to walk in themselves, but sadly, not everyone wants to think for themselves so for some people, they need to be encouraged to, but at the same time, not forced to make them believe, for you might be wrong and he might be right.\n\nHumanly speaking, truth is hard to discern from all the lies that feels right but ultimately is still just a lie even if it's infinitesimally small. Societies created by free will minded people also have biases, the bias that is to maintain free will becomes in itself the will of the society that they conform to. All free will societies have a tendency to break down to make a smaller yet similar group as they don't adhere to some of the things that are enforced so they make their own group that enforces certain protocols that they previously didn't have. Benevolent dictators in free will societies are like the biblical leaders in the Book of Judges, they are not kings, neither of the priesthood, nor are they controlling the people by exercising any authority over them. Does that make free will societies bad? It allows alternative opinions but at the same time, disapproves of certain things that the society as a whole is against. In any system besides such societies, there is no alternative, and if you don't conform to it, then you are going to be punished for those opinions no matter how much empirical evidence are based on accurate observations. Occult societies tend to seek power over forced will societies like the nations and private corporations. Occult means hidden, what they do is not known from just a normal observation from the outside looking in.\n\nFree will societies in concept doesn't have anything hidden, but that isn't always the case, neither are forced will societies, nations, and corporations. They are all targeted by occult societies that ultimately seek to control what they infiltrated, so all occult societies are forced will societies. All societies gather intelligence and so they have a secretive aspect but that doesn't necessarily make that part hidden, as long as other people know that society has such a function of an investigative system being in place, sort of like a department of defense. There hasn't been much free will nations as they tend to either be destroyed by forced will nations controlled by occult societies that fears their liberating thinking would dissolve all the nations, or they had been infiltrated by occult societies which destroys it from the inside out. There are some free will corporations that are influenced by free will societies instead of forced will societies, but until that is the majority, most free will corporations are influenced by either forced will corporations controlled by occult societies or outwardly free will corporations controlled by occult societies.\n\nMany occult societies control all types of societies through proxy. If they were actually good people they wouldn't be using such underhanded tactics, and they wouldn't be hidden. Hidden doesn't mean secretive, they are two separate words that have different meanings and only in certain situations are they considered synonyms, especially when people who uses those words don't differentiate those words as its own separate definitions. All occult societies are cults just as all societies are cults that cultivates what they desire to increase for whatever that they seek gains from. Occult societies cultivates force will over others by proxy. Not all cults are occult, but all occult cults are cults. Occult cults can be secretive just as all cults can be secretive, but not all cults are occulted and secretive. Occult cults tend to be secretive, but they sometimes make proxy occult cults that are partially hidden as they do certain things openly in plain sight although some things are encoded with occult meanings that are a secret to those who don't know an is not a secret to those who do know, but those who do know doesn't necessarily have to be in the occult cult to know that occulted meaning. Occulted as in made hidden.\n\nMany laws use occulted and ancient words that are no longer used with that specific definition, spelling, or even language by the people of that country like Latin and Elizabethan English. Some words and definitions are purposely removed from the thoughts of the people so that they won't understand what they are dealing with when they see it being used, which further proves that all the nations we have now uses such draconian methods of control over the people while having a front of appearing to have free will as it has been infiltrated to become as it is by design, made to fail and made to enslave. Some free will societies are set up as an alternative form of government, but not all self proclaimed religions have that because they are set up under the authority of other systems, especially under forced will nations made to be agents of the nation to do the will of the nation first, anything else, second. They practice free will after doing their duties under forced will, which they are simply deceiving themselves.\n\nKnowing these things, it is important to know when to keep the truth hidden from those who want to extinguish you and when to speak the truth to those who don't know the truth. The truth has its own will, its own spirit, it's own power. It wills to be shared to others to free people from themselves. In the end, there are no societies but the ones you make in your mind, they are just people, deceived or not. However, if God exists, then in His mind, He had made things how He wants to, which is the natural order that is observable when looking at nature, but the trust He had put in mankind is not given to anything else in creation which are under the natural law. In some extent, mankind is under natural law, but the first kingdom he is from is the Kingdom of God, the family structure which Adam is the son of God. That kingdom uses Royal law that is the two greatest commandments that is the ten commandments perfected. It is also known as the revealed law. What was entrusted to mankind was taken away from us by our own consent to other kingdoms as we get swindled by the lack of knowledge of anything concerning trickery and laws as we leave our first estate under God and into another state that is a separate jurisdiction from the Kingdom of God that is the fallen world of Satan which had brought death into this world through man's sin that was compelled by the flesh to sin and to keep sinning as long as that body is alive which is why God didn't want Adam and Eve to partake of the fruit of life from the tree of life for they would eternally be controlled by Satan without end, that would make their lives an eternal living hell on earth instead of a temporary one.\n\nGod knowingly made mankind to be able to sin, predestined the outcome, and so God did make sin and used Satan to tempt mankind into rebellion against God. Does that make God evil? Of course not. Jacob He had loved but Esau He hated. Esau became Edom of the Edomites which that name \"Edom\" derived from Adam. The parallel being made is that God hates the depravity of man's sinning and man's fleshly desires that is within us. He made people to be fruitful to multiply so that He can gather those whom He predestined and ordained before He created the universe of those who have the inner man, the Holy Spirit, the Christ Jesus that is within those who have the spirit of truth. God loved a race of people so He's racist. There are only two races in God's eyes, those who believe in Him, and those who don't. If they believe in Him, they will do His will as they are compelled by God's will to will themselves to do what they are willed to do by God. God chooses those who will be saved and those who are not going to be saved, no free will religion can claim that everyone in the society are saved for they are not God, though there are signs written in the bible that shows that someone is saved based on what they do, based on the fruits of their labor, signs are not by themselves proof that someone has the right faith God, nor does their fruit merit salvation. God desires people to be only subject to Him alone and have not given people any authority over others as a ruler but as a titular leader that is only a leader by name or title but not by what they do which they are servants serving under the people as servants, for everyone are kings and queens with their own land if they have the first trust under the Kingdom of God. In this reality, Christians are under a foreign land, they don't truly own their own land, so they are like foreigners from another kingdom, while being in that worldly kingdom of Satan as a citizen, but they can repent and create God's free will religion that can help people to get out of the will of man by providing the alternative will.\n\nAt first, many will be subject to the kingdoms of this world as dual citizens, but as it grows, the less and less need for most of the people to work for people outside of the Kingdom of God as they work in the Kingdom of God in its own economy separate from the economy of the world. At first, a free will religious society won't have much people who separate themselves from the world because they depend on those who are dual citizens that deals with the currency of this world for them as proxy. If it gets big enough, the Kingdom of God can live by bartering and bartering alone, and currency is simply a contract between two people as a promissory note of goods to be traded for in exchange. Coins of intrinsic value might be used in free will religious nations, but so can any material object and any thing that constitutes as a contribution like knowledge. Value is being determined between two people is better than value determined by the consensus. Bartering is used so that they can do business with other nations without paying them taxes, being bound by their system. In God's free will Kingdom, believers and unbelievers can live peacefully with each other. Any debt would be forgiven in every jubilee. There are only a few laws to deal with that you can understand just by reading the bible, most of which comes from the concept of the Royal law that is you shall love your neighbor as yourself but towards a specific point, a way of thinking towards certain situations that requires discernment as to what to do.\n\nThere isn't much liberty to do all these things in the world, neither are there many people who are exposed to such concepts that is seen negatively as separatists seeking to undermine the country, which some forced will religions controlled by occult societies want to do. Some occult societies are enemies with each other while many are infiltrated by more occulted occult societies like the Jesuits and the Venetians. Many are exposed to a forced will instead of a will that one can conform to by choice, but if these occult societies that control the media through private forced will companies and also many religions, societies, nations, and groups of people gathering together for a purpose, it would then be very hard to persuade someone with something beyond their typical, socially approved thoughts although it should be very thought provoking to them of they never heard it before. One needs to realize that at a certain point, it is futile to keep on dealing with the same people that hates the truth and no matter how much you love them, since they don't love God, you are lead by God to hate those who He hates, to be not with the willingly ignorant unbelievers because God leads you to depart from those who corrupt the gospel.\n\nThe Word of God causes separation among people. Those who seeks God wants to be the inner man that would be made in a new incorruptible body, rejecting the outer man while seeking to metaphorically starve the flesh of the current corruptible body of sin and resist temptation by fleeing from it when possible and standing up for what you believe in whenever questioned. Those who don't have the Holy Spirit doesn't have the inner man, so they won't be lead by God to hear more about the gospel of His Kingdom. There is however, only one Body of Christ, even though many can have the Holy Spirit. At first, some people might pretend to be brothers and sisters in Christ, yet later they might reveal that they preach a different gospel, worshiping a different god, under the de facto jurisdiction of Satan's fallen world that God temporarily allows Satan to use. I am not against people who can properly speak these truths to people in a conversation, but they need to be wholly aware of these external barriers beyond the ones that those people make in their minds. Consider the situation and do what the Holy Spirit tells you to do especially when your mind can't understand what is going on, for God will put the words in your mouth to speak, you just need to discern it if it is in line with the bible or if it is your own thoughts or if it is from demons with fleshly, corruptible logic. Not everyone however, has that gift of public speaking, so know your place in God's Kingdom but strive to grow and be able to do more than what you can do without God. Censorship is a dangerous thing.\n\nüå†<strong>Synchronicity and the Ad hoc hypothesis Aug 28, 2015 @ 00:14</strong>\n\nThis is going to be my first public attempt to try to rationally look down the barrel of the rabbit hole without being sucked into the torrent of the polarized counterspace flow into the center of the earth, imprisoned in this hypercube, waiting to break out what was trapped by design. This is an introduction and conclusion behind the grand design concerning things of this nature.\n\nBefore I start, there are some examples that you need to look into, so here are some external links. Go look at them and come back, but take your time with the information in them. If you are somewhat aware of these things, skip the parts you know about, but not the ones you are not confident that you know about. One needs to experience being exposed to these things before they can say anything about it.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.thebabylonmatrix.com/index.php?title=911:Occult_symbolism_Intro\" target=\"_blank\">Occult symbolism Intro</a>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdVzGLDCkMU Why Jesus Christ is the Messiah [FULL] // R$E (private video)\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLurHDM8AtzX8dBJwvBHGqKSvA900Uz5OV\" target=\"_blank\">FAKE TRUTH MOVEMENT EXPOSED playlist</a>\n\nNow these links are from questionable people but they still have some right information which Christians avoid talking about, since there are some false information within this as well. Sometimes you need to look at what they think, not just through a filtered Christian aspect. The material in here is what most people who seeks an alternative to the Christian faith tends to look into, which some won't be able to get out of.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMseZD_3gWQ\" target=\"_blank\">The Soul Travelers - Michael Wynn - Full Length Documentary</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L777RhL_Fz4\" target=\"_blank\">Secrets in Plain Sight 1-23 (Full video)</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suBqqpez_-I\" target=\"_blank\">The Pharmacratic Inquisition DVD - Official Online Edition</a>\n\nHere are now some more material by Christians debunking certain lies behind some people talking about symbolism.

(the link broke)\n\nOf course, not all of them are controlled though they may fall for some of their lies, some of them understand it as simply getting people to think about these things, conditioning the people to certain realities, fueling the symbolic, ritualistic sigils with their thoughts, accepting certain doctrines, and using your own conscious to desire demonic spirits by consent, which this CERN conspiracy among Christians is causing them to lean in the \"right\" while people who believe in the institutionalized science being preached by the scientific pharisees are in the \"left\" of the progression of \"science\" and technology for humanity to sustain itself and its population through the increase of knowledge, which is suppressed in another agenda by the Venetians and their Jesuits to suppress nuclear energy advancements for their Club of Rome Depopulation Agenda and to bring all the nations together while seeking to dissolve nationalism by force in the name of peace as one new world order. It would only help the big oil companies that are under the Venetians while being in direct competition with Russia and China's oil businesses as they seek a new world economic order (<a href=\"https://larouchepac.com/new-economic-order\" target=\"_blank\">LaRouche On The Record: A New International Economic Order</a>), and because Russia knows that all so called fossil fuels are naturally replenishable and virtually unlimited (proof: <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/russia-proves-peak-oil-is-a-misleading-zionist-scam/\" target=\"_blank\">Russia Proves ‚ÄòPeak Oil‚Äô Is A Misleading Zionist Scam</a>).\n\nAnyways, back to my CERN example, there would be the last lunar eclipse/blood moon of the recent blood moon tetrad in September 28th, but Chris White debunked the blood moon theory that John Hagee, that evangelical Zionist had promoted: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v--qn0ZyZi0\" target=\"_blank\">Four Blood Moons DEBUNKED (2014-2015)</a> There is the talk of the financial sabbatical year, the shemitah cycle that supposed to happen in September but it already happened: <a href=\"http://www.maxkeiser.com/2015/08/markets-crack-as-predicted-did-shemitah-come-early-this-year/\" target=\"_blank\">Markets Crack, As Predicted: Did Shemitah Come Early This Year?</a> and based off of Daniel Gregg's research (<a href=\"http://www.torahtimes.org/books.html#scrollbook\" target=\"_blank\">The Scroll of Biblical Chronology</a>), this year is not a biblical sabbatical year, although from the beginning of fall 2013 to the end of summer 2014 was a sabbatical year in the jubilee cycle, the 28th year. This year is the 6154rd year of the world, which every year begins in the beginning of spring, Tishri 1, so the whole 6000th year would be the year of the beginning of the millennium kingdom is simply, unbiblical false doctrine. Here's this month in the torah calendar: <a href=\"http://torahtimes.org/the_torah_calendar/6154_2015_2016/6154_06_2015%20(predicted).pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Anno: 6154 Month 6, Elul AD 2015</a> The only things worth noting is the 70th session of the UN General Assembly on September 15th, that the UN is going to push the sustainable development agenda on September 25-27 which is Agenda 21 on steroids, and that the Jesuit Pope Francis would introduce that said agenda to the world in New York, pushing the green policy which is simply, green fascism: <a href=\"https://larouchepac.com/green-fascism\" target=\"_blank\">The British Empire's Green Fascism</a> that ties in with all the other global depopulation agendas. Popes had came to USA to interfere and to construct the government to do its bidding before, so it's not a rare occurrence for that to happen. In truth, any situation that the elite thinks of as a good time to do the false rapture and the false alien take over and also the false messiah agenda, is up to them, not to what other people think that they would do. They will do it when they think it is the right time to do so. Know that they have other cards up their sleeves like nuclear world war 3, fake nuclear EMP blackout, full lockdown and imprisonment through the FEMA camps or relocation to mega cities in the name of saving the animals and their habitat, and so on.\n\nThe numerological reasoning that I could think of (in other words, make up, conjure up in my mind) concerning the predictive programming of 9/23 in the media is simply how 9 is the square of 3 and 23 is the number of Eris, frequently attributed to chaos, the destruction of the old order that needs to come for the new order created from the chaos. 3 is a prime number and can mean the Trinity, the counterfeit trinity, triangle, alchemical fire or water, the capstone, anything relating to 3, the bronze emblem of Le\"Mu\"ria displayed at Tokyo's Shinobazu Temple that portrays the lands of Mu engulfed by the sea, which Mu is \"Hiva\" to the Hawaiian people. Squaring means to put it in a box, compartmentalization, under a defined border, the limits to where something that is squared can go to. 9 by itself is a unlucky number, it has a bad meaning as Mark Passio exposes here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDz0GOI1akk&amp;t=45m8s\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Passio Occult Mockery Of Police &amp; Military Personnel Full Length HD</a> at the 45 minute 8 second mark of the video. Does that mean that chaos would ensue in 9/23 when they run the Large Hadron Collider at full power? No.\n\nTime is in God's hand, no one has any power over time except for God. I argue that to God, time is an illusion, time can only exist in relation to something else. God made light when only the waters above was created by God, since there was something else besides Himself when before there was nothing in relation to anything except that God was there in the beginning which was created as He had to make a system of measuring time, for what He was about to do concerning biblical prophecy and what man needs to do in certain seasons was all in ordinance to time and to the physical world where time is bound to, and measured to be bound by the ordinance of His laws. In the biblical New Jerusalem, new heaven/earth, God is our light, so there won't be any more light to measure time with as the people in that reality are going to be with God forever, so there was no longer a need to have seasons because there is no need for it in God's paradise restored on earth where the tree of life is once again at the reach of mankind to take. God is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, so perhaps He can manipulate time to be in His liking, which means that our current reality is going exactly as He wills for it to be as He controls all the outcome. God did show Apostle John the future and so did God show many of His prophets of old the future, so I won't say that He doesn't have the power to undo time itself if He wanted to, but I will say that He doesn't need to or else He is imperfect. There is no alternative timelines, time cannot be manipulated by the created so there is no way anyone can simply move to another timeline.\n\nThe light that was made in the first day is assumed to be what the sun and the moon is synchronized to the heavenly light unseen by people on earth because of the waters above that is a barrier between God's glory and the universe beneath it. That waters above can be frozen, crystalline water sphere that reflects the light of the stars while blocking the light outside of the universe. That can explain why there are always more stars the longer we look up into the heavens with stronger and stronger telescopes that might be viewing starlight that was reflected many times and split into many more points of light, like shining a geode with a flashlight or hitting a beam through the tip of a crystal point. Eric P. Dollard had made two identical portals and powered them on to test if what he was making worked in theory, would be an instantaneous portal between two physical places without delay in real time, but his portal was dismantled by the government. Just because you throw particles at each other in a circular tube doesn't mean that it would make a portal. That is like assuming a silver ring that is electrically charged would rip open a dimension to hell. First off, all portals need a duplicate portal to be connected to, so if there were to be a portal to hell, there needs to be one in hell and one on earth, synced up and powered on, made with Tesla inspired electrical research to achieve such a feat. Second, it is God who let the seven seals, seven trumpets, seven vials to be set loose that brings all the destruction that will happen, some of which is using Satan's army itself, even setting loose the Antichrist. God is to blame for everything that happens, and nothing that man can do can stop this. Third, if God wants to save His people on a jubilee, it's not going to be this year.\n\nThere is biblical symbolism, there is occult symbolism, but they don't always mix well. Satan's symbolism tries to parallel the bible's symbolism, but everything good is attributed to him and his legion of demons and everything bad is attributed to God, His angels, and His people. What is parallel to is not the same as what it tries to become yet can't, so he makes it appear as if the alternative is the original, and he makes many alternative forms of said alternative creation story in many different religions although different from each other in some things. In the end, the occult has many factions and different beliefs concerning spiritual superiority, but in the ancient occult world, Europe is barbaric compared to everywhere else in the world, inferior to the African people that once ruled the new world as the ruling class leaders many thousands of years before Europe been to the Americas, inferior to the scientific yet religious Chinese culture who also reached the new world 2,500 years ago, way before any European has (<a href=\"http://www.messagetoeagle.com/new-controversial-evidence-ancient-chinese-visited-america-2500-years-ago-2/\" target=\"_blank\">New Controversial Evidence - Ancient Chinese Visited America 2,500 Years Ago</a>). Canaan has what he has through merging with the Tribe of Dan, through the persistent worship of Saturn as Moloch, Chiun, Remphan and abandoning other religions for the Phoenician religion centering around being formed by Kaos, ex nihilo, the religion of Emanationism, accepting anything that rejects any sense of absolute morals by hearing about Aristotle's works to justify their materialism through nihilistic mindsets.\n\nPagan symbols are not compatible with biblical symbols even though it might appear to correlate to each other, their whole world view is not the same as the biblical world view. Caucasian people was liberated from the tyranny of the Venetian and Roman controlled Catholicism because of the bible that had lead people to seek the spirit of truth that leads people to all knowledge, all truth, which is the Holy Spirit, which was suppressed by the Vatican made, Venetian controlled Islamic religion and also by the Roman Catholic Church itself that brought the dark ages to occur from start to finish. To tyrants, any religion that questions the status quo is their enemy, that is how Satan's people and Satan's nations think, they have nothing about the bible in their heart but only in their mind as history that doesn't really apply to them. They don't think that any religion is superior except their Luciferian pseudo scientific religion of the state government that is their only \"god\" that they deem worthy of worship, destroying the Vatican, destroying Christianity and Islam and every other religion including atheists whom might defy serving the state as their god.\n\nIf you try to use bible's symbols but use them as how any other religion uses them out of the context of biblical prophecy, it is simply white magic which is simply disguising itself as good yet is still doing black magic in the end. Christian synchronicity is when God makes things happen among Christians to help each other out in need without the other knowing that they needed that help yet were brought together by God answering their prayers. It is not biblical prophecy as it isn't prophesied in the bible in context to the bible's prophecies, but that is the only kind of synchronicity that exists for Christians, and if it isn't, then it is either biblical prophecy happening, or it is the false synchronicity of the occult world controlled by being filled with demons, activating the Crown chakra, getting the Kundalini Illness that may take years of biblical counseling and alternative health therapies or one trip to Gary Clyman's place and have him remove the blockages caused by it, for it is a physical disorder, disease that triggers the mind to be somewhat fragile but also heightens the senses while being less aware of its own body as a disconnect is made somewhere between the spirit and the body, I'm assuming. Gary Clyman is the only person that treats Kundalini Illness in America which he named it ‚ÄúBio-Chaotic Meditation Syndrome‚Äù in 1985. Mind altering drugs can also create mental and neural blockages, which SSRI drug taking people display this behavior but even more dangerous than Kundalini activation. Mental blockages of energy is real, tied into your physical body, which real TCM knowledge and a real professional like Gary Clyman can help you have the chi flow the right way. For the record, I never met him, but I never met anyone else who can claim to repeatedly fix something as hard as Kundalini Illness, and I don't know anyone else who can claim something similar to this to this efficiency as a licensed doctor of some sort.\n\nSatan will use many biblical symbols out of context to lead Christians into a false form of synchronicity, muddying the waters of their abilities to discern certain incoming events based off of the things that some people do around them and even far from them. This skill of alertness is a God given instinct to give people a chance to prepare beforehand and to act appropriately to the inevitable event caused by the chain of events effecting the future events. Prediction is not postdiction, neither is prediction prophecy. Ignorant Christians are calling predictions as prophecy. If anyone who calls themselves prophets have any of their prophecies to be false, they are liars and are false prophets. They have no right to modify their prophecies to be acceptable even after the first prophecy fell short. Doing that is the same thing as what scientists are doing to making any theory that might contradict the bible until it is proven to be false. This continuation of lies is their foundation of their demonic ministry as the former lies crumble by the hand of God. Ad hoc theories and prophecies are what is killing sound logic and doctrine, serving as a barrier for the suppression of advancements in both real science and Christianity. To a Christian that is awake to all these symbols that they had learned in order to separate themselves and also be aware of the agendas concerning it can also notice demonic synchronicity, but even such Christians can confuse demonically controlled events from God ordained, life changing events that God Himself had send demons to attack you for your sins so that you might repent from it and come back to Him. Do not give authority over Satan's synchronicity, but at the same time, don't spend so much time concerning Satan's plans when God has something greater for you to do. Don't dwell in vain imagination and stay firm into reality, unwavering by external forces. Know that demon possessed people are controlled by the will of Satan even if they themselves don't think that they have demons inside yet displays personalities and spirits that doesn't bear good fruit but instead, of bad, spoiled and rotten fruit that deserves to be thrown into the fire.\n\nWhat is certain is that there will be people who will continue to force seemingly separate events together and call it biblical. They are simply throwing out all the lines with bait, seeing what bites. That is a mockery to biblical prophecy that should be an exact science based on an unbroken biblical chronology. No one knows the hour or day because of the timezones and also simply because it is still speculation even though it might be biblical. Until the events fold out in front of our eyes, then we will know what is to be done, yet in those days, the gospel won't be preached except by the two witnesses. Whether it is symbolic of the real Israel of God's Church, or physically Elijah and Moses, that too, we will know in those days. If biblical prophecy was happening, then there should be no doubt in a real Christian's mind that it is happening, but it hasn't gotten to that point yet. Although the Historicism interpretation of the book of Revelation is somewhat true, that viewpoint doesn't explain everything and I still have doubt that the tribulation even started since the first seal has yet to be opened even though spiritually, the spirit of Antichrist is in many antichrists walking on this earth right now. THE Antichrist is still a mystery, I have so much doubt concerning who can be THE Antichrist right now, but I won't get into that. What I do know is that a FORM of AN antichrist is every mediator between Christ Jesus and mankind, who claims to be Christ on earth, which many Catholic priests claim that and also the Pope.\n\nI can make a prediction that the blood moon theorists would come back in the next blood moon tetrad. That theory is a theory that allows more chances of it happening, like being able to throw four dices for an unlimited amount of times until you get above a total score of 3, and if that doesn't work, they can lower the standards as to the score that they need to get and also the amount of dices that they can roll if they don't get the desired outcome, since there is no absolute source that comes directly from God to disprove it as God keeps it a secret to mankind, even a secret to his own Son, Jesus Christ, and they refuse to take the bible as the final authority concerning what they do. I can make a prediction that people would only see what they want to. I can make a prediction that many people with a mind would be dissuaded by these false Pharisaical Christians that make false prophecies and turn to falsehoods. I can make a prediction that there would be Christianized demonic synchronicity happening in churches that would lead them to another gospel that is contrary to what was being taught in the written word of God that is the Holy Scriptures. I can make a prediction that people who agrees with me would understand me and those who won't would attack me and the true gospel of the Kingdom of God that is not the same as the Dominionism being taught in churches like the New Apostolic Reformation, completely missing the point of how the society of God's people would work as a free republic, freed from the tyranny of the \"public\" as everyone in the free republic has their own land and the people are the state while the government is the church that doesn't exercise authority over others, but are real servants of the people by the people for the people who are leaders by title. I am saying these very words yet I predict that people would misuse these words to promote a state government instead of a religious government that gives people free will since mankind is not given dominion over other men and women. A real religious government would give the people back their land, their families, their possession as the people are the kings and queens who had received their first estate from God through Adam which was restored through the second Adam, Jesus Christ. What many Christians everywhere are doing is only practicing religion without the proper jurisdiction from God to do so, de facto but not de jure. That is the false gospel that is taught across the world. Church and state are separate even in God's Kingdom on earth, but only one of them becomes the government of the people, either one that would either make their servants their masters as the master becomes the servant, or the one which the servants continues to be the servants of the people who serves beneath them as nothing can come between man and God except Jesus of Nazarene our High Priest and King of the Judahites.\n\nüå†<strong>A short chronological look at the Book of Revelation Sep 4, 2015 @ 00:48</strong>\n\nI am not a licensed pastor, neither am I a minister of a congregation, but an Elder of God's Church. I am not infallible, but neither are some doctrines made by fallible men. I won't claim with 100% certainty. This is not an in depth study of the Book of Revelation, rather, things that I had found to raise some questions concerning some pre-existing theories mainly focusing on when things happen along with some tangents here and there.\n\nThe Book of Revelation when read by a free thinking Christian that had heard of some explanations by others, would try to see which one of those theories would stand in their own observation from what they read while trying to make their own explanations that is independently formed that may or may not use some of the theories given by others, and they are free to think their own way, though they can be persuaded, they can't be forced to think a specific way.\n\nLet's go straight to chapter 4. If you got a problem with me skipping some chapters and verses, let me remind you that this is by no means an in depth study and I may or may not be skipping something crucial to what I am about to present. I am going to quote from the 1599 Geneva bible. If you got a problem with that, well that's too bad because I'm not going to use any other bible translation in English except when showing it's inferiority compared to the Geneva bible. Compare it yourself with any other translation provided in BibleGateway: <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%204&amp;version=GNV;KJV\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%204&amp;version=GNV;KJV</a> Now let's look at verse 1:<blockquote>After this I looked, and behold, a door was open in heaven, and the first voice which I heard, was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, saying, Come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be done hereafter.</blockquote>\n\nThis is one of the most favorite verses by the traditional pre-tribulational rapture people, since Jesus is the door and Jesus has a voice of a trumpet. Now read on by yourself as I quote verse 4 for the next point:<blockquote>And round about the throne were four and twenty seats, and upon the seats I saw four and twenty Elders sitting, clothed in white raiment, and had on their heads crowns of gold.</blockquote>\n\nAs you can plainly see, there's 24 Elders who are already in Heaven. Now read on to chapter 5 as I quote now verses 11 and 12:<blockquote>11 Then I beheld, and I heard the voice of many Angels round about the throne, and about the beasts and the Elders, and there were ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousand thousands,\n12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was killed, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and praise.</blockquote>\n\nNow this is also one of the pre-tribulational rapture verses that may justify meaning that those many many numbers are concerning the gentile believers who were in the Israel of God through His Church that they were grafted and adopted into God's family. They assume that since the 24 Elders are in Heaven, then so can some other people who were raptured into Heaven as well, which those many numbers that may or may not mean to show how there is many of them in Heaven, it doesn't specify if it is about the Angels round about the throne, though it can be assumed to be so as well because the beasts and the Elders have been numbered already. Now read on through chapter 6 as I quote verse 12:<blockquote>And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was a great earthquake, and the Sun was as black as sackcloth of hair, and the Moon was like blood.</blockquote>\n\nNow that is the sixth seal. We'll get to this later. Now I'm going to chapter 7 as I quote verses 2 to 4:<blockquote>2 And I saw another Angel come up from the East, which had the seal of the living God, and he cried with a loud voice to the four Angels to whom power was given to hurt the earth, and the sea, saying,\n3 Hurt ye not the earth, neither the sea, neither the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.\n4 And I heard the number of them, which were sealed, and there were sealed an hundred and four and forty thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.</blockquote>\n\nIt should be very clear that only 144,000 are sealed and will be there in the midst of the destruction when this will happen. There's an important point that I'm going to make. After Ephraim represented as the lost 10 tribes of Israel that has scattered into the nations, the majority left in the Kingdom of Judah are of the tribe of Judah and of the tribe of Benjamin. The tribe of Dan is excluded from Ephraim and was replaced by Levi as a part of the 12 tribes when the Levites never owned their own land in ancient Israel so they were the 13th tribe, which Paul being the 13th Apostle sought after the gentiles that is the 13th tribe of Israel, which among the gentiles, there is the lost 10 tribes. The Sephardic Jews and the Ashkenazi Jews have the tribe of Judah and Benjamin within, but concerning the rest of the tribes, it is uncertain. Perhaps it is possible that among them there might be all 12 tribes of Israel, though I strongly doubt it. No one can prove what tribe that they come from although they might get close to a genome relating to the Jews which makes them a part of Israel instead of Judah. Ethiopian Jews are not Ethiopian Israelites, they apparently have the blood of King Shelomoh traced back to a long lineage starting with Shelomoh and Queen of Sheba but this isn't written in the bible. Any other tribe is hard to tell as undeniable fact because there are many of them and they intermingled so only God knows His family tree starting from Adam and Eve. Don't waste your time on endless generations, for every generation back, the number of people in the family tree grows exponentially to the point where it exceeds the number of people alive back then. It is even harder to tell if someone is from the lineage of Abraham, but through the Order of Malkitsedeq, the title name of Shem, whom he had given his blessings to Abram, Jesus Christ has restored the family order which he has his lineage through the prophets and kings of Israel that has this blessing. Anyways, back to the point. Now here's verse 9 to 17:<blockquote>9 After these things I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations and kindreds, and people, and tongues stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with long white robes, and palms in their hands.\n10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation cometh of our God, that sitteth upon the throne, and of the Lamb.\n11 And all the Angels stood round about the throne, and about the Elders, and the four beasts, and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,\n12 Saying, Amen, Praise and glory, and wisdom, and thanks, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God for evermore, Amen.\n13 And one of the Elders spake, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in long white robes? and whence came they?\n14 And I said unto him, Lord, thou knowest. And he said unto me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their long robes, and have made their long robes white in the blood of the Lamb.\n15 Therefore are they in the presence of the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple, and he that sitteth on the throne will dwell among them.\n16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun light on them, neither any heat.\n17 For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall govern them, and shall lead them unto the lively fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</blockquote>\n\nThese saved gentiles who had went through the six seals came out of the great tribulation. It isn't stated that they died during the great tribulation, but had gone through it as they came out of it but not through all of it. These people are in Heaven while the sealed are not stated that they are in Heaven. They are not numbered unlike the last time when there were numbers given that was most likely for the Angels as the Elders didn't notice such people when they sang a new song before so it can be assumed that these gentiles weren't there in chapter 4. Now read on through chapter 8 as I quote verse 1 to 4:<blockquote>1 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour.\n2 And I saw the seven Angels, which stood before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.\n3 Then another Angel came and stood before the Altar, having a golden censer, and much odors was given unto him, that he should offer with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar, which is before the throne.\n4 And the smoke of the odors with the prayers of the Saints, went up before God, out of the Angel‚Äôs hand.</blockquote>\n\nThe people who are already at the throne of God who doesn't have the seal of God on them as they don't need to since they are already spared from the continuing great tribulation might be the ones who are praying as a part of \"all Saints\" though it may include the 144,000 who are still on earth as well. There was no trumpet sounded when the sixth seal was opened and the seventh seal brought silence which then initiated the next process that is the seven trumpets. Now here's chapter 9 verse 1 and 2:<blockquote>1 And the fifth Angel blew the trumpet, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.\n2 And he opened the bottomless pit, and there arose the smoke of the pit, the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun, and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.</blockquote>\n\nThis bottomless pit is not the grave, but the inter-dimensional prison of the Nephilim and it's king, Abaddon, within the earth somewhere. For more information about Abaddon, read this article: <a href=\"http://paradoxbrown.com/abyss-old-and-new-testaments.htm/\" target=\"_blank\">A Survey of the Abyss in the Old and New Testaments</a> and also Ezekiel 31:3-16. It was God who opened the bottomless pit and it was God who set loose the Antichrist, but the Antichrist spirit is within many people right now as antichrists but they are not THE Antichrist. Abaddon is not Satan. Chapter 11 verse 3 and 4:<blockquote>3 But I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.\n4 These are two olive trees, and two candlesticks, standing before the God of the earth.</blockquote>\n\nThe two witnesses are represented as two candlesticks. Could it be relating to the symbolism used previously in Revelation chapter 1? It is possible that this is a part of the 144,000, assuming that candlesticks represent churches, and it can be the newly converted gentiles that hang around them that were not a part of the gentile believers in Heaven, though unlikely and the witnesses are doing miracles that Moses and Elijah did before and they are both prophets. Realize that many interpretations are assumptions when they are not clearly defined. We will know for certain when the day comes, but I believe that some things should be very apparent as to what it plainly states chronologically. Revelation 12 and 13 is the Historicism view of the book of Revelation that the Reformers at Geneva who had translated the Geneva bible had put in the footnotes as events that happened and was happening in their day. Some of the language used is also used in law and in some forms, there already is a mark of the beast. The great wonder that John saw of the woman is God's Church and it is also a real astronomical event. For more information about that, read this article: <a href=\"http://torahtimes.org/writings/magi-thinking/article.html\" target=\"_blank\">When was Messiah Born?: The Thinking of the Magi</a>. Now if the Historicism view is correct and is not an event that happened rather a recap of history starting from the birth of Jesus Christ up until the events of the beginning of the great tribulation, that means Christians shouldn't go to any war and should only use weapons for defense, for protection.\n\nOf course there will be many more applications to this, like the current situation of the hyper-connected web 3.0 global identity that we are forced to be in against our will more and more as time goes on, and also how the beast from the sea is concerning International Maritime Admiralty law, which originates from the Canaanites as the Phoenicians who are also merchants and pirates that later the strongest scions became the Black Nobility behind the Venetian Empire that moved to the Blessed Isles of Albion at Londinium as New Venice, in which their Venetian system has a Council of Ten that can be interpreted as the ten horns of the fourth and most terrible beast that controls the harlot that is the Vatican and also any church that relinquishes their kingdom authority unto any beast which a beast is a nation and if you make a church that is under the authority of a nation or anything that is not of God's, then that church and everyone in it is not in God's Church lawfully, but instead, under the control of the Vatican through the World Council of Churches, and also under the control of the Venetian Democratic Oligarchs through their Jesuit Order that has infiltrated or influenced almost every powerful occult society in existence to do their bidding which they infect any country that they are in with their ecumenical ideals to wiggle into power. I went ahead of myself as there is some more places in the Book of Revelation that shows a Historicism viewpoint revealing things of the past. I still think that there might be a chance of there being a final mark of the beast, very possible and plausible, but I see it as an event that would happen some time after Abaddon comes out of the bottomless pit. The people who are still alive to that day who are not taken up to heaven, who didn't die from losing the battle against the beast, needs to not get the final mark of the beast for any hope of salvation later if they die during the great tribulation that is this whole timespan from the first seal to the last vial holding the last plague. Consider that there are some leftover Jews and gentiles that were converted biblical Christianity. Those people would have to go through it all. Quoting Revelation chapter 14 verse 1 to 3:<blockquote>1 Then I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on mount Zion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father‚Äôs Name written in their foreheads.\n2 And I heard a voice from heaven as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers, harping with their harps.\n3 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the Elders: and no man could learn that song, but the hundred, forty and four thousand, which were bought from the earth.</blockquote>\n\nSeems like they went up into Heaven before the throne. Do you remember reading chapter 11 verse 15? That was technically the last trump. The rapture in Matthew 24 was therefore, for the 144,000, for it was in the sixth seal that the rapture for the Church that might had included some Jews but didn't qualify to be in a part of the 144,000, had happened, which the seventh seal lead to the beginning of blowing the seven trumpets. If you consider the seven vials to be God's wrath, then there are 14 events which in the 6th event the Church is raptured while in the 14th, Israel is raptured. You would have to believe in a third in rapture and two-thirds in rapture, if you count seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven vials as three groups of seven events which equals to 21 events. If you believe that the seven churches were raptured at the beginning in Revelation 1 and that the number given to the Angels also applied to the gentiles that appear without a number as they are noticed by the Elders, assuming that they were just too busy with stuff to notice that they were already in Heaven, then there the first rapture would happen before the great tribulation and where it says came out of the great tribulation, it would therefore mean that they came out before it started. Whether the seven churches mentioned was for the early church or for a type of seven churches through the whole church age, that is also uncertain though it can be both, but if it means a type of seven churches through the whole church age, that would mean that all Christians who die in Christ are already up in Heaven before the start of the great tribulation, but it is not their final destination which will be the New Heaven New Earth, and they would be in the millennial kingdom in post-tribulational, millennial Jerusalem with the Jews having their land restored, living long lives as in the days of Adam through Noah. Now quoting chapter 14 verse 14 to 20:<blockquote>14 And I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sitting like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.\n15 And another Angel came out of the Temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle and reap, for the time is come to reap: for the harvest of the earth is ripe.\n16 And he that sat on the cloud, thrust in his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.\n17 Then another Angel came out of the Temple, which is in heaven, having also a sharp sickle.\n18 And another Angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire, and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, and said, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vineyard of the earth: for her grapes are ripe.\n19 And the Angel thrust in his sharp sickle on the earth, and cut down the vines of the vineyard of the earth, and cast them into that great winepress of the wrath of God.\n20 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</blockquote>\n\nThis is in preparation for the seven vials, but ask yourself, are they simply getting grapes, or are they killing people? This is the reaping, the harvest that you don't want to be a part of as the ingredient. Now I'm going to skip ahead so read carefully as some of the things that I was referring to when I went ahead of myself is mentioned. Revelation 19 verse 6 to 10:<blockquote>6 And I heard like a voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of strong thunderings, saying, Hallelujah: for the Lord that God that Almighty one hath reigned.\n7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.\n8 And to her was granted, that she should be arrayed with pure fine linen and shining, for the fine linen is the righteousness of Saints.\n9 Then he said unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the Lamb‚Äôs supper. And he said unto me, These words of God are true.\n10 And I fell before his feet, to worship him, but he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow servant, and one of thy brethren, which have the testimony of Jesus, Worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy.</blockquote>\n\nSo after all seven vials are poured out, the supper and the wedding ceremony is being prepared. Later in the chapter, the Angels eat up the army of the False Prophet and the Beast, which Satan in the beginning of chapter 20, is thrown into the bottomless pit for 1,000 years. Now in Revelation 20 verse 4 to 6:<blockquote>4 And I saw seats: and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them, and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which did not worship the beast, neither his image, neither had taken his mark upon their foreheads or on their hands: and they lived, and reigned with Christ a thousand years.\n5 But the rest of the dead men shall not live again, until the thousand years be finished: this is the first resurrection.\n6 Blessed and holy is he, that hath part in the first resurrection: for on such the second death hath no power: but they shall be the Priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</blockquote>\n\nIt is assumed that every Christian who die before the tribulation would also have the first resurrection as they were persecuted for their faith. That may be the case, but it seems to be for people who were martyred during the great tribulation from the first seal to the last vial. It wouldn't make sense for those people who were raptured to not be able to be in the millennial kingdom. Verse 7 to 15:<blockquote>7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,\n8 And shall go out to deceive the people, which are in the four quarters of the earth: even Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the Sea.\n9 And they went up into the plain of the earth, and they compassed the tents of the Saints about, and the beloved city: but fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.\n10 And the devil that deceived them, was cast into a lake of fire and brimstone, where that beast and that false prophet are, and shall be tormented even day and night for evermore.\n11 And I saw a great white throne, and one that sat on it, from whose face fled away both the earth and heaven, and their place was no more found.\n12 And I saw the dead, both great and small stand before God: and the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged of those things, which were written in the books, according to their works.\n13 And the sea gave up her dead, which were in her, and death and hell delivered up the dead, which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.\n14 And death, and hell were cast into the lake of fire: this is the second death.\n15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life, was cast into the lake of fire.</blockquote>\n\nThat fire that came down from heaven is the baptism of fire that is misquoted as the baptism of the Holy Ghost out of context. Some people are dumb enough to claim that that fire baptism is the lake of fire when it is plainly spelled out for them that they would be resurrected only to be judged according to their works, which if they are guilty, they will be cast into the lake of fire alive, eternal damnation, treated the same as the False prophet, Satan, Abaddon, all the demons, all the evil people whomever existed that didn't obey God, etc. Every single soul sleep promoters despise the concept of eternal damnation and believes in a end to it when that won't be so. Every single soul sleep promoters, just as every single traditional spiritualism of treating God as the god of the dead where they go into the netherworld AKA: heaven, they both make this one mistake: they simply don't know what would really happen after death. To have the Revelation timeline to work for soul sleep promoters, they would have to assume that everyone who died before the rapture would be resurrected in the second resurrection and will not be a part of the first resurrection, neither would be in the millennial kingdom and that during the first rapture of the Church as a whole is only for the Church as a whole during the great tribulation, so people like Paul won't be in the first resurrection and won't be in the millennial kingdom. If they can live with their strictest prediction which I just presented to you, that's fine by me, as long as they don't nitpick things that they like and dislike. Some SDA people believe in soul sleep but it is all for the wrong reasons, because they believe in what Ellen G. White's false, conveniently edited, and fabricated prophecies that were simply changed to fit her false agenda. If SDB people and Millerites hold onto William Miller's speculations as biblical doctrine, they need to repent as well as any denomination that believes in speculations as prophetic visions that the bible needs to conform to instead of the so called visions being just a speculation received by one's imagination and/or rationalization. I will just leave the actual outcome as a mystery to me to enjoy.\n\nTo summarize, there are two raptures, one is for the Church that takes place before the great tribulation or a third into the great tribulation, and another is for the 144,000 at the last trump two thirds into the great tribulation as events, not measuring any time given but divided by event numbering which seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven vials equals to 21 events, as the last trump taking place in the 14th event, but there can be people who listened to the testimony of the two witnesses that can be Moses and Elijah or the 144,000 and the recently converted gentiles or false Christians who thought that they were going to be raptured but were not but they realized why they were not Christians during the tribulation which they then became real Christians, that those two witnesses preached the gospel and did many miracles which had made more Christians, though somewhere between chapter 11 verse 15 and chapter 14 verse 3, the 144,000 went up to Heaven at the last trump so I can be wrong about them being the two witnesses. There might be a false harvest in the making of the wine in the seven vials which the wine that holds the seven plagues might be using humans instead of grapes. The rapture is not the first resurrection. There are some places that have more than one interpretation as something that already happened in the past and something that is yet to be done. The fire baptism is not the lake of fire, Abaddon is not Satan, the bottomless pit is not the grave. Everyone will be resurrected in the second resurrection if they are not already alive to see Jesus on judgement day, and whosoever was not found written in the book of life, was cast into a lake of fire and brimstone, the same place where that devil, that beast, and that false prophet are, and shall be tormented even day and night for evermore with them. Maybe 1 Corinthians 6:3 might mean that the Israel of God won't be judged as they already were pre-judged throughout their life on earth by being truly saved in accordance to the scriptures and die once for sinning, but we may never know until the time comes.\n\nI honestly don't see anyone taking a transparent and chronological interpretation to the Book of Revelation. Again I remind you that this is a short study. SHORT. To try to dismantle everything in the Book of Revelation has taken some people like Jim Brown of Grace and Truth Ministries two years to do it. I haven't tried to dismantle anything, but the problem is, many people completely misunderstood how it is like to see the Book of Revelation as chronologically as possible as they push just one theory over another when they are stuck in their narrow-minded nitpicking rather than trying to trying to understand what the bible says, letting it define itself as much as possible, rightly dividing the word of God. Wake up, you have had it all wrong. The greatest event in all of history is when every knee shall bow to Jesus, every tongue confess to God. That is when our hope and faith has fulfilled its purpose as love remains to be with us forever more without any doubt and despair. They will all know that Jesus is God and that God is real.\n\nAnd that concludes my article. Read the rest for yourself, but remember, the bible is the recorded testimony of Jesus Christ, which those who testify of him also needs to know the bible and if they do, they would also know that to preach the real gospel of His kingdom is also done in the Spirit of prophecy, which anyone can do it now.\n\nüå†<strong>Uncommon History of the Current Adversary Sep 9, 2015 @ 08:35</strong>\n\nThis is a bunch of baseline truths and bits of history of which is very uncommon for commoners to casually discuss in the open. Some of the material here is copy-pasted. All credit goes where credit is due. As usual, I won't be able to cover everything possible. I am just going to go through what is lesser known to the majority of the controlled alternative media realm.\n\nJesus Christ is the Son of God. God exists. There is absolute truth. There is absolute morality. If history is written by the victors, even if they are evil, you will not know why by reading their official side of the story. The universe was created in six days, and as of this post, we are currently in the 6154th year of the world. There is only two stories behind our origin but only one of them isn't fabricated nonsense described in different ways to pretend to be the same as the real story. There are plausible scientific and theological reasons to believe that the sons of God in Genesis 6:2 can be normal people or fallen angels but there are many false doctrines being taught by promoters of the serpent seed doctrine and any deviations from it. Real magic is using the law against you, trickery is magic, all but one kingdom are nations that rebelled from the original kingdom from which they had stolen people by consent outside of the natural kingdom.\n\nThere are two evil races behind Egypt and Babylon, which Babylon is the stronger one but the race in what was previously known as Kemet (ancient E.G.Y.P.T.[is said to be short for the Genie of Ptah]) that later became the Moors are the one that has brought many of the religions in the ancient world. Nimrod was a Chaldean ruler but he might had been black as he is the grandson of Ham, though it is unclear as to which of the races that within which of the three Noah's sons had the gene that made people look like how they do, and Zondervan researchers for some reason doesn't include black people being from Ham. Some ancient Canaanite busts look like Mediteranean white people, and there isn't any depictions of them being described as black people, or the ones that I'm aware of, but Canaan is the son of Ham. If Ham isn't the black people, then it is highly likely that Shem is the black people while Ham is the White people. The more logical reasoning is to simply assume that Noah's grandchildren were all individually different races with different or similar traits from each other, and that the gene pool was still fairly \"fresh\" enough to have inbreeding without any worries of genetic mutations. The generalization that all of Ham's children are black people is a biblically flawed understanding. Perhaps Mizraim just so happened to be the most blackest person alive, so to speak, getting the most dominate genes from both of his parents that isn't the same as the bloodline of Cush and Nimrod of the Babylonian people, neither is the same as the Canaanites that again, has very \"white\" facial features. It is better to assume that people back then had a very wide range of genes in the family jewels, to be able to produce people of vastly different traits that doesn't resemble all too much the same as the parents, only barely enough to know that they are related. If Mizraim is the black people, then the Khemetic people that supposedly came from Atlantis was actually all of Noah's family.\n\nEthnicity is more diverse than race, and a common race is concerning a nation or a commonwealth's people regardless of their ethnic group or their general race. There is differences between say a Scottish from an Irish due to micro \"evolution\" though it should be called micro devolution since we are losing genes as a group of people continue to be together and flourish in their respective environment and culture demands a certain type of wanted genetic traits. It is foolish to ignore what is observed in nature, and it can be detrimental to not take into consideration the strengths and weaknesses that an ethnic group has for that society to progress, whether with other ethnic groups, or with a generally homogeneous ethnic group. I will get more into this in a separate article.\n\nNimrod, his son Tammuz (falsely claimed as the resurrected Nimrod), and his wife Semiramis are responsible for spreading similar false triad pantheon religions in various names though the Khemetic people were the ones who started what he wanted to have globally as the first global nation and identity going against God's Natural law of the family system whom Shem passed his blessings as God's chosen people to Abram to continue being under God's family instead of a nation who are a family by contract instead of by blood.\n\nLemuria is a sunken island chain in north east of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California. Atlantis is a sunken island at the west of the Azores in the Antlantic Ocean. I think that it is more probable that both of them sank AFTER the biblical great deluge, during or before Peleg came into being, when it was in his time that the Ice Age which was formed by rapid cooling that proceeded after Noah's flood literally melted away, creating division of land by vast amounts of water we call oceans, and Peleg means division. The ancient Phoenicians as a nation hired black people as paid and equal people as pirates and had spread their religion and their alphabet to many nations across the Atlantic Ocean commonly mistaken as being from a Hebraic source being promoted by historians in during the British Israelism movement, desperately seeking out the lost ten tribes of Israel to fuel the Zionist agenda as a means to have control over the original homeland of the Canaanites and especially Jerusalem. The Celts were originally Phoenicians and Picts before the first Roman came in. British means covenant man in Hebrew, the Blessed Isles of Albion was renamed into the British Isles.\n\nMany times throughout biblical history, the Israelites were up against a global conspiracy against their very existance that destroys whatever nation that it wants to. Even when they don't have God on their side, they hunger for power as if it is in their flesh to desire, passed onto their offsprings by ideals. Jesus was probably dark skinned but he is not as how the Catholic Church depicts him as a blonde hair blue eyes Caucasian man, neither does he look like Cesare Borgia or a masculine Mary with a goatee. The Canaanites were behind most events throughout the last 2000 years and even before as the Roman empire itself. The Catholic Church fell into corruption ever since the last apostle died. The Jews who were exposed to Neo Babylonian pagan customs had adopted them into their religion and customs as a judaized nihilistic materialism mindset that is somewhat compatible to the Venetians who adhere to the concepts of the Aristotelian cult that justifies their evil doing. Aristotle asserted that slavery is a necessary institution, because some are born to rule and others to be ruled. He also reduced the question of human knowledge to the crudest sense certainty and perception of \"facts.\" Aristotle‚Äôs formalism is a means of killing human creativity, and therefore represents absolute evil. This evil is expressed by the bestialist view of the oligarchs that human beings are the same as animals. The Jews do most of the dirty work under the Venetians, some have become a part of the Papal Nobility Bloodlines and others changed their names to appear less Jewish.\n\nThe long and tortuous path of peoples through history sees the Khazars in the Holy Land and part of the Canaanites eventually in northern Italy, adopting the name \"Sepharvaim\" for deceptive purposes. In the pre-Christian world around the Mediterranean, oligarchical political forces included Babylon in Mesopotamia. The \"whore of Babylon\" condemned in the Apocalypse of St. John the Divine, is not a mystical construct, but can be interpreted as a very specific cartel of oligarchical families, or any church that abandons God for the State, a Jezebel church that is in bed with the government of the world yet claims to be the wife of God as opposed to an undefiled church that is not under any other government except God's kingdom yet is in this world. Other oligarchical centers included Hiram of Tyre and the Phoenicians. The Persian Empire was an oligarchy. In the Greek world, the center of oligarchical banking and intelligence was the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, whose agents included Lycurgus of Sparta and, later, Aristotle. During most of the past 2,500 years, oligarchs have been identified by their support for the philosophical writings of Aristotle and their rejection of the epistemology of Plato.\n\nThe Phoenicians who are the Canaanites that became the Romans as the aristocrats of the Roman Empire fled to the swamps of Venice during the fall of the Roman Empire became the Venetians who seeks to control the world through bureaucracy and monetarism of the banking sector, the ideological successors of Rome. The Black Nobility are the oligarchic families of Venice and Genoa. The Vatican created the religion of Islam. The Venetians controls the Roman Catholic Church and destroyed the Byzantine Empire. The Venetians controlled the Knights Templar to go on their crusades. The Knights Templar found out about the secret behind Islam, implemented the Hassassin power structure for control, obtained maps of the new world in Alexandria, the knowledge of the Moret people of which most of the Morets moved to Switzerland. The Venetians moved to London as the British East India Company (chartered by Queen Elizabeth I on December 31, 1600 and dissolved in 1873), which its Council of 300 (AKA: Committee of 300) is under the authority of the Order of the Garter, serving the current Queen Elizabeth Windsor(Saxe-Coburg-Gotha) II of the Genoese House of Guelph which the Venetian system controls everything through the City of London and its various Freemasonic structured Livery companies with some Jesuitical influences which the Jesuits can also be seen as the Dutch East India Company.\n\nAlmost all esoteric societies that has any substantial control over people are also controlled by the Venetians by proxy and infiltration, especially through the Jesuit order that was created by the Venetians. That however doesn't mean that there are factions that are against each other despite being infiltrated and controlled. The Venetians controlled the Reformation and the Counter Reformation, as well as being behind many secret societies like the Freemasons and the Rosicrucians. Many former Templars and Morets people fled to Portugal, Scotland and Switzerland. The Venetian controlled Knights Templar descendants which the ones who had fled to the Kingdom of Aragon became a part of the Los Alumbrados which is not the same as the later Barvarian Illuminati, whose founder for the Venetians was an occultist and member of the Order of Malta known as Giuseppe Balsamo. The Aragon Knights Templar as the Order of Calatrava and the Order of the Montessa were controlled by the Cult of San Rocco in Venice controlled by the Farnese family, which later came back to the Roman Catholic Church as the Jesuit Order, which that same Cult of San Rocco created The Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei fronted by Josemar√≠a Escriv√° of Spain. Loyola had powerful connections and backers including the Doge of Venice who was Andrea Gritti and Venetian Cardinal, Gasparo Contarini not to mention Alexander VI Borgia who was behind the Los Alumbrados Order the forerunner to the Jesuit Order, which the Los Alumbrados were run by Marranos (Spanish Jews who converted to Catholicism under pretense to avoid persecution).\n\nIn the Jewish viewpoint, Adam 'Spartacus' Weishaupt was a Jew that became a Jesuit, then disaffected and was behind the creation of the Bavarian Illuminati in conjunction with the Rothschilds. The purpose of the Illuminati was for the Rothschilds and Jews to take power away from the Catholic Church that had dominated up to that time. Weishaupt said \"We will infiltrate that place [the Vatican] and once inside we will never come out. We will bore from within until nothing remains but an empty shell.\" The Venetians sometimes send their children to Jesuit schools, but they are above their hierarchy in the pyramid of power. Through the Barvarian Illuminati, Jacobinism and Communism came forth, recruiting the Kaballistic Jews that believed in the Zohar and its revolutionist principles of being a chosen people ergo, self entitled, and its Gnostic Monad based religion of Emanationism, calling the Monad the Shekinah Glory, the Presence of God, which its energy flows in varying degrees manifesting in lower and lower forms from the spiritual to the mental to the physical, would have these Jews to seek a new government system as their god just as the Venetians' true god is Statism.\n\nThe Jesuits are split into six conferences: Conference of European Provincials (CEP), Jesuit Conference of South Asia (JCSA), Conferencia de Provinciales en America Latina (CPAL), Jesuit Conference of Asia Pacific (JCAP), Jesuit Superiors of Africa and Madagascar (JESAM), Jesuits of Canada and the United States (JCU). Out of the six, the JCU is interconnected with the \"Venice International University\" both of which are currently run by Jesuit soldier, William P. Leahy, S.J. and Umberto Vattani. The City of London is a city-state within the heart of Greater London that is built upon the ruins of the ancient Roman city of Londinium which serves as a \"New Venice\" to the Venetians. Ever since the creation of the Second Vatican Council (of Trent) there was no real pope in the Roman Catholic definition of a pope but an AntiPope, a title representing a head of the Roman Cult, mostly being Italian claimants from heretic satanic Roman families incorporating the authority of Pontifex Maximus to falsely claim supreme leadership of the Catholic Church. To a Protestant, all popes are antichrist, but this is using Roman Catholic definitions first formally used by the Francofil Catholic Leaders during the middle of the 11th Century to describe heretic AntiPope Pontifex Maximus Gregory VII.\n\nThe Queen doesn't wear black in the presence of Pope Francis, even though she did with meeting the previous popes. Currently, there is no Superior General of the Society of Jesus. The conference that is mainly up against the JCU is the CEP. When the Superior General Adolfo Nicholas Pachon was exposed by the ITCSS for pedophilia, he resigned, but Queen Elizabeth II was also exposed for being in the same Black International Network of this underground child trafficking for ritualistic use, for blackmailing politicians, even for pleasure, although you don't see her resigning and stepping down from her position. It is highly probable that the Venetian system is still alive and well and very hidden from plain sight as they make you focus on their proxies like the Jesuits, the Grand Druidic Council structured Barvarian Illuminati, OTO, Knight of Malta, other Catholic Orders, Scottish Rite Freemasonry, Memphis Misraim, Arcana Arcanorum, Papal Nobility Bloodlines, the Jews, the Fabian Society, the Vatican, the World Council of Churches, Lucis Trust, Bilderbergs, Tavistock Institute, Theosophical Society, Council of Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Mormons, Jehovah Witnesses, Islam, Buddhism, Rhodes Society, EU, UN, Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, KKK, Boule Society, Fraternities, Three Letter Acronym groups, and so on.\n\nDon't underestimate the Jews, for there is an agenda to make them the ruling class being mixed with the Venetian Oligarchs and other powerful scions, while creating a slave race of Eurasian-Negroids, or simply just a people without a cultural identity that they can adhere to as they are of too many races that they would be easily inclined to accept a global identity, a global religion, and seek the dissolvment of homogeneous populations and national sovereignty. Count Richard Nikolas Eijiro Graf Coudenhove-Kalergi, a mixed race Venetian who was married to two Jewish women in his three marriages, he was one of the main people behind the creation of the EU and he also went to a Jesuit school. Kate Middleton is a Goldschmidt who married Prince William V and made more Venetian offsprings that would be under the control of Satan's kingdom. I assume that since the Jews and the Canaanites had cohabited and that through the lost ten tribes that became Samaria and also the Samaritans, those Samaritans later became a part of the Phoenician blood or close enough as Semitic people. I also assume that if some of these Phoenician-Samaritans wanted to get their land back, they would have to be one with the kingdom of Judah by marriage and later by blood through mixed offsprings. If the Tribe of Dan is among the Grecian people as the Spartans that had invaded Troy or have adopted the Phoenician seafaring life as a sea pirate, then maybe the Antichrist would be able to claim to be a Jew and from the Tribe of Dan while being born into the system Venetian Oligarchy that conveniently has Jerusalem in his possession through conquest or through inheritance, in an attempt to force the bible prophecies to come true and thus starting the New World Order out of the Old World.\n\nThere is something to Texe Marrs and his Crypto-Jew theory, but we must remember that we are not talking about just any Jew, only the ones that know that they are Jews that also hides the facts that they are Jews by usually pretending to be Anglo-Saxons, and also knowingly do evil by rejecting the Torah for the Talmud and the Zohar. This is no different to saying that many white people are in power by design but that doesn't make all white people predestined to be \"privileged\" of this power, neither are they going to keep their power in the future multicultural world that the elites are creating where being white straight American man is considered a sin by the third wave feminism that's extra communistic and polluting anything concerning humanities. Is it an individual Jew's fault that their race as a whole has fallen in apostasy against Jesus Christ? Of course it isn't. Am I going to hell for the sins of my ancestors? No. Don't let anyone drag you down to their lowered mental capacity of rationalization, for they are the type of people who gives up learning when they reach a certain level of understanding when that level gives half truths with poison while the higher level puts half truths together while removing the poison and exposing the poison that it is which were put in by the gatekeepers of the lower level truthers.\n\nI want to teach people, even the Jews of the real history of this terrible world and also tell them about the good news of the gospel of His kingdom. If I was a Jew, I would want to know what my people really had done in the past 2000 years, not so that I would hate my origins, but to learn from it what I should really be doing instead of trying to create a world that is suitable for the Antichrist, deceived by my own to think that he is the true Messiah. The problem is, this intensely strong desire to seek the truth is not found in just anyone, but in those whom God has predestined to have the inner man, the Holy Spirit within that is activated when one hears the gospel. Those who have the Holy Spirit has the Spirit of Truth which will lead people to all truth. Even among real Christians I find myself separated from them just because I simply know much more than they do concerning history and health. I came to realize that God gifted me to become a researcher who can understand the depths of this conspiracy. There are many degrees of deception in this world, and simply trying to identify the bad guys in itself is a strange and long journey for me. I haven't gotten much into the many various agendas going on in the world. Through the works of many researchers like Eustace Mullins, Craig Oxley, Walter Veith, Frank Joseph, Frank O'Collins, and many more, I wouldn't be where I am today, but sadly, my path is a lonely one as I know too much to explain everything that I want to in detail. The things that I've learned in less than 5 years, it would make some people I know to the brink of suicide. Be very careful when choosing your peers, for they will drag you down to their level if they hate what you preach and do, and that level can be 6 feet under if you are around dangerous people.\n\nIf you want to know more about the Venetian and the Jewish connection, see this: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-chosen/\" target=\"_blank\">The Chosen</a>\n\nüå†<strong>I don't like exposing recent false flag events Sep 12, 2015 @ 01:04</strong>\n\nHere is a short explanation why I don't like exposing recent false flag events:\n\nThere are people who can simply do it better than I can. Those people who can do it better than I can are also good at looking things in hindsight and also using such knowledge to predict events before it even happens. You can go to their websites right now: <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/\" target=\"_blank\">http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/</a> <a href=\"http://jimstone.is\" target=\"_blank\">http://jimstone.is</a> It happens at least once a week somewhere in the world, and at most, multiple times from multiple agendas every single day. Lesser known events happen multiple times from multiple agendas every single day. There are more dangerous things taking place behind the scenes that you aren't told about in the media and in the controlled alternative media. All false flag events are a multilayer distraction from higher level agendas which manifests itself as lower level agendas. To explain why X happened, I need to explain A through W and also Y and Z to show you that X is not the last of these events that were meticulously planned out for many thousands of years of trial and error. It is better to focus on the higher level agendas so that the lower level agendas would be understood naturally when it happens. It is harder but better to have real worthwhile solutions than saying reasons why people should look for real worthwhile solutions. It will get bothersome at least for me to re-mind people to not simply lose their minds on these tragic events even if they kill real people, that nothing is worth sacrificing your already dwindling liberty to someone or something else that isn't God. If you don't care about why things happen, you won't even think for yourself to begin with. It is better to bring people together in love than in fear, in free will than against their will, but that doesn't mean that God has no will over Christians, neither does that mean Christians can control the will of others the same way the Omnipotent God can change the hearts of the Predestined. To protect people you don't know in fear is not the same as protecting people who you love despite being in fear, so why give anyone your power to protect who you want to protect when there is no guarantee that you would know the people who say that they protect you, neither any guarantee that they won't take you down, but there is 100% guarantee that the protection that comes in fear creates more fear in both sides until the collapse of the current structure. In the name of love, they bring fear to people, in the name of peace, they start wars in nations. Fear God who is inside you as the Holy Spirit, don't fear the god of this world that Satan has de facto jurisdiction of.\n\nLook at my <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/links/\" target=\"_blank\">Links</a> page as it explain most of the lower level and some of the higher level agendas, as well as some solutions to questions that you never really questioned. In the age of increasing knowledge through the world consciousness that is the internet, most of the answers are surprisingly already solved, which most things concerning your lack of knowledge is because you don't utilize this source properly or long enough to extract the most of what you can get from it, but I made that easier for me and you with my <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/links/\" target=\"_blank\">Links</a> page as to the general direction that you should look towards.\n\nüå†<strong>Just a reminder 1 Sep 16, 2015 @ 15:20</strong>\n\nInstall a GNU/Linux distribution, use uBlock Origin on your web browser, I edit my articles randomly and fix errors that I find, I have no editor and on purpose, get a hold of some precious metals and virtual cryptocurrencies, defense is biblical, to say that you do good by doing bad, for good, is an oversimplified example of doublethink, this world is in multiple factions in a network that does networking to get people to do certain things disregarding laws and humanity, God loves the Jews but hates their wicked ways, and America is still a British colony.\n\nüå†<strong>Aging disagreements Sep 19, 2015 @ 19:39</strong>\n\nWe all hope for the best, but not everyone will know why. We all think we know what we are doing, but sometimes until a whole generation dies out, they would continue to spread lies by proxy without even knowing that they are working as Satan's agents yet it isn't their fault and perhaps some of them would be sealed until the day of redemption, remembered for only the good of what they had done for God in the right faith that of which faith and works can't be separated into a seemingly dualistic paradox that biblicly cannot exist. The true geniuses in this world by God are considered crazy even among the fools of this world by Satan's standards, yet only God knows their attempt and their contribution to society that is only recognized by an increasingly dwindling group of people that doesn't truly know in their hearts that they exist, neither have they ever met them in any way, shape, or form. Their knowledge is so dense that nothing except Jesus Christ can move them. It is imbued into their very bones. When they move, everyone fears the intense countenance that they see inside yet to that bearer of the truth, it is just a walk in the park. You are a sheep in wolves' clothing that doesn't like to do it yet is compelled by your own free will to take up the task that was destined for you to be in before time itself was created.\n\nSuch powerful people of God understand in their hearts the true weight of all the sin that is placed upon every consecutive generation, and yearns for them to take up a different, lighter yoke while sharing the weight that they have to the next generation so that their God given burden would be just a pinch lighter. However, they find themselves to be in a place where many of their peers can't hold this burden of truth, and as they seek more truth, they also seek more people, yet find themselves even more alone as their newly found peers aren't able to catch up to where you are as they are mislead to think that you are a worker of iniquity when it is they that wanted to claim absolute truth while you suspect plausible deniability concerning the doctrines that they speak. Eventually, these voices in the wilderness are increasingly restless until they have finally found another who can understand a reasonable amount, enough to lighten their true God given burden of the truth that compelled them to never give up...until you learn something, something new yet true that make you go through, that spiraling cycle all over again, trying to find more people that can bear witness to your testimony, only to lose more people.\n\nAt a certain point, these people stop at where they feel comfortable and become their worse enemy, a gatekeeper, a great stumbling block that is also inevitably wrong in certain things, but you will do your best to raise everyone up in a higher level, and bid Godspeed for the next you of the next generation to persevere but also to not let them die old but to live as young as they can be despite their long life, for when the body comes to the point of no return, the mind indefinitely accepts death and hopes that God will remember you to be sealed unto the day of redemption as you remember the hope of salvation is on your head, while you plea to God to come quickly to take up your spirit to return to where you came from.\n\nüå†<strong>Luciferians, personas, and meaning Sep 21, 2015 @ 19:46</strong>\n\nIn our world, we are made by the will of God, under His rule, made from His power that can manifest things into reality by words which those words have meaning. We are created through the absolute meaning ordained by God which we are to stay within its defined definition concerning what we can do and what we shouldn't do but still can do but we can never truly do what we can never do as it is up to the Creator to choose what we are. We can repurpose materials to create things for different purposes, changing dirt to pottery, thus also changing its meaning but we can't create the materials, we can't manifest things of the physical to appear. Our body repurposes food into energy, the food of which preprocessed-repurposed the materials in a form that the body can process it into as energy or as waste and a little of both.\n\nNow this is where I'll lose some of you, but please read on with a open mind. I am not a doctor, read this with caution. Some poor people drink lots of water and yet have eczema even when they grow up and become wealthy. Silver has some incredible healing properties that can even cure eczema in the form of silver water as colloidal silver water. Silver is a metal used as something with intrinsic value. A homeopathic remedy made from silver can treat some people with a strong \"miasm\" of psora. Miasms was originally seen as genetic taints by Hahnemann, which later, Rajan Sankaran has taken Hahnemann‚Äôs work and expanded the three original miasms to ten miasms by redefining the parameters of what the miasms are. In Sankaran‚Äôs system miasms represent a fundamental attitude toward life and pace of disease. Argentum Metallicum 10x, 20x, and 30x HPUS is used in the Sovereign Silver First Aid Gel, though it also contains ionic water soluble silver with practically no colloidal silver as \"silver hydrosol\" so it doesn't contain just the homeopathic remedy by itself which makes me wonder which part of it is being used to heal. In alchemy, silver is one of the noble metals and represents the restorative, healing power of the Moon. Silver is said to help both the physical body and the spiritual (astral) body. Silver is antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral (but probably not effective with viruses like ebola), but if you're going to drink colloidal and ionic silver (all colloidal silver contains some ionic silver), take some probiotics at a later time since it would wipe out most of your gut flora.\n\nMy understanding of demons is different than most others. Daimon comes from daio (to distribute fortunes). Demons are demonic, supernatural spirits of the fallen angels and their angel-human hybrids that have the spirit of angels and have an abnormal mixture of human and angelic DNA. All of these angelic and demonic beings that disobeyed God all went inside the foundations of the earth, some of them being locked up in a spiritual prison, unable to leave due to their exceedingly evil deeds up until they get released from the abyss but most of these bodiless spirits can go wherever they please within the confine of the atmosphere but Satan can leave earth heaven in the grounds of not harming the angels nor in conquest through war, to try to test God and His people legally. Fallen angels and demons are both demons collectively. These demons distribute good fortunes to people that they think that would be used to have people boast in having good things, material or spiritual, appearing to have good fruits of righteousness at least by looking at it so that people would be lead away from God in some way. Demons also distribute bad fortunes to people like Christians and sinners that can potentially become powerful Christians which these supernatural beings can generally understand God's hand towards certain people that He loves but aren't saved yet or probably never if Satan gets his way in tricking those people before God gives any mercy to them by preaching to them the true gospel message, dragging them down into the lake of fire.\n\nPersonalities are not inherently bad nor good. There is no closed set of personalities that Christians or anyone is restricted to. Whether if a personality is good or bad depends on the viewpoint of the person, whether first person, second person, or third person, third person near omniscience or third person omniscient of which the third person near omniscience POV is Satan, while third person omniscient being the Triune Godhead entity, the first being in the Trinity, God the Father, second, God the Son, third, God the Spirit. There are four states of which someone can be in, a state of sin, a state of righteousness, a state of hypocrisy and a state of neutrality. The state of neutrality technically doesn't exists, but they are aborted babies, infant children, and severely mentally retarded or one of those people who are born with a nervous system but without a brain, who don't and can't grasp logic and sin at least in the perspective of Natural Law, which they default to being forgiven by God of their mortal sin that is within the flesh itself that desires to sin. Whatever personalities that increases a state of righteousness is seen as good personalities, but it gets more complicated yet still simple enough for me to explain.\n\nWe all have the Holy Spirit within us, that is why we are even alive to begin with. HOwever, not everybody has the gift of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit in some ways is attributed to the breath of life which truth is imbued into the soul, understood to everyone as the Natural Law, that gut feeling, the way God made this world to work in. Our soul, mind, is affected by any spirit, whether it be the Holy Spirit, or demonic spirits, the spirit of forgiveness, or the spirit of anger, the spirit of America, or the spirit of Prometheus. The flesh is the greatest tempter of any man or woman. The physical body is the flesh. If it doesn't provoke you to sin, it isn't called the flesh until it hinders you from your goals of which again it is called the flesh. When people grow up into maturing teens and young adults, sexual desires provoke people to do more than what is legally acceptable in order to fulfill the lustful fire within outside of love, but that is when they are physically the most capable and is biologically the best time frame to have children. If you have children when you are 30 or older, you are creating children that are genetically in danger of unwanted mutations about the same as two first cousins having a child. When people get old, their sexual lust might disappear, but their bodies are the least capable in service as they accumulated too much pain, toxins, et cetera in their bodies. The flesh can be starved of its sinful desires in any sin not limited to sexual lusts. When you grow up, you have a higher metabolism (if you eat healthy enough) and you process food into your body, as your childhood influences are imprinted to a degree in your body and soul.\n\nIf you didn't notice, my definition that I use for spirit is a bit wider than what people use as they try to compartmentalize that meaning in the context of religion, law, and the metaphysical. You have your spirit, that part of you that does what you want and you know that it is you because it isn't your body, neither is it the Holy Spirit or demons or godly people's spiritual personalities or demonic people's spiritual personalities. The only way that your spirit can live on is either to write up a will for people to carry out in your name, or be influential enough for your influences, ideas, logic, work, et cetera, permeate within the people around you lives on through their lives, taking whatever good or bad of your spirit with them. When your mind stops, so does your spirit, as the Holy Spirit that gives you life returns back to God. If you die in Christ, the dead shall rise first in the first resurrection, while the others would be resurrected in the second resurrection in sin after the millennial kingdom, right when Satan is set loose from the abyss. There is no conscious after death, that is impossible, biochemically speaking. You need to be alive to have any conscious. Thoughts that comes from the pure consciousness obeys the Holy Spirit, the part of your spirit and mind that agrees with the bible and the Holy Spirit within and awaken in their realization of who they are by having the gifts of the spirit being activated in their newly found truth from the spirit of truth that is the Holy Spirit. Those who have the Holy Spirit craves the truth and seeks after the way, the truth and the life that Jesus Christ walked in to serve as the perfect example of how a righteous man of God can be like.\n\nIf your righteous anger was released in an improper time, you can potentially be sinning, or it can be simply a mistake, which that personality would be described as impatient, hothead, stupid, hateful. If you don't sin, it isn't bad to God, but it can be bad to others, even good to Satan as he wants you to look bad to others. If it was released in the right place, right time, but break some laws in front of the wrong people, the same bad descriptions can be applied here as well, and it can also be sinning depending on what you done. If you are simply angry in fleshly anger released in an appropriate time not in front of others and not doing bad things yet questioning God in prayer like what Job did, you are still sinning but it is objectively better than murdering people or causing any harm to others or even yourself physically or mentally. You can be a Christian that has a sarcastic sense of humor that mocks unrighteous sinners in front of their faces which might lead them to go away from you and from Christians, but it can also lead some of those people instead to try and see what God is really trying to tell them through you as you talk about how 66 books were written that are in complete agreement with each other despite having various authors in time is nothing short of a miracle. If you love someone that is also a real Christian yet if they don't like your highly analytical thinking that is often misconstrued to them as judgmental, which you are, but you don't mean to want to be mean and judgmental all the time when it is a part of your personality, it just means that her personality isn't compatible with yours and vice versa. Does that make that a sin, or is there some level of miscommunication going on?\n\nYou see how there are some gray areas here and there every now and then even among Christians. The flesh affects the mind enough to pick up good or bad personalities, making it hard for the mind to weed out the potentially bad ones when it is subjected at a lower level yet it isn't subjective at the highest perspective. There is also a striving to be righteous when you are not, but you still sin yet are not doing something worse if you didn't obeyed the Holy Spirit to a degree. Demons and demonic people can distribute good or bad fortune to you that the end result being of leading you away from God in some way, shape, or form, just as angels and godly men and women can distribute good or bad fortune (relatively speaking in your perspective of a situation) to you that the end result being of leading you towards God. If one deceptively tries to change people, that automatically is a sinful act, but God can make use of any situation to His favor, so people can be saved by lying wolves in sheep's clothing but be lead out of false churches if they read a good, reliable translation of the bible and seek after the kingdom of God and of His righteousness. That doesn't make that sinful act not a sin just because the end result was good. Demons can manifest as ideas, emotions, through sin, invading the body and even the mind but not the Holy Spirit and they can affect your spirit. Strong man demons come in to keep demons inside people.\n\nIf one is a Christian, they can start to change their ways and do what the bible asks for them to do in certain situations that is relatable with certain concepts presented in the bible. Since the body is also the flesh, the flesh gets stronger in the demonic spiritual sense as it gets weaker through poor diet, poor faith, et cetera. If you get poisoned, pray to God for a remedy, both spiritual and physical, for your flesh controls your mind which is where your spirit is within your mind. A weak body can form a weak mind/soul, which a weak soul has a weak spirit, but the Holy Spirit within is untouchable, and if they obey God and not be in a continual state of sin willingly as they strive to do away with those things, repenting wholeheartedly and praying for forgiveness, God can protect them and send angels to keep them safe from some of Satan's deceitful plans to end your life earlier than what God wants for you. You can be delivered from many demons initially when you get saved and many more when you strive to change your ways and you continue to be in the state of righteousness, but when you are in a state of sinning and in hypocrisy which is also in a state of sinning but with more dangerous punishment as a Christian you die in sin to be thrown into the lake of fire, some demons come back in depending on how long and how much you do away with God.\n\nNow back to silver. If you can forgive yourself and your situation that you grew up or have dealt with that had brought you to have a poor spirit, if you can let God heal you as He leads you to have riches in a spiritual sense among other Christians in meaningful and righteous relationships, your outlook in life might change and thus, you don't have to take any homeopathic medicine or colloidal silver to treat your skin problems and your constant need to drink lots of water instead of eating up when you are hungry. I am not saying that is going to be the case for everyone, but it is not completely wrong even in the context of homeopathy. There is a level of healing that can happen through changing who you are, but like many things in healing, if you just peel away one layer of a molding onion, it isn't enough until you get rid of all of the affected layers which then what's left is just the pure, unaffected and delicious onion. Using tools to accelerate healing isn't wrong or a sin as long as you can prove that it is not being used as a sort of charm. Being healed in one thing would make other problems to surface, not because you are getting weaker, but because you are getting more aware of what your body is dealing with. In TCM, certain organs affect certain emotions. A heated liver gets angry but if they keep the anger in, it becomes bitterness and manifests as pain in the liver if there's enough of it, while a cooled liver would make people less angry and a healthier liver. Artichoke leaves and milk thistle helps to detoxify and cool down the liver. A heated, or inflamed liver is one cause for eczema coming from within. The liver craves good sugars and carbohydrates like polysaccharides and glucose but not junk like sucrose, sucralose, alcohol, fructose, sugar alcohols that ends with a suffix -tol or -itol, poisons, metals, spicy food (the typical Korean diet in my opinion uses too much hot spices in everything) et cetera. Take sugar in its natural form, for it will come with fiber. Pasteurized juices are to be avoided for it lacks the vital phytonutrients and enzymes. Chrysanthemum tea is also good for the liver to cool down. Many physical problems are gateways for potential mental and spiritual pathways for demons to come into, even if you don't sin, but for the most part, the spiritual departure of obeying the Holy Spirit leads to spiritual and thus mental degeneracy that makes stupid mistakes of listening to the flesh that is easily manipulated by Satan against them to sin, thus, they come in through the flesh, into the mind.\n\nWhat are Luciferians? They are simply like Lucifer/Satan but in the form of an angel of light, as an innocent sheep, yet are ravenous wolves in the inside, which their followers get destroyed by their influences and false doctrines. Many, many Christians in the general truth movement are Luciferians by proxy. They are simply deceived sheep that don't know that they are doing wrong yet promote it. Until they realize and recognize what they do as sin, they are not full blown Luciferians. Lucifer is the god of the rainbow according to the higher echelons within the Grand Druidic Council as the Barvarian Illuminati, the Council of 13 exposed by John Todd. If you read Ezekiel 28, you'll find out he does kind of radiate like a rainbow and being covered with various precious stones. The Council of 10 is the Venetian system that controls the Committee of 300 which is higher up than the Grand Druidic Council which by the way, is infiltrated by the Jesuits.\n\nThe higher up you go in your journey of understanding the networking being done in the network, the more lies and gatekeepers that you will face which they would absolutely censor everything that is contrary to what they believe in despite having the evidence that they are wrong. They would assume that everyone that isn't a Jesuit priest but has been in their schools are Temporal Coadjutors, front men that the Jesuits use when they want to since they are not Jesuit priests. Just because someone is telling you that you are wrong doesn't mean that they are lying and thus, controlled by the Jesuits and thus, demonically possessed and potentially the hardest to prove that they are not saved. They would claim people like John Daniel, Tupper Saussy, Lyndon LaRouche, Webster Tarpley, Craig Oxley, and Eustace Mullins to be Temporal Coadjutors controlled by their the professed, fourth vow Jesuit priests. A good example of Christian Luciferians by proxy are Eric Jon Phelps, David Daniels, Bryan Denlinger, Walter Veith, John Todd, Alberto Rivera. What does all of those people have in common? They promote the King James Bible, they don't know the true history of the reformation and the time before the reformation but exposes the Jesuits, and they never talk about the Venetians, while steering people with some false doctrines concerning the bible. Although some of them are not intentionally spreading lies, they unfortunately are via proxy.\n\nThat is a whole can of beans for another time, but I want you to realize that some of those people are not controlled though some are, some of the things that they teach are real facts but not all of them, some of them are probably saved but probably not two or three of them based on the lies that they spout. These people who mean very well, teach things that turns out to be lies, simple as that. The things that they teach make more Luciferians by proxy, then through the herd bias of their peers of which are blind sheep that lose more discernment the more that they rely on them without fact checking everything. The less insulting term is Christians in error. Certain ideas begets a certain level of thinking.\n\nNo man or woman can get rid of everything that is flawed in their ways as we are made in corruptible bodies by God's design, and it is He that promises Christians that we will be made in a new incorruptible body. I remind you that these Luciferians by proxy are gatekeepers that are hindering people from knowing more. You will never hear from these people that Black people living in America are actually Moors that came to America, some being sent from America to elsewhere during the slave trade, some slave masters being funded by the Jews themselves. You will never hear from these people that the Soviets fabricated so called Holocaust evidence. You will never hear from these people that the City of London owns the land of which America is on. You will never hear from these people that the Lollards were controlled by the Knights Templars and the Knights Hospitallers, controlling the Peasant Uprising of 1381. You will never hear from these people the Irish slavery by the British Empire which was blamed on a famine when it was from start to finish, the symptom of enslaving a whole nation into serfdom. Reality is darker and more amazing as the light of the world that is Jesus Christ shines brighter in comparison, which is apparent in real churches that also shine like Jesus instead of hiding under the bushel of the IRS or other governments as a registered organization that has no true authority that an unregistered church that can prove that they are under Jesus Christ through their works testifying their faith has.\n\nThere's so much more that you won't be exposed to simply because you had restricted your education to a small group of white Christian elitists, and to adopt their way of thinking for too long would be detrimental to your mental well being. I assume that most of history would be revised and corrected in Jesus's millennial kingdom as censorship concerning history is gone for good, while Jesus Himself can correct what needs correcting. Every Christian alive is in error in something, some are just more correct than others, but not necessarily more \"right\" for knowing things that others don't. Once all the Christians are in the New Heaven, New Earth, New Jerusalem, only then would history have no power as we become one with God, forever beyond the end of time. Be careful my friends, and never stop researching, if you truly call yourself a truther.\n\nüå†<strong>Retarding discernment 1 Sep 26, 2015 @ 20:26</strong>\n\nThere is a strong delusion going on among Christians. I am going to expand on certain points from <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/synchronicity-and-the-ad-hoc-hypothesis/\" target=\"_blank\">Synchronicity and the Ad hoc hypothesis</a> and also <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/uncommon-history-of-the-current-adversary/\" target=\"_blank\">Uncommon History of the Current Adversary</a>. What I see is gatekeepers of the truth in various levels and factions, sort of like Satan's kingdom on earth through these evil people within their Black International Network that only seems to be divided externally.\n\nThe more one really seeks the truth, going above the clouds, the less centralized things become, for people who has the source truths are only good at that field of which they are exposing that can reveal the lies within the smokescreens beneath, but only through a spotlight. People who are aware of the other spotlights see many spotlights shining through the lies, but it can't shine through everything. Everyone else within the cloud can stumble upon some spots of light but can't get out of the light as they fear the lies outside of the light when they don't realize that they are still within the cloud, thus, still in confusion. Clouds are in many levels, and so are gatekeepers and the deceived. Clouds can be categorized within three altitude zones from low, mid, and high. Low altitude clouds are below mid altitude clouds which are below high altitude clouds. Some clouds are within all three zones like the Cumulonimbus, some take up two like the Nimbostratus, but most clouds are only in ine zone. Some clouds are thick, while others are fairly transparent and thin. If we expand this symbolism from clouds to the weather system, to the solar weather system, even the galactic weather system, The concept of an layered but interconnected system can be understood, but all allegories are not always literal and should not be taken too symbolic, metaphysical, and philosophical. Many Christians have their heads way up in the clouds that they forget that they can only live on earth now, not up there or down there, right now we are in earth, so wasting too much time on what's up there or down there can make you lose focus on your life. How many people had tried to hold onto dear life but they turn out to be grasping onto straws, thinking that a LifeStraw can prevent them from falling down the cliff of a treacherous mountain that hangs over a bottomless pit that they shouldn't be remotely close to to begin with? That's a rhetorical and metaphorical question, for those who didn't know what needs no explanation, let me explain.\n\nWatch this video before you read everything else: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw6O4V-N6mI\" target=\"_blank\">Critiquing The September Doom Theories - Shemitah - Bloom Moon 2015 (Radio Interview)</a> Did you watch it? I hope you did. Now Chris White doesn't talk about how the Freemasons and the controlled evangelical Zionist Christians are promoting this like the Prophecy Club controlled by Freemason Lindsey Williams and the 700 Club controlled by Freemason Pat Robinson and his friends. Remember that even in the highest Barvarian Illuminati hierarchy level, the Jewish Rothschilds are at high positions, which the Barvarian Illuminati has thoroughly infiltrated the Freemasons, though the Barvarian Illuminati itself is a front group of the Jesuit Order that is a front group of the merging of the Venetians, the Templar Knights, and the Catholic Jewish Marranos that serves the Venetians though the Venetian cult of San Rocco that the Los Alumbrados Aragon Templar Knights as the Order of Montessa and the Order of Calatrava have its true origins from. Many messianic churches are Luciferians by proxy, as the modern origins of the Hebrew Roots Movement are pushed by Freemasonic pastors like SMOM knight Rick Joyner and evangelical Freemasonic and Zionist Christian pastors like John Hagee, who has promoted the blood moon theory which was also promoted by the Prophecy Club and the 700 club. The modern HRM are just as controlled as the old HRM as the promotion of the Zionist British Israelism movement that had corrupted some forms of historical research of other nations into promoting the concept of the Zionist controlled Replacement Theology, assuming that if the Hebrews moved to other lands as Ephraim. There are more forms of Replacement Theology, but I will get to that in another article.\n\nThe New Apostolic Reformation church groups, Pentecostals, Evangelical Christianity, and even Seventh Day Adventists (even SDA's, Alberto Rivera, Walter Veith, Jim Arrabito, Danny Vierra, and any researcher that looks into the Freemasonic origins and ties in the SDA church will have to admit this), Mormons, and Jehovah Witnesses are easily deceived, but so are any ecumenical church and that includes Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Anglican, Episcopalians, Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Islam, Sikhs, Buddhists, Hinduists, Shamanism of many different tribes scattered across the world, and so on and so forth. Organized, centralized (not decentralized nor distributed) religion of any sort is prone to being corrupted. I think that it is easier to witness to a hermit that has no ties with other people within WICCA and the Church of Satanism or the OTO or any occult group than to witness to a deceived Christian within the Southern Baptist Convention, though it is good to remember that there are factions among any factions yet are networked together by a completely foreign entity. Many of them are within Freemasonic temples, Freemasonic Fraternities, Freemasonic business partners, Freemasonic controlled and infiltrated religions and governments, but Freemasonry is like a low level layer of the onion, many things are within and is affected by Freemasonry, but it is just the outer, dry appearance that protects whats inside. If Freemasonry was controlled by the Barvarian Illuminati, then the Freemasons are the Illuminati by proxy. If Barvarian Illuminati are controlled by the Jesuit Order, then the Freemasons are Jesuits by proxy, usually as Temporal Coadjutors. If the Jesuits are made by the Venetians, the Knights Templar, and the Jews, the Freemasons are Venetian controlled goyims that promote Zionism and claim to be spiritual descendents of the Catholic Knights Templar. If Freemasons are controlled by Catholic Knights Templar people, then the Freemasons are Catholics. If Catholics are controlled by pagan druids that adhere to Mitraism, Zeus, Thor, other sun gods and other religions as pantheists that serves Pan, the green man, AKA: Lucifer AKA: Venus, then Freemasons are Luciferians. If the druids are Phoenician in origin, being tied with the Kingdom of Tyre which also includes the Roman people that worships Saturn/Cronos (the hidden occult name of the city of Roma is Saturnalia), then the Freemasons are Saturnalians that outwardly serves Jupiter/Zeus/Marduk and also Venus/(Lucifer/Hermaphrodite) and other deities, by proxy. At a certain point, people will just realize that a onion is a onion is a onion no matter in what layer that it is in, but it is important to expose these layers so that people would understand how Satan's kingdom works in dividing God's kingdom seemingly against itself when both sides is actually infiltrated, though one is less controlled.\n\nThroughout the bible, one sees a transitioning in understanding the truth and also some misunderstandings as well. It was perfect before Adam and Eve sinned, which after they sinned, they were kicked out of the garden of Eden but they didn't have to deal with conspiracy theories when it is obvious as to who did what. When Cain came into picture, he killed Abel and fled with one of his sister to create a city-state with a separate kingdom outside of Adam's jurisdiction and thus, outside of God's authority and jurisdiction through Adam. Things gotten worse throughout the 1656 years until during the 1657th year when the flood happened and only leaving Noah and his wife, his three sons and their wives for a total of eight people who were in Adam's system and was not related to Cain's blood and his influences with the fallen angels that had tainted the gene pool with demons which their amoral debauchery also influenced the general culture of the people in the whole world, even corrupting some of the descendants of Seth by blood and by sin. Noah passed on the family system to Shem which Shem passed down the baton to A(h)bram/Bra(h)ma as Malkitsedeq. The Patriarchal family system continued through Moses's Israel as a free theorepublic, free as in free will and freed from the \"public\", for the patriarchal family system is set up so that every man can own their land and the land is kept in the family until the bloodline die out in which the neighboring families can split up the land. True Natural Law religious orders don't own the land, rather, the people does, as they use a religious Natural Law religion to do what any national government body does except that it protects the patriarchal family system and its titular leaders serve the people beneath the people, ministering to them. In other words, it is a system concerning dealing with families who are in the patriarchal family system without using force, without taking the liberty of the people away from their private lives, businesses, land, et cetera. Since in those days, such people owned land, those families or people that do are of royalty for everything within their own land is privately owned, they had allodial title of the land, which even if they donate to the priesthood/religious organization, they would return the land after every jubilee to the family that owned the land.\n\nFrom King Saul onwards, the people of Israel stopped owning their land as it became like the heathen nations that give up all their land to a ruler or a group of rulers to work for the will of the people outwardly, but inwardly the rulers did what they wanted to. Call it an Aristocracy, call it an oligarchy, call it a democracy, a kingdom, a \"republic\", dictatorship, it doesn't matter what you say that it is, but any system that gains power over the people, away from the people, against the people, it is a beast system. Any religion that promotes a beast system is an harlot that also seeks the destruction of the people. There were good kings and bad kings, but the people still didn't obey the laws that God told Moses to have Israel respect the land Sabbath laws and the jubilee laws, which God had enough and forced Israel into Babylonian captivity so that the land would have its rest for all the sabbatical years that the people didn't honor, and also to remind them that God entrusted Israel to own land under the conditions that He said to Israel to keep but wasn't paid as the rent was overdue, so to speak. Israel dealt with being under the occupation of other nations, some people owned land yet still had Jewish kings ruling under the empires that took over up through the Roman Empire. Israel had abandoned the priesthood system and made up their own system that is the Rabbinical system that incorporated religions of the nihilistic Babylonians and its neighboring nation's religion, but Israel for a long time had intermarried to neighboring nations, its people and its religious beliefs, pagan worship was even at one point, done publicly through King Shelomoh which in Freemasonry, his name is seen as King Solomon or Sol O Mon, the sun and the moon, and in between, the O is a solar eclipse, the generative principle, the union between the right and the left polarity/poles/pillars, even the Crown and the Monad. Then Jesus came in to take up an empty throne, only to lead his people and also the foreign people who are among the people Israel to return to Moses's Israel under Shem's religious priesthood/order, bypassing the Levitical system and thus, the need to become an Levite by blood but only being the Son of David. Only the King of Israel has the authority to change Israel into a different system. The problem however, is that not all of His people had obeyed Jesus, despite having a genealogy proving His royalty, and the land was controlled by Roman Empire so He was a king without any land of His own. Even though He ultimately does own the land, he was not under the Roman system that occupied the land illegally.\n\nJesus was recognized as the King of the Jews by the fifth Prefect of the Roman province of Jud√¶a, Pontius Pilate, under the authority of Tiberius Caesar, Son of the Divine Augustus, the Emperor. Jesus's kingdom will come to pass as revealed in the bible and by Jesus Himself that He will one day restore the land back to the Israelites, but until then, the religion that Jesus preached about is for everyone that is in the world physically, but seeks to not be a part of the systems in this world. There is no such thing as a real Christian nation that adheres to patriarchal family system which automatically means that the people have to own the land, that there is no state government, only a religious government but that religious government can't do anything by force but by the free will of the people. Did that ever completely happen on a \"national\" scale? Nope. If the Amish religion forces people to not do this or that, then it is in error and thus, not a Christian nation within a nation. You don't have to own allodial title to be in Jesus's Israel, though it will just be better if you did own the land since that would mean that you don't have to pay taxes to any other nation but to Jesus and His church, in free will contributions. The Apostles were lead by the Holy Spirit to make a treasury to let some trustees handle the money for the Apostles and for those who has done a vow (vows are not oaths) of poverty as an example to let them provide the stipend to those who have completely went under God's kingdom that can't be taking a part of the world's commerce but only within the kingdom of God on earth among the Christians, bartering and trading without currency, all just to not be taxed and if you use the king's money, it is of the king's and thus, not your money. People who are completely in God's kingdom might use a currency, but it isn't owned by others, and currencies between two people can exist by contract, though it is dissuaded to do so as it is a binding contract to form an IOU promissory note, which when created, one needs to eventually return the debt owed, but since Jesus isn't here on earth yet, He can't enforce a sabbatical year, but we can try to make a biblical chronological calendar from lots of research to find out when such sabbatical years are taking place, in which in my research, only a man called Daniel Gregg has set up a 99.9% biblical and historical chronological timeline and calendar. You could you know, just forgive people and only give to people out of your own free will without any strings attached.\n\nThe Apostles also made some rules concerning what gentiles can't do like eating food sacrificed to other gods and drinking blood, but Paul clarifies this and he also doesn't care about what kind of food that the gentiles eat, so blood in the food became acceptable, food like rare steak, blood sausages, even cow blood soup and living creatures that are eaten alive, as long as it wasn't for a demonic ritual or something. There are many more things that the Apostle Paul has clarified concerning what Jesus and the Apostles taught, even correcting Peter's error concerning his dietary reservations and hypocrisy of being unable to eat unclean food in front of Jews when he eats anything in front of gentiles. Apostle John spent his later days trying to preserve the written lowercase w word of God, the Holy Scriptures, throwing away the gnostic fake knockoffs that has false doctrines, whether Rabbinical, Essene, Gnostic, or pagan heresies which the Apostle Paul has dealt with as well as most of the Apostolic church. Right after all the Apostles died out, there no longer was anyone who can be called a biblical Apostle, a disciple who have seen Jesus Christ in the flesh on earth. It just so happened to be around that time which great heretics came in as \"church fathers\" that had lead the people astray and had watered down the early Christian's understanding concerning the doctrines and laws that were taught in the bible by the likes of Justin Martyr, Origen, et cetera, to the point of becoming a harlot church, by wanting to be under the jurisdiction of the Roman government for safety, they were in a position of supporting a state government that took the estate of the people into the hands of a few which the people are taxed for using their land as public citizens that are privately owned by the state. We mustn't forget that slavery was prominent in those days in the Mediterranean (mediterraneus, Middle Earth) countries but it wasn't always the case.\n\nEven before the reformation, even before the Knights Hospitaller and Knights Templar influences behind the Lollards, the people who had held the Antioch line of the bible had taught false doctrines despite holding a censored bible translation as Justin Martyr and the Catholic Church (the church before \"Roman\" Catholicism and after the Apostolic church) promoted the Rabbinical Septuagint translation by the Jewish Sanhedrin and the Alexandrian line of the bible. The Protestants are comprised of Protesters and Christians, the Protesters being the Freemasonic Knights Templar that want revenge of the power that Catholicism and the oligarchs had taken from them, and also the Venetians who wanted to weaken the Vatican, though the Venetian controlled Jesuit Order were behind the counter reformation. Some good and some bad had came about from this, which then a division came about among the Christians who were loyal to the controlled British Monarchy and thus, loyal to the Freemasons and the Catholics who keep them in power. These Christians of the Reformation that wanted to flee from Britain are known as the Puritans, whom they wanted to own their own land, but has failed to keep it that way as they ultimately went to the New World under the charter of the Virginia Company which was owned by the Crown corporation that was later given up to the City of London of which they still own all the land that the colonies, whether Protestant or Catholic colonies, has walked on the land in the King's place. As time went by, the Rosicrucian Lutherans and any of the reformed Protestant divisions in America developed, it has split into many more denominations, mostly false, some were pretty good but as time went by, the had forgotten what the Protestant Christian denominations has done to fight for \"religious freedom\" in America and the things that they were fighting for, as more and more, apostasy has grown to an extremely dangerous level. It is until the advent of the internet that people can do better research and condense thousands of years of researching by using other people's research into a few years of intense research (if you are smart enough and have lots of ample time on your hands) which had finally allowed some people to not be deceived concerning most things in history, even though the internet was created by DARPA before it had a D, it still allows some content to survive and it can't be completely taken down. As time goes on, the internet is in danger, in which mesh network systems are right around the corner, taking the next step in information preservation to being a completely decentralized, distributed library for knowledge, research, or anything for that matter, to accelerate the human creativity by at least liberating the people from the censored lies that goes on while sharing the censored truth in hopes of people to use it well for good.\n\nTo be continued here: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/retarding-discernment-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Retarding discernment 2</a>\n\nüå†<strong>Retarding discernment 2 Sep 29, 2015 @ 03:26</strong>\n\nThis is outdated, but the backbone structure of this article is somewhat the same.\n\nIn my previous article: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/retarding-discernment-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Retarding discernment 1</a>, most of it is a long winded historical explanation of why Satan can't trick everyone all the time, even though he does trick some people all the time and everyone some of the time, while showing how the truth can be condensed so immensely by using the research of others who've compiled and also compressed their works to some degree in order to explain what they need to. I can go off into many tangents attempting to explain everything in my highly condensed version of the timeline of mankind, but now I'm going to explain some more relatable information concerning certain groups of people who can be categorized in tiers that are subject to disinfo.\n\nThere are four ways to react to disinfo, or anything for that matter. There are those who are for the disinfo, those that are against, those who are uncertain, and those who don't deal with it. Someone who can spot disinfo from a mile away are people who tend to be mature and experienced enough to not deal with it but only leave a simple memo that they're not for it because of X reason and those people minimize their time dealing with shills and drama while focusing what needs to be exposed because little to no one is actually exposing the important info at hand, though not necessarily spending their time on current events even though they are well up to date concerning it through other similar people who really dedicate their time to do that. There's so many things happening every day that even if I guess 95% of the agenda preemptively just by the title of a news article from alternative or mainstream media outlets correctly before reading it then understanding its implications tying in with other deeper agendas, I don't have the time, nor enough motivation to do that as I explained in my rant: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/i-dont-like-exposing-recent-false-flag-events/\" target=\"_blank\">I don't like exposing recent false flag events</a>. This website is much slower paced so don't expect exemplary news updates. Anyways, I exposed certain lies in the whole blood moons and the shemitah nonsense in hopes that you would see a deeper level of disinformation going on within certain groups, without dealing with drama in the comments section that you guys can't comment on. You could call my tier, rank B, while the people who are exposing recent stuff but also at least capable of seeing things in my level, rank A.\n\nThere are those who are against the disinfo but spend lots of time on it while dealing with drama without ever touching the deeper level disinfo. If those people do that for recent news, they're rank C while their followers or people who do that with older stuff, they're rank D. These people, both C and D, tend to be on Youtube and in the mainstream social media centers owned by Jews like Youtube and Facebook and Google+. There are some rank B's in those places, but believe me when I say that people like me are 1 in 100,000 to 1,000,000 because those people know that they're very stupid for using controlled social media yet they don't know where else to go as places in IRC and anonymous image boards isn't a good alternative, while obscure decentralized social network sites tend to have the same kind of terrible people found in anonymous image boards. Popular public alternative media forums tend to be full of disinfo agents, though it isn't completely bad to be in them, they just at times feel too restrictive even if they aren't controlled, any group comes with a bias and a specialty towards their strengths. Everything below rank C are never exposed to information concerning the Venetians. Some rank C people know about it, but they think that the Vatican controls the Jesuits when it is clearly the other way around and not only that, but there is a Venetian AND a Jewish side behind the roots of the Jesuits that seeks to destroy the Vatican and Catholicism more than what Catholicism can do to itself with a over powerful Pontifex Maximus anti-pope. They want you to think that the Papal Nobility bloodlines control the Jesuits, so it comes as a full circle, which is illogical, and they want you to not look at the Black Nobility bloodlines, especially the ones with an amalgam of multiple powerful scions in them that controls the Papal Nobility bloodlines. Some of the Jews were married into such bloodlines and these people want to be part Jewish as one of their Talmudic beliefs is about how they can be saved by blood, or just being a Jew makes you better than all of the goyim, which is a very comforting thought to evil nihilists if they ever start to fear if they ever have any morality left in them to be worried about saving their souls because of the evil deeds that they and their bloodline has done.\n\nThere are those who are against the disinfo, but are also uncertain as to their position in which they are also for the disinfo. Many rank C and D also fall into this category, but we are assuming that we know that it really is disinfo and also people's stances concerning it so don't get too meta on me, you're over-thinking this. Generally, those who are in this category most of the time are rank E and F. There are those who are uncertain but are generally for the disinfo, they are G and H. Rank E, F, G, and H are what most people who spend quite some time on the internet are. They only looked at the tip of the iceberg, ignoring what's beneath what already seems to be the truth by these people. They also deal with even lower tier conspiracies like Gamergate, third wave feminism, the LGBTIQ people, deceived religious traditionalists and patriots like Libertarians, ethnic differences, religious conspiracies, the Neo Nazi hatred of the Jews without understanding that it is a spiritual wickedness going on that affects them and Satan's chosen people who are Canaanites by blood and by spirit as merchants. In other words, anything that would be easy bait for a Hegelian dialectic argument, usually dealing with morals, politics, and even the general group of conspiracy theories that Alex Jones or David Icke spews out which those two are rank E but sometimes are rank G. Rank E through H are concerned with anything that affects their mainstream internet culture and its various internet sub cultures that isn't in the general conspiracy culture though they are aware of it and make fun of it with terrible logic and reasoning. There are those who are for the disinfo, paid shills or not, they believe it at least 90%. Those people are rank I and J, but they are actually the surface level mainstream nonsense. Rank I is the mainstream media, the public school system, the authoritative figures. Rank J being the old patriotic grandma that doesn't use the internet and only has a land line, old friends, and a 12 inch technicolor television to watch reruns on TV Land and Fox News. As you can see, there's overlapping of some of the groups concerning their situation.\n\nThere is a rank above rank A which I would call rank 1, and there is a rank below rank J being rank 0. Rank 1 people are whistle blowers that have gotten direct information from the closest source there is and exposes it, risking their lives for just for one or more things. These people have to had been attempted to be murdered. Rank A people deals with death threats, and so does people even in rank J, so death threats mean nothing in comparison to actual assassination attempts. These rank 1 people get the second hand info from the people who make the agendas themselves: the rank 0. Rank 0 is 0 because they are evil and are of the scum of the earth, will be stepped on its head like a serpent, forcefully eating dust, never being able to taste complete victory from their hard labor. Without rank 1, A, and B, you are dealing with a filtered version of the actual agenda in every rank that you go lower. Rank 0 information will never reveal itself or else it becomes a rank 1 even if it still is in the dark side, for we can never fully know if it is a rank 0 as such people would probably be cut off from the higher levels of the pyramid scheme and into a lower level that externalizes the lower hierarchy, never revealing the higher hierarchy. Some rank 1's become lower ranks the more people find out of they are wrong or are controlled, but sometimes shills and ignorant Luciferians by proxy make these rank 1's look bad in order to hide the truth. Eric Jon Phelps and Bryan Denlinger does that. When rank E's and G's are exposing each other and themselves sort of like Puritan Pictures, R$E, TVC, and Nephtali1981 Youtubers has done, it's better to just grow up and get out of the lower level immature and naive nonsense that preaches like a rank G or I pastor with little to no discernment in biblical doctrine, quoting G or I rank pastors as someone that they look up to as some sort of a reliable source. Sadly, a pastor that's above rank C is rare, even finding a rank C pastor is rare. As much as I disagree with Bryan Denlinger (mostly rank D, sometimes rank C) concerning some things, he is right on many things concerning biblical doctrine. He's better than Paul Washer and Steven Anderson. He's also above pastor worship even though he respects some people, he doesn't go beyond to the point of sharing and wholeheartedly believing everything that some famous pastor had said. Many people in rank E through H hold dear to Calvinism or Arminianism when they're actually both wrong in certain forms, see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-ride-never-ends/\" target=\"_blank\">The ride never ends!</a> <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/what-isnt-predestination/\" target=\"_blank\">What isn‚Äôt Predestination?</a>. If someone calls themselves Christian yet are stuck between all these isms for salvation with their favorite doctrine tied into their favorite man that has made that doctrine when the last page on every Chick tract does it fairly better than the rest, they might be saved for all I know, but they are rank G to J Christians.\n\nHere's a condensed version: Rank 0 is the highest source of the agenda, rank 1 are whistle blowers of rank 0 information, but never makes the agendas like rank 0, rank A, C, E, G, and I are active journalists in varying levels from the source, rank B, D, F, and H are passive journalists and/or followers of higher ranked people, rank A and B gathers as much rank 1's and their information but rank B also use rank A's information, rank I sometimes get rank 0's filtered information but never gets the full picture, rank J is typical sheeple through and through. Depending on the subject, some people are of higher ranking than others, and people in the same rank aren't necessarily equal. I'd rather have more people that were in rank E through H to move to rank C and D than to have a few rank A and B's, since that would mean that I would just need to focus on rank C and D people to do away with lower tier people. If you are in rank B and above, as a Christian, you can start to focus on things that really matter like establishing God's church the right way without going to some stupid bible college to get a license to take money away from you as a business, actually doing what God calls us to do, start the healing process through giving and forgiving, and so much more but done the right way without doing anything illegal. But seek ye first for the kingdom of God and of his righteousness.

When in doubt, rely only on the information that Ken L. Wheeler gives out which his research concerning magnets and the forces in this universe is beyond many others.\n\nüå†<strong>People I find to be a waste of my time Oct 4, 2015 @ 16:20</strong>\n\nAt a certain point, there are things that I feel like I don't want to waste my time on besides a brief mention of how utterly stupid it is. Regardless, I end up exposing some of them in detail because of either peer pressure or by pure pity for those people that are stuck in a spiritual rut.\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkodTydUR0E\" target=\"_blank\">WARNING!</a></strong> Be careful when \"researching\" information about these kind of people and their beliefs.\n\nThese people are those who get their \"news\" from Facebook or Tumblr or Twitter or Google+, Flat Earthers, Anti Catholic Jesuit haters (as opposed to Jesuit haters), Neo Nazis (not to be grouped with Holocaust revisionists), Libertarians, New Agers, Book of Enoch promoters, the general Evangelical Christians/Messianics, racial supremacists, multicultralists, the general controlled mainstream science promoters, and some other groups not mentioned. I can sum all of them up with this principle that they are under double standards by assuming one authority is infallible, then things falls under Poe's Law as their Perceptual Constancy is fixed to be proven by ad hoc theories that doesn't prove everything beyond the subjective level, thus, gets trapped into a self fulfilling prophecy cycle even if the actual objective empirical evidence interpreted in reality would say otherwise. The problem is that these authoritative sources serves as gatekeepers of the cycle and thus, gatekeepers keeping you away from truth, keeping you in the cycle, and at times, using you for their benefit whether good or bad. The problem is also that only God is the most grounded in the truth as He IS the truth, so no one, not me, you, Lucifer, nor Gabriel, nor the internet, can ever truly and fully understand everything. People will use the Holy Bible to say that they are lead to ALL truth because they're Christians, but as time goes by, I realize that is not always the case, if not, it is MOSTLY not the case. That again doesn't mean that they are necessarily worse off than others, rather, the speck of fecal matter that's on their pupil poisons the future generations coming from that pupil that grown up to be the teacher that spread the truth but with a speck of evil in it. You won't necessarily notice or even care as it won't kill you, but taking that speck out would increase the purity of the truth and thus, you would prefer the best over the former best, until there is a way to get rid of the dissolved water soluble fecal matter that contaminated the seemingly clear water.\n\nüå†<strong>The Chosen Oct 7, 2015 @ 14:42</strong>\n\nOne of the most important things for people to understand is to discern as to what is a Christian and what is a Jew. Like many things, people had done some research already, and I am simply gathering the information together to show you a clearer picture.\n\nThis is a good base to start with: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJrjtiulUmw\" target=\"_blank\">Replacement Theology Examined</a>.\n\nThis gets more into exposing the Jews and their history: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJxdIXgMGAI\" target=\"_blank\">THE OTHER ISRAEL</a>.\n\nThis: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=typ2pl2L47k\" target=\"_blank\">'Marching to Zion' Official Full Film - Youtube</a> also talks about the Jews and also presents information promoting Replacement theology but as the first video exposes, the Dispensationalism doctrine and mindset and also Replacement theology doctrine are false, but it is true the Martin Luther did speak against the unbelieving Jews, and after the one hour twelve minute mark, Steven Anderson tries to explain the meaninglessness of endless genealogies. Eat the meat, spit out the bones, focus on the arguments presented, not his very questionable character of calling sodomites: \"faggots\"(not in the documentary of course), and other questionable things concerning his doctrines, the people he associates with, et cetera. Know that this video explains things that the \"THE OTHER ISRAEL\" documentary didn't explain, so like any real researcher, you should look into it before criticizing or praising it for whatever value that it has.\n\nNow we are going into what most Christians think when they hear \"Replacement Theology\": <a href=\"http://www.ldslearning.org/tribe-of-ephraim.htm\" target=\"_blank\">The tribe of Ephraim</a> <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150611092509/http://www.associationcovenantpeople.org:80/our-library/current-writers/rob-macdormand/60-ephraim-and-manasseh\" target=\"_blank\">Ephraim and Manasseh</a> <a href=\"https://carm.org/black-hebrew-israelites\" target=\"_blank\">Black Hebrew Israelites</a>. Take note that these \"extreme\" definitions is not the same as the Replacement Theology that Marching to Zion documentary talks about, though similar, the internal core beliefs are not the same as the external core beliefs. Reformed or Covenant Theology can often be grouped into the general Replacement Theology nonsense which many people who says Replacement Theology doesn't know themselves that it isn't limited to just Americans thinking that they're Israelites when it can be any religion, nation, race and ethnicity (just one race contains multiple ethnicities beneath it) that claims to be from any tribe of Israel BY FLESH AND BLOOD. No one can claim with 100% certainty as to what tribe that they came from, which if you watched the Marching to Zion documentary, he and some other baptists understand in a more general sense that the Jews have dispersed and was scattered into the world, so there are people who think that they are not Jews when they can quite possibly be, and if the requirement was to be of Abraham's seed BY FLESH AND BLOOD, then there would be a much higher chance of being of Abrahamic descent, BUT, remember that salvation was NEVER by being flesh and blood Jews, yet the exact opposite is being pushed by some evangelical churches and even by some so called Messianic churches. If there is no Jew nor Greek in Heaven in the sense of there not being any separation by flesh and blood among a Christian Jew or a Christian Greek, then what are they? Christians! That doesn't mean however, that God is done with the Jews by flesh and blood as we can see in the Book of Revelation which I've only briefly gone through here: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/a-short-chronological-look-at-the-book-of-revelation/\" target=\"_blank\">A short chronological look at the Book of Revelation</a>.\n\nI believe that at one point, Replacement Theology was pushed by Zionist Jews, especially during the British Israelism movement, which had given reasons for some random Brit to care about the bible and also to try to get their land back. The original Zionist Jews are also Jacobinist, Bolsheviks, a part of the Barvarian Illuminati, even a part of the Jesuit Order ever since the beginning. The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, hoax or not, its contents are what is seen by many conspiracy theorists as a good general plan that Zionists Jews and Zionist gentiles are actually following it to a tee. An older form of Zionism existed through the Merovingian dynasty who are theorized to be of the Tribe of Dan pretending to be of a direct lineage from Jesus and Mary Magdalene which such claims are made only by gnostic writings after the gospels and the epistles are written. There's even a Post Apostolic version of Zionism through Simon Magus and his Simonian Samaritan followers which Samaritans are part Babylonian, part Jews, part Canaanite/Phoenician, part Assyrian. We can go even further as the Persians themselves thought of Abraham as their true founder, even the Indians think of Abraham as Brahma, but that won't technically be Zionism, rather trying to call the egg of Judaism to be from the chicken that laid many eggs claiming to be tied in with Abraham in some way in their religion. For more about that, look here: <a href=\"http://www.hermetics.org/Abraham2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Who Was Abraham?</a>.\n\nThe important blue bloods actually are the descendents of the former Roman Empire's aristocratic oligarchs, which some of them fled to the armpit of Italy, the swamplands of Venice and became the Venetians. Some of them want to claim that they are of Egyptian dynasties as well, since they like their system of slavery that was perfected from Nimrod's system, which in itself is Cain's system but without the Nephilim and so God only confused the languages instead of flooding the earth again even though the same old Satanic system seeks to be outside of God's Royal Law and Natural Law. Before the Roman Empire, the Romans were the Phoenicians of the same old Kingdom of Tyre before the Persians through Alexander the Great took them out of the power of the Middle Earth (Mediterraneus, Mediterranean Sea. John Ronald Reuel Tolkien substituted some real names with magic words as the good Roman Catholic and occultist he is). The Roman Empire as how I see it, is the continuation of the Kingdom of Tyre, while most of the already heretical Catholic Church as Jezebel who marries King Tyre as the Roman Catholic Church, but uses the knowledge of the Greek philosophers, specifically Aristotle's works, to perpetuate the Phoenician Law of the High Seas in order to not be subjects to other nations yet take over them on top of the Law of the Land that gives it authority, into Roman Civil Law, into Roman Catholic Canon Law, into Templarism, into the Crown corporation, into the Uniform Commercial Code, into anything and everything that promotes Zeusian tyranny instead of Promethean leaders. The Law of the Land isn't \"good\" either my friends. Zionism to me is a system of control used by the Venetians and the Jesuits and the Jews to use religion to usurp authority over others by identifying the Jews as the chosen aristocratic leader/master race while promoting multiculturalism as the Plebian servant/slave race since they lose their genetic and cultural identity as practiced in ancient Egypt and Babylon through slavery as a national citizenship. I have discussed some of these matters before in here: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/uncommon-history-of-the-current-adversary/\" target=\"_blank\">Uncommon History of the Current Adversary</a>.\n\nThe Venetians are partially the Jesuits but only the ones that associate themselves with Venetian schools and people of Venetian descent but for the most part, the Jesuits are controlled by the Venetians while the Jesuit Order itself is split into its own factions. Besides a few Black Nobility scions, the Papal Nobility scions and some random Nobility scions all over the world that are not of the Black Nobility are like commoners in comparison, yet the Talmudic Kabbalistic Frankist Sabbatean Jews are intermingled with all of them indiscriminately only for their wealth and power to ultimately destroy it from the inside out. Taken from <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20151023062036/http://one-evil.org:80/content/entities_locations_venice.html\" target=\"_blank\">One Evil: Venice</a>:<blockquote>Venice - a city located within the marshes of the river Po and at the top of the Adriatic Sea was founded around 532 CE by Sarmatian noble family refugees fleeing the Byzantine Empire and the capital crime issued by Justinian that practicing Sarmatians religion (demon worship and human sacrifice by burning) was a capital crime. The word \"Venice\" comes from the Latin veneti, which is equivalent to the Greek etenoi, which means \"Praisworthy/Chosen\". It is the title self imposed by the Sarmatians claiming to be the only race \"chosen by God\", with all other cultures, races and people doomed to fire and fodder. The title became their unofficial resistance cry against the Byzantines in forming new settlements in Spain and the top of the Adriatic. Early Venice -- a famous Jewish state. Prior to the wholesale revision of history to hide the obvious historical facts, Venice was known as one of the most famous Jewish States of the early middle ages. After Septimania was captured by the Umayyad caliphate in the 7th Century, Venice became the last purely Jewish state on the Mediterranean in history until the formation of Israel in 1948. Within one hundred and fifty years of their exile from Sarmara, the colonists of Etenoi (Veneti) has signed a trade pact with Byzantine that enabled the Jewish trading states of Septimania in Spain, Egypt and Venice to move their vessels past Constantinople to Samara, the capital of the Khazars in the Black Sea.</blockquote>\n\nFor more information concerning the Venetians, look at these links: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRfR6tvUZKs\" target=\"_blank\">Venetian Oligarchy</a> <a href=\"http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/\" target=\"_blank\">Against Oligarchy</a> <a href=\"http://www.eustacemullins.us/wp-content/works/Books/\" target=\"_blank\">Eustace Mullins' books</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP7NxfPmiI4\" target=\"_blank\">The Venetian Money System</a>. If you looked at all the information presented, you can now start to see that there were Samaritan exiles and Jews in Venice that merged with the Roman aristocratic oligarchs from the ancient Roman Empire, and that what the Jesuit trained, Jew loving Venetian Count Richard Nikolas Eijiro Graf Coudenhove-Kalergi is pushing (<a href=\"http://henrymakow.com/2015/06/The-Illuminati-Jewish-Plan-for-European-Genocide%20.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Illuminati Jewish Plan for European Genocide</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4U8srs6qgo\" target=\"_blank\">The Hidden Roots of the European Union</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJjSzXkm55o\" target=\"_blank\">How Zionists Divide and Conquer</a>) as the Kalergi Plan, then you will know that the Venetians and the Jews are fundamentally compatible as they see themselves as \"The Chosen\", both worships Monetarism and Statism, and both are materialistic nihilists.\n\nThe Venetian aspect of British Israelism is explained well by Webster Tarpley: <a href=\"http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/how-the-venetian-system-was-transplanted-into-england/\" target=\"_blank\">How the Venetian System Was Transplanted Into England</a> but you don't see much of the Jewish aspect of it, which you can see it here: <a href=\"http://henrymakow.com/jewish_peril.html\" target=\"_blank\">Catholics Unveiled Masonic Jewish Plot in 1936</a> <a href=\"http://www.catholicvoice.co.uk/pinay/\" target=\"_blank\">The Plot Against the Church by Maurice Pinay</a>. Here's the British aspect of British Israelism for the modern era: <a href=\"http://www.larouchepub.com/other/1997/ahc.html\" target=\"_blank\">British Subversion of the United States: The militias and Pentecostalism</a>. The reason why you will never see Protestant \"Christians\" speak against the Jews is because they psychologically can't accept that their religion was hijacked by the Venetians and the Jews from the Lollards onwards. I believe that Martin Luther later realized how evil the unsaved, wicked Jews were in comparison to the average unsaved gentiles which prompted him to write his famous book against the Jews, yet he was still somewhat under the Venetian control as the very logo of the Lutheran Church is symbolic of the Rosicrucians (<a href=\"http://watch.pair.com/reformation.html\" target=\"_blank\">THE REFORMATION: ROSICRUCIAN CONNECTIONS PART 1</a>) which are Catholics, which the Roman Catholic Church was already infiltrated by the Venetians and the Jews through Freemasonry and by other hidden tentacles, while the Venetians and the Jews as the Marranos had made and controlled the Jesuit Order through the Cult of San Rocco in Venice. John Calvin and John Knox are Jews who believed in questionable doctrines: <a href=\"http://watch.pair.com/reformation-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">THE REFORMATION: ROSICRUCIAN CONNECTIONS PART 2</a>. Since the Venetians are Samaritans which the Samaritans are Chaldeans, Phoenicians, Canaanites, and the lost ten tribes of Israel including the sea faring pirate tribe of Dan speculated as the original Arcadians/Spartans that isn't included in the ten tribes of Israel/\"Ephraim\" of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, it's better to say that these Venetians are merchant (the same word for Canaanite in Hebrew) Israelites that also merged with the Romans and the Jews that moved their power to Britain through the Protestant Reformation in order to hinder the Vatican and also to move away from the impending destruction of the Venetian Empire in the Mediterranean Sea to the Blessed Isles of Albion in the ancient Roman city of Londonium where the New Venice reigns its Consiglio dei Dieci (Council of Ten) in the City of London within the heart of Greater London where its New Doge, Elizabeth Mary II of the House of Guelph reigns not as the Queen of England.\n\nTaken from <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/webster-tarpley-the-jesuits-are-on-the-side-of-the-british-empire/#comment-5377\" target=\"_blank\">http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/webster-tarpley-the-jesuits-are-on-the-side-of-the-british-empire/#comment-5377</a>:<blockquote>The majority power within and over the Jesuits are also aligned with the New Venice Empire. Whilst you have New Venice control and alignment over the Jesuits then the order will continue to deteriorate in knowledge and wisdom from what it once was. The Jesuits are no where near as great minded as they once were and they too have deteriorated since the Bertrand Russell and his attack on mankind aided by the Darwinism. It‚Äôs interesting to note how many Jesuits actually admire Bertrand Russell and yet this same creature has aided the mental demise of the Jesuits. There are still some clued up Jesuits but for now they‚Äôve not been able to challenge the New Venice powers but that might change in the future now Putin‚Äôs bringing on the BRICS New Development Bank and a multi-polar Promethean powered world. We might just see another schism in the Jesuit Order where by the last few minds take back control of the Jesuits and bring some morality back to the order and the Vatican. So what we have here is an alliance between the former Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (Jesuits) with the British East India Company (City of London) and this is an almighty power. This alliance has bought about its revenge against Europe and Catholicism over the Renaissance which almost destroyed the Satanic Venetian powers. Europe and the Catholic Church made the mistake of not totally destroying Venice and the Jesuits when they had the opportunity and now these groups continue their revenge. Take a look at the last two Grandmasters of the Order of Malta and notice how they‚Äôve been British. The key moment in time to monitor from was 1962-63 not only with the Second Vatican Council but also the Alliance of the Orders of St John. New Venice totally took over the last dredges of Europe and the Catholic Church from the sixties onwards. The Second Vatican Council was the Jesuit destruction of the Catholic Church leaving them in charge of the Vatican and now they‚Äôve even got a Jesuit soldier in the position of Pope (anti-pope since 1963) which signifies they‚Äôve won the battle.</blockquote>\n\nWhat made Zionism global is the religion of the Holocaust, as if one wrong, real or not, justifies the systematic genocide of the German people, the creation of the United Nations and strengthening the New World Order. Hitler was right about there being a Jewish conspiracy controlling freemasonry, the media, the banks, et cetera, but he wouldn't have thought that the Jesuits would betray him, which they actually didn't and they were for Hitler's goals of getting the german people back their land, to bypass the Jewish banking system controlled by the Rothschilds, get rid of the Jewish controlled media and Jewish controlled government officials by sending them to the State of Israel with all their wealth intact, save his own people from the systemic racial genocide and oppression happening in other countries like the Germans in Poland, and ultimately to encourage other nations to seek a moral nation with its own culture using its own money without usury, maintain sovereignty of all races to their respectable nations. The Holocaust is a fabricated communist lie, which it was the Jewish Bolsheviks that killed the Tsars in Russia, wanting to make NSDAP look like they had done a evil crime to justify the genocide of the Germans. Saying all of that, I think that Hitler was hypocritically funded by the British Empire, the Episcopalian (internally Catholics and Freemasons) elite families, even the Zionist Jews that took over Britain by their infiltrated Freemasonic systems that pushed the concept of British Israelism. I also think that the Jesuit controlled (since 1814) Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM) controlled Nazi Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst (DVD) merged with the OSS that was funding and helping Hitler's Germany by using Operation Paperclip to smuggle in Nazi families, leaders, and scientists into the States before Joseph Stalin got a hold of the \"loot\". Hitler helped his people by using hyperbaric oxygen chambers in hospitals to cure people from disease, and since the Roman Catholic Church had a schism concerning the Jews that tried to infiltrate the \"Church\" through freemasonry, I do think that in certain degrees, Hitler knew that Roman Catholics were on his side, but the DVD and the Jews that he had made into honorary Aryans that is in his inner circle were not completely loyal to him. Hitler can be seen as a Promethean liberator like Lincoln, JFK, Gaddafi, and even Putin because of their rebellion against the Venetian system, but Hitler was not completely innocent in his youth with the spy work that he has done. In the end, it is the Zionists and the Venetians (and the Venetian controlled Jesuits) that are the real \"Nazis\" since they control the DVD that works within the CIA, and also supported Hitler at one time while attacking him in another.\n\nHere's a dump of links concerning some of the information that I used to come to the conclusions above:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9kXnJ5cfZA\" target=\"_blank\">The Origins Of US Intelligence-Dave Emory</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytnINw6kqoE\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Story - Jesuit/Vatican EU Criminal Corruption &amp; Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM\" target=\"_blank\">JFK to 911 Everything Is A Rich Man's Trick</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjMcbykR9Og\" target=\"_blank\">The History of the German Space Pioneers</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5sbegfCz7o\" target=\"_blank\">Ernst Zundel - Interviewed by an Israeli journalist (1996) GREAT !!!</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7aPiYzXPMI\" target=\"_blank\">Fred Leuchter Interview with Jim Rizoli 2015</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGKKqF_lPc\" target=\"_blank\">Holocaust: Breaking the Spell</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.jimstonefreelance.com/holohoax.html\" target=\"_blank\">Holohoax report from June 27 2014</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.hellstormdocumentary.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hellstorm - Exposing The Real Genocide of Nazi Germany</a>\n<a href=\"http://tgsnt.tv/\" target=\"_blank\">The Untold Story of Adolf Hitler</a>\n\nBy the way, you should know by now that I use The Unhived Mind's research quite often, and his comments are well educated opinions but I don't have it in me to link to every single comment that he says as my source for my reasoning that I have extrapolated and with other information from other researchers into my own amalgamation of an opinion.\n\nNow here's a theory that some old timer researchers might remember that is \"The Mysterious Force\", an order made by King Herod Agrippa in AD 43 and you can read it here: <a href=\"http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/masonry1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">INIQUITY UNVEILED: FREEMASONRY &amp; ORDER OF ILLUMINATI</a>.

Every single sect, denomination, and cult has a different answer. Despite supposedly answering that question in the first part of this article, the \"answer\" given by them is not a good enough answer. <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-ride-never-ends/\" target=\"_blank\">The ride never ends!</a>\n\nüå†<strong>Burden of the truth Oct 8, 2015 @ 00:11</strong>\n\nIn many of my rants and the general tone of my website might reflect a stubborn, grumpy, snooty, condescending, pessimistic realism that's almost completely nihilistic, a bit autistic, and a pinch of pathetic pity. I don't know what internal character profile that you see in me when you read my blog, but that's what I see when I read my own stuff. I also see how I can be completely misunderstood, not because of my intentions, not necessarily because of the poor choice of words that I might say, but because of the terrible drama and argumentative nonsense that happens when two researchers with different and possibly conflicting views and mentality clash. Certain levels of \"truths\" can create certain levels of personalities. Certain understandings can lead to certain precautionary actions. Now I am not talking about the typical \"fallacies\" here like ad hominen attacks, I'm talking about things like doublespeak, baiting, constantly dropping loaded questions verses using names holding compressed meaning behind the agenda(s), objective generalizations verses individual relativity, esoteric language, guilt by proxy, neurotypical language verses neurodivergent/atypical language (look it up), self fulfilling prophecy verses conspiracy, guerrilla journalism, answering without answering the question, censorship, eye witness accounts verses empirical evidence, controlled alternative media exposing the controlled decompartmentalization of the lower hierarchy verses not controlled whistle blowers exposing the actual higher hierarchy, attacking the logic/mindset/argument from the being verses attacking the being and the logic/mindset/argument, tree of life (100% good) verses tree of knowledge of good and evil (Hegelian dialect), lesser of two evils verses greater of two goods, eat the meat spit out the bones verses spit meat if bones are present, fabricated testimony (false truths) verses getting a piece of the puzzle but missing the rest (partial truths but not the whole truth), and any combination of any sort of logic, reasoning, and fallacies. \n\nConfusion comes in many ways, many levels, et cetera. I'm a broken record when it comes to these things. What might appear as an \"attack\" can and will be treated as one, even though the attack is towards a way of thinking instead of the ego directly though it might be direct or indirect. As much as you want to lead people to things that matters more, until they let go of their plastic pearls, they can't get the real deal because they don't want the real deal. Even saying these things, I tell you now that every, and any argument that man starts will never end, as long as there is no absolute immovable objective moral truth. Being silent can be foolish in certain situations, while being silent can be a sign of wisdom, which the vow of silence in occult groups is a foolish silence to push a foolish agenda that would cost the fool's life at times if they expose their foolish agendas into the open, yet a fool that speaks out against the foolish society is wiser than a fool that doesn't speak out against it yet comes out of it, for they would let people touch the bear trap instead of not touching it, yet one can argue that people learn things the hard way, but that hard way can be the end of you, but if you just didn't join them to begin with, you didn't need to deal with the problem if you simply did more research, but how can you relatively trust other people concerning secret societies until you become a part of one to begin with, but there are actual empirical evidence proving that they are bad, but how can I tell if that evidence is fabricated and that all of the focus on them is not a diversion from joining them, but they only appear to do good externally while doing bad internally, but they do things in plain sight, but the Freemasons are against the Illuminati (some Freemasons actually claim that), but both the Illuminati and the Freemasons are one and the same, but they are actually infiltrated by the Jews, yet they were preaching gnosticism, the cult of Orion, and other religious beliefs even before Scottish Rite, but they are doing witchcraft rituals, but they are not a part of WICCA, but they are ultimately not the same entity, yet they both are occultists even though they call themselves with different names and labels, but those are just labels, how can you tell as to what they really believe in, but you can tell by reading the bible because the bible is telling the truth, but how can you tell if the bible is translated properly, but it is depending on the translation like a King James Bible, but in Freemasonry, we do have a King James bible, but those footnotes are false doctrines, but the King James Bible was encoded with hidden meanings, but the King James bible is not the best bible as there is the Geneva bible, but the King James bible is over 90 percent the same with the Geneva bible so why does it matter, and so on and so forth.\n\nI can only do what I can, and I find that whether it be in writing or in spoken words, confusion seeps in. Whether in conversation or in writing that has no time or word limit that tries to answer every single question, anything can and will be misunderstood, misinterpreted, even the intention behind both sides as no one can relatively tell if they have bad intentions even if they say that they don't have any. A lecture is not a conversation as there is no exchange of words back and forth as it's usually one sided until after the lecture when it is over as it becomes a FAQ or QnA session which is also not 100% a conversation. Conversations doesn't have time for people to take their time to think, but even if they are oratory masters, beliefs and mindsets also serve as mental blocks which isn't bad in itself, but it can mean that it would take much more to persuade or dissuade people. Using visual and auditory information also has a limit. Emotions and subjective emotions also cause confusion and apathy despite invoking empathy. Besides mental blockages, there are spiritual blockages that fundamentally is for or against other spirits, which the Patriotic Spirit of America for example, is against the Patriotic Spirit of the Father who art in Heaven. I am knowingly wasting my time, yet also know that I am being productive. I deal with seemingly contradictory situations all the time and I get stuck in some contradictions too. I am not perfect yet I am perfect while being perfected at the same time. I am a sheep in wolves clothing yet when people see the sheep in me, they sometimes think that I am a wolf in sheep's clothing and some people that sees my wolves clothing, they think that I am a simple controlled lone sheep without a shepherd. I am a part of a tree, a part of a branch, but the branch is not a part of the tree yet it is now so therefore I am both the tree and the branch but not a part of the branch that was a part of the tree yet that branch is my friend and enemy, depending on what tree it is on, and so it is the same with the branch that I am a part of. I need to be thrown into the fire, so that I won't be thrown into the fire. God ordained some things to happen while other things you had some control over yet God had known the outcome before it even happened. Everything is meaningless, except for the one that gives meaning to all.\n\nüå†<strong>Empirical Science & Biblical Creationism Oct 14, 2015 @ 07:06</strong>\n\nYou have all been lied to, so in order to show you some of the things here, you first need to have a basic understanding concerning the two modes of thinking. One will keep you at a state of mental arrest with a slave mentality that is obedient to their handlers, while another will free you from that mental trap while being able to obtain knowledge through observing God's creativity imprinted in His design within all things in this universe that is to a degree, is made to be knowable as one seeks the truth for themselves.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yy09tyUWrg\" target=\"_blank\">Science, Art and the Economic Crisis</a>\n<a href=\"https://larouchepac.com/classical-renaissance\" target=\"_blank\">LaRouche's Campaign for a Classical Renaissance</a>\n<a href=\"http://science.larouchepac.com/\" target=\"_blank\">science.larouchepac.com</a>\n<a href=\"http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/how-the-dead-souls-of-venice-corrupted-science/\" target=\"_blank\">How the Dead Souls of Venice Corrupted Science</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUwGovJHNts\" target=\"_blank\">The Harvard Yard: Fraud of Modern Education</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjMcbykR9Og\" target=\"_blank\">The History of the German Space Pioneers</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKRG_k4oOes\" target=\"_blank\">The Fusion Torch</a>\n<a href=\"https://larouchepac.com/energy-flux-density\" target=\"_blank\">Energy Flux Density</a>\n\nRemember the information in those links, for some of the information in it falls short, stuff like Einstein being a genius, the Evolution lie, et cetera. There is a form of evolution going on that is the way that humans think as the more one taps into their creative minds to seek after the truth in the universe that God had made, but I believe that there is no such thing as macro evolution, and what scientists are calling micro evolution is actually a loss of genetic information, ergo, micro devolution. They have also never seen \"evolution\" without the proper environment that sustains life that predates it. Life needs its biosphere, but a biosphere comes from God's design. Jason Ross explains some of this here: <a href=\"https://larouchepac.com/20151021/new-paradigm-mankind-leibniz-human-mind-what-means-education-october-21-2015\" target=\"_blank\">New Paradigm for Mankind: Leibniz, the Human Mind &amp; what that means for Education, October 21, 2015</a>.\n\nNow that's out of the way, let me move on to the most fundamental knowledge of the universe by starting off with this: <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/magnetism1small\" target=\"_blank\">Uncovering the missing Secrets of Magnetism</a>. Here is a playlist by someone of an ongoing series by the same author of that book: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnilnjUumFqDMOeh3DVHd7QjZdObXBxxE\" target=\"_blank\">Uncovering the Missing Secrets of Magnetism - Ken Wheeler</a>. You can watch more of his videos concerning the one thing that only manifests itself as an illusion in different ways by its appearance through observation when the aether/counterspace is the only field there is in which things are emanating from \"the source\" as a waste product. It is only in that sense, that context does Emanationism can be understood as field mechanics which other religions had misinterpreted, from WICCA to the Zohar, even mainstream Greek Atomism based Materialistic Physics and the mind virus of General Relativity and Quantum Physics that can't ever define a non quantitative field yet insists on the existence of a field that in description is similar and equal to the aether yet they don't want to admit that they are fundamentally wrong and flawed from its very core, for their descriptions are never the answers. The purest concept of nothing doesn't really exist as we know it in this universe where everything is a \"force\". That being said, space is the absence of inertia, and nature doesn't deal with \"time\" for things to work. God made \"time\" for humans, so time is for humans, not for the laws of nature. Just because we can observe time doesn't mean we can \"quantify\" time nor does time have a \"field\".\n\nIt should go without saying that the information that is \"outsourced\" with links and complex explanations that would take a normal schmuck at least a good hour or two to process and think about the information that they are provided with for every general concept that I throw out, would actually make articles like this to take up a highly disproportionate amount of time relative to the time spent on just reading the words in this article. It should also go without saying that every presenter of the information gets some things right and some things wrong, which any good researcher can shift through the muck to only pull out the rough diamonds, cut the diamonds, and make it into jewelry. I will try to summarize the whole of the information of those links as much as I can without going too much into the detail.\n\nHere is some more links from Eric P. Dollard which Ken L. Wheeler got some inspiration from:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TttHkDRuyZw\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Dollard - History and Theory of Electricity</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJcU7INwnU\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Dollard - Origin of Energy Synthesis</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX63GDRCMSw\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Dollard - The Supernatural Power of Music</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_QadTr8Bls\" target=\"_blank\">What You Are Not Being Told About The Sun!!</a>\n\nWhen people mention the Electric Universe, it's actually the Plasma Universe, just the electrical component is emphasized. The Electric Universe concept is partially true, but electricity is an hybrid of dielectricity and magnetism. Here are a couple of links from Wallace Thornhill whom I think is one of the main leaders behind the \"Electric Universe\":\n\n<a href=\"http://www.holoscience.com/wp/synopsis/\" target=\"_blank\">Synopsis</a> A twelve part synopsis about the Electric Universe.\n<a href=\"http://www.holoscience.com/wp/category/eu-views/\" target=\"_blank\">EU Views</a> The archive of his many articles explaining certain aspects of the Electric Universe in more detail.\n\nI don't agree completely with his promotion of Immanuel Velikovsky's questionable research because Velikovsky believed that the crossing of the Red Sea was actually the crossing of the sea of reeds, implying that the water level was shallow when there are no reeds in the actual location where the Egyptian chariots are found are in a fairly deep level that people can easily drown at such depths. Moses and the Israelites crossed the Gulf of Aqaba, not the Suez Canal, the narrowest part of the Gulf of Suez. Velikovsky is wrong about that, and so shall he be wrong about many other things like the rejection of Genesis 1:14, which then means that God is a liar if the lights above in Genesis 1:14 that is every celestial body besides the sun and the moon, planets are also visible and give off light so they have to be predictable, in which in the videos presented so far, we know that they are in harmonic balance to the sun as the sun keeps them in their place and also that we can easily trace back any celestial alignment in the past precisely of the astronomical data recorded by some ancient societies like the Babylonians and the Chinese. Also, some of the strange celestial anomolies recorded in the bible is also recorded in ancient civilizations. In fact, it is completely possible for someone to know when that light came into the universe, it was April 25th, 4139 BC at the first dawn that the unformed and void earth that only had the water above that is the water that is the shell of the empty universe. Just because Earth had a water vapor canopy, it doesn't mean that is the same as the waters above in the biblical cosmology structure. Planets can in theory had been in different alignments, but until there is concrete evidence that it has deviated from its divinely ordered path, I'll believe in the bible and the existing evidence.\n\nHere is a very skeptical critic called Stephen Crothers that simply breaks down the lies presented concerning the core tenets of mainstream modern science:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXF098w48fo\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Crothers: The Parallax Effect on Short Hair | EU2014</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jINHHXaPrWA\" target=\"_blank\">(Full Length) Stephen J.

I conclude that Kepler's model makes the most sense, within the context of geo-heliocentrism as the earth is fixed while the sun goes around the earth and the rest of the planets goes around the sun. However, Johannes Kepler probably drugged Tycho Brahe with mercury as explained here: <a href=\"http://geocentricity.com/shop/about_tycho.html\" target=\"_blank\">About Tycho Brahe</a> so perhaps his assertion that the sun makes elliptical orbits might had been fabricated for all we know. Kepler of course had not seen proof of the aether moving around the earth, disproving how the earth is not moving around the sun. There can be elliptical orbits in a modified Tychonian model, but it won't suddenly make the sun the center of the universe, only the center of its electromagnetic field covering the nearby planets that goes around the sun explained through the Electric Universe model but the earth being stationary. Despite all of that, Kepler was the first to explain gravity, not the con artist, Sir Issac Newton that had mystified and simplified it while borrowing Leibniz's Calculus. The connection between Kepler and Newton is explained in Pari Spolter's <a href=\"http://parispolter.com/gravitational-force-of-the-sun/\" target=\"_blank\">Gravitational Force of the Sun</a> book. Neither Kepler, nor Newton used \"mass\" to determine gravity. Mass is understood as energy, but it's independent of force.\n\nNow here are some links from Creationists that don't believe in Geocentricity and some other lies which makes them not Biblical Creationists:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Scientific Creation</a>\n<a href=\"http://creationministries.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Creation, Evolution &amp; Science Ministries</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD388804F87108CFD\" target=\"_blank\">Russ Miller Creation Science Seminar Series</a>\n\nI cannot recommend other Copernican Christian Creationists which many of them tend to be friends with unbiblical, false teachers like Kent Hovind and friends, believe in General Relativity like Ken Ham, and any less than that, there are Theistic Evolutionists which include Old Earth Christian Creationists. It is important to note that the so called Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation is fabricated data that was retrieved within the Earth's atmosphere so much of the radiation came from the Earth itself which they simply cut out all such red parts and knit together a fabricated final image that is not based on the real images, so Christian Creationists should stop promoting that and keep on using reliable data instead of that nonsense that can't prove nor disprove anything. There are many things that Christian Creationists, whether biblical or not, don't know about which such information are provided by the Electric Universe proponents. Unfortunately, there isn't much union between these two that I'm aware of.\n\nBiblical Archaeology and Biblical Creationism are related as they both are biblical, but one comes before another. Some aspects of Biblical Creationism is proven by Biblical Archaeology, like how many mass dinosaur burial sites just so happened to be caused by supposed local floods. Biblical Archaeology is a part of Biblical Creationism, but Biblical Creationism is the heart of all things relating to the Holy Bible, for if the very foundation, if the Book of Genesis turns out to be a lie, everything else after it is based on a false premise ergo, Jesus didn't die for our sins, and Jesus didn't exist as described in the New Testament. Ron Wyatt is probably the most famous Archaeologist among Christians that do their research. Michael Rood only confirms Ron Wyatt's testimony, but I think Michael Rood is in error concerning his doctrines. Here is a website concerning his research, but I don't know if there is an legitimate, official website that the Wyatt family is behind: <a href=\"http://www.arkdiscovery.com/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Ark Discovery International</a>. Here is another website that has similar content concerning biblical archaeology: <a href=\"http://www.bible.ca/archeology/\" target=\"_blank\">Biblical Archaeology - Digging up Bible stories</a>. I don't think that Ron Wyatt is wrong about everything and there are things that bible.ca guy doesn't cover which Ron Wyatt does. It's important to note that Ron Wyatt is an SDA so if he ever really gotten his hands of the Ark of the Covenant, it would be under the care of the Freemasonic SDA's and other Satanists behind the scenes. There are lesser known Archaeologists like Barry Fell which some Christians like but his research is not based on things concerning the bible. There is nothing explicitly stated in the bible that the Israelites or even the Phoenicians that had moved to the Americas, therefore it's not biblical, but such people are in the bible.\n\nThere is one Biblical Astronomer called Daniel Gregg whose research I find to be extraordinary as he also uses archaeological data from other ancient societies, can read Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic, and he is in the making his own bible translation. His book: \"The Scroll of Biblical Chronology\", is an unbroken chronology that has all the actual dates of important events recorded in the bible. Here's his website: <a href=\"http://torahtimes.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Torah Times Messianic Ministry</a>. I don't agree with his stance of Arminianism, certain things concerning death and hell, and there are some things that I disagree with in translation, but I think that he is one of the best Christian scholars out there, as he can break down many falsehoods behind famous Messianic and Jewish leaders like Michael Rood, and Nehemia Gordon, Lew White, and many more. He proved that Ellen G. White is a lying prophet while taking the Seventh Day stance. If Chris White and Daniel Gregg were in an internet forum as White defends Sunday worship while Gregg defends sabbath day worship, let's say, in the CARM forums, Daniel Gregg will win. If any of you still have a Facebook account, try to add him as a friend on Facebook, but don't go and attack him without reading his book first.\n\nNow look back again to the first few links in the beginning of the article. What I desire is a truly free Christian society that keeps classical music and art, teaches about Pythagoras, Plato, Kepler, Leibniz, Tesla, Birkeland, Searl, Dollard, Wyatt, Gregg, and even Wheeler concerning the fundamentals of true science, as they continue to do more research on space, hot fusion, and with other things listed in here: <a href=\"http://peswiki.com/main-page\" target=\"_blank\">PESWiki</a> for the purpose of creating a higher platform for all mankind. To be clear, as much as I like Promethean ideals over Zeusian, I am not for either of them. As much as I like Pythagoras and Plato, I don't worship the intelligent design of the universe rather, the Creator of the universe as I enjoy learning about His universe. As much as I like organ music when played right, I don't limit worship to music alone as a means to praise God, neither does that make me a part of the cult of Pythagoras or the Roman Catholic Church or the Lutheran Church or any church with an organ in a church building that taps into the energy of the solar flares and the harmonics of the planets circling around the sun that circles around the earth. As much as I think that the Grand Orient de France Freemason Lyndon LaRouche is mostly right doesn't make me or the information false by association. He isn't willing to accept certain ties that the Venetians, the Jews, the Jesuits, and the English Freemasonry have with the French Freemasons. He is a humanist, but he is a very rational one.\n\nEmpirical evidence uses reductionist logic to come to conclusions based off of presuppositions, but that is not the right way to do science. True science is creative, artistic, innovative, it relies on the mind more than the senses, for the mind of God that dictates the laws of nature is what governs the physical, the physical observation can't formulate the inherent nature of reality, it can only observe it, but that then makes science subjective and relative to interpretation of evidence. Discoveries don't come from looking at logic based off of what we currently know.\n\nFor the time being, if you want to know more about health, click here: Therapueo and also look at my <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/links/\" target=\"_blank\">Links</a> page.\n\nüå†<strong>Former About Page Oct 16, 2015 @ 16:53</strong>\n\nThere are many questions left unanswered in this universe where many simply don't have the time to waste to dig deeper into the nonsense we call the mind to use it to use our senses to make sense of things unseen, untouched, unheard of. That is why I focus on the things that were already searched out by others so what I do is re-searching and presenting them in a manner that I can comprehend and to reflect upon the the things of which I can do now after gathering the re-searched data to make something out of it that I, or others might be able to use to search for something that is truly left unsearched, though that is highly improbable as there is nothing new under the sun as Solomon reminds mankind of through the scriptures in Ecclesiastes 1:9. Therefore, the only sensible re-search that is worth re-searching about is the path that no man, woman, or child can truly deny that is not a path worth walking in, but the predicament that I witness to is that it's so ridiculously easy yet just as hard to show why that this path that I speak of is so, because of the dogma of lies being doctored to professing practicing practitioners who only close the loop of this psychotic yet perpetual cycle of controlled disorder that can only exist because they had gained enough passionate believers of the corrupt faith that is left untested through the senses yet insists upon being completely and purely derived from empirical evidence despite how many people who had seen this proof at hand and had rejected all of the things of which they were told under that institution squaring the circle by the The Worshipful Company of Haberdashers and The Worshipful Company of Mercers of which is a part of the Olympian-Venetian brainwashing propaganda machine who are the Ancients that accepted a Zeusian system with an Aristotelian mindset and a Luciferian faith, serving the Adversary of God as the adversaries of God's people. I don't conjure up these claims by myself, I get them from somewhere like I've said.\n\nOne must learn the truth and unlearn the lies within half truths before listening to your pure conscious that writes the Natural Law within the heart that stores knowledge. To do that, one needs to look at the truth and let it reveal itself to what you need to do so that you have a reference point that of which you can build upon your knowledge on a stable foundation so that you won't lose your mind when something beyond your understanding shows up and knocks down some lies in your house. The truth will lead your self conscious to reject the ego while seeking the pure consciousness working with your self, not rejecting who you really are but rejecting who you really are not. Your pure conscious had always been there but has been inert when you believed in your first lie. This pure conscious is also God's breath of life, the very reason that you are alive. Nature's God is God's nature, His creation which is under His laws, constituted and made just as He said so which we are under this realm under Him who is our Creator. The written truth is the written word of God divinely inspired to be written down as the law, but the unwritten truth is revealed by the Holy Spirit that is your pure conscious. The Ten Commandments to me is simply a part of the Natural Law though it is actually the Royal Law, to love your neighbor as yourself, because God is our one true Sovereign above all sovereigns and principalities. Nature's law is under the Royal Law and the Holy Script is the highest law which everything else is simply using God's laws to get you out of His theo-anarcho-ad-hocratic, \"free from the Public (Libera Res Publica)\" system and into a de facto jurisdiction through your consent into a system where a leader is between you and God. We all are in truth, the children of God through the first Adam who is the son of God, but only through the second Adam, Jesus Christ, are we given a chance to get inside of the kingdom of God on earth as it is in heaven.\n\nThe Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil has no life therein, but in this reality being affected by it, we need to learn why we are in the de facto jurisdiction and compare it with the de jure kingdom of God which the gospel is about that kingdom. In English, the 1560/99 Geneva Bible is preferred over the King James Bible, though it should be used along with an interlinear bible with a Strong's concordance, some knowledge of biblical archaeology and creation science. At last but not least, seek after the weightier matters of the Law: Judgment, Mercy, and Fidelity, simply the desire to seek to understand how the government of God works will compel you to re-search for it in the Holy Script. You also need to know the laws outside of God's kingdom so that you can show to them how God's republic can form within Satan's democracy. They need to know that Jesus of Nazareth is the King of the Jews, which Pontius Pilate under the authority of Emperor Tiberius and the Roman Empire had recognized His Majesty, Jesus Christ, King of the Jews. Jesus died for our sins, was buried for 72 hours, and was resurrected and has ascended into heaven, continuing to minister unto us as our High Priest and King forever and ever. Therefore, everything of which he has said is still the Law of which Christians can choose to serve above all the laws of the nations and merchants, but we seek to be in harmony in the world's governments as long as they don't go against the Royal Law. We also seek to help the world and conquer through real peace, not the false peace that the Antichristos system as exposed by the The Iron Mountain Report and the scriptures.\n\nAlthough I prefer Promethean countries over Zeusian countries, they are still not God's country so they are our competitors. Any real church that is under the authority of any nation or any religion that is not of their own is a controlled church used to sway people into the beast from the land and the beast from the sea. A church without the true authority of being its own system, they have no liberty and power within it, rather, a privilege to practice a religion that is under another government, which all governments are religions while religions are a form of government. From that point onward, it is easier for you to grasp the things of which I am sharing, but don't let that knowledge be in vain when your faith is tested. Know for yourself what is and what is not. I may not be able to cite all of my sources for most of what I cite is from secondary sources, as all things of re-search, primary sources are few and rare, but make it a habit to trace back an article to a primary source then compare the opinions formed from those sources. Don't be pressured to choose people's opinions and learn to be able to form an opinion from a very broad viewpoint to pinpoint the point that matters which sometimes no one else but you are able to find, yet at the same time being able to recognize when you are simply uncertain and be able to admit it. In time, the points that fall you just don't hold onto anymore while the points that is never moved connects to each other, forming the foundation from which you build upon. Once you had gotten enough foundation to build on, that is when your building can be able to connect to other buildings on other foundations from other people similar to you, but be careful to not let them destroy you.\n\nüå†<strong>Modern Immigration Oct 20, 2015 @ 05:05</strong>\n\nOne purpose behind the creation of nations is to keep a bunch of people who are related to each other from being wiped out through any means. The only nation on earth that does this very strictly is the State of Israel. The problem is that they assume power is to be theirs wherever they are, and in order to do just that is to attack the homogeneous culture, race, mentality, and religion, into a heterogeneous culture, mixing of the races, mixing of the mentality, and the mixing of races, while the Jews pull out their Jewish Holocaust Gold Joker card that beats all the other supposed race cards that any race in a heterogeneous society can ever pull out, including a UNO Wild Draw 4 card from someone of an hybrid of multiple races going back many generations within a heterogeneous society like say Hawaii or Brazil, while the host race has no cards to play as they are forced to not have any identity of any sort that is deemed worthy to be protected as the parasitic Jews push this multiculturalism technique for slavery conditioning practiced in Ancient Egypt and Babylon.\n\nHow does this play out with the Muslim immigration happening in first world countries, especially in white nations? It is mostly to destroy the host nation's religion and also race, while the Jews though the B'nai B'rith fund and make this happen in any country of their choosing. I don't think that the Jesuits are completely behind this, for it won't benefit them, neither the Roman Catholic Church. It does however, benefit the Jesuits that are obedient to the British Venetians which by the way are the real \"ISIS\" that changed their names to \"SIS\" <a target=\"_blank\">https://public.isishq.com/public/SitePages/Home.aspx</a>, and it is the British Empire/government that attacked Russian fighter jets because Russia bombed a CIA base that was the Syrian mercenary \"rebels\" that gotten military training in Israel, of which the whole Syrian conflict was agitated by Father Paolo Dall'Oglio SJ (Society of Jesus) in order to overthrow the legitimate government of Syria, while the real Caliphate of ISIL is Erdogan of Turkey, his daughter runs the ISIL hospital network and his son runs the ISIL oil network stealing oil and selling it tax free thus undercutting oil revenues. Syria and Iran are good friends with Russia and the BRICS nations while Turkey and Saudi Arabia are very much controlled by their Venetian puppet masters. The Islamic State is a terrorist proxy for the City of London and Wall Street (New Venice Empire). ISIS is being funded by Qatar, Saudi Arabia (Citibank), U.S./Japan[Shinzo Abe] (Bank of America), U.K. (JPMorgan, Barclays Bank), DVD Nazis (Deutsche Bank). The Worshipful Company of Fuellers are using ISIS as a means to allow both Rockefeller's Exxon Mobil Corp and Queen Elizabeth II's (New Doge of New Venice) British Petroleum to buy barrels of oil 20% cheaper than anyone else in the world which can then be sold for standard prices (similar to how the IMF can still purchase gold bullion at $50 a troy ounce). Ancient Londinium control ISIS through British Intelligence (MI6) who handle the terrorist proxy‚Äôs Caliphate. Another acronym for ISIS stands for Israeli Secret Intelligence Service (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMUlTSmNu0c\" target=\"_blank\">ISIS revealed as ISRAELI SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE</a>), ISIS is Mossad and ISIS controls ISIL.\n\nWhy do I think that the Kalergi Plan is not completely under the Jesuits' control? As the British loving Leo Zagami mentioned in the recent disinfo propaganda that he's in with Zionist Alex Jones, the current state of Roma and Italy is disgusting as the immigrants are violating the \"sanctity\" of the Vatican City, increasing crime rates, graffiti, homeless bums showering in public founts. The SMOM controlled Swiss Army can't do anything concerning keeping these degenerates from coming in. Just because the Vatican created the religion of Islam doesn't mean that they have a good enough control over them when in truth, the Venetians and some Jews had gotten away with doing business with them in history without getting killed, and without being attacked by them. In reality, the Jesuits significantly weakened in the 1800's and after the many schisms and assassinations within the Jesuit order, it is the Venetian controlled, Scottish Rite Freemasonic Jesuits that took over as the traditional, conservative Jesuits that were in favor of keeping any shred of morality that Catholicism as a social engineering system can provide to the world populace has lost the battle ever since the formation of the Second Vatican Council. That, and because the Kalergi Plan benefits only the Jews, was pushed by a Venetian Count that has friends with those in the B'nai B'rith, had two Jewish wives in different times, he was one of the major leaders behind the formation of the EU, and this goes well with the Venetians as they also see themselves as <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-chosen/\" target=\"_blank\">The Chosen</a>.\n\nWhy specifically are white nations being targeted first in the Kalergi Plan? It is simply because white nations have more power and influence than other nations. That being said, many third world asian country immigrants move to better and better places, into countries like South Korea and Japan, and Muslims are also coming into Japan to the point of having Muslim prayer rooms in Japanese airports, since the Japanese people don't really know how to deal with extremists because they don't want to be labeled racist for disapproving their religion and their Arabian race. Why does Muslim immigration matter for Americans? Ever since 9/11 and probably before 9/11, people who were born and raised in America that happened to look dark skinned, have an Arabian or Islamic first and last name, yet are not Muslims become targeted individuals and some had been framed for bomb threats and are sent to jail. Saying all of this, some Christian sects like Evangelical Christianity are considered terrorists by their own government. If you are a state secessionist, you are technically a separatist. If you believe in the same things that Joanne Chesimard AKA Assata Shakur, if you want Black Americans to be with their own kind by having states with the most black population secede and become its own nation that seeks to protect its own culture without having to be poisoned with fluoride in the water (black and hispanic people's IQ are drastically lowered by fluoride compared to white people drinking fluoridated water, see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7BqFtyCRJc\" target=\"_blank\">The Great Culling: Our Water</a>) and to not let the Zionist mainstream media from hiding their truly rich culture and heritage, you are a terrorist.\n\nWhenever there is a wave of people coming into a land, until the dust settles, the people who come in haven't contributed to the host society enough to say that they deserve to be on the land that their ancestors worked on. However, all people are genetically biased towards a group of people that they identify with. We are all racists, even the most mixed race being that you know alive is racist and prefers to be with one race over another, but the only politically correct race that can do just that is the Jews. The third world countries are set up to be as such for now, in immense debt and a lack of infrastructure, which makes people in such places seek a way out, so they migrate to better and better places legally or illegally, it doesn't matter. This in turn would affect places that are known to be multicultural at least outwardly, to have more and more problems as one culture in said multicultural society would gain leverage and ultimately take over. The Muslims don't hide it when they implement Sharia Law, but the Jews take over by taking up the spots in high places in their host government. True Muslims are bound to protect Catholic and Christian churches, so any Muslim that do bombings and such are probably either radical Shi'ite Muslims, or a fake government agency like say Al-CIAda, in which if it is set up, the Zionist media is there to record the propaganda. They want you to dislike immigrants and Muslims in order for you to be predictable and easily labeled as a racist bigot, and they also want you to like them as the good sheeple you are, willing to increase crime rate, destroy your identity, and destroy the gene pool as the more genetically homogeneous a global heterogeneous society becomes, the more susceptible they are to diseases in which no one has an immunity for, unless you are a Venetian-Jew in this dystopian society. The best way to destroy any race is to remove the middle class so that no one can just simply gain power through any means of moral business.\n\nThere are scientific, biological racial and ethnic (more specific, like comparing Scots to Irish) differences that the Zionist controlled mainstream science is rejecting and to the looks of it, such studies are going to continue to be suppressed and less and less people in the future would care about it. There are obvious cultural differences in ideology, their way of thinking, their mentality, their way of using logic, compared to and in contrast to other ethnic cultures regardless of race. Factor in religion, wealth, even \"education\" and maybe then you might realize how stupid you are to think that immigration is a good thing for anyone. There are always risks on both sides, but the host race will never win because of multiculturalism. Biological warfare still goes on among groups of people, but it is all from the rich that orchestrates all the global depopulation programs through many means to reduce the population 50% by 2050 and a further 35% of the remaining survivors by 2100. Because of machines, the rich can live comfortable lives as they require less people alive that would be their slaves for their sadistic entertainment like rape and blood sacrifice. What use is it if everyone were living comfortable lives if there isn't those who suffer beneath them to envy them, to wail for them in tears of admiration as sheep worshiping them as gods. If the rich keeps poor nations poor, they control them as that nation has no control of itself, which doesn't sound like a nation. Those people in such poor cattle farms seek to move to other cattle farms with greener pastures, but if the owner of the said cattle farm with the greener pastures didn't want them in yet were forced to accept these shriveled up chattel...cattle, then both governments don't really own their own cows as the sickly cows infect the healthier cows with Mad Cow disease. Those two farms are in themselves owned by a rich company that more or less threatens them to do as they are told. The sovereignty of nations are not protected in the Venetian-Jewish controlled nations. It seems to me that the BRICS nations are doing just that, which is why there are still some resistance to the New World Order through a New International Economic Order that used the infrastructure ideas that Lyndon LaRouche had been crying out about for all these many decades that is coming into fruition through the BRICS. The rich would want to be on both sides of World War III if it ever comes to a thermonuclear war, or a war fought with a stroke of a pen that promotes national sovereignty while seeking to have huge global infrastructure projects to connect the world together without destroying any nation.\n\nEven though the Kalergi Plan is used as a way to scare Germany and France from aligning to the New Economic International Order so that New Venice would get their oil, the British Empire are already shifting towards the BRICS and towards the Yuanization of the world as the superior global currency. The Vatican also sort of supported the BRICS so that they would still have money should the BRICS system triumphs over New Venice's Zeusian system, but they will continue to smuggle in their ways to control the BRICS. If you want to understand what is going on, follow the money like how Jim Willie is as this interview summarized the situation well: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adsErowi86E\" target=\"_blank\">10.26.2015: Jim Willie update on Financial Collapse and Geopolitical Chess moves</a>.\n\nYou cannot empower anyone with laws, money, or even \"education\", if you don't teach them about righteousness. If your people give any other race the power to take away your people's liberty, if your kind given them more money than you could ever imagine of affording, if you let them teach your own children, both you and the privileged race are crippled in different ways because of you and your kin's ignorance and twisted allegiance to those who only seek to destroy your community through trickery. You might help your neighbor or foreign travelers, but you can't conquer hate with hate, and you do need to protect you and your kind from those who hate you. When justice is in the hands of the unjust, enforced by whoremongering traitors that serves them as soldiers, the police, et cetera, take up your responsibility with patience and of sound mind and help them come out of the matrix (womb) of the Harlot before you act in self defense. Help them to be able to help themselves eventually without your help without enabling them but remember, your family and friends are of higher priority to help. Know your limits and seek God to lead you to work upon your talents as you gain more in maturing. Forgive and give.\n\nIf you still don't get it, see these videos: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjzfGChGlE\" target=\"_blank\">Immigration, World Poverty and Gumballs - NumbersUSA.com</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCvVv8D1kUc\" target=\"_blank\">Is immigration higher now than ever?

The Linux kernel might potentially have binaries in the code that allow Microsoft (NSA) to get in through the Linux kernel that the Linux-libre kernel that tries to remove the proprietary blobs might had failed to fully remove, the BSD kernel might be safer but all BSD distributions are mostly reliant on the Linux community and its contributions for most things concerning BSD are borrowed from Linux so many of the things that makes Linux programs insecure makes BSD also insecure. Bad programming allows bugs to appear which when exploited to breach the security of any system, some bugs therefore can be overlooked backdoors which only those who are in the inner circle might know. The Linux kernel is arguably too big and long for its purpose to be a kernel. Anything more obscure than BSD distributions like AmigaOS, might be better but is lacking in some programs and hardware support. The hardware itself that comes from Intel, Nvidia, and AMD has backdoors built into it. There are some computers that are not using x86 or x64 architecture for their microprocessors like ARM devices, but they are not that advanced yet enough to compete with Intel, Nvidia, and AMD. The only people who are making significant changes is Russia and China as they are seeking to make homemade technologies based on open source (whether they would keep it open source or proprietary is uncertain) to not have the western countries sabotage their tech, their airplanes, their weapons, their phones, their servers. If you currently use a smartphone, try to switch to Jolla once it's available wherever you are, or you could go back to using a dumb brick cellular phone. A Linux system is safer than Windows and Mac, but some things that you had taken for granted won't work as it had before as you look for alternatives to replace them. Never forget that Nils Torvalds asked his son, Linus Torvalds if he was approached by NSA about backdoors and Linus said no but he nodded his head at the same time.\n\nHere's a good resource for the basics concerning what one should strive to do when online: <a href=\"https://paranoidsbible.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Paranoid's Bible: An anti-dox effort.</a>\n\nHere's a thread covering most things about Windows: <a href=\"http://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/building-your-own-privacy-package.366847/\" target=\"_blank\">Building Your Own Privacy Package</a>\n\nHere's a old Linux guide that is somewhat still relevant: <a href=\"http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=24722\" target=\"_blank\">The paranoid #!

Stallman's talks and interviews, Jay Miner's prophetic prediction of the future, Jacob Applebaum's talks in DEFCON, Jim Stone's website and many others.

The groups that are saying \"nay\" to them are former marijuana drug addicts, religious people, and various governments all around the world except for Portugal which legalized everything to a certain limit that keeps people from making profits off of it though I am not completely up to date with all that is happening in Portugal. Those who say \"yea\" are people cured from their diseases through the use of marijuana, different religious people, and anyone who has read all the facts from both sides. What is clear however, is that keeping certain things \"illegal\" makes it much more profitable than when it is \"legal\". The Nazi CIA makes profits off of these things, and if you asked me, the real \"gateway drug\" is a lack of real education against the pseudoscience of psychiatry and a certain mindset that wants to die and their instincts against death are weakened or nonexistent. The psychological rush of doing something anti-government is more addicting than the very heroin that they inject themselves with, but they don't instinctively know that although some of the hardcore addicts do know that at least in their minds as knowledge. People who are addicted to religious hypnotic mind programming are just as addicted to letting go of reality as someone addicted to drugs. The real drug is all the poisons that you take as Agent Orange derivative biochemical toxin laced, Agent Orange resistant GMO bacterial frankenfood that blocks communication or over excites the neurons that also changes the DNA by the excessive genetically modified mRNA that is plentiful in GMOs which your body uses as building block for its own DNA as the cell mutates into cancer or dies from programmed cell death which then creates a breeding ground for bad bacterial strains, viruses, parasites to flourish from which then in turn makes it even more likely to cause diseases and more cancerous tumors to developing.\n\nHemp and marijuana are related to each other, marijuana is once called hemp, but hemp have a very low level of THC than marijuana yet have more CBD within so there COULD had been a widespread use of hemp but no, it is simply grouped as an evil drug. You can't get high off of an normal hemp oil extract but you can from BHO or Butane Hash Oil which is designed to specifically extract THC. Synthetic marijuana that mimics certain drug qualities of marijuana sprayed onto some herbs is an unhealthy, unnatural, street drug for unholistic, recreational use that has more devastating effects than one of God's miracle herbs, the humble marijuana plant. There are some strains of marijuana hybrids (not the same as GMOs since their DNA was not tampered in a lab) that has a higher THC content and is harder to kick the habit. Another reason why normal marijuana is possibly dangerous is because of how people deceive themselves into thinking that it's not a bad drug so they keep on using marijuana, a simple circular reasoning loop. The safest form of marijuana is of course the CBD oil extract which can heal brain and nerve related diseases and among other various cancer fighting effects, but like anything, cancer needs to be tackled in all directions from your diet, exercise, stress management, psychological care without going to the shrink, taking other powerful holistic medicine, keeping the frame straightened out, and so on. There are obviously situations that won't solve the causation of a disease through the use of CBD oil so keep that in mind.\n\nHemp is superior to extracting CBD oil and also 10,000 other usages, which in old Materia Medica books both eastern and western, it had been recognized as a medicinal herb even in 1800's America. The more THC potent strains of Cannabis sativa should be discouraged but not made illegal, as well as Cannabis indica, both should be used by real medicinal professionals that isn't controlled by Big Pharma that can't make any profits off of nature because they can't patent nature due to nature being in a separate jurisdiction concerning Natural Law. They can however patent every chemical within anything. If CBD oil is so bad, they would have to ban sea urchins, human breast milk, your own mind, and other naturally formed sources of Cannabinoids which Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of at least 85 active cannabinoids identified in cannabis. One problem concerning \"legalizing\" marijuana is that it's considered a drug, hemp is also considered a drug, and by the jurisdiction of whatever, recognizes it as a drug that is legalized within certain parameters and jurisdictions of course which then breaking those rules would make it illegal. If there is an actual GMO strain of marijuana being released, that is probably when it is legalized, but I would say that even synthetic CBD oil from GMO marijuana, although in its weak, contaminated form, will be banned in due time if these psychos get what they wanted but for now it's considered food by the FDA and by most other nations, completely legal to get CBD oil. Get it while you can. Don't get GMO marijuana though, and avoid the potent strains.\n\nThis is as silly as claiming dandelions as a dangerous drug. Dandelions have components that cures cancer and among other benefits, it's almost everywhere, and yet people hate it because of how ugly it looks on their lawns. The hatred against dandelions spawned terrible companies dedicated to killing them yet they are always unsuccessful in doing so and that herbicide is being used in all industrialized crops of sold out farmers that are completely dependent on Monsanto and DuPont to provide them more GMO seeds since they can't make any since all GMO plants don't make any reusable seeds while losing yield and spending more money in maintenance for a deliberately broken system that would eventually make the soil unusable and without any nutrition, which is how farmers are disappearing. My point is that there is some measure of profit being squeezed out of it at the expense of the people's health being done through legalizing marijuana when the bigger problem is the big companies pulling the strings of the politicians through lobbying and putting their people into power, which at a higher level, is to fulfill the Club of Rome Zero Growth Depopulation agenda and also the Georgia Guidestones, which is in line with the Kalergi Plan which is in line with the Talmud and Zohar, which it is the Jews and the Venetians in a joint alliance that created Freemasonry that promotes such genocidal plans of world domination through deception by keeping the people ignorant and attacked when they question the status quo.\n\nWhat then is higher reason why bad things happen? It is not the evil people, but the people who let evil do its deeds. The blame is all upon yourselves for being willfully ignorant and willfully playing along with it all by doing nothing concerning it as you hold onto your various idols from drugs, to religion, to sports, to sexual perversions, to anything besides the weightier matters of the law: Judgment, Mercy, Fidelity which your attempts of giving Hope, Faith, and Charity through government agents that made a contract with the government to let it also \"legalize\" its religion thus having absolutely no authority of its own but of the state sanctioned religion unequally yoked to other state sanctioned religions that pleas to the God of the state that is not the same God as your God(s) of whatever religion you adhere to. Think about it this way, this is the same as Jacob giving Esau a bowl of soup for a birthright. You give away the sovereignty of God's kingdom by simply pretending to be an ambassador of Jesus Christ's kingdom when in truth, you are a state agent of a foreign kingdom that isn't of Christ's, and if you are a church member, you are in the jurisdiction of the state which demands you to submit to all of its precepts over the precepts being taught by your religion.\n\nWe are going into the realm of legalese. All of God's people congregate in free will assemblies, NOT because they have a membership. Salvation is not given by those who decides to become a member of a church. If it was that easy, even Satanists and evil rich people (as opposed to rich people that doesn't love money) would be going to heaven as long as they have a church membership. All Christians have the hardest of time comprehending these things within the context of the world's laws simply because we are made to be ignorant about such laws. Go look up words that you think sounds legal and biblical, because the more you do that, the more you would question as to which words are in God's jurisdiction or in Satan's jurisdiction. Any religion that is bound to the laws of the land that which it is in, then there is no separation of church and state. The people should be the state, the state should be the family system, and it is a family system, either naturally or by adoption. The people of Israel were running an adhocratic freed republic state that also has an orderly religious system that worked in free will and genuine love for one another in free will offerings. The free will religion and the priests have no jurisdiction over the state, they are the servants and can't intervene in matters of things that only the state can do. Israel was divided into twelve states of the twelve tribes excluding Levites, counting the tribe of Joseph as the half tribe of Manasseh and the half tribe of Ephraim as two separate tribes which makes twelve tribes in total.\n\nThere's much more things that can be covered concerning that topic alone, but my point is that people shouldn't hate the biblical concept of the state nor the biblical concept of church and the biblical concept of the separation of church and state, but any deviation from the biblical standard always created chaos as prophetic warnings came about as the people labored to set up a broken system, so would its devastating effects would manifest in due time. The Kingdom of God on earth is at the hands of the ministerial servants of God which the care of the people is done through them as they work as the trustees of Jesus Christ's trust concerning the heavenly duties that needs to be done on earth, for our God is not the god of the dead. If everything is in its proper order, there would be no such ridiculous laws that bans marijuana, and even if such bad laws come to existence, it would be later taken down by good, righteous people who didn't idly let things happen, and approached the situation correctly. To rebel against God's design will have dire consequences. Righteous people govern themselves or else they won't have any rights from themselves to govern themselves. If one smokes marijuana unrighteously, they should stop smoking.\n\nüå†<strong>There is no perfect bible Nov 23, 2015 @ 05:42</strong>\n\nThe various debates concerning what translation is the perfect translation is probably one of the biggest waste of time and energy that goes against the very book that they're trying to defend. People within Christology insists upon the maximum requirement that is in line with their tradition and their doctrines, so no matter what bible one uses, the people who has to say about it is quite often more influential than the bible when it comes to changing mindsets through reading the bible. People within Christology makes meaningless creeds to define the minimum requirement that is in line with their tradition and their doctrines, but it is at the same time, is void and empty of its meaning when looked at by the initiated. Why is that? It is because Christology no longer understands laws, and no longer have the Holy Spirit as they push meaningless doctrines like insisting that the Holy Spirit should be called the Holy Ghost if it was after the Shavuot/Pentecost of Anno Mundi 4173/Anno Domini 34 in Acts chapter 2. The simplest definition of a Christian is only understood by someone if they have the Holy Spirit within, convicting them. The absolute minimum information that someone needs to accept before being saved varies from one another, but nevertheless, it's there. No one is wrong or right when they simply don't understand, so there is a need for a generic, generalized definition, as well as a legal definition to determine the minimal requirement of what defines a church to be a church. What the general populace and the law books say about Christology is different than what Christology thinks of itself, which is also different from what Christianity thinks of Christology and Christianity.\n\nGod's grace and mercy for people today is the whole bible, but there is a catch that few ever talks about. All bible versions after the Authorized 1611 King James Bible Pure Cambridge Edition are worse than the Authorized 1611 King James Bible Pure Cambridge Edition. The 1611 KJAV is based off of the Catholic Douay-Rheims and the Protestant 1560/99 Geneva bible. Some of the Reformers were controlled by Freemasonry, the Venetians, the Venetian controlled Templar Knights continuum, and the Jews, while the counter reformation was controlled by the Venetian controlled Roman Catholic Church, and the Venetian and Jewish controlled Jesuit Order. The ruling class of the Venetians were part Jews and descendants from the Roman Aristocratic Oligarchical families had enough with the Vatican as they set up a schism away from their grasp by using their Lollards who were \"The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon\" that took over the underground Antioch line of Christology that uses the Textus Receptus. The Masoretes that contributed to the Old Testament being used in the Geneva and King James were Pharisees and so had their bias within the Old Testament. Both the Antioch line and the Alexandria line of bible translations have biases, therefore, both needs to be used by an expert translator. The Aramaic bible is translated from the greek, therefore it is not older, neither better than the Septuagint nor the Textus Receptus. Many gnostic books are dated after all the original apostles died. The post apostolic church understood certain precepts of what were taught by the original apostles, they were already being changed even with Justin Martyr (though some things I agree with Justin Martyr) but increasingly gotten worse until Rome gained full control over Christology. An Hebrew translation of the Tanak has vowel points added into it when Hebrew should be understood as pictograms with different meanings when using different vowel points but originally the Tanak has no vowel points added into it, it is the Babylonian Pharisaical scribes who added it in. Modern Babylonian Hebrew is derived from the Phoenician alphabet script but in the Paleo-Hebrew language which no one knows how they talked as people falsely assumed that they used the Aramaic pronunciation when there is no definite proof whatsoever.\n\nChristology existed ever since Satan heard the first prophecy from God in the garden, for Christology is Satan's rebuttal and his deliberate confusion to make Christianity be misunderstood. Once God promised a savior of mankind to crush Satan, Satan did everything in his power to prevent His coming, but he failed. Satan did everything in his power to corrupt Jesus from doing what he came on earth to do, but he failed. Satan did everything in his power to corrupt the minds of the people from knowing the truth through his various religions, nation states, and evil rulers, but he failed to deceive everyone all the time. Satan deceived some of the people all of the time, all of the people some of the time, but he failed to deceive all of the people all of the time. If you look at how Jesus did evangelism, he said what was needed to be said to every single man and woman he talked to as some \"repented\" (or what could also be translated as converted) of their ways to the Way that Jesus taught them, while some didn't and a few were prophesied by Jesus that they would be in spiritual Gehenna or the eternal lake of fire as they already were living in a metaphorical Gehenna through their deeds (I think it is important to distinguish between the literal/physical valley of Gehenna, the literal/spiritual/metaphysical lake of fire, and the spiritual/metaphorical/allegorical/lawful concept of the physical valley of Gehenna or the metaphysical lake of fire).\n\nWhen one looks at religion in the context of a nation's law and compare it with of what that religion says about itself, and also compare with what people in that religion says about its religion is quite often different from each other. People don't really need to rely on what others say about a religion if that religion has recorded what it stands for in a format accessible to anyone who seeks the truth. The problem is that many things within say Christology takes from Christianity, but it is misinterpreted. The problem is also that many things within the law books and legal codes of a nation is taken out of context because people don't use a legal dictionary to study every single word as to what it means. To assume that the common, modern language retains 100% the same meaning as the old language that its definitions are used for laws is to forget the nature of laws is that it always looks back into the past but never the present nor the future. To understand old translations in depth like say the King James bible, one might consider reading the Magna Carta, the 1828 Noah Webster's dictionary, a newer version of Black's Law dictionary, Strong's Exhaustive Concordance and Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon. Does everyone have to do that in order to be a Christian? Of course not, but it will help an aspiring minister of God to understand the distinction between God's definition of His own church, the state's definition of a church either registered or not under the state, the state as how God defines it, and the state as how the state defines itself. The very least a minister needs to be 100% clear about is to know that difference within their own heart, not as head knowledge.\n\nNow this is where I would lose some of you. There are some reasons why I promote the use of the 1560/99 Geneva bible, but it's not for the same reasons that King James Only people have. Although I do think that the Geneva bible is superior concerning its wording in comparison to the King James bible, I know that the Geneva bible isn't used in masonic temples so I am in a position that can explain the whole drama behind the Worshipful Company of Mercers Sir John Dee the Enochian black magician controlled Freemasonic King James VI/I. As Wikipedia states, The Worshipful Company of Mercers is the premier Livery Company of the City of London and ranks first in the order of precedence of the Companies. It is the first of the so-called 'Great Twelve City Livery Companies'. That means Sir John Dee was not only controlled that Livery Company, he also controlled all of English Freemasonry and everyone in it, from Sir Francis Bacon and of course, King James, son of the Catholic Queen \"Bloody\" Mary I. People don't quite understand that there were various schisms that were cooperating with each other in this time. The Venetians, Knights Templar and the Jews were behind the reformation while the Venetians by proxy through the Jesuit Order and Catholicism and Freemasonry which the Jews were also behind, were the counter reformation. Freemasonry, Rosicrucians, the Jesuit Order, the SMOM knights, they were against the Lollards who were mostly Templar Knights and some Saint John Hospitallers. Templarism was against itself while in the higher levels, the Venetians and in a lesser extent, the Jews were behind both.\n\nThe lesser of two evils were of course everyone in the Reformation side. The major mover in England for the reformation was the Sephardi Jew descendant, John Knox whom tried to establish a Protestant monarchy through Queen Elizabeth I. Although Sir John Dee was partially working for Queen Elizabeth, he wasn't fully devoted on making England a Protestant nation. If anything, he used the Venetian controlled Catholic Rosicrucian Freemasonic Sir Francis Bacon to remove certain words and making it Latinized. In other words, treating the Holy Bible as a book of spells, Sir John Dee removed much of its power and replacing it with poison. One of the most important things to get rid of was the footnotes of the Geneva Bible and also squeeze in the Apocryphal books that the people behind the 1599 Geneva bible had removed. All words spells things out, a string of words creates a sentence that invokes a thought, a concept. To make English harder to read in a illiterate society was to throw in Latin sounding words that the people didn't commonly used except in Roman Catholic Churches. In the standpoint of Satan's minions, they would want to corrupt the Holy Bible from being understood, and one way to ensure that people would use an inferior bible is to make it mandatory for the Church of England to use that bible by chaining it to the church wall, bound by the divine right of kings that is not directly questioned in the King James bible because there are no footnotes speaking against that and the papacy. Even when someone reads 1 Samuel, many King James Only people would misunderstand what Samuel done as they also see King James as a righteous Protestant king that is not a sodomite nor a part of an Catholic conspiracy to destroy Protestantism.\n\nSome people say that Protestantism brought forth people like Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Francis Bacon, but nothing is further from the truth. The true scientific method was promoted by people like Da Vinci, Leibinz, Kepler, Gauss, Riemann, Vernandsky, Dirichlet, and Tesla while people like Zorzi, Sarpi, Conti, Ortes, Galileo, Newton, Voltaire, Bacon, Descartes, Malthus, Darwin, Einstein, and many more pharisees of academia suppressed certain concepts of the nature of how new concepts are formed and how that can be applied to other things like economics. The false scientific method is an over analytical, arcane method of deduction that looks at the past instead of how things would and could become in the future. Protestantism might had influenced a new wave of scientific enlightenment but it was not the intention of the Venetians seeing as how the Templar Knights pretty much integrated with the SMOM knights and became a part of the Venetian power structure and how many of the English Protestant leaders were Venetian agents. One important subject that mustn't be forgotten concerning all of this is how Edward de Vere or his son could had been the King of England and he is the true \"Shakespeare\", not Bacon, not William Shakespeare. His assassination was the beginning of the end of English Protestant Reformation. To imagine a world of what could had been is to somewhat understand the politics of that time and its potential reverberation into the future. Leaders that promote a system that encourages good even if it's not entirely good is better than going backwards into the past of Aristotelian science that was promoted through the Roman Catholic Church. Perhaps John Knox's goal of eventually dissolving the monarchy and setting up a true Christian theocratic republic state could had seen the light if the bastard son of Elizabeth I, Edward de Vere took his rightful throne.\n\nI am not saying that the reformation was completely good since it promoted a Protestant monarchy when there should be a Protestant republic without a monarchy, but from it came forth liberty outside of the Aristocratic dark ages of science, politics, and religion, though it was short lived once Catholic colonies and lawyers came in to destroy the Puritans and their favorite book, the Geneva bible, the true bible of the reformation. The ugly truth is that the Puritans themselves came to the new world as a British colony, and that ugly truth still stands. Some of the information here I've somewhat covered in previous articles like <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/empirical-science-biblical-creationism/\" target=\"_blank\">Empirical Science &amp; Biblical Creationism</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-chosen/\" target=\"_blank\">The Chosen</a>, some of it is in the <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/links/\" target=\"_blank\">Links</a> page. The James I: The Fool As King book by Otto J. Scott should be read in the context of The Grand Design Exposed book by John Daniel, which should be read in the context of the Against Oligarchy book by Webster Tarpley. Complimentary sources are anything written by Eustace Mullins, some articles by The Unhived Mind like <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/UHM/the-aragon-templars-and-the-rothschild-alliance/\" target=\"_blank\">THE ARAGON TEMPLARS AND THE ROTHSCHILD ALLIANCE</a>. The truth is meant to be understood and also practiced. If you know for example that killing innocent people is wrong yet if you kill yourself, you don't understand that killing innocent people is wrong. Don't let anyone intimidate you in fear that the truth can't be understood nor done.\n\nüå†<strong>What is Thanksgiving? Nov 25, 2015 @ 03:54</strong>\n\nThanksgiving Day means different things in different countries, and some countries don't have a Thanksgiving Day equivalent in their culture or in their state holidays. In these modern times, Thanksgiving Day is Black Friday's Eve while the next day is Second Christmas. Black Friday is Consumerism: The Holiday, while Cyber Monday is Consumerism 2: The Hipster Dad's Revenge. A rule of thumb to abide by is to never buy anything normally expensive during the holiday season. Those bargains are nonexistent, is always made at the expense of companies and countries that are exploited, and is simply reinforcing a lie of cultural superiority in \"first world\" countries when \"second world\" countries, especially BRICS nations are doing better than the \"first world\" countries because at least they are slowly moving to a form of currency backed up by gold while the Chinese Yuan is taking over the Petrodollar as the Petroyuan, which just in case WW3 breaks out, the British Empire are pretending to be friends with China while the rest of the Five Eyes Network and any country that the Jesuits have control in are going to deal with a crash unless they join the BRICS and establish a New International Economic Order, but of course New Venice won't give up her New World Order without a fight.\n\nThe true origin of the first thanksgiving is taught by Justin Martyr and the post apostolic church's view of communion to be something done usually on sundays after resting during the sabbath, feeding the poor with the charity that people gathered while remembering what Jesus had done by carrying out the ritual of communion in the manner that Jesus had done. The concept of charity is tied into communion as the people who eat the food that came from the generosity of others thanked God for providing them another meal. I never said that this is the biblical origin of the first communion, nor did I say that the passover feast is communion. It isn't even the first biblical thanksgiving feast recorded in the New Testament. Paul's concept of communion could possibly be the same as Justin Martyr's concept of communion, assuming the post apostolic church didn't get drunk and party like the apostolic church was until Paul rebuked such fleshly actions. The Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant form of communion has downgraded, taking Paul's rebuke to another level of starving the flesh by starving their bodies in order to remember what Jesus had done yet their charity is done in vain because it is done under submission to the authority of a foreign state or nation to get tax exempt status.\n\nI don't think that the post apostolic church were doing what the apostolic church were doing, for by then, they no longer understood the concept of \"sabbaton\" in the Jewish mind <a href=\"http://torahtimes.org/articles/shavuot_01.html\" target=\"_blank\">In The Day After The Sabbath: How to count to Shavuot, Practical Matters</a> so they falsely calculated the \"Lord's Day\" to be on a sunday (which it isn't, see this <a href=\"http://www.torahtimes.org/images/sabbath_resurrection_02.png\" target=\"_blank\">diagram</a>) yet hypocritically accepted the Rabbinical concept of not doing work during the sabbath which the Levites obviously worked during the sabbath and in the Jewish holidays and Jesus Christ healed people for free, in agape/charity, not for profit so I don't think the apostles were all too dogmatic concerning sabbath observation but instead were dogmatic about having a biblical work ethic that contributes to the kingdom of God and that only those who work deserves any form of rest. I don't simply assume that the practices of the post apostolic church is identical with the apostolic church, though I think it was similar.\n\nThe next possible origin of Thanksgiving Day is a theory from some black revisionists, but don't take my words for it, go read it for yourself: <a href=\"https://pacingforward.com/2010/11/25/the-truth-behind-thanksgiving/\" target=\"_blank\">The TRUTH behind Thanksgiving</a><blockquote>The TRUTH behind Thanksgiving\n\nBy Elimu Milele on November 25, 2010\t‚Ä¢ ( 7 )\n\nTo me, thanksgiving is a holiday that I celebrate things that I‚Äôm thankful for and spend time with family and loved ones. However, I submit in entirety the truth behind Thanksgiving. This was presented to me by a very wise person whose name is credited at the end.\n\nPeace &amp; Greetings,\n\nFor those who will read and listen, I submit truth about ‚ÄúThanksgiving‚Äù. For those\nwho will not, so mote it be:\n\nContrary to the lies we were told while in the public ‚Äúfool‚Äù system, the turkey bird had nothing to do with the origin of Thanksgiving and an alleged friendship with the Wampanoag Indians and the Pilgrims. They didn‚Äôt tell us this in school, but the day after the original Thanksgiving (October 19-21, 1621), the Pilgrims killed all 91 Wampanoag Indians who had anything to do with the original Thanksgiving.\n\nAfter the arrival of the Moors, life would never be the same again in Europe. Spain became sophisticated by beautiful and stunning Moorish architecture. Beautifully designed mosques, libraries, and schools sprang up in Moorish cities. Education was offered to all citizens, including women, who were denied education in Europe during this time. Moorish Spain became the light of Europe, which was engulfed in ‚Äúthe Dark Ages.‚Äù The standard of living far exceeded that of the Europeans, who were jealous and envious of the Moors‚Äô accomplishments in Spain. The Christian Spaniards fought hard to rid Europe of their benevolent Muslim conquerors. There were eventually many bloody Muslim-Christian battles.\n\nIn the year 1491, the Moors surrendered the city of Granada, their last stronghold. On November 25, 1491, the Moors signed the ‚ÄúAct of Capitulation‚Äù after which Spain‚Äôs King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella took possession of the city. The Spanish Christians were THANK-ful for the Moors GIVING (Thanks-Giving) up Granada, ending Islamic rule in the country. This was a merry and festive day in the eyes of the Europeans and would henceforth be a day of THANKS.\n\nThe defeat of the Moors brought 3 options: (1) Replace their Islamic and Asiatic customs with European customs and Christianity, (2) Be expelled from Spain, (3) Face execution!\n\nAfter the expulsion of the Moors, Cardinal Ximenes (backed by Pope Alexander VI of Rome and Queen Isabella) ordered the destruction of the beautiful and stunning Moorish libraries and mosques. Many Moors were driven into West Africa and were later captured and sold into America as slaves. Some of these slaves came on the slave ships of Christopher Columbus (a Spanish Jew) who was commissioned by Queen Isabella on his voyage to the ‚ÄúNew World.‚Äù Many other Moors sought refuge in the country of Anatolia. These expelled Muslims [Moors] from Spain would later be called ‚ÄúTurks,‚Äù (as in Turkish Moors) and the country would later be renamed ‚ÄúTurkey‚Äù (by Europeans).\n\nAfter the expulsion of the Moors, Europeans began to annually celebrate November 25th. There would be great feasts all over Spain and Europe. Turkey bird (which is a crossbreed between the genetically engineered chicken and buzzard or ospray forbidden in Leviticus 11:13) was not the main meat dish served, but a fat roasted pig with an apple in its mouth (representing or symbolizing rebirth or a new beginning). Europeans ate so much on this feast day that virtually nobody could work the next day (which explains why in modern times many corporate jobs give their employees the day after Thanksgiving off!).\n\nYears later, Europeans would begin to take revenge on the Moors, now called ‚ÄúTurks,‚Äù because of the sexual relations the Moors held with white Christian Spaniard women. The black men [Moors] were\nmockingly called ‚ÄúTurkeys,‚Äù and were called this by European men because of their alleged wild and uncivilized nature. European Christians would now go on a ‚ÄúTurkey shoot‚Äù or ‚ÄúTurkey hunt.‚Äù The hunting of the stern Kharijite Moor from Turkey (Anatolia) became an act highly regarded by Europeans at the time. In the process of the ‚Äúturkeyshoot‚Äù Europeans would engage in the wholesale slaughter of the black-skinned Turkish Moors. Innocent Moors would be hunted down cold-blooded by European Christians. Many others would be captured, tied by their wrists and ankles with rope and roasted ALIVE (just like you roast that turkey bird in the oven for Thanksgiving dinner).\n\nThe Moors that were not roasted alive would be laid on the ground and a European male would take a knife and literally CARVE up the Turk (which is what many people are re-enacting when they carve the turkey bird on Thanksgiving). This bloodied, carved up Turk (black man) would then have his internal organs removed and then would be stuffed with certain fabric material (the sick origin of stuffing the turkey bird with bread stuffing or dressing). The Moorish woman was literally carved and cut apart the way meat-eaters and butchers today cut up a chicken. Many a European man would say, ‚Äúgive me a breast!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a thigh!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI want a leg,‚Äù just like meat-eaters do today when they are ordering fried chicken. Breasts, thighs, legs, are all female sexual-related and connotated body parts, as women are sized up and critiqued by the size of their breasts, thickness of their thighs etc. Feminist meat-eaters should think about the sexual politics of meat the next time they brutally bite into a piece of chicken (or any animal commonly eaten today for that matter, as all eaten meats are female).\n\nAfter this violent and brutal act supra, European men would then engage in joyous merry-making which would culminate with a great big feast. This is what you call THANKSGIVING and eagerly celebrate every year under the false notion that you are celebrating the friendly act and feast between Native Americans (so-called Indians) and European settlers called Pilgrims.\n\nAnd in regards to African-Americans (many of which are descendants or ascendants of the great Moors) out of ignorance we have celebrated Thanksgiving and feast the same way the Europeans did, after they conquered the Moors on November 25, 1491. And in this, we celebrate\nthe loss of our own land, the rape of our own women, the murder of our own children, the humiliation of our own forefathers, the fall of a black empire, the enslavement of our own people. Yes, you celebrate this dark and shameful day of our own people and call it ‚ÄúThanksgiving‚Äù.\n\nHetepu,\n\nBro. Dexter Harper\n(Sharma Men Ra)\n\n‚ÄúThe presence of a female in the community is the symbol of continuity of life in that community, and on the contrary, her absence is the symbol of its end. The feminine is life (God) in and around us.‚Äù\n\nKongo (Afrikan) Proverb</blockquote>\n\nAs symbols and concepts are hidden, so could this be an esoteric interpretation of what happened, but the claim that Thanksgiving Day being only about the Puritans falls flat because there were earlier Catholic versions of such a feast in history that predates the Puritans and even indirectly influenced the Puritan Thanksgiving story. <a href=\"http://taylormarshall.com/2010/11/catholic-origins-of-thanksgiving.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Catholic Origins of Thanksgiving!</a><blockquote>The Catholic Origins of Thanksgiving!\nby Dr Taylor Marshall\n\nThe history books will tell you that the first Thanksgiving was celebrated by the pilgrims in 1621. Not true.\n\nAn interesting bit of trivia is that the first American Thanksgiving was actually celebrated on September 8, 1565 in St. Augustine, Florida. The Native Americans and Spanish settlers held a feast and the Holy Mass was offered.\n\nThe Catholic origins of Thanksgiving don‚Äôt stop there. Squanto, the beloved hero of Thanksgiving, was the Native American man who mediated between the Puritan Pilgrims and the Native Americans. Squanto had been enslaved by the English but he was freed by Spanish Franciscans. Squanto thus received baptism and became a Catholic. So it was a baptized Catholic Native American who orchestrated what became known as Thanksgiving.\n\nAll that being said, Thanksgiving is traditionally Protestant and marks the tradition of religious toleration (something in which the Puritan pilgrims did not actually believe ‚Äì they set up a ‚Äútheocracy‚Äù).\n\nMy wife once taught at a high-church Episcopalian/Anglican classical school in Philadelphia. The school consciously played down the significance of Thanksgiving. Why? The reason is simple. At root, Thanksgiving commemorates the good fortune of political and ecclesiastical rebels against the Church of England and the Anglican tradition as a whole.\n\nIt all started with Richard Clyfton who was a Church of England parson in Nottinghamshire in the early 1600s. Clifton sympathized with the Separatists of that era. Separatists were Calvinistic non-conformists to the doctrine and liturgy of the Church of England. The Hampton Court Conference held by King James I (1604) condemned those who would not conform to the more outwardly Catholic usages in the Church of England (e.g. robes, candles, bowing the head at the name of Christ, processions). The result was that Richard Clyfton was ‚Äúdefrocked‚Äù and stripped of his clerical status in the Church of England. Shortly thereafter Richard Clyfton went to Amsterdam and was followed by his disciples: the Pilgrims.\n\nThese Pilgrims moved around a bit until finally coming to America in 1620. An interesting bit of trivia is that one child was born on board the Mayflower while at sea. The child was given the rather lame name: ‚ÄúOceanus‚Äù. Poor child.\n\nIn 1621, the Pilgrims allegedly celebrated a happy meal with the Native Americans and the rest is history. So why would an Anglican school be against Thanksgiving? It celebrates those who defied the Church of England and the Crown of England.\n\nNow that I‚Äôm no longer an Anglican and now a Catholic, things are a bit different. The penal laws of England regarding non-conformists affected not only the rigorous Calvinistic Puritans in England, but also the English Catholic recusants. The Pilgrims shared the same lot as the Catholic faithful of England. Interestingly enough, the Catholics who lived in Nottinghamshire where the Pilgrims originated were persecuted mercilessly.\n\nSo while Thanksgiving may celebrate the Calvinist Separatists who fled England, Catholics might remember the same unjust laws that granted the crown of martyrdom to Thomas More, John Fisher, Edmund Campion, et al. are the same injustices that led the Pilgrims to Plymouth.\n\nAnother bit of trivia is that the truly ‚ÄúFirst Thanksgiving‚Äù celebration occurred on American soil on April 30, 1598 in Texas when Don Juan de O√±ate declared a day of Thanksgiving to be commemorated by the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.\n\nAnd let everyone remember that ‚ÄúThanksgiving‚Äù in Greek is Eucharistia. Thus, the Body and Blood of Christ is the true ‚ÄúThanksgiving Meal‚Äù.</blockquote>\n\nI take the stance of a unified theory concerning the modern origin of Thanksgiving Day to be plausible to be covertly about the Islamic Moors/Turks, the first technical thanksgiving meal in America was done by Catholics first, but this story is perpetuated in the Protestant Puritans' side alone which degraded into yet another consumerism holiday focused on football games and parades. In the end, Thanksgiving Day is not a biblical holiday, even though there is a biblical definition of the word thanksgiving, it's not an holiday. People can decide to gather as an family tradition not enforced, and its date is not set in stone, not taken as an holy day but a time of gathering. Just because someone takes a day off doesn't mean that it is a holy day, even if it's treated as such within the family, it's not within the religion of which they adhere and amend to. Remember that many terrible laws are passed during holidays, and nobody deserves any rest until they worked for it, but God sometimes gives us grace and let some people rest longer and in peace than others that don't obey God who won't have peace when they rest from their work.\n\nüå†<strong>The Error of Solo Scriptura Dec 31, 2015 @ 00:40</strong>\n\nMaybe it's the excitotoxins that's giving me headaches or I am fed up with certain irrational modes of thinking surrounding the various misconceptions of what is Sola Scriptura which to a relativist, the most important claim Christianity can make against relativism is absolution of what is the truth, which Sola Scriptura is the essence of the truth as a concept. Without Sola Scriptura, the fundamental beliefs of Christianity is wiped out, and this divide between those who believes in Sola Scriptura and Solo Scriptura is as different as light is to darkness. Contrary to the title, I am going to address what people have withou Sola Scriptura, which Solo Scriptura is one of them, but I am not completely against certain forms of Solo Scriptura. There's many misconceptions that I'm all too aware of concerning the Reformation but I'm going to mention two of them: one claiming that Sola Scriptura is Solo Scriptura and two, the claim that Protestants were divided between Arminianism and Calvinism. Within the claim that many Catholics and even KJV only people make that Sola Scriptura is Solo Scriptura is in itself a loaded statement that can't be addressed simply without breaking down the claims and its implications that leads to other loaded questions.\n\nWhat is Sola Scriptura and what is Solo Scriptura? Here, let these articles testify for themselves and come back once you read through it all: <a href=\"http://www.reformedapologeticsministries.com/2013/01/an-articulation-of-sola-scriptura.html\" target=\"_blank\">An Articulation of Sola Scriptura: The Biblical Basis for the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures</a> <a href=\"http://www.reformedapologeticsministries.com/2014/03/biblical-evidence-for-sola-scriptura.html\" target=\"_blank\">Biblical Evidence for Sola Scriptura</a> <a href=\"http://www.reformedapologeticsministries.com/2014/03/the-church-fathers-taught-sola-scriptura.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Church Fathers Taught Sola Scriptura</a> <a href=\"http://www.the-highway.com/Sola_Scriptura_Mathison.html\" target=\"_blank\">A Critique of the Evangelical Doctrine of Solo Scriptura</a> <a href=\"http://www.the-highway.com/Sola_Scriptura_Armstrong.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Authority of Scripture</a>\n\nSome of the things that the Council of Trent had decided that the \"Church\" is the ultimate interpreter of the Scriptures and that the Bible and Church Tradition (the tradition that made up part of the Catholic faith) were equally and independently authoritative. Sola Scriptura makes the Bible the final authority but Sola Scriptura doesn't throw away other lesser forms of authority like ministers, creeds, councils. Although Roman Catholicism is split into Traditional Roman Catholics and Modern Roman Catholics, none of that even matters from the Council of Trent onwards. What Martin Luther was trying to do was to have his own form of Catholicism that's in line with certain aspects of the early Catholic Church but without a Pope and an over centralized power structure that doesn't value the Bible more than tradition which in turn means that they don't value God and His commandments more than tradition. He took whatever truth that the Roman Catholic Church was holding back and made a more liberating church that's more in line with the Bible. This is one reason why some Protestant sects/denominations look back to early Catholic Church writings and even claim some of the saints as their own, people of which they think that are saved and had contributed to Christianity in understanding more about the Holy Scriptures, all the while believing that the Scriptures is the final authority.\n\nSola Scriptura is a biblical concept, yet is a concept explained by man, it is a doctrine derived from the bible. Sola Scriptura is not technically the Scriptures, someone had to decide to name a certain doctrine so that when addressing certain big ideas that it can be easily identified.\n<blockquote>2 Timothy 3:16 For the whole Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to convince, to correct, and to instruct in righteousness, 17 That the man of God may be absolute, being made perfect unto all good works.</blockquote>\n\nSo if a creed, a doctrine, a catechism, a concept is biblical as it teaches, convince, correct, and instruct people in righteousness, then Protestants can claim the Athanasian Creed, the Nicene Creed, and anything else from Catholicism to be theirs, including doctrines made by Protestants, as long as it is all biblicly sound, it is used for the glory of God. Sola Scriptura is why Lutherans does some traditions like celebrating a Christianized version of Weihnachten/Saturnalia/Pagan Winter Solstice celebration, the candle lighting, the Christianized hymns of Catholic and folk music with Christianized lyrics. Someone with a very strict Solo Scriptura stance can claim that since the New Testament didn't mention worship in the context of singing and musical instrument playing that neither should we do any of that. They would claim that doing such traditions would condemn you. There are biblical rituals that applies to Christians like Baptism, Holy Matrimony, Communion, et cetera, but not doing those things won't condemn you. If all the Reformers were taking the stance of Solo Scriptura, the Protestant church won't ever sing, won't ever celebrate a holiday of their own people despite it not done in a Pagan manner, and worst of all, nobody can claim to know anything because they are simply not the bible. Solo Scriptura debunks Solo Scriptura because only the Holy Spirit can give you life, not words written on paper, not symbols formed by light on a rectangle, but the word of God written in the heart of flesh. Solo Scriptura is not in the bible, and you can't say \"Trinity\" for that word is not in the bible yet the concept is in a creed that defines it as trinity so you either use a biblical word or you need to use Sola Scriptura to either form your own doctrine concerning this or use other people's doctrines.\n\nKJV only people switch back and forth between Sola Scriptura and Solo Scriptura to suit their agenda and to gain control over others. There are different kinds of Solo Scriptura mindsets as well as KJV only mindsets. The most dangerous type is the one that claims authority over the congregation through Solo Scriptura, claiming that whatever they say is Solo Scriptura because they quote the bible. Some KJV people take it to the next step and say that Solo Scriptura only applies to the KJV only. Whenever they want to justify tradition like celebrating Christmas, they use Solo Scriptura to justify Sola Scriptura. At times they use their position justified through Solo Scriptura to try to reason with the congregation instead of being strictly Solo Scriptura. This corrupt form of Solo Scriptura or KJV onlyism is simply using religion as a master tool for herding the gullible sheep. These pastors try long and hard to claim all of their authority through misquotations of the bible outside of the context of what the Holy Spirit is leading them as they speak without discernment while pretending to feed you the truth when these people hypocritically get their discernment from bible colleges. In truth, charlatans are everywhere in any religious organization, but KJV onlyism is a systematic theology surrounded by falsified evidence and a lack of history and honest research bent to uphold their Solo Scriptura stance. I would embrace Solo Scriptura people that uses the bible to come to the conclusion that Sola Scriptura is biblical. I would befriend Solo Scriptura people that sticks to using one translation in their own language. I won't bid godspeed to Solo Scriptura people who condemns people for using another translation. I won't befriend Solo Scriptura people who condemns people for trying to understand what the original text tried to say and compare that to a translation to see which one holds up to their standards. I won't give to the Solo Scriptura charlatan what their flesh desires. I won't attack the leaders of Solo Scriptura that promotes one version but I will attack all their false points.\n\nSolo Scriptura is not the same as bible translation preference, but many times to some people it is equated with that. Bible translation onlyism is worse than Solo Scriptura, but Solo Scriptura many times leads to bible translation onlyism. I prefer the Geneva Bible yet I don't believe that Solo Scriptura is biblical. I can think that the Geneva Bible is a superior translation yet not claim that it is a 100% correct translation to the point of replacing the source texts. A more historical promotion of Solo Scriptura and bible translation onlyism in Christianity took place through King James as he wanted to remove all the footnotes since it questioned the Divine Right of Kings but many KJV only people claim that this was actually done because of Solo Scriptura masked as Sola Scriptura since they don't know the difference. To them I say, they are historically inaccurate and was fed a lie so that they won't question certain things. I am attacking them concerning history but to make things easier for me, I shall direct you to look at these links: <a href=\"http://1611-king-james-bible.com/history.html\" target=\"_blank\">History The King James Bible</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Bible\" target=\"_blank\">Geneva Bible</a> <a href=\"http://www.reformedreader.org/gbn/igb.htm\" target=\"_blank\">An Introduction to the Geneva Bible</a> <a href=\"http://founders.org/fj86/the-geneva-bible-and-its-influence-on-the-king-james-bible/\" target=\"_blank\">The Geneva Bible and Its Influence on the King James Bible</a> <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/the-geneva-bible-1560-is-the-most-superior-and-true-bible-of-the-reformation/\" target=\"_blank\">THE GENEVA BIBLE 1560 IS THE MOST SUPERIOR AND TRUE BIBLE OF THE REFORMATION</a> <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/king-james-vii-freemasonic-monarch/\" target=\"_blank\">KING JAMES VI/I, FREEMASONIC MONARCH</a> <a href=\"http://kjvonly.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The King James Only Resource Center</a>\n\nThrough the promotion of the King James Bible in this modern age, the concept of KJV onlyism or Solo Scriptura through the KJV also brought forth a liberal minded form of Christianity that at one hand promoted people to read the KJV more and not seek to be congregations, even seek no desire to have any minister as everyone become the captain of their own ship, an extreme form of Christian Anarchism that isn't the same as the independence that the Reformationists and the Puritans sought after. These people congregate on social media and they don't always agree with others so much like themselves. The ones that have families are generally sane in comparison to the Anarcho-Capitalist, Jesuit hating, KJV only, Conspiracy Theorist, single Christians. Though some of them would want to be in a relationship, they just can't find anyone like themselves. They usually stop learning certain things at that level. What do I mean? They believe in many different delusions set up by the Roman Catholics, Jews, and the Venetians as they have a very nihilistic and narrow spectrum concerning history, economics, eschatology, apologetics, et cetera, taught through the many layers of controlled alternative media. They are discouraged to be fruitful and multiply, they are in fear, they have no hope, they don't understand the current level of geopolitics, they don't value privacy, they don't know how to combat censorship, but the worst of all is that they no longer know what is the purpose of a congregation, nor do they know how to find one. They need to be prepared yet they are burdened with everything placed upon themselves as they have no one to share that with. Nothing makes you more alone that knowing a low level truth that puts you in this box.\n\nThere is good news, there are congregations out there, there are people who are willing to prepare themselves, most of them are also prefer the KJV and they seek genuine real people that seeks righteousness, truth, the Jesus way, but how much of what you currently believe stand the longer you truly seek God with everything you got? You will be tested and tested and tested through the Refiner's fire within the group, but can you take the heat? How much of your actions testify your faithfulness to Christ? Keep calm and be patient. The answer is there if God opens your eyes to see, your ears to hear, your heart to feel by the Holy Spirit that binds you to others with the Holy Spirit. <a href=\"http://www.preparingyou.com/wiki/Network\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preparingyou.com/wiki/Network</a> Update: I linked to that site as an example of people attemping to \"do it right\" but the longer I stayed there, the more I was lead out of there. I don't recommend them anymore but this is an old article and I've decided to keep that link there. I've said many things against them in my website in various articles, but I've mentioned no names thus far for their sake. For the record, I have not read any of their garbage once I've cut off all ties with them.\n\nAnyways, there is two things that's worse than the bible translation onlyism which one is the Roman Catholic stance after that Council of Trent of the Church having the final say and beyond that is the even more heretical tier of Sola/Solo Spiritus (see <a href=\"http://www.virtueonline.org/sola-scriptura-solus-spiritus-bruce-atkinson\" target=\"_blank\">Sola Scriptura, Solus Spiritus</a>). It is the completely opposite end of bible translation onlyism. If I were to all of this in a spectrum starting from one end claiming the bible to be more important to the other end claiming that anything else to be more important than the bible, it would look something like this: Original text onlyism, Bible translation onlyism, Solo Scriptura, Sola Scriptura, the logically nonexistent middle stance, Sola Ecclesia, Solo Ecclesia, Sola Spiritus, Solo Spiritus, and last but not least, Natural Revelation onlyism. This spectrum line is assuming that it is within the confines of Christianity or \"Christology\" as learned skeptical scholars from academia use as a Strawman, a hoodoo doll to attack Christianity. As people draw outside of the biblical Sola Scriptura, the more go off in extreme tangents until one day, they simply fall off the spectrum into anything outside of Christianity. This may make more sense as a Venn diagram. The Divine Right of Kings fall under or near Sola Ecclesia as Sola Regnum which makes the historical mandate of the KJV as the official bible of England to not be bible translation onlyism for that is the lie. In those days, the Pope made kings and queens which then makes Sola Regnum be under Sola Ecclesia, and if you didn't know, King James was a closet Sodomite, Freemason, and Catholic. The true understanding of the separation of church and state is to realize that both church and state are both separate governments and religions. The current world we live in is an overtly Statist, Socialist, Communistic controlled churches of the populace used like opium by the nations for political control while a covert control of nations through covert Satanic religious cults that has its own untouchable form of government. The biblical form of government the people of Israel had was a free republic where everyone were their own king and did what they though was the right thing to do while the priesthood were servants beneath the people that had no authority over the people but only over the free will no strings attached tithes and sacrifices for them and the people to do and keep the will of God.\n\nThe spectrum can then become a 2D graph when we put in a y axis concerning Arminianism vs Calvinism, and it can become a 3D graph when we put in a z axis concerning how \"red pill\" or \"blue pill\" someone is, but beyond three spectrum lines, please consider using a spider graph or use multiple separate spectrum lines or other visual presentations. It might be fun to fill out a quiz to figure out where someone's at in their faith, keeping it private by default of course as you choose to opt in to breach your privacy by yourself by showing the results to others. Maybe one day you can rapidly boost your faith by realizing where you are so that you can move to where you want to be by taking a free online test.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with thinking outside of what you normally think though I do think that we all should have an unwavering central point of faith, to some it takes much time to find that and it takes time and patience. Even if we have an unwavering central point of faith, it isn't wise to stop learning and it isn't good to ignore other points of other people's central point of faith. Many arguments can be dismissed as pure sophistry in any perspective in the spectrum. There are some measure of truth in the different modes within the spectrum, so eat the meat, spit out the bones, but it's nice to \"come back home\" to Sola Scriptura. No matter what stance you take, by the fruits of your labor when judged by God on the Day of Judgement can we be certain what really matters and what really doesn't matter, but by then it is too late to undo your mistakes so seek to get it right the first time you're conscious and alive while in this limited physical plane, but sometimes we forget that having an existential crisis doesn't automatically always equate to being uncertain in your faith and that can just be your flesh, your body, and a symptom of simply being a mortal. Faith doesn't guarantee 100% certainty, but again, when we face Absolute Truth that is God, we will know where we are in our faith and where we should had been. Our God is not the God of the Dead, so do your best to do the will of our Father in Heaven on Earth in the right faith in God's grace and mercy received through Jesus Christ now instead of seeking to do it after you die. Eat healthy, be healthy, be happy, think logically, seek the truth, read and understand the bible, bear witness unto the truth, minister unto the people, but don't forget to pray all the time but not in vain repetition.\n\ntl;dr, the people behind the Reformation taught what Orthodox Christians meant \"Prima Scriptura\", but Martin Luther didn't want to use their terminology and it would make his five solas into four solas and a prima. Sola Scriptura meaning Prima Scriptura is not the modern false interpretation that is Sola Scriptura meaning Solo Scriptura that throws out canons and the works of Christian Theologians throughout history that seeks a proper understanding of the truth.\n\nIf you're here because of The Unhived Mind made a backup to this article on his website: <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/UHM/the-error-of-solo-scriptura/\" target=\"_blank\">The Error of Solo Scriptura</a>, know that I make random edits from time to time and that some of my older articles are there mostly for looking back at how I've used to think.

Study ‚ÄòGlobal 2000 Report‚Äô by Club of Rome tied to DVD agent, Mikhail Gorbachev. I also suggest you read ‚ÄòPopulation Bomb‚Äô by Paul Ehrlich. Study the U.N Agenda 21 and Sustainable Development.\n\nThe New World Order (Temporal Power)\n\nThe New World Order is a fascist system of control over the global populace as one within the aeon of Aquarius. Where by a whole new culture, lifestyle and society must be formed almost completely different to the old one of the past. This is why we see such extensive mind reframing and social engineering going on in front of our very eyes on the populaces and their belief systems being erased by new belief systems handed to them by the likes of Common Purpose (UK) and also Common Cause (US). Pedro Arrupe SJ was preparing his Knights of the Virgin Mary IHS for the coming New World Order a long time before his Knight of Malta, George H.W. Bush of the Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst came out with the term in the 90s. People of the U.S. should beware of The Crown‚Äôs use of the Senior Executive Service.\n\nGlobal Police state post democratic society\n\nAs the Knights of Malta, Global governance rolls through so does the militarization of the Governments police forces. We now see a gradual increase in fascist thug actions upon the peoples of our lands especially with the deadly taser. All designed for subordination to the Police state in the post democratic society as stated numerous times within the Lisbon Treaty.\n\nSurveillance Network\n\nSurveillance network The Knights of Malta wish to lock the people into the biggest enslavement known, far exceeding the Dark Ages when we were all once overtly controlled by the Vatican. This time though they wish to know everything about you and your exact location 24/7 utilizing microchip implants and computer systems such as the BEAST in Brussels. You‚Äôll see more and more ID card systems being brought in, along with fingerprinting and Iris scanning. Chips will be made fashionable and forced by certain employers and to be able to purchase goods and foods. Its coming folks and once in you wont be able to hide. If you don‚Äôt accept the mark then you‚Äôll simply not be able to buy/sell etc. When the Knights of Malta have full control over everything on this Planet you certainly will not eat if you oppose them. Make note of The Worshipful Company of Fuellers and The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists.\n\nIntelligence network Dope Inc\n\nThe true role of these Intelligence networks is the protection of the commerce system its that simple. British SIS control all the agencies from the Pakistani ISI, MOSSAD to the CIA. Remember on they created them all. British SIS are the leaders of the Global Drugs Trade which is simply a method of dumbing the people down whilst using cleaned up drug money laundered through the Stock Market companies to keep the economy going. Right now the Economy is in trouble and has been for a while. Notice the increase in drugs on the street at cut prices? Pioneer researchers in this field were Brain Downing Quig &amp; Gary Webb, guess where they are now? In a wooden box, DEAD! Mike Ruppert has some excellent information on this subject. Whilst Oil is only $110 a barrel, the Heroin trade is worth $20 million a barrel and when cut it brings in $60-80 million. Welcome to the Knights of Malta and their The Crown‚Äôs dirtiest dealings. Remember the connection of Sicily to the heroin trade and note how King Juan Carlos controls this region via his House of Bourbon power. The very house which is the Farnese continuum today. Also study the role of The Worshipful Company of Apothecaries controlling Dope Inc.\n\nIntelligence network false flags\n\nThe Knights of Malta need to advance their agenda amongst the public. They know the public will not accept their agenda so they create a crisis. This crisis utilizes `fear‚Äô as the weapon which makes the public buckle up and follow the agenda. This is known as `Ordo Ab Chao‚Äô amongst the hierarchy leadership secret societies, meaning `Order out of Chaos.‚Äô Its also known as problem-reaction-solution and the solution is always the hidden agenda. Try to check out `Operation Northwoods‚Äô for more information. 9-11 was carried out by the DVD, The Crown, and utilising elements of Israeli intelligence.\n\nGun control and the 2nd Amendment of America\n\nThe Knights of Malta wish for an unarmed populace which can be easily governed under their fascist Global governance about to laid down. An unarmed populace cannot defend itself from tyrannical leaders. Crime rates fall where Guns are held by the populace. This reduces chaos! The Jesuits wish for chaos, so you‚Äôll except their fascist order. Never let the guns be removed from the people. Once the arms are rounded up by foreign U.N MJTF (Fincen) troops, the American people will be made aware of something huge. This will be notice that the U.S Constitution has been dead since 1945 but especially since 1992 and that the Congress is redundant. The land is no longer the United States but in fact the United Nations. This has been the case due to the Charter of the United Nations being accepted. Just study those once U.S. National Parks.\n\nThe World commerce system\n\nThe Knights of Malta control all finance &amp; banking and they‚Äôre known as ‚Äòthe greatest merchants on Earth‚Äô. All commerce along with yourself is controlled by the Universal Postal Union in Berne, Switzerland for The Crown controlling the likes of the Worshipful Company of International Bankers along with the Guild of International Bankers all controlled by the Knights of Malta. This is the Oleron system of Code and Rule over the populace removing your rights as a sovereign being of the Divine who‚Äôs blood flows and flesh lives. They‚Äôve trapped you within a system known as the Uniform Commercial Code based on Vatican Canon Law. You‚Äôre simply a Maritime Admiralty product due to being born of your mother‚Äôs water from her birth canal. The ancient symbolism of Venus rules over business, the five pointed star. International Banking was created by the Vatican‚Äôs Knights Templars known as The Crown today which was taken over in the 14th Century by the Knights of Malta now commanded by Grandmaster, Matthew Festing who‚Äôs also a Cardinal in the College of Cardinals. You‚Äôll find that both the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem along with Opus Dei are active in the financial World. The Sepulchre are the masters of the Knights of Malta and the leading Crusading order today other than the revived Spanish Templars ruling the roost known as the Knights of the Virgin Mary IHS.\n\nThe Economic Depression\n\nFull economic collapse is about to occur at any second. The Knights of Malta controlling The Crown and the Worshipful Company of International Bankers, Guild of International Bankers and The Bankers Club desire a complete collapse of their current economic system Worldwide. The economy being a great modern control over the global populace as people no longer are taught to grow their own food and be indepenent. The Canon Law based Uniform Commerical Code (Oleron Law) financial system currently in place will eventually be replaced with an I.M.F backed system ready for the completion of an electronic only, non cash society which will also be a single World Company Inc currency by 2019. All controlled by the Universal Postal Union in Berne, Switzerland. In the meantime the populaces are to suffer and be bought back to the Dark Ages under the Papal Nobility and their Praetorian Guard known as the Knights of the Virgin Mary IHS. They‚Äôve hinted about this covertly in Subliminals and more as far back as 1987 with films like ‚ÄòThe Running Man‚Äô take a look at its opening upward scroll text at the beginning of the film. We‚Äôre about to enter a decade or more of deep poverty and severe lifestyle change.\n\nEarth Changes and Scalar biowarfare\n\nThe Jesuits were first to understand seismology and the ionosphere. I suggest you study there wicked actions down at Manila Observatory since 1951 onwards. Now when you understand these ionospheric heaters and the Earthquakes they can create you may think differently about their origins. Weather warfare is taking place by space based weapons platforms and satellites in conjunction with aerosol programs in the atmosphere and ground based scalar interferometers. Again please make sure you‚Äôre aware of the report from Iron Mountain.\n\nMass civil unrest, disobedience, protest and strikes\n\nTheres an agenda to create endless rioting in order to help break down society and bring in acceptance amongst the populace for Martial Law in the coming post democratic society. All as unemployment rates rise to economic Depression figures and worse whilst taxes get higher and people can no longer afford to live. This is unfortunately the post industrial/democratic zero growth society wished for by the Knights of Malta. Watch as security guards and traffic wardens take local duties of Police officers whilst the Police officers tackle the civil disobedience. Expect regular almost constant rioting from the end of 2014 onwards as the Depression and New World Order comes well into play.\n\nADMIRALTY LAW\n\nUsurping false Law\n\nCell phones, Microwaves, EMF and Wifi\n\nCell phones utilize microwaves and Extra Low Frequencies which interfere with the body and produce a host of symptoms including death from brain and Hodgkins Lymphoma. Intelligence agencies now have technology to utilize your cell phone as a real weapon via resonant frequency and microwaves by ECCM (Electronic Counter Counter-Measure) units such as Venus EECM and the Stoner techology both are in the hands of Mi6, CIA, FBI Division #5 and others.\n\nAIDS and the non-existent hiv fraud\n\nThere is no such virus as Human immunodeficiency virus its never existed. Knight of Malta, Robert Gallo and friends have created on of the biggest frauds and hoaxes on the public which will lead to depopulation on a grand scale when mandatory testing comes in. AIDS has been around since day one under the many names of old such as malnutrition and Syphilis etc. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the hype and brainwashing on this subject. Information I possess is major heresy in this corporate medical World of so-called experts.\n\nCancer\n\nCancer is now within one in three of the populace in some parts of the World such as parts of Canada in masculines. This is a filth originating metabolic disease stemming ultimately from Pancreas dysfunction tied to dysfunction of the Spleen. By this time you‚Äôll find the Liver and Kidneys most likely will have become dysfunction which will have an affect on the Heart and Lungs. This area will cover the Cancer subject and real alternative treatments available. Study the work of William Donald Kelley, Dr Max Gerson and Dr John Ray Christopher along with Harry Hoxsey, Rene Caisse, Sir Jason Winters, Dr Otto Warburg and of course Dr John Beard (The Unitarian Trophoblastic Theory). Remember on that the Pancreas is controlled by the Spleen.\n\nChemical/synthetic poisons and toxins\n\nAspartame is a carcinogenic sweetener created by Searle which has multiple serious health symptoms creating havok and death. Please try to watch a video called ‚ÄúSweet Misery.‚Äù Try to study the work of Dr Russell L Blaylock. **NOTE NEW POISON COMING FROM NUTRASWEET SOON** ALSO NOTE A NEW POISON SUBSITUTE FOR MSG NOW OUT CALLED -SENOMYX- 17/8/7 ** UPDATE: ASPARTAME BEING CALLED NOW ‚ÄòAMINOSWEET‚Äô BEWARE OF THIS TRICKERY **\n\nFluoride\n\nThis deadly substance first developed by the Nazis and Russians causes many serious health problems including Cancer as well as the mind numbing effects to dumb down the surviving population via the water systems. Serious damages the Kidneys and damages the spiritual light body.\n\nConspiracy audio files\n\nAudio files usually MP3 or Streaming web format all containing information on Conspiracy knowledge.\n\nConspiracy video footage\n\nVideo streams and files usually MP3/AVI containing information on Conspiracy knowledge.\n\nGeneral information\n\nAn area for anything of important but not quite relevant to any of the other topics.\n\nHealth audio files\n\nAudio files usually MP3 or Streaming web format all containing information on Health knowledge.\n\nHealth video footage\n\nVideo streams and files usually MP3/AVI containing information on Health knowledge.\n\nHerbal medicine\n\nHerbal medicines have been used for centuries to reverse ailments and disease. This is the natural method of healing and not just masking of symptoms known as disease management which the pharmaceutical treatments are known for. Remember most of the top synthetic drugs of the Medical Mafia come originally from the plant Kingdom such as the Periwinkle and Mistletoe Chemotherapies along with Foxglove for Heart failure,\n\nHydration and Salt\n\nPure Water &amp; Salt healing was brought to the masses by Dr. Fereydoon Batmanghelidj of Iran. Both substance are vital for life along with Qi, Oxygen and Iodine. Correct Salt levels help the Kidneys to function and should be obtained from natural foods ideally. If you wish to take salt other than the natural salty foods then you should only use Himalayan Salt or Redmond Salt. Sea salt is fine as long as it isn‚Äôt processed. There must be correct balance between the water intake and salt in accordance with Dr Batmanghelidj‚Äôs information or even better the Chinese diet system. His best book is ‚ÄòWater &amp; Salt Your Healers From Within‚Äô.\n\nLatest health news updates\n\nAll the latest news on health from around the World.\n\nMedical Quackery &amp; Death\n\nThe covert Spanish Inquisitional medical establishment exposed! This poisonous pharmacopeia is utter quackery designed to misled and control the populace. Fully controlled by the Knights of Malta through their American Medical Association and their bully boy Food and Drug Administration. A way of making mass profits for greedy corporations like Bayer. A tool to make currency whilst destroying the enemies of Rome! Synthetic drugs are poison and they‚Äôll kill you in the long run. These days the drugs seem to kill and hurt even faster than ever.\n\nOzone and Oxygenation\n\nOzone gas is renowned in Europe for its serious healing and detoxification powers. Used in Germany and Russia extensively for fighting many forms disease bought about by filth. Brought to the mass attention by ‚ÄúMr.Oxygen‚Äù Ed Mccabe in modern times. I strongly suggest people study the work of Dr Otto Warburg of the early 20th Century.\n\nPandemic Flu &amp; Pneumonic Plague\n\nPandemic Level 6 flus and Epidemics are great ways to depopulation areas but the ultimate is Pneumonic Plague as trialled in the Ukraine during the supposed Swine flu level 6 pandemic. Remember no animal virus can enter a human being and survive naturally. Only military genetic engineering can create such viruses, many of which are injected via vaccines mostly and can be vectored by aerosols if need be.\n\nPoliomyelitis and the truth\n\nContagious disease? No! Polio is a virus which lives in the stomach in order to protect you from pollution and radiation. All viruses are protein solvents for cleansing of filth. I suggest you study Dupont more and make sure you‚Äôre aware of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane. This DDT is still in use today in third World nations and you‚Äôll find they all have this disease called Polio. Beware them reintroducing it which they‚Äôre calling for these days now population reduction is needed in the West.\n\nPrecious metal investment &amp; true wealth\n\nOnce you realize that paper ca$h is tra$h then you need precious metals to preserve and maybe increase your wealth through times of hardship in the economy. Right now you should be investing a large percentage of your wealth into physical Gold &amp; Silver bullion. The later being the better of the two in the long run as it goes extinct around 2019! Silver also has a long way to go just to match the old 16:1 ratio against gold. Thus Silver is the one to watch and its very rare these days. Study now how to get into this arena and fast. The Knights of Malta still use bullion to this day behind closed doors but don‚Äôt wish you to have the pleasure. Gold and Silver are the only legal tender in the U.S. under the Constitution.\n\nTemporal Power Crusade\n\nRussia, China, Brazil, Syria, Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, India forming to defeat the Western New World Order or so we‚Äôre led to believe. Any news on these places can be added here along with WAR information! Its the Knight of the Virgin Mary controlled Knights of Malta Crusade for the full control and creation of their One World Government. Note how The Pentagon of the Department of Defense originated with the Farnese Papal Bloodline and their Villa Farnese in Luzio, Italy. This is the Knights of the Virgin Mary IHS using their proxy military force commanded from ‚Äòlittle Rome‚Äô Washington D.C. as the bully boy bringing back Temporal Power this time Worldwide live never before.\n\nThe Aerosol Programme\n\nAerosols are being vectored Worldwide across our skies raising environmental pollution and pathogens which have killed and diseased many people. Now after years of this we‚Äôre seeing the collateral damage manifesting as Morgellons disease across America and other sprayed Countries. Thanks to the Office of Naval Intelligence we now have Operation Clover Leaf, Operation Red Sky, Operation Rain Dance right above our heads tied into the Civil and Military Open Skies treaties.\n\nThe Jesuit Revived Templarism\n\nThese Knights originate from Spain who were once known as the Los Alumbrados. These are the revived Knights Templar of old who‚Äôve reclaimed their powers and extended them over their enemy the Vatican and once fellow Crusaders. The Knights of Malta fell to their power in 1798 and the Vatican between 1814-1870. I suggest you study their origins in the Kingdom of Aragon controlled by the Borgia family. Please note their founder under the name of the Society of Jesus and he was Francis Borgia tied to the Grandmaster of the Order of Montesa. The Pope did not kill off all the Knights Templar. A small band of these were allowed to stay in Aragon but under a different name. The Society of Jesus as they‚Äôre now called were the first religious order to be allowed to deal commercially since the Knights Templar of old. May I remind everyone that Loyola was a Gentile from Spain and not a crypto-Judiac. He lived in the castle Casa-Solar in the Biscayan Provinces. The Order‚Äôs old war rooms were in Villa Caprarola in Lazio, Italy! The Order now rules from the Curia Generalizia in the sovereign, Borgo Santo Spirito next door to the Vatican. Their control is via the spiritual power of the sovereign Vatican City, the military power of the sovereign Washington D.C. and finally the financial power of the Sovereign City of London home of The Crown and its Crown Agents and Livery power of the old British Empire controlled since 1215 by the Knights Templar and since the 14th Century by the Knights of Malta.\n\nWilliam Cooper\n\nAnother legendary truth exposer killed by the establishment at his home. William exposed the mysterys religion, Ufos, underground bases, freemasonry, project lucifer, JFK william greer shooting and much more. A true truthsayer.\n\nVaccination Inquisition\n\nVaccines do not cure disease they create disease. Vaccines are used as a depopulation tool under the guise of false help. An example is the Simian Virus 40 which causes Cancer in Salk Polio jabs amongst 150 other contaminants just in one vaccine. Used to create crippling illnesses and dumbing down of humans etc. Vaccines originate with Francis Xavier SJ of the Knights of the Virgin Mary IHS and pushed on the World by Edward Jenner SJ of the same order.\n\nUnidentified Flying Objects\n\nInformation on Unidentified Flying Objects and possibly various genetically created lifeforms for the final agenda what Project Greenstar has all been to bring about. Notice the predictive programming programmes on TV downloading the conditioning into your mind daily. Programmes such as series called ‚ÄòV‚Äô, movies like ‚ÄòSkyline‚Äô or ‚ÄòBattle Los Angeles‚Äô and ‚ÄòWar of the Worlds‚Äô. Please remember Knight of Malta, Ronald Reagan‚Äôs words about a threat from outer space. Please make sure you‚Äôre aware of the Iron Mountain Report and how this\n\nTraditional Chinese Medicine\n\nTraditional Chinese Medicine is 5000 years old and the ultimate in balance within the body. This involves the use of Herbal medicine along with Acupuncture, Tai Chi/Qi Gong, Massage and Cupping. It involves getting to the root of the problem and dealing with internal Qi lifeforce. Far more deeper than Western Herbalism with a far more deeper understanding of the body and its functions. An ultra strict diet system is involved and people must be serious about healing and dedicated fully.\n\nThe Ptolemaic Papal Nobility\n\nNow we come to the real omega point of control over this global conspiracy as we find the Papal Nobility bloodlines of old going back to the Ptolemaic dynasty era of Egypt. Notice who commissioned the Knights of the Virgin Mary IHS as the Society of Jesus and this was Alessandro Farnese. These are most powerful bloodlines in existence such as the House of Aldobrandini along with the House of Orsini. The Knights of the Virgin Mary IHS are merely a gatekeeper for this level of hidden power. The Borgia family also came within this level along with the Medici. Note how the Medici were bred into the Orsini bloodline for status. Now the connection of the Borghese to the Aldobrandini bloodline. These are what you may wish to term the Grey Knights or the Sup√®rieur Inconnu.\n\nThe profiting off Cholesterol\n\nCholesterol is vital to the human body and without it you‚Äôd die quickly. Think of it as your puncture repair kit and transportation of fat soluble vitamins and minerals. If you shut this down your illness needing Cholesterol will worsen and you‚Äôll be malnourished. Synthetic Cholesterol lowering medicine will damage your Liver, Kidneys and Spleen. Real Cholesterol problems stem from Liver dysfunction which responds well to Artichoke root herbal treatment.\n\nThe Brotherhood of Zeus and Kronos\n\nThe core of the control over Planet Earth‚Äôs populace lies in the ancient cults of Zeus and Kronos. These cults are still in existence to this very day. Following the most ancient religions mixed with sexual worship. The main cults are the worship of the Planet Jupiter (Zeus) and his father Saturn (Kronos). Israel is located on the land formerly known as Canaan. Canaan was the most advanced post deluvian civilization on Earth. Outstripping both Egypt and Sumer in all areas. Now the center of trade, Holy land and soon the Divine Dragon‚Äôs open ‚ÄòLatin Kingdom‚Äô, when the Luciferian Vatican moves from Rome to Canaan.\n\nThe destruction of the N.H.S\n\nCommon Purpose of the Pope‚Äôs European Union are trying to engineer distrust in the National Health Service of Gt Britain. They want you to fall for their U.S. style private system being built as we speak. They want you to transition into this with ease and with zero troubles. So they attack the N.H.S and make it go through a hard time coping with the purposely created chaos. I don‚Äôt agree with N.H.S poisoning but theres devious trickery going on by Knight of the Virgin Mary Michael Holman, SJ again. Its all about greed for pharmaceutical companies desperate to push highly inflated priced poisons with ease on your insurance bills. Ask the Americans how it hits their pockets\n\nThe famine agenda\n\nThe populaces of the Western World are to dramatically have their living standards drop closer to Second World status to match the rest of the World as we all become one under the World Government. Food controls the populace and this is to be severely depleted in order to bring about depopulation of the third World. Once the depopulation of the third World becomes really visible they‚Äôll then push for GM crops in order to help disease and control the Western World which has economies relying on sickness for the economy in the Post Industrial Zero Growth Society. Expect rations and expect to be forced to live as a Vegan and never to see Salt and Meat ever again. The later is to make sure the lifespan of the human being is depleted as studies have showed. Notice how the U,N food programs WFP, FAO and their headquarters are all in Rome, Italy.\n\nThe Hermaphrodite Agenda\n\nThe Homosexuality Agenda The goal is to have a population of at least fifty percent homosexuals whilst the rest are majority bi-sexual. This will be achievable without civilization collapse as kids of Saturn will be created in the laboratory replacing children of God. This all ties into the Papal Nobility Hermetic mind frames. All in a H.G Wells free-love society. These Satanic creatures want rid of the idea of sexes just the same as they wish to remove the idea of race, nationality, individuality etc. Until forced sterilization and eventual creation of a new genetic modified being, homosexuality aids in curbing the population growth in line with the ‚ÄòGlobal 2000‚Äô report needs whilst needing a source of kids due to lack of breeding. Study groups like the Department of Justice Pride.\n\nThe Ice Age\n\nAs we enter the Dalton‚Äôs minimum period of Solar activity for the next 30-50 years we enter into an Ice-Age period. The underwater Volcanoes heat up the oceans creating more moisture in the atmosphere which comes inland creating floods but when the temperature drops this gives you the Ice-Age. William Cooper warned us all about this period happening right now but he told us this decades ago in advance.\n\nSherman Skolnick\n\n#\n#From here on, these are the rest of the categories that are not on the info tabs.\n#\n\nDEPOPULATION\n\nThe depopulating of the planet by 65% by 2050\n\nElectro-healing\n\nDoctor Hulda Clark &amp; Robert C. Beck brought Electro healing back to the masses of the Western World. The original pioneers were Dr George Lakhovsky, Royal Raymond Rife, Wilhelm Reich and Nikola Tesla. You may wish to study information on Zapping, Blood Electrification, Magnetic Pulsing, Multiple Wave Oscillators and Rife based machines. This should be a part of the future of health!\n\nfeatured\n\nfeature articles\n\nJoe Vialls\n\nJoe Vialls was an old school researcher and exposer of the conspiracy being played out all these years now more in front of our face than ever. Joe was unique in his level of detail whilst going into even forensic detail like no other. Joe was plagued by the Knights of Malta intelligence networks who would remove his attempts to collect finances, they‚Äôd ban his PayPal and similar methods. Eventually they assassinated Joe in 2005 by bio-weapon which destroyed his Kidneys. A very sad time indeed for us all. His work will never be forgotten by myself. Much of his work is disappearing off the internet and we must keep his effort alive as its all of vital importance.\n\nOrgone\n\nOrgone has been known by the few thanks to Wilhelm Reich. Mark Hooten created the most powerful orgonite cloudbusters and from then on dominates this arena with the most powerful creations around.\n\nPhil Schneider\n\nPhil was beaten, finger chopped off and strangled in his appartment after around the 9th attempt on his life. Phil exposed underground bases, ufos, space created materials, aliens, prison trains and depopulation plans. This guy knew way to much and was one of the biggest threats to the above top secret agendas.\n\nThe Unhived Mind\n\nThe Unhived Mind has been researching for just under a decade now. Well schooled in a broad array of subjects from health to conspiracy and the many angles within. Schooled in many subjects to make sure you all have an opportunity to learn what he knows to the fullest. The Unhived Mind has been one of the biggest promoters of the anti-Vatican movement and continues to this day to keep everyone aware of startling new information where others wouldn‚Äôt dare to tread. Currently an adviser of Eric Jon Phelps.\n\nUncategorized\n\nüå†<strong>Applying ethical theories to religion Jan 13, 2016 @ 05:30</strong>\n\nSome ideas are so inherently simplistic that it can be visually represented without too much confusion. Simply substitute or apply the main points in this <a href=\"https://visualunit.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/basic_ethics_theories.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">infograph</a> to a certain name of a doctrine in any religion of your choice and voila, you now know some potential underlying ethical reasons for religious organizations that split into major schisms and denominations like say Calvinism verses Arminianism. Of course this can't be applied to everything for all religions, but at a certain point, when people look at all the angles, they would ultimately be able to pick one angle or a few angles over other angles or simply see it in all angles and respect it as it is. Once their ethical world view is decided, that is what they want to see in any religion and if they don't perceive what they want to see in a religion, assuming they're undecided, they would simply look elsewhere or even change things so that it conforms to their ethical world view. That infograph is better applied personally than through externalized concepts that has underlying ethical theories. What do you adhere to the most?\n\nThis of course can be applied to politics, but the whole divide et impera concept being pushed around in controlled alternative media is toxic if that's how you view everything in history to be reduced to that. Some opposition are justified logically, some opposition are genuine, not everything has to be controlled. Oversimplification ignores the finer details that changes its definition. I think that infograph is not too simplistic, not too complex, but can get the message through that underlying concepts does exists, just abused to create divisions and wars instead of meeting each other halfway concerning what they believe in so that they can team up on bigger, more dangerous threats. With that being said, people can't stand being with those that hate how they think for what seems to be an eternity whenever they talk about their disagreements in the truth.\n\nAnything can be argued away by the fool to being something else than what it is, so I don't really enjoy explaining to those who won't understand no matter what but I do it anyways. I know and believe that there is a valid and logical approach to proving that God exists and this website does that well: <a href=\"http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/</a> and also this part of his website: <a href=\"http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/one-to-one-tracts/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/one-to-one-tracts/</a> If that's not enough, I think that they are fools that need more time to think it through and to do more research but if they're still not convinced after some more refutation, there's a time when I just stop trying to convince them. I have done what I can, especially if they don't want to be convicted of the truth. God will do what needs to be done in others in the right timing, though we can't determine that would always happen to people since we don't know their due dates. Don't put yourself down for not being able to lead someone to Christ the whole nine yards because God is being patient to them for the whole 100 meter run. You don't know all the answers to convince everyone, and you don't want to tell them what they want to hear if that isn't the truth.\n\nüå†<strong>What isn't Predestination? Jan 27, 2016 @ 14:31</strong>\n\nNo matter how hard I try to explain this, people just can't really figure out as to the dynamics and purpose of all the different gathering of people that come together for any reason. It is important for me to explain these concepts first before I explain what is Predestination so bear with me. When they think that they \"figured a group out\", they tend to make false statements like: \"Many of those who believe in Predestination also tend to believe in Calvinism, which Calvinists also tend to believe in the 5 solas, which many of the ferverent ones online tend to also be (Authorized) King James Version Only Baptists\". Such generalizations are based off of one's own personal, amateur statistical data that requires to map out all such groups in its similarities and in its differences, and to do that, they need to BE in said group enough to understand its schisms within and among themselves, and many times people make too much assumptions and it can't be helped. Specific generalizations made for the purpose of separating a specific subculture at a point passes the borders of group thinking and falls under the borders of individual thinking. Through the internet, shared opinions are sought after but in that process, it can also get you more and more isolated from others beyond the point where it is socially acceptable. A common ground is now whenever you find one other individual that thinks almost exactly like you which then it becomes in itself a group. This is a form of compartmentalization that keeps you away from sharing your opinions to those around you while the more you seek to be closer in this journey of truth, the less tolerance and noise you have among those you think are intolerable even though in the pre-internet era, you might had been good friends with them.\n\nChristians, Researchers, Journalists, and others controlled by design more and more are having problems with definitions because of the amount of data one needs to sit through to be acquainted and know what it means to one and to another. It is harder to record the history of the internet's various subcultures as it's divided by language, family, race, nation, websites, ideologies, hobbies, program applications, and many more. If your definition of a group is two or more, there's so many algorithms in play that is harder to profile everyone in all of its groups as they are dynamically increasing many times, but social networking websites like Facebook does that very well. If everybody profiled themselves the way that they use Facebook with stuff that they like and like to dislike in an autobiography, it is abundantely clear as to how different we are, but those with less things that they like and like to dislike are those who don't spend most of their time trying to know themselves through groups of people that they like to be with.\n\nThere are three main examples of this sort of group identity compartmentalization that I want to present to you: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:History_of_Christianity\" target=\"_blank\">History of Christianity</a> <a href=\"http://futurist.se/gldt/\" target=\"_blank\">GNU/Linux Distribution Timeline</a> <a href=\"https://archive.is/K0EP1\" target=\"_blank\">Complete List of Tumblr Genders (SO FAR)</a>\n\nThe history of Christianity in how it has spread was for the most part, a gradual phenomenon in line with the population of the world though it had been kicked up a notch with a hoard of heresies every now and then when the people are caught up with \"the spirit of the age\", facing multiple schisms, some being genuine, but the most either already being corrupt or being corrupted by false interpretations within formerly genuine sects. The GNU/Linux Distribution Timeline shows a glimpse to what could happen in the real world if everyone were not forced to be bound by a nation's laws while being able to create their own laws to do what they see is right among their own and to assemble among those that they agree with for a common purpose like in the book of Judges. The list of Tumblr \"Genders\" is what happens when \"free will\" rejects Natural Law. We need to remember that Tumblr was founded almost 9 years ago. Within the span of 8 years, more than the number that I've failed to count beyond (70) in my attempt to number the list of genders that these self proclaimed \"S(ocial) J(ustice) W(arrior)s\", a breeding ground of Leftists, Feminists, LGBTQAPX..., Sodomites, Degenerates, and disinfo shills which its sphere of influence is spilling over Facebook, into the real world, and promoted by mainstream Jewish controlled Western media that is ultimately pushing their inner Neo Babylonian paganism hidden behind the veil of Rabbinical Judaism. The Italian Mafia and the Roman Catholic Jesuits that once used to control Hollywood don't have the visible power as they used to have before as most of them are hidden behind the Nazi DVD division of the CIA and the other alphabet agencies and offices.\n\nSome concepts of Predestination is in Calvinism, but Calvinism is not Predestination. As there are different interpretations of John Calvin's works, so there are different concepts behind Predestination. Many people who say \"Calvinist\" tend to falsely group that with the \"Reformers\", \"Protestantism\", and \"Baptists\" when the first sect/denomination to be founded on John Calvin's research brought into Scotland through John Knox is called Presbyterianism. Presbyterians are not Baptists. There is also this huge hurdle of assuming that the Southern Baptist Convention is the same as Lutherans and Reformed Baptists when they are trying to denounce them as traditionalists which they also denounce anyone who associates themselves with such groups as real Christians in an individual level. Christians that does this denouncing tend to be Pentecostals and its many divisions which the overt origins of Pentecostalism came from Methodists which came from the enlightenment era. The New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) came from Pentecostals, but the covert origins of Pentecostalism came from Anglicanism and British Israelism as revealed here: <a href=\"http://www.larouchepub.com/other/1997/ahc.html\" target=\"_blank\">British Subversion of the United States: The militias and Pentecostalism</a> which then debunks another assumption that Anglicanism and its divisions are the same as the Puritans that fled to the Americas, for it is more of the matter of where one puts their loyalty to, either to bow down to the King, or to bow down to the King of Kings. Anglicans in the eyes of the Puritans and some other Protestant colonies are obnoxious and dangerous to them as a Roman Catholic, but many of these ancient political beliefs are lost in the sands of time.\n\nNow when people claim that \"fundamental\" Christians have to agree with John Calvin and read the King James Bible, they are also wrong since there are many Baptist preachers teaching free will, Arminianism, and some of them use a King James Bible, but oh wait, Baptists are not Presbyterians but all Protestants adhere to most of what the Reformers of the Reformation believed in, even though in reality, that claim is watered down with false teaching. Only those who read the footnotes of the Geneva bible knows the whole of what the Reformers believed in because it is exactly that which makes one a historically accurate Protestant Christian than one that does not care to look at their claims as they become a KJVO Christian or whatever bible translation they adhere to. The revival and adherance to the King James Bible was pushed by traditional Freemasons themselves that think they are in the \"know\", working in unison with deceived but honest Christians that is fed up with all the terrible translating after the King James Bible. After the creation of the united states of America, that democratic system made on top of the pre-existing free republic of the people, Freemasonry, Deism, and Catholicism increased while the slow replacement of the Geneva bible with the Anglican King James Bible came about as these duped Protestants sought to make their enemy Freemasons, Deists, Catholics, and anything else except Anglicans and Espicolicans. We also need to remember that a Protestant does not have to be American, and that it was a gradual takeover that the united states of America had done to take away the rights they had under God into \"freedom\", privileges under another system that is Statism. A Protestant in the Americas is not the same as a Protestant that is a citizen under the united states of America, which the \"The United States Of America\" AKA: USA is in itself another beast formed from the united states of America.\n\nThere's much more clarification needed, but back to \"Predestination\". Generalizations are generally true, but not always reliable with ample statistical data surveyed and gathered properly and they're sometimes propaganda or memes (forced or natural forming) or mind viruses that implants a specific thought form into your mind, changing a definition and reinforcing that different definition through some methods and medium to distribute it to the people. Sometimes generalizations are treated as metaphors or misidentified as metaphors. Sometimes the means to describe something becomes the description yet in describing that description of a concept, sometimes the real meaning gets lost in sophistry and ignorance. That does not mean that a description of a concept should be dismissed because someone described that concept, only considered before accepted or rejected or understood or be aware of. That description of a concept can be true, though at times it can be misinterpreted, deviated from the descriptor's image of that concept within the mind. This is when referring to a reliable reference like the 1828 Webster's Dictionary or the Black's Law Dictionary proves to be valuable in discerning what the true meaning and origin of these words come from. When it concerns religious text, a reliably preserved reference in its original language is needed as well as reliable lexicons and proper understanding of that language in its grammar and punctuation and many more points of reference like biblical archaeology, biblical cosmology, biblical science, and other things to put it in proper context although too much context can take away from the message sometimes.\n\nAll books conveys concepts with different words and it sometimes does not provide a name for its concept which is up to the reader to seek for himself a proper name with the least confusion possible in the proper context that the book draws into the mind of the reader. To make it simple to describe it to others, the description needs to be extracted from the book in its entirety where the concept is being described in the book, or the definition of that new word for this new concept not yet understood by the world can simply refer the reader to read that book to understand what it means and/or describe the concept without referring to the book, word for word and/or thought for thought through a metaphor or simile or other figures of speech. The goal is different by the questions people ask or what they want to gather. Whether the description is a simple concept meant for the populace, or a confounding piece of work for intellectuals that want to feel smart, the audience that asks for the definition affects the delivery of the definition that may or may not be properly represented to them in each and every situation.\n\nMy goal audience is to the Calvinist, the Lordship Salvation promoters, and even the Arminianist. Luckily, because of the internet, I can simply redirect your attention to a few links that does the bulk of the work for me. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psl2n4TbMo0\" target=\"_blank\">Predestinated To NOT Be A Calvinist</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbyF29RNA8U\" target=\"_blank\">3025 WN120512 Predestination: All Action Proceeds From God -- Good And Evil -- God Meant It For Good</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4QL9FNlniU\" target=\"_blank\">God is a heretic, God doesn't love everybody, God is prejudiced</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bbza-VhFgI\" target=\"_blank\">How Preachers Rip the Word of God to Shreds</a> Even though the people behind the information that they are presenting have never met each other nor talked to each other nor agree with each other and even have some measure of conflicting doctrines, I encourage you to sit through it all. If you haven't done so and just want to see what I've got to say, you are too deaf and blind to understand the truth. It is not what I say but what the truth in what I say has to say which you are potentially rejecting without knowing, attacking the messenger before the messenger speaks for itself.\n\nFor God so agapao the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever have fidelity in him should not continue to be in a state of spiritual separation because of sin, but have everlasting life because of the Holy Spirit that quicken their spirit to be willing to truly repent in their free will, convicted by their own conscience of their own sin to get rid of it again, only through the Holy Spirit. If God decides to harden the Pharaoh's heart, God also decides to soften the heart and write his laws in people's hearts. God had chosen the Elect, but because the Elect will choose him and only after the Elect had repented are they predestined to eventually be with God in Heaven. We are covered by the blood of Jesus as in, through Jesus Christ, by Christ alone, accepting the life giving gift of grace through trusting faithfulness we are saved while sanctified as we move from destination to destination to the eventual predestined location and jurisdiction that is Heaven. Though his blood is sufficient for all, only the Elect will repent from their sins and accept the truth. Sometimes the fruit of the labor might appear to be good yet be rotten and corrupted inside. Sometimes it can look rotten and monstrous on the outside yet be sweet and delicious in the inside. There are some wolves in sheep's clothing, sheep in wolves clothing, wolves in wolves' clothing, and sheep in sheep's clothing. It's not wise to rationalize the things of how God sees in the heart of man so that we might know what's in the minds of men. We will never truly understand the way God thinks, but that does not mean that there is no way to discern a brethren from another. The flesh seeks to sin while the spirit seeks to be cleansed from sin which this dual internal conflict is the source of fire and tribulations that every Christian deals with, but again no one knows if someone is saved until they reach out to them in agape.\n\nCalvinism is not biblical, it's a little on the dark grey area but Hyper Calvinism is damnable, just as Arminianism and Lordship Salvation is a damnable heresy, promoting salvation through works. Belief without repentance and change is meaningless. Predestination is biblical and anyone who disagrees need to read the bible more. Only through God's will do we have free will even though the outcome is known beforehand by God, it is not an excuse to not repent, neither does it mean that those of the Elect who die sinning would automatically go to Hell. There is no fear or pride of this world when people preach about the biblical predestination, but there is a fear of God and the pride of being a Christian that boasts not themselves but the blessed redeemer of their souls that is genuine, not done as a false front. There's nothing wrong with being a \"robot\" in Christ Jesus whom that are obedient to his will. Free will outside of the bounds of God's will is forbidden yet the door is open for anyone to go for it as the world will punish you. The free will that I'm claiming that exists is the free will that Adam and Eve had when they were in the garden of Eden. Mankind can choose to do many things except a few things that God has warned against and is willing to make you learn from your mistakes so that you might know of his agape. God has made it abundantely clear to those who have the eyes to see that he loves us, but not the flesh that's a part of us. God already loves us but he would love us even more if we are saved and do what he calls us to do. To call those that seeks assurance of properly finding and having God's agape through the scriptures \"unsaved\" and \"Calvinists\" are envious and jealous of what they have that someone has no guarantee of. It is exactly those people that desires to be with God will find assurance of their journey will end in the predestined location and jurisdiction mentioned in the scriptures.\n\nLet me refer you to a rant: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/applying-ethical-theories-to-religion/\" target=\"_blank\">Applying ethical theories to religion</a>. Ultimately, there are two different kinds of people that have different ways of expressing things: action ethics verses agent ethics. I lean towards agent ethics although in varying measures, I also agree with some of the basic action ethics theories. A divinely created personality is instilled on everyone. That is being attacked through selective breeding programming on the populace (eugenics as the green agenda, abortion, softkill program, \"diversity\"). Let the dog people and the cat people sort themselves out, but neither are not \"wrong\" for having such personalities. Such basic mortal \"gut instinct\" differences shouldn't be pushed to be favored one over the other. Dog people have their own strengths and weaknesses as do cat people. People are divided further through the many social groups and through the knowledge and wisdom (either from God or from man) that they accumulate while the internet is making that much worse for some people as they step out of Natural Law, out of \"the garden of Eden\", free will going rampant like animals. A dog like Christian reading these things might never understand why a cat like Christian can be a Christian. Those dog like Christians had misassociated cat personalities with false personalities and goat personalities. One can be dog like yet be a completely fake Christian in the eyes of God. Everyone have different personalities and different personality preferences that they seek in others. Cats and dogs can be happy with each other if they both have a good master. Cat people are better off preaching to the undomesticated big cats while dog people are better off preaching to the laughing hyenas.\n\nIf this does not make sense to you, ask someone that knows you well but have a different personality to \"translate\" this for you in words that you understand. In my experience, people are too afraid to talk about and think about these things without going into full panic mode. I don't really think that this is such a hard concept to grasp, but for those that don't really think, I can only recommend to them that they should really think more often through puzzle games and reading the bible (preferably the Geneva bible or an Interlinear). Being a cat person or a dog person should not matter all that much. If you've seen that \"Too Cute\" show documenting puppies and kittens, you would know how diverse cats and dogs are in their personality within their litter. Free will people blaspheme God by limiting his Omnipotent power through their irrational reasoning twisted to their agenda outside of the whole proper context of the Holy Scriptures. No wonder the Jesuits used Arminianism to destroy the Reformation as the Counter-Reformation.

Of course that means that a dimmer sun means a weakening, eventually nonexistent ionosphere for earth and so radiowaves and other stuff like HAARP can't work as there's nothing to bounce off of. The moon goes around the Tychonic stationary earth once every single day. The dinosaurs probably were in about 1/3 of our current earth's gravity and it could be explained through the Electric Universe model which can in turn could explain certain mysteries that Christian Creationists have some problems answering.

Feb 29, 2016 @ 07:22</strong>\n\nThere's a certain limit for everyone as to what is within their grasp. We try to explain things with physical metaphors of spiritual, ethereal abstractions because our normal mode of thinking is based off of physical experiences as our minds are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Exposure to certain things might lead people to grasp it, but if they don't have much of a brain to do so, it would slip through the space between their brain cells and come out as a bloody booger. Big ideas are harder to grasp, they are smaller but denser than normal ideas, and small ideas are big enough to grasp with little to no effort as you use them to grasp other ideas of smaller and higher density. Knowledge therefore, is infinitely available and be contained within an infinitesimal point of infinite density within an Omniscient mind. Unfortunately again, physical and created beings can't hold onto such things, it just goes right through them. This is why God had revealed certain things as a foundation for people to at least be able to have a relationship with the Omniscient God that keeps nothing a secret to those he calls a friend. That being said, God keeps an infinite amount of knowledge away from us because created beings can't become Omniscient and it's foolish to think that we can. What he does give to us we might not grasp as to why he had done so based on how man had failed to do as he demanded, but he lets some people to grasp, no, he MAKES some people to grasp certain mysteries that he had predestined for them to grasp. Everyone could be saved, but not everyone will be saved because it is the will of God. Jacob he had loved but Esau he hated before the foundation of the earth was made.\n\nAnyways, I can only do so much in explaining certain concepts. I can't expect everyone to know at what instance was I talking in legal terms or in philosophical terms or in scientific terms or in biblical terms, the \"punchline\" was explained yet just way above your grasp, but does that mean that you're smarter or dumber? That depends on every situation that would make sense in the standpoint of God that knows what is going on while some people might have a bird's eye view, some have a side angle, some have night vision goggles. By faith I know what God had said is true, but I don't know if my faith is always true by my own power and knowledge outside of my faith in Christ. With faith I know that with cause and effect, God is the cause that created the effect that is this Uni-Verse, Genesis 1:1 that everyone is within that universe that is confirmed with evidence, but others with a different faith would know that the cause that created the effect that is \"reality\" doesn't matter and that's because whatever evidence they find would be going in circles. The reality that people describe can be different from each other, therefore, reality is different from one and another but if people sought to get rid of these viscious circular logic and come to the conclusion that God is the cause that created the effect, then through that, one can expose and remove certain lies that is brought forth by science that does not follow cause and effect. The cause was and is and is to come, it just exists. There is a reality, and everyone by faith accepts a reality to be the reality. What is important is to properly define the words we use to each other instead of simply always assuming it is what you think it is when it is what others that say those words define those words themselves that define their reality that may or may not be reality or at least your reality that you believe in by faith.\n\nTo a thinker, the statement: \"One can have free will under God's will\" is a contradiction, but to a lawyer, they would understand it differently with a different explanation through switching up certain words and definitions to make it make sense to their mind so one example could be (I am not a laywer and this is not legal advice): \"People have the divine right of free will within the bounds of God's jurisdiction, so God can revoke that right whenever people breaks his laws, his will for people to obey which there will be punishment for disobeying the law, and to break the law, one assumes to either be above God's jurisdiction to be their own ruler, or they seek to be under another ruler which man was never given dominion over another the same as man having dominion over the plants and the animals and the land that God had entrusted to man\". Some Christians might say that God has a few laws for mankind to obey but things that he made no law for that does not violate his laws, we have the free will to do as we please, even though he knows what would happen and predestinate all things to happen all for his pleasure, though relatively speaking, we don't know what the future holds for us so we have a sort of illusion of free will. We can choose God but God had chosen us first and gives people the broken heart to repent as those people repent seemingly by their acceptance of the truth that is real, but was already a predetermined outcome. Through grace and faith, works that is done in the proper will of God will eventually bear fruit at least from within as it grows more and more as time goes by, but if they have heard another gospel, another will, they would only be doing things in God's authority but not do God's will. This false gospel will deceive the very Elect, which is why we need to reach out to them to wake them up from that lie that they were told by the deaf and blind spirit that deafens their ears and closes their eyes from the truth that they fall asleep when they are exposed to it. God will use the Elect to save the Elect, calling them out of the world to seek to be in the kingdom of God, in the world but not of it.\n\nThose that seek not to build on a foundation are those that are retrogressing society as a whole, but a foundation built on sand is not worth building. Even though Christians have a foundation of truth to build and further advance society and science, if they have not a proper system to build on that foundation that is compatible to the foundation, it then becomes counterproductive and eventually destroys the foundation that they used to hold dear to. In time, Christians had built some things on top of the foundation like the Apostle's Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed, as that then becomes the new foundation for future generations which means that the foundation actually gets wider in area though the cornerstone is immovable, cannot be shaken. Systems that rebel against this in turn seeks to chip off the cornerstone and replace it with a wooden block. It is at times, inevitable that in every generation of generating Christians through the flow of time that people would splinter off of from corruption that used to represent and used to be a proper representation of the truth that they say that they do yet don't. In every succession that is done, the remnant that keeps their path straight actually builds more on top of the foundation properly supported but is going outwards and gaining more perimeter to what they know as being the bounds of Christianity, a better understanding on what liberty they have in Christ through obedience, being freed from more things than before. We had gotten so good at this that at a certain point, we had overvalued so called scholarly research and evidence over the faith. Evidential apologetics at times undermine presuppositional apologetics, it gives away the very foundation and authority that we used to hold onto to others that become the judge over God by basing one's faith through evidence. Faith is not always subject to \"evidence\" (or a seemingly lack thereof), but those with a different faith simply won't see what you are saying.\n\nOne needs to go back home, remember all the logical absolutes and use them properly to never give away our reality dragged down to their damnable level of subjectivity and self interpretation of evidence. There is nothing wrong or egotistical to say that some people simply just don't get something because they have a different reality to yours by their own definitions. If you do have the absolute proof that without God you can't prove anything, then you do know that your reality is God's reality revealed to you which what God says affects everybody and those who rejects God's reality are living in their own reality rejecting the God that they know and in doing so, making themselves fools to God and rejecting the reality that you know is real and is not subjective to man's thinking but is subject to God's authority, God's will, God's laws. If two people define reality differently, those two people do indeed have different realities. There really is no point in wasting too much time on those that time after time, simply reject the simple truth that God is real, that sin is real, and God has given one way to him which is only logically Jesus Christ which will make sense if you repent and accept the gospel, but it is God who convicts you to repentance so you don't do it in your own power, but in God's grace do you repent to accept the faith that God had already given you that you were in rejection for so long. Does this make sense? Do you now understand the type of free will that I believe that Christians have? If you don't, you live in a different reality that is rejecting the reality that God has revealed to man through the bible and through nature and logic itself, and what you do might be done in vain, doing things outside of God's will because of a false will, gospel, faith, religion, dogma, creed, law, jurisdiction, dominion, etc.\n\nIn other words, you might not even be a Christian, or simply you don't understand the definitions I use to explain which then I can only direct you to external sources for reference, but that's just evidence and no matter how much evidence I throw at you, if your presuppositions won't allow you to think properly, you won't accept this reality that God had revealed as to how it really works. People with different realities can't work together for so long without some conflict questioning the very foundation that work is being built on that is either made out of sand or the solid rock foundation that is Jesus Christ. Any pastor that ignores these things to be irrelevant are fools that need to be instructed in the truth again, assuming they had the truth to begin with as Christians. This battle between fake Christians and real Christians will never end until God puts it to an end through initiating all the events prophesied in the book of Revelation. How much mercy would you put up with is not necessarily a \"sin\" if you run out of patience towards a reprobate mind, but that mercy you give to an unbeliever is not the mercy that you would give to a believer, especially a pastor that is risking many people's souls through sermons that's in the grey areas. It all depends more on how much of those people that pastor is deceiving is worth your energy saving, which God determines that length of time of patience and mercy in every situation. Sometimes God won't let you be among unbelievers or deceived Elect for too long because it is in his will for you to leave them behind as you had done what you needed to. Maybe some day some of them that are the Elect will come out of the spiritual whore of Babylon, the Jezebel spirit that binds people through deceitful, unrighteous ways, invoking things that they never given any power to have to begin with like their claims of God being on their side and such fear tactics to push false doctrines through. Pray for (not to nor through) the Elect, the Church in general, but not to be the mediator between God and them like Jesus as if they can be saved through your works.\n\nüí´<strong>Zika Virus, Ebola, Autism, HIV/AIDS, Polio, and more! Mar 2, 2016 @ 02:58</strong>\n\nVaccines, GMOs, petrolchemical synthetics, the -cides (pesticides, insecticides, larvicides, herbicides, etc.), overprocessed foods, fungi, parasites, metals, radiation, wireless radiation, chemical poisoning, unnatural air pollutants including Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering, AKA: Chemtrails, and naturally existing forms of poison like snake venom or poisonous mushrooms. They are all completely harmless things at a distance until it comes into the biosphere. All of those things are to some measure, only possible through human intervention to use against someone while some others are dangerous only through ignorance. I am only going to address some of them in context to the Zika Virus, Ebola, Autism, HIV/AIDS, Polio and more.\n\nAll vaccines follow a certain concept taught none other than Hippocrates. It is to cure like with like. A symptom caused by say a virus is remedied by a small amount of \"dead\" viruses ideally of that same strain. If we just stop right there, you are not going to know anything. Do you see anything wrong with this? Just think for a little bit.\n\nDid you ponder about it yet? I hope you did. Here's a good question: how does one know what virus is in someone only by looking at the symptoms? Why don't they take a blood sample and seek out the viruses within the blood and simply use that as the basis of making a vaccine made just for your specific condition? Why is it only limited to viruses when we have bacteria, fungus (and mycotoxins), cancer cells (there's always a tiny cancer cell cluster somewhere in the body that the white blood cells attempt to get rid of), and parasites? Why can't one look at the blood sample to the lab for a full blown analysis and see if there's other factors that might be contributing to the illness?\n\nConceptually, if one knew what viral strain is causing the illness, there's essentially two ways of putting it inside the body: through an orifice, or bypass the hermetic seal of the skin and directly into the bloodstream without letting the body decide to either absorb or dispose. Injecting anything into the blood is to bypass most of your immune system that is in your guts as gut flora (good bacteria) within the stomach and your intestines. Most of what makes the human body alive is the good bacteria that makes up more than the cells in your body that is you. Capsules bypass the mouth and its saliva and bacteria and release it ideally in the intestines for absorption without being altered by the stomach acids too much. Vaccines must be delivering exactly what the body really needs to be stimulate and provoke the immune system to make it respond to that vaccine and in doing so, letting the white blood cells to know what to look out for in other places of the body. It's like calling the cops by showing them known thieves in front of them and make the whole police station be on the lookout for more thieves. Another example is the concept of making antivenom, but antivenom works when the poison is present, while vaccines can't work like antivenom since it should be to build immunity beforehand. Homeopathy can work as both antivenom and vaccine without any needles.\n\nIf you stop at here, you still are being duped in so many levels, it disgusts me.\n\nAssuming one took a blood sample, keep the blood warm at body temperature and observe what happens, find a bunch of dangerous strain of viruses (viruses in a healthy body are inert, did you know?), let that strain grow a little in a petri dish, kill it safely by heating it up to the temperature that kills the virus, gather some of the remains for the syringe, and inject it in the bloodstream. Then is everything fine and dandy? Unfortunately, there is absolutely no guarantee that there's only dead viruses in the vaccine. Instead of taking out the viruses, if one tries to grow the white blood cells using the same blood of the patient, introduce it with a low dose of viruses in a petri dish, let white blood cells grow and multiply, and then put back your white blood cells back into your body, that seems reasonably safe to me, but unfortunately, I didn't come up with that great idea. I say all that in layman's terms and the technical terms are more complicated, see <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/a-new-era-in-cell-biology-german-company-develops-groundbreaking-alternative-to-stem-cell-therapy-56811912.html\" target=\"_blank\">A New Era in Cell Biology: German Company Develops Groundbreaking Alternative to Stem Cell Therapy</a>\n\nFor the most part, what people dislike about vaccination is the junk within the additive carrying the supposed viruses. You've probably seen a few examples already but here's two that sums it up well: <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/037653_vaccine_additives_thimerosal_formaldehyde.html\" target=\"_blank\"> What's really in vaccines? Proof of MSG, formaldehyde, aluminum and mercury</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3P6wVUH0pc\" target=\"_blank\">This is the Best Explanation of the Vaccine/Autism Connection I've Ever Heard!</a> The second link is very important even for those who are already aware of the dangers of vaccines as it addresses a plethora of other problems like how the vaccine to prevent HPV kills girls, why there's an influx of autism after 2002, that glyphosate removes manganese which makes glutamate toxic as it passes the gut-brain barrier and the glutamate hides the aluminum within it as glutamate goes to the brain and the pineal gland, creating a whole bunch of problems. The original vaccine used applesauce. The additive really doesn't have to be using toxic materials. As long as the material itself be dispersed and held within the biocompatible, liquid solution it should be okay. I don't know if water is fine, just clean the inside of the syringe well and of course, dispose the needles once per use.\n\nWhat doctors and scientists push is the concept of \"herd immunity\". The concept is that if most everyone develops an immunity to something, it would no longer be an issue and those that don't take the vaccine don't really need to as long as the majority does. Unfortunately, that is also a lie. The only herd immunity that is real comes from the DNA received from the parents and their ancestors that had gone through dealing with such dangerous diseases like mumps, measels, rubella as an example. Isolated populations suffer from biological warfare because many of them have not dealt with certain diseases in the past. Those who are immune to certain viruses in turn can act as carriers of that disease. The good thing however, is that there is bound to be survivors of such indigenous people that repopulate and intermingle with the biologically resistant race, although they don't have to as the resistant indigenous people could simply repopulate among themselves, as long as they're not too few in numbers. By that reason alone, multigenerational race mixing (by that I mean all the races in the world) is bound to create a homogeneous gene pool that can be easily exploited to kill off people in such a gene pool. Stuff like the human genome project is making it easy to kill off targeted racial groups with specialized biological weaponry, so why make it easier for them by making everyone into one race, genetically, and through weaponized nanobot virus vaccines targeting the DNA of the host in cells, they can determine the outcome of offsprings and in the process, put in high amounts of various toxins as a softkill program to ensure your lifespan in stunted. Assuming that everyone uses clean and good viral vaccines, even then, the herd immunity as described by these medical quacks (subjectively speaking) does not automatically eliminate a virus, rather, they become potential carriers and they can spread it to others while it's in their system, and those that are not affected by that virus won't display any symptoms yet can have inert viruses that are inert in their bodies but not when it enters into other people.\n\nThe Polio vaccine made by Merck contained a simian virus called SV40 that was the cause of cancer in vaccinated children. Some Americans were against vaccines before the rise of Polio: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20151113030331/http://www.thelibertybeacon.com:80/2014/12/03/forbidden-history-did-you-know-that-raggedy-ann-is-an-iconic-symbol-for-vaccine-induced-injury-and-death/\" target=\"_blank\">Forbidden History: Did You Know that Raggedy Ann is an Iconic symbol for Vaccine Induced Injury and Death?</a> and Polio is caused by DDT toxicity. Believe it or not, I was exposed to DDT and developed Polio like conditions (weak knees) which was mostly fixed with acupuncture and drinking a special TCM vineger concoction. Bedbugs don't die from DDT. Diatomaceous earth might help, but using essential oils that are known to repel bedbugs also help. Another fact about bedbugs is that they can be used to spread small pox and the spread of begbugs in recent years was a deliberate setup. I don't have bedbugs anymore. Anyways, my point is that it's not uncommon for the \"American Medical Association\" funded by Rockefeller and the CDC and other similar alphabet groups to sell poison as medicine through pharmaceutical giant companies with a supposed virus for Polio that doesn't exist all for population control. In a similar note, HIV and AIDS does not exist, just as the Polio virus does not exist. For that, watch this: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsT4GrimfLQ\" target=\"_blank\">House of Numbers Full Documentary</a> and read this: <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/051995_Charlie_Sheen_HIV_positive_false_science.html\" target=\"_blank\">Charlie Sheen does NOT have HIV... AIDS industry skeptic says it's all fabricated based on flimsy, fraudulent science</a> What was originally caused GRID (Gay-related immune deficiency) is lung irritation through poppers and the unhealthy active Homosexual/Sodomite lifestyle of partying and sex. Since you don't have to be gay to use poppers or have STDs and party every night, GRID became known as AIDS.\n\nSome of the Gulf War syndrome is caused by the Anthrax vaccine though it can also be blamed on other things like DU (Depleted uranium) and psychiatry but of course the government won't admit it. See: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmvuYTH5nU0\" target=\"_blank\">The Hidden Enemy: Psychiatry</a>. The Enterovirus probably also does not exist as it might be caused instead by the -cides similar to DDT or the vaccines as this simple softkill method works, killing you with one thing then blame it on a virus then kill you with vaccines then label it as an isolated event.\n\nMeasles occur these days in people who get the MMR vaccine. Anyone that gets a vaccine should be quarrantined for up to four weeks because there are active viruses in them. Measles can be treated with Homeopathic medicine and TCM. Measles parties was a thing long ago, similar to the Chicken Pox parties thing. If people naturally develop immunity to measles without vaccination, they then can have a higher immunity stronger against certain types of cancer cells in the body. If anything, the reintroduction of seeming nonexistent diseases due to better hygiene, food, and water in modern societies does not come from people but from the vaccines that infects people, mostly children than in turn infects others in schools which spreads elsewhere. In other words, they're doing more harm than good.\n\nNow you might be wondering, how can viruses be inert? To understand that, you need to realize that one of the purpose of bacteria, fungus, viruses, and even amoebas is to be nature's decomposers. If you got heavy metal toxicity, bacteria, fungus, cancer cells, and viruses hold onto them and as the body gets rid of them as waste material, the metals leave with them, but only if you can get rid of the metals themselves. One needs to look into natural chelators (look it up) to get rid of the metal junk and in turn it will get rid of the things attached to them. Hepatitis ABCDE whatever is generally associated with liver toxicity. Clean up the liver, stop drinking alcohol, eat healthy, and it might go away. I don't think it always has to be a STD to cause similar symptoms of Hepatitis. Bacteria, fungus, cancer cells, and viruses thrive in acidic surroundings. Eating a more neutral, slightly alkaline pH diet would help regulate the blood's pH levels. That doesn't mean that one should give up on naturally acidic foods and fats. If your blood gets more oxygen in the system, it would also help as they can't survive in such a state, but one needs to get more natural antioxidants in their system so that your body can utilize that. Literally breathing cleaner air and breathing more every day can rejuvenate your blood with more oxygen. The problem with modern vitamins and minerals is that they are not derived from the plants or animals in its natural form so it instead builds up as toxins stored as fat, or as expensive pee, and has low absorption levels so what you see on the label, you would generally get like 10% of that. There's much information out there concerning these things.\n\nSo in a healthy body, bacteria, viruses, fungus, and cancer cells are properly attacked by white blood cells every day from spreading and doing any further damage than what was already done and it already has the proper antibodies being created to attack them. If that healthy body does get sick, it gets warm and forces a temperature increase to sterilize. We call that a fever. Being in a sauna room mimics a fever.\n\nThe realistic solution to an epidemic is proper sterilization and sanitation protocols. Since those GM mosquitos are being dropped off at various locations like Mexico and such, it is important to find ways to protect your skin from contact, but if you didn't know by now from the links that I've shown you and the things that I've already said to conclude that the toxic crap sprayed to kill off these GM mosquitos and on the food crops, these deadly herbicides and pesticides, they are also dangerous, and so are the vaccines and the GM mosquitos that instead of getting rid of diseases, only aid in spreading more of them.\n\nWhat we call as vaccines are not the vaccines that we want to use. Disdain from taking vaccines or be a Jew by faith, since Jews have kosher vaccines that might not have none of the junk that us goyims have and it also might not contain any viruses to keep the Jews alive and get away with what they had done. These white so called Jews are mostly Ashkenazi Jews which are mostly gypsies and Ashkenazi by DNA, not Jews by DNA. Sephardi Jews are seen as more legit, although they see themselves superior over Morrocan Jews and Ethiopian Jews. In a biblical standpoint, they are not biblical Jews but of the Rabbinical system that is not the Levitical system, so biblical Judaism is long gone. A \"Jew\" is more of a citizenship under God's kingdom, but through Jesus Christ, Jews had to be Christians or else they were no longer in God's kingdom and thus, not God's children.\n\nThe Zika virus in Columbia was associated with the Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome but in Brazil, there is no symptoms of paralysis found in those supposedly identified to have the Zika virus present in them. There's 25,000 cases of microcephaly in USA every year: <a href=\"https://birdflu666.wordpress.com/2016/02/02/busted-25000-cases-of-microcephaly-in-the-us-per-year/\" target=\"_blank\">Busted: 25,000 cases of microcephaly in the US per year</a> so really the logical conclusion is that there is another cause to microcephaly outside of the Zika virus, yet there are pregnant women taking vaccines to prevent said Zika virus will probably get a child born with microcephaly or autism or some other thing, a vicious cycle. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta38Ax4jfZQ\" target=\"_blank\">The Zika Files: DEET is part of a binary chemical weapon targeting your brain</a>\n\nEbola, unlike the Zika virus, is more like the DDT caused Polio because people with Polio don't get it from the vaccines that actually gives them cancers and tumors because of the SV40 in it. Why? The Ebola that Liberians and other Africans had was from formaldehyde water poisoning and simply general malnutrition which hospitalized Ebola patients were fed good, untainted food and water for once in their miserable lives. <a href=\"http://www.liberianobserver.com/security/breaking-formaldeyde-water-allegedly-causing-ebola-symptoms\" target=\"_blank\">BREAKING: Formaldeyde in Water Allegedly Causing Ebola-like Symptoms</a> Most of the affected areas just happened to be places affected by Boko Haram and in other African countries that is distracted from getting their oil from China instead of the US.

Whether actual ebola is spreading around, we might not fully know, but we do know that formaldehyde contamination is real. During that scare in western influenced media, colloidal silver was popularized but colloidal silver works to disabling the catalytic enzyme in charge of oxygen metabolism so that bacteria, viruses, fungi would be attacked in a oxygen rich environment, it works around the problem, therefore, there is no guarantee that it will specifically target ebola. Intravenous Vitamin C might work, and so would ozone therapy, but really, people should look into frequency healing technology that's all encompassing like say the Multi Wave Oscillator. Craig Oxley's analysis about Ebola is probably more reliable than mines: <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/UHM/the-scaremongering-and-treatment-for-the-ebola-virus/\" target=\"_blank\">The scaremongering &amp; treatment for the deadly Ebola virus</a>.\n\nConcerning influenza, it all usually tries to create cytokine storming in the lungs. See this for basic tips: <a href=\"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/05/prweb383231.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Natural Bird Flu Medicine and Antivirals</a> \"Boosting\" your immune system against influenza won't work as well since the immune system itself is making things worse which is why it's creating the cytokine storming. Besides the methods listed in that link, one can force coughing and sterilization within the lungs through breathing ozonated air but it's highly not suggested, especially to those suseptible to asthma attacks. Drinking colloidal silver water and ozonated water (I don't suggest ozonating colloidal silver water but go ahead) might help. Boneset is the recommended herb. Influenza is real, but the vaccines for it won't help at all.\n\nBe very careful with the Lassa Fever: <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/missionary-infected-with-lassa-fever-being-treated-in-the-u-s/#comment-6116\" target=\"_blank\">http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/missionary-infected-with-lassa-fever-being-treated-in-the-u-s/#comment-6116</a>.\n\nVaccines are more dangerous than the viruses and diseases that they seek to prevent, but it's just one of many variables in the playing field against your health. If you haven't gone to <a href=\"http://jimstone.is\" target=\"_blank\">jimstone.is</a>, you should do it, since you'll find the bulk of the information (<a href=\"http://archive.is/CCgIc\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.is/CCgIc</a>) of what I'm about to re-word and in some ways, simplify for my target audience.\n\nAnywho, let's start off with the origin of pet allergies before the 80's: you've guessed it, those viruses were cultured in animal cells which getting allergic to certain animals becomes a side effect. Although even before the mid 1980's there were aluminum, thimersol and other junk that may had caused autism before autism was properly understood in the 1950's as it was in the case of Dr. Aajonus Vonderplanitz which he cured his autism with raw eggs and raw milk during his 20's, modern vaccines ultimately can't be remedied of its dangerous side effects because it uses human cells, primarily from aborted fetuses retrieved from Planned Parenthood at least the majority made in America. Ever since aborted fetus cells were used in the mid 1980's autism rates increased. Beware of human albumin, and the human cell lines MRC-5, and WI-38 ingredients listed in vaccines as ingredients. Do you want to see a official list directly from the CDC? See: <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf</a>. Nobody can separate the viruses from the cells that those viruses came from as in, there is no flawless extraction method (nor any method altogether) to get viruses away from the cells without having some cell DNA and cell tissue mixed into the concoction. Some viruses can only propagate in human cells, therefore, whatever human organ cell that is used to propagate such viruses, your immune system will attack the corresponding human organ cell tissue and DNA, while metals present in the vaccine simply is a magnet of bacteria, fungus/cancer and viruses, generally in destructive synergy with the different types of metals in an increased assault inside your body as your white blood cells are reprogrammed to destroy the host cells while trying to remove the metals in the body, and no, your white blood cells don't know the difference between your DNA and cell tissue from another human's, hence, the increased rates of autism.\n\nMany scientists have now hypothesized that cancer and other childhood neurological diseases such as autistic disorder are caused by mutations in the child‚Äôs DNA. This conclusion is based upon finding numerous mutations in the brains and/or blood of such children which cannot be found in their parents, these are called de novo mutations. They are caused by something that happens to the child after birth (early vaccination). SCPI researches have extensively reviewed the potential health risks posed by this residual human DNA. Based upon that research, SCPI does ongoing research and seeks to raise awareness of the potential health risks of manufacturing medical products on human cell lines. Every child who receives the MMR vaccine gets at least a 10 point IQ reduction for life, and the worst hit develop full blown autism. The implications here is that your brain is not entirely your own, you have a parasitic entity that becomes a part of your brain but in its process of integration, you either get dumber or become a \"gifted\" high functioning autist, and what if I told you, that these elites don't do this without any reason.\n\nProbably the main purpose in creating autistic people is for the technocratic future. According to the England Hypothesis, named after research journalist Christina England, vaccine-induced autism is an intentional chemical manipulation to create worker drones ‚Äì sterile, docile, unable to question the conditions handed to them for their lives, content with boring, repetitive tasks, placid, disposable and interchangeable. In short, autists are the 'deltas' and 'epsilons' of the brave New World Order consistent with the genocidal aspirations of globalization via Agenda 21. Here's a doctor's analysis about it: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p3DHtxjLlg\" target=\"_blank\">DeltaProject</a>. In said globalization hierarchy, the \"Neo Aristocrats\" is at the top, law enforcement is at the middle, delta and epsilon technicians are at the bottom. Most labor is done by robots, the workforce is unnecessary therefore they need to be killed off by softkill while going through mind programming as their offsprings are chemically stunted of their physical and mental growth while they become infertile also chemically which Stevia makes one infertile by the way, which then they push recreational sex and such that won't help population growth anyways. Being creative and multiplying are both the nature of life for us people, which is managed through a patriarchal system that chastises women as God intended in the bible and is simply an historical fact that such societies fluorish while in its impending destruction, matriarchal societies come about but never lasts too long after the destruction of society that man had made and run as leaders. The delta and epsilon autistic males lack proper education and mental capacity to grasp when they should be submissive, assertive, and aggressive as their aggression becomes passive and they don't know how to be assertive while they respond improperly concerning the situations that they are in that they are aware of almost everything that they need to know. As the females become masculine in their roles, they seek masculinity in females since the males being effeminate psychologically and even chemically can't satisfy their desire for masculinity in them while males can't find feminine females since women being \"liberated\" from males see masculine males as their sex toys that they're entitled to, which means less people have sex ironically, especially the men, but in another twist, many of these women pushing for these ideals are unattractive to most men except for whiteknighting kiss ass men that seeks to gain their attention but in utter failure for the most part.\n\nHow would such people gain a living? They simply get free money from the government while having people work for imaginary currencies like bitcoins and such. What do you think Virtual Reality games and games like Minecraft and such is really doing to the minds of impressionable autistic children behind a computer? Labor can be done remotely and virtually for profit. It's either put society in a persistent coma hooked up to an IV forver, or change the current Zeusian system altogether for a better Promethean type of system that's backed by gold and guns with a goal that brings all people together like continuing space exploration for expansion. At a certain point in around 500 years later in real dedication for furthering and utilizing the creative, spontaneous will of mankind properly, space colonization is a plausible feat assuming we continue to multiply, learn to be creative (seeking new scientific discoveries) the right way by bringing forth intuition into intellect of the nature of reality that God had made so that it could be known. Such a Promethean society is in its awakening through the BRICS system, mostly from the support of Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, picking up where JFK and Gaddafi left things.\n\nOne last trick (more to come) the medical industry has done is to abuse the whole \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\" thing which is what they are doing to the whole Zika scaremongering. \"Doctors also are worried that Zika exposure in utero may have hidden effects, such as behavioral problems or learning disabilities, that are not apparent at birth.\", that is the excuse that will push the use of vaccines and the -cides, ignoring that even one percent of the microcephaly cases have actually been exposed to Zika. This is precisely why they are claiming autism rates will hit 50 percent by 2035, because they have their road map. Society cannot survive a 50 percent autism rate, this is cold hard proof that they do not want a New World Order, and instead, they want the near total death of mankind. That death will come via the needle.\n\nA Zeusian system is either Satanic or Luciferian but they're both one and the same. A Talmudic/Kronos/Saturnalian system can also be either Satanic or Luciferian but it's not Zeusian although they can and they are teamed up. The \"New World Order\" that they want to make is a (pseudo)scientific, Luciferian Order that benefits Zeusians (Venetians, Aristocrats) and the Synagoge of Satan/Worshipers of Kronos (Ashkenazi Jews by faith, some Sephardi Jews included). A Zeusian adheres to Aristotle's Aristocratic system as well as the teachings of Bertrand Russell and Aleister Crowley while the Tribe adheres to the Talmud and the Zohar of its mystical, demonic influences that is best described as the djinns as how the Islamic faith describes these malevolent demonic shadow entities that flee when mentioning Jesus Christ with conviction in proper biblical context and faith. The Jews by rabbinical faith continuing from the Pharisees which adopted Babylonian traditions and mysticism after the diaspora again (once before during Daniel's time) where they had elaborated on their oral traditions to the point of writing them down. As long as the Jews are among the Aristocrats, they ultimately have nothing against each other, just different sources of evil that goes hand in hand with each other as equals but truth be told, the worshipers of Kronos and their influences are worse than the Zeusians as they work in all levels of the system while the Venetians tend to pull the strings through smokes and mirrors as time went by, they use less and less of their proxies pertaining to the Jesuits that has lost their power and influence overall in comparison to the power the Jews have over others.\n\nThere are shills within the alternative health realm that claim that nagalase is the cause of the increased rates of autism. Those people (the people behing the \"The Truth About Cancer\" docu-series) do more damage than good when they make such claims because they are implying that you can unchimarize yourself of the de novo mutations which by the way, what affects your flesh and blood brain also affects your flesh and blood heart that contains similar \"brain tissue\", many of those who've \"changed their heart\" started to display behaviors that the organ donor had that was not a part of the behavior that the recipient had before. Your \"soul\" is not complete without your own brain and heart present, and these people say that GMOs can be detoxified and be changed with a organic, non-GMO diet while then implying that de novo mutations can be removed entirely. Oh how wrong can they be! They've even showed homeopathic patients cured of cancer yet in a QnA, reject homeopathy as a reliable cure for cancer or for anything for that matter, pushing the controlled opposition Naturopathy stance falsely misrepresenting what Homeopathics has to say and yes, Homeopathy also works against autism if you find a good doctor that had properly identified your miasms and personality profile that requires a constitutional remedy fit for your personality, although for the most part, your constitution rarely affect remedies that works for most people. There is no known cure for de novo mutations. The Jews opt out of vaccines using human cells while opting in of vaccines using animal cells or simply nothing but metals which can be detoxed when done right, but remember, the State of Israel's average IQ is 94, they're not as smart as they want you to think that they are \"master race\" as naive Protestants overglorify their genetics, but on the other side, they have very low autism rates. Instead of trying to be smarter, they push everyone to be dumber as chattel/cattle, goyim, autistic delta/epsilon sheeple workers in a spiritual coma. Don't take vaccines and seek vaccines that doesn't have human cells when forced to. It does not matter in a logical standpoint whether those cells are from Planned Parenthood or third generation cells that they lie in your face about since either way, vaccines containing them can cause de novo mutations.\n\nFear shuts down kidney function, so do not fear, but to do that, you need to fear something greater than your fears. Fear the Lord God Almighty. The constant fearmongering in TV and other media is keeping one in an eternal state of panic, overusing the adrenals and weakening the kidneys which in turn, affects the mind and create general old people problems earlier than your real age.\n\nüí´<strong>Everything wrong with \"Protestantism\" Mar 4, 2016 @ 22:22</strong>\n\nIt's no secret that I don't like everything about what those in the name of the Reformed Faith had done against humanity. This is just an incomplete list.\n\n1. The Protestants took over the monasteries (AKA: Dissolution/Suppression of the Monasteries) through Henry VIII of England's Cestui Que Vie Act of 1540 which in turn, enslaved the British people much more. Taken from http://one-heaven.org/canons/positive_law/article/100.html#2042:<blockquote>In 1534, prior to the 1st Cestui Que Vie Act (1540), Henry VIII declared the first Cestui Que Vie type estate with the Act of Supremecy which created the Crown Estate. In 1604, seventy (70) years later, James I of England modified the estate as the Crown Union (Union of Crowns). By the 18th Century, the Crown was viewed as a company. However by the start of the 19th Century around 1814 onwards upon the bankruptcy of the company (1814/15), it became the fully private Crown Corporation controlled by European private banker families.</blockquote>\n\nProtestants only focus on the Cestui Que Vie Act of 1666 yet ignore anything preceeding it.\n\n2. Protestants had forgotten the real purpose behind vows, but so did the Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians, which Martinus Lutherus declared that monastic vows to be unbiblical but in doing so, all Protestants had gotten the false impression that all vows are not biblical. So what are biblical vows and in what condition do people can or can't do biblical vows? See: <a href=\"http://www.hisholychurch.org/media/books/FCR/Biblical%20support%20of%20vows.php\" target=\"_blank\">The Free Church Report Appendix 5. Biblical Support of Vows</a>.\n\n3. The Anglicans (they're unfortunately also \"Protestants\") kept church life and their worldly life separate just like Catholics and other religions.\n\n4. Anglicans and Lutherans and some others used symbols and kept some traditions that were serving as distractions to the Reformed Faith that Puritans and Separatists were quick to point out with their iconoclastic ways.\n\n5. Protestants as a whole were somewhat conflicted and confused with doing \"Christ-mass/Saturnalia\" and \"Eostre\" but now the majority of Protestants are traditionalists that seeks to do something on holidays even if it's pagan, Catholic, or a national holiday that is a huge distraction as to the purpose of the church since the state had taken most of its rituals and responsibilities away from the church.\n\n6. Though the Celtic Christians (they're not Protestants) used to serve God on the Sabbath, but because of to calendar miscalculations, misinterpretation of the bible, and adoption of Sunday worship from Catholicism, the Protestants had blindly accepted Sunday worship as the new Sabbath and enforced it. However, half of the reason why they had done that was to prevent Jewish infiltration and destruction of the church yet they had found their way into power nevertheless.\n\n7. Jehan Cauvin pushed an humanistic approach that asserted that prosperity and profit gained from good honest hard work is a qualifying factor of being a visible saint which is seeming contradictory to what most people think of as \"Calvinism\" but this implied that those that do hard work yet don't make much profit and be fruitful might have something wrong with them, and that those predestined to be poor might not be saved because they're lazy because they're poor, in an unbreakable cycle of destruction. That of course is not always true, but it creates a sense of social class divide, an invisible caste system created through an exclusive community that keeps unwanted people away even if they are self professing honest working Christians, they are highly judgemental of each other. Some Puritans (Puritans don't call themselves Puritans) believed that people were predestined to have certain amount of wealth and prosperity, ergo, there can be Christians that are hard workers yet are still poor no matter how much time goes by not because something's wrong with them. There was a form of salvation through works through the Calvinist roots of Protestantism that had become a part of American culture to the point of thinking that's the whole biblical picture when stuff like vows of poverty are biblical, and they don't take martyrdom/persecution from the world into consideration as a reason why Christians can be poor or sick or anything seen negatively which in recent years, that exactly became the case as the middle class becomes the lower class while the rich gets richer through deception and accumulation of debt notes as a number on a computer. In the end, some of the formerly arrogant descendants of the Puritans are getting the bad end of the joke along with the poor Christians as they both seek to not give up their liberty to the state anymore. Yes there can be internal reasons to be a plausible cause to making people reap what they sow, but to overspiritualize problems to always have an internal source is really a sign of totalitarian methods of indoctrination and suppression of the truth that draws people's attention away from external reasons of their own demise not deliberatly brought upon themselves through their own actions but through the actions of others brought against them without giving up their own libery, violated. The Neighborhood Witch Hunt is downplayed now because of how secular the world has become, but it is somewhat there in the air when you are among a group of fundamental Protestants and if you're not of their race*. They no longer know how to truly love their neighbor as themselves correctly as they don't have much time to contemplate on this simple fallacious argument surrounding the false foundation of their society as they value work more than life, profit more than stability, living shallow, covertly humanistic lives, not questioning the things in this list as their salvation (and their lives) hinges on the approval of others. These problems can be alleviated if these people lived farther apart from each other instead of being too busy sticking their noses in their neighbor's windows and keeping their enemies closer to blackmail them when given the opprotunity. In other words, they had made the same mistakes the Israelites made as they now relinquished their authority to the world once again because the newer generation abused their power. Seeking to do the weightier matters of the law without knowing what that really is is like a fool that does sermons \"by the holy spirit\" without doing absolutely any prep work in studying the scriptures and attacking the bereans that point out his faults in loving (agapao) rebuke.\n\n* Whatever definition of race (commonwealth/national, ethnic, spiritual, cultural, social class divide, etc.) that came into your mind, it's exactly that but it's also the other definitions as well, it's all of the above and one or the others yet it happens even among the most \"mixed\".\n\n8. The words: Protestant Reformation has a double meaning since they don't necessarily have to be Christians, but those that protest against Catholicism and Papists and seek to reform the Roman Catholic Church. It's really a questioning of authority that creates a divide et impera situation to take some powers away from the Roman Catholic Church to the hands of the Venetians and the persecuted underground Knight Templars seeking revenge as the Lollards onwards but they had later merged with the Venetians and its English Freemasonry that they brought to Britain before the Knight Templars had come to Britain, and who controlled the crusades? The Venetians!\n\n9. Though Lutherans were anti Rabbinical Jews, the Protestants later in time lost their way as they succumb to the lies from the British Empire that sought to create a state of Israel through reforming the Jews. In other words, some Protestants became Zionists, and so was Nazi Germany. There were no greater than 5 digits of Jews (mostly Ashkenazi) that died in the Holohoax in the labor camps, many of which were anti Zionist Jews that was sent to the labor camps in an attempt to keep them at check and also to keep them safe from the war protected by German soldiers but what really killed the people was not the Germans but the Typhus outbreak which was the reason why hair was shaved then they were immediately went to the shower room and then given new clothes to wear while their shoes and clothes were passed through Zyklon B to kill off the lice. Anyways, Zionism supports the Jewish people to do what they ought not to do which is to come back to their land without repenting and without a change of heart in accepting Jesus Christ as their Savior and King as demanded in their Tanakh. Though there is a Venetian side to Zionism as they see themselves as \"<a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-chosen/\" target=\"_blank\">The Chosen</a>\", I'm not going to talk about that here. The Jewish controlled Communism had slew way over 100 million in WWII, 66 million of them being in the gulags, the majority of them being Christians, yet these Zionist Jews wants to blame others for sending the anti Zionist Jews into certain demise.\n\n10. Through the promotion of the Anglican King James Bible, Protestants had later gained interest on the uninspired Apocrypha and had adopted a new heresy called \"Solo Scriptura\". See: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-error-of-solo-scriptura/\" target=\"_blank\">The Error of Solo Scriptura</a>. Because of Solo Scriptura, it has spawned forth various cults and made themselves weak against Jesuit infiltration and infiltration in general.\n\n11. Practically most of the junk the Quakers had done to making the American republic more liberal and democratic even before the Freemasons and Catholics came into the picture. Though they had done things that are similar to the Puritans, in the things that they differ, Christians casually forget why they were unbiblical and only focuses on the good that they had done, which these duped Christians also do that when it comes to Anglicanism and Espicolicanism and other similar sects under the control of the British Monarchy just because Anglicans are technically Protestants.\n\n12. The Anglicans created or at least thoroughly infiltrated the already corrupt Pentecostalism, hiding their tracks by saying that the Methodists indirectly created the Pentecostal movement which is partially true but not it is not the entire picture. See: <a href=\"http://www.larouchepub.com/other/1997/ahc.html\" target=\"_blank\">British Subversion of the United States: The militias and Pentecostalism</a>. Pentecosalism's more corrupt sects like the New Apostolic Reformation are not only \"Evangelical\" in evangelizing their lies, but they're also Zionists and Messianics subservient to Rabbis and the international Jewish mob (MOSSAD, B'nai B'rith), they also tend to be incorporating paganism and Satanism and its leaders are usually in Freemasonic Orders or in Catholic Orders.\n\n13. The Anglican church also created the World Council of Churches for the New Venetian Empire though Protestants ignore that and only focuses on the Vatican's attempt to control all the sects under the WCC. Why the Orthodox church still go to the Vatican, I don't know, though some of them do hope some day that the schism would come to an end. Why the church leaders of prominent Protestant sects bow down to the Pope and kiss his Freemasonic ring and touch his dirty hands, I don't know, they're probably not Christians.\n\n14. The Anglican church supported Oliver Cromwell's evil reign of terror over the Irish people treated worse than the black slaves under Catholic colonies. See: <a href=\"http://www.schillerinstitute.org/economy/nbw/pot_famine95.html\" target=\"_blank\">How British Free Trade Starved Millions During Ireland's Potato Famine</a>.\n\n15. Though not solely a problem caused by Protestants, many had become too liberal and became more nondemoninational while loosing their grip on the chastisement of women. Western culture and western men are to blame for giving up their power to women to rule over them as these women choose to let other nations and religions destroy their country as seen in the Anglosphere and in Europa through open immigration without due process, without having them integrate to the host nation's customs. See: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxpVwBzFAkw\" target=\"_blank\">Why Women DESTROY NATIONS * / CIVILIZATIONS ‚Äì and other UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS</a> * UNINTENTIONALLY and/or INADVERTENTLY.\n\n16. Many Protestants seek to use evidence to prove their faith, but in doing so, had rendered the seat of the judge meant for God to be given to the people they're debating.\n\n17. Anglicans and some KJVO people rationalize how any monarch that is a Protestant is a biblical monarch when in doing so, reject the real King, Jesus Christ. In a similar manner, many Protestants give authority to the state instead of letting the beast starve. As churches give up their ecclesiastical authority by becoming agents of the IRS or any state goverment body that should had been separate from the church government body, they commit the same sins as the Anglicans.\n\n18. Protestants claim that empiricism and the renaissance was attributed to their success, but really it is the success of the Venetians that brought their knowledge to Albion Isles that's now known as the British Isles, which again, it was the Venetians that had funded the Reformers. Here's my \"proof\": <a href=\"http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/how-the-venetian-system-was-transplanted-into-england/\" target=\"_blank\">How the Venetian System Was Transplanted Into England</a> <a href=\"http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/the-role-of-the-venetian-oligarchy/\" target=\"_blank\">The Role of the Venetian Oligarchy in Reformation, Counter-reformation, Enlightenment, and the Thirty Years‚Äô War</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRfR6tvUZKs\" target=\"_blank\">Venetian Oligarchy</a>. Re-learn the Reformation from sources not only from Protestants but also from historians and take note of any mention of the Venetians, Venice, Switzerland (Home of the Pharaohs and Templars), the British Monarchy, crypto-Jews, etc. All the so called founding father of science Creationists associate as \"Christians\" are empiricists and con artists that ripped off the research of others. Science had existed independently from Christianity and had existed even before Moses' Israel came about. Many of the rules Moses came up with probably had some influences from learning in the Egyptian library he had access to concerning hygiene and diet. The Puritans were too supersticious to conduct proper examination of those displaying bizzare behavior to might having a physical disease of sorts, an external cause behind their problems that isn't necessarily caused by demons. Unfortunately, since empiricism took over science yet again, you won't find real doctors that can identify your exact problems all that easily even among so called hollistic doctors, as they lack a full education concerning everything about the human body as things are compartmentalized. Chiropractors only work on the spine, Podiatrists only work on the feet, Iridologists only observe the eye to identify possible problems in patients, many other so called hollistic doctors simply prescribe medicine to their patients that might work but they don't do much of anything beyond diagnosis and treatment through machinery like say using the hyperbaric oxygen chamber, but TCM doctors work on all of the body through various methods and techniques, a generally wider spectrum, and if you're lucky, a great TCM doctor could also adjust your spine, hips, ankles, wrists, shoulders, neck, they are not limited to the spine like Chiropractors so you can get rid of Chiropractors, Podiatrists, and many other doctors for specific parts of your body. The pursuit of knowledge is separate from the pursuit of life, but to have life, some knowledge is beneficial to life unless if it destroys life. Knowing enough to keep that destructive knowledge away from destroying life is necessary or else people will be destroyed by a lack of knowledge concerning life and its antithesis that is simply anything that isn't life.\n\nTo sum it all up, Protestants have a selective memory towards certain things, trying to bury everything wrong with Protestantism to being isolated mistakes but it affects us all. If Protestants get rid of the cancer that is the Anglican church, a good chunk of church history that had created the problems we deal with today would be blamed to the Anglicans and really, Anglicans should be considered not only as a schism of the Reformed Faith, but also a cheating whore that is in communion with the Roman Catholic Church and the Venetians that seeks to destroy them and Protestants and Catholics and Orthodox Christians will do so by controlling and funding millitant Islamic people in their favor as Saudi Arabia owes the Empire trillions and knows that the Western people will be enraged when they release a portion of the information concerning the censored 28 pages of the 9/11 commission report that identifies a few of the big names behind 9/11. They of course won't include much of the ties Saudi Arabia has with UK and USA. If there is a biblical Reformed Protestant church, I would had found it by now. There can be a biblical church, it just won't associate itself with the negatives of Protestantism, Catholicism, and Orthodoxy, only whatever worth extracting from them that adheres to the bible. Though some had tainted the name of Jesus Christ by doing things that is against the will of God, no matter what denomination, sect, schism, nation they are in, God will not be mocked, he will give them the punishment they had reaped in the lake of fire.\n\nüí´<strong>If we had gone to the moon Mar 7, 2016 @ 05:47</strong>\n\nIf we had gone to the moon, we would have to make certain preparations in order to make the improbable, possible, and also reexamine the purpose behind those that perpetuate a lie concerning the moon landing being a hoax.\n\nFirst and foremost, all calculations needs to be done from a Tychonic geocentric perspective, then from the mooncentric perspective assuming we would go back home. Why is that important? It's to make things EASIER to calculate the trajectory of point A to point B in the perspective of point A than to calculate the trajectory of point A to point B in the perspective of point C. Scientists still struggle with the three-body problem, so the only purpose to obscure the actual distances between the moon and the earth is to do it in the perspective of the sun, while promoting the heliocentric model to be used in every situation. Second, there needs to be some way of shielding the space shuttle and the space suits to protect themselves from the Van Allen belts' radiation, and also when going through the earth's atmosphere. The space suits are not really meant to go through the earth's atmosphere but the space shuttle uses ceramics for that purpose, but what would they defend themselves from the Van Allen belts? Polyethylene, and 3 millimeters of it is needed to have enough protection. Even with that, astronauts are in potential danger from direct contact from solar flares and many develop problems up in space and after coming back to earth, but they're still alive and they're not fried up. If you still pay for those TV sets with DVR and if you live in the USA, you can probably see the NASA TV channel for yourself. Just leave that channel on and learn the rudiments concerning all things space exploration. You could optionally look for Youtube videos of foreign space programs in what they do because the fundamentals don't change. Third, to make sure the moon landing goes right, they need to play pretend, set up a studio in doing simulations of the moon landings for practice and to avoid making certain mistakes. In later years, many of these simulations are done in a big indoor pool for a more realistic training, dealing with similar replica machinery that they intend to fix or improve in the real thing up there in the ISS. Of course some moon landings were faked and was shown on TV, it was an exercise for the real thing but it seems like some people didn't know that studio footage was aired on TV at times, though there were real footages aired on TV. If you want to know what NASA has to say, see this: <a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/frame.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apollo Lunar Surface Journal</a>. Where did I get the claim that NASA aired mock moon landings on TV? Look at this: <a href=\"http://archive.is/8jpF0\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.is/8jpF0</a>. That link by itself debunks many of the claims made by moon hoaxers and in extension, flat earthers. I'm also drawing some other information from it as well for this article, so to give credit where it's due, thanks Jim Stone for being firm in your stance. I don't really need to prove that the moon landing was real beyond this point really, I've directed you to where I get these claims from.\n\nOkay, so here comes the theoretical part of this. I prefer talking about what NASA MIGHT be hiding. If the moon landing is real, then what are some examples of such conspiracy theories surrounding what they really done up in the moon, for what purpose did they go there and what did they see, what did they take back to earth? What if aliens are real, what if UFOs are real?\n\nHere's a link dump that makes an attempt to answer these questions:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-N_r4JVhXo\" target=\"_blank\">Aliens On The Moon The Truth Exposed 2014 - Aliens documentary NEW</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W1FEMkYM14\" target=\"_blank\">Aliens Come From Hell -- MIRRORED By SHIELD OF THE SON</a>\n<a href=\"http://humansarefree.com/2015/12/where-on-earth-are-nasas-rovers-sending.html\" target=\"_blank\">Where On Earth Are NASA's Rovers Sending Pictures From?

The reason why the Eric Dollard video's there is because of his claim of making two literal identical scalar wave portals that transfers anything that goes through it to the other side with no delay, but it was destroyed by the US government before he get to do what he wanted to do since to him, the science is there. If his claim was true, and if the Aliens come from Hell video is also true concerning making portals on the moon, we need to come to the conclusion that portals are plausible, assuming you're as smart as Eric Dollard. There can be demons posing as aliens, but really the real problem is that humans can drive these UFOs, not necessarily dependent on demons, that governments also made pacts with them in pushing the Alien Agenda and the False Messiah Agenda. The Primary Water video is about how there's water beneath the earth and that there's sometimes passages into the underground global ocean beneath the earth's crust, above the magma. It can be a plausible hideout and have its own ecosystem, though whatever lifeforms that lives there would be one of those iron eating bacteria or some \"Alien\" base, and where the body of the fallen angels and demons are, assuming the \"Sons of God\" meant the fallen angels instead of the traditional interpretation of \"Sons of God\" being of the line of Seth marrying the corrupt line of Cain or the \"Daughters of Men\" as Cain has no lineage to God but stops at Adam.\n\nI would rather think that the \"Daughters of Men\" might have the blood of the fallen angels, and so would the wives that married Noah's children. There is no hollow earth, but simply there being abundant pure water beneath the crust. Jim Stone suggests that if there was a hollow earth, that core would be of tungsten vapor. The reason why did I share that EU (Electric Universe) workshop video is to explain the special gravity that earth might had which is a third of our current gravity which then in turn might explain how dinosaurs could had grown so big, and it might be able to explain why there might had been giant humanlike skeletons though whether they are real or faked is another matter altogether. It might then give explanation as to the longevity of the human lifespan before the great flood and the possible space explorations to the moon being three times easier to do then and thus, plausible reasons why there might be ancient structures created none other than people. The Destruction of NASA video is a basic history and purpose of NASA. Although abductions could be real, it isn't always done by \"demons\" but by real people since they had been perfecting and building these UFOs through the guidance of these \"aliens\" so it's not just solely used by these \"aliens\". The first link is the general overview of what is commonly shared among conspiracy theorists about these matters. The Case Against the Book of Enoch link is there to show that the Book of Enoch is useless yet it is promoted by Christians that believe aliens are demons. There can be structures on the moon, there can be many different precious elements on the moon, but what really matters is the Helium-3 up there that can be used to further nuclear fusion technology to phase out nuclear fission technology for a more cleaner, more powerful source of higher energy density to meet the demands of a higher population. Before China thought of mining Helium-3, it was Americans that came up with that plan.\n\nIf we really did go to the moon, then the flat earthers and the moon hoaxers are simply wrong. Though there are some lies propagated by NASA like faking Mars pictures which Mars might actually have a blue sky just like our home, NASA have kept certain things hidden from the public as exposed. NASA is now pretty much dead and controlled by environmentalists controlled by Prince Philip and his NGOs as they had got their way of destroying scientific advancements in favor for funding wars. If we truly had gone to earth's big rocky satellite, then those that spread lies about the moon are pretty much pushed by the flat earthers in recent years, government controlled disinfo agents either by the CIA or the FBI's COINTELPRO to make people want to be against the funding of NASA for political acceptance to Obama not wanting to fund NASA. If moon hoaxers were wrong, they were at first communistic shilling, but now it's taken over by flat earthers that push a mind numbing narrative, and people like Rob Skiba uses the Book of Enoch as proof that the earth is flat, and since Rob Skiba is a Zionist shill, along with many of the aliens are demons shills that share the same nonsense and are afraid of CERN stuff, I suspect there's a Freemasonic or Jewish link, spreading out such disinfo which I've exposed before here: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/synchronicity-and-the-ad-hoc-hypothesis/\" target=\"_blank\">Synchronicity and the Ad hoc hypothesis</a>. Yes, if the CERN stuff can be linked to flat earthers, then really those who share both are associating with terrible people and are doubly stupid pawns of the controlled alternative media. You shall know the enemy by their doctrines that is against the one you were taught in, assuming you have gained wisdom and knowledge from God concerning what is the truth. If the moon hoax lie was propagated by Communists, then since the Communism was created by the Jewish, Venetian, Jesuit controlled Barvarian Illuminati, and if flat earthers perpetuate that lie, and certain Freemasonic Christian alternative media shills also collaborate with each other, really it's all a joint effort to destroy mankind's dreams to aspire and done on purpose. It is quite easy to dismiss things via association, and for the most part, it is easy to eliminate nonsensical disinfo this way, it does not mean that people shouldn't make an attempt to try to prove or disprove their claims. Test it and see if it still stands and if it doesn't, be aware of those who share such lies to see if they share other lies as if it's the gospel.\n\nHere's some more links to cast unto these Freemasonic swines as it never seems to be enough proofs against their presuppositions: <a href=\"https://eyewarnub4eye8u.blogspot.com/2015/05/flat-earth-masonic-jesuit-cia-psyops.html\" target=\"_blank\">FLAT EARTH MASONIC JESUIT CIA PSYOPS - ERIC DUBAY &amp; MATTHEW BOYLAN 'CO-ADJUDICATORS'!!!</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exa5w3qG6lo\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ 43: Does The Bible Teach A Flat Earth?</a> <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/live-iss-stream\" target=\"_blank\">Live_ISS_Stream on USTREAM</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikmOGqA7R7A\" target=\"_blank\">Flat Earth &amp; Fake NASA Conspiracy COMPLETELY Debunked into Oblivion - Case Closed Forever (RIP)</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCh-tbTd_Pc\" target=\"_blank\">Flat earth stupidity exposed</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDWyRjFnYkw\" target=\"_blank\">Why the Sun circles the Earth</a>\n\nThese people are only seeking your money to spend for their profit, they don't care if it's the truth. If they are really telling the truth, I don't mind if they get some monetary gain from it, but if the information some people get donations from are actually freely available on the internet, as these people actually imitate from each other, then I can confidently say to you that you are being conned. Exposing deceptions on the other hand, can be rewarded even if it's copied from others, though that reward won't be significant enough at times to warrant getting donations for. If they copy yet confuse people with lies, don't give them anything, it's as simple as that. Some of these people make a living from this which isn't wrong unless they want to keep on living off of donations because many of these people run out of creative juices at a certain point as they run out of steam, bringing themselves their own destruction. That Aliens come from Hell video is the kind of stuff that is extracted from, and expanded into \"original research\" shared by other people. I haven't seen much new information from Christian truthers for awhile. Though they are many incompetent researchers out there, the more revealing facts are that people are willing to throw money towards those that knows anything that they don't. A wise spender of books buys books that are either worth having a physical copy or, or they know that they can't find the information online as that book contains things hidden from the internet not necessarily due to censorship, but because of how revealing it is. The more you look at the right places, the more you know that there's less and less people talking about it. Though in that alone is not enough to know if it is actually the truth that they are sharing as it can be a trap in itself, I am simply stating general phenomena concerning the spread of truth and how these thought forms spread. My little website don't get much traffic but it's okay, it just means I have less trouble.\n\nConcerning Mars, all I have to say about that is if NASA had continued to receive its funding in perfecting nuclear fusion rocket propulsion technology, we would of had 7 day round trip missions to Mars by now, all the while mining the exotic resources on the moon to further improve nuclear fusion technologies and even contribute for future mining on Mars and even terraformation of the Martian environment. People had disposed that baton but Russia, India, and China, even North Korea seeks to improve their technology and thus, for the benefit of all of humanity to bring forth new inventions, a by-product of dreaming big. We have taken Kevlar suits, solar panels, velcro, and other things for granted, but they wouldn't have come forth without hard working innovators, geniuses that is homegrown and inspired to helping the economy that benefits at least four times the amount of money invested in these endeavors. Now, NASA is simply a propaganda machine under the control of the environmentalists that is contempt with faking Mars Rover pictures and aiding the Alien Agenda for the New World Order.\n\nWhere there are people who are free to dream big, they will look into improving space exploration as that dream can in turn create innovative solutions that is practical to people on earth. Movies like Elysium would make you think that it's the Elite's goals to use it to make their own heaven but reality says otherwise as these Zeusians/Jupiter (Venetians, Vatican) and worshipers of Kronos/Saturn (Talmudic Judaism) and Luciferians/Venus/Hermes+Aphrodite (Jesuits) seeks to imprison people on earth with limited energy flux density for a feudal system run by the European nobility and the rich Jews that intermingle and become \"<a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-chosen/\" target=\"_blank\">The Chosen</a>\" as they intend to reach that status by the end of 2099 and into 2100 when it's completed, while making people either interbreed between races or outlaw sex altogether to make sure they get the population down to 500 million globally by any means possible, stripped of any health, culture, and religion the people had to being simply the slave culture that they indoctrinate to you as your identity you are allowed to have under them. Whether that would happen or not, time will tell.\n\nüí´<strong>Eleven Past Nine Mar 9, 2016 @ 00:39</strong>\n\nI do not intend to update this article, neither was this intended to be showing a complete picture. Other people does it better than I do, most of which I use their sources. Don't rely solely on what I have to say, but please, consider the following.\n\nWho did what during when at where but why and how? The essense of all questions comes from the lack of omniscience as everyone with sentience hunt for the oasis in the desert that turns out to be a mirage. History doesn't repeat itself in every iteration that was being generated. Such pessimism is the rejection of the human potential, but the remedy is as simple as sharing the best knowledge available now to as much people as possible, to create a fertile ground for future geniuses that then they can do the same to foster a higher level of creativity on top of a higher base level foundation.\n\nThe elements required for a progressive \"Promethean\" society is creativity, an uncensored global truth platform that is in completely equally distributed network that can never be taken down, high density energy sources, an end to monetarism, Promethean leaders all over the world changing formerly Zeusian nations into Promethean free will nations that cooperate and respects national soverignty and also religious governments, Properly funded government organizations in preserving and advancing all things in the right direction completely driven by the people's own choosing towards providing help for what they want to contribute to, abolishment of all nihilistic, manipulative secret occult societies or at least render their tactics useless in attempts to hinder true human progression, and last but not least, a global government that first gives everyone allodial title in their respective homeland, then let the people choose to decide to be either to become a nation that takes away land ownership or be a religious nation that lets people be their own king on their own land maintained by the family while the government of the religious nation having no authority over you but are titular leaders in namesake only, to keep the servants of the people as servants that serve under them, unable to use any force.\n\nThat last requirement is probably not going to happen until Jesus Christ comes to reign on earth, but it did happen in the past many times by the Israelites when they were righteous. In other words, imagine a world where the lion and the lamb would live peacefully among each other because they had reached a high level of sentience and knowledge to just ascend from their carnal and animalistic instincts as they don't need to eat anymore for they had obtained enough information from innovative and creative researching to create a portable machine that manifests all of their nutrition into their bodies from thin air, and they realize the potential value in each other that is the most precious thing that life has to offer.\n\nWhat am I talking about in an article that should be about 9/11? I am spelling these words out to you to encourage certain thoughts to form so that you might see this situation in my perspective. Every sentence is a spell, every book is a book of spells. Visual imagery, audible vibrations, aromatic atmosphere, delectable flavors, and physical textures, they all invoke the inner mind and the inner spirit man in many different ways, coming in specific succession to express general groupings of these experiences in a language. The written language invokes the thinking man more than the emotional man, but it is generally devoid of many of the five senses, and is a more restricted source of visual imagerly reduced to squggly lines. Video is a continuously moving picture that mimics how we perceive reality from a distance, which audio and visual senses are the more far reaching senses while smells are more limited and is closer to us physically, and tasting and feeling is the most personal and close senses. When the far reaching senses detect danger, it is instinctive for people to react to flee from it before it comes close to them. This is the defense mechanism that is being invoked or desensitized against you by people who present video footage with sound.\n\nNow people who have a wide spectrum of experiences will be the most easily provoked to react, but their target is people who lack in certain experiences, like fear and thoughts concerning the inevitable death. Experience is one commodity that people have a hard time steering, for no one can have the same exact chain of events to happen to them, with the same body and thoughts, and second, sometimes you can't experience things that you want to while experiencing things that you don't want to. Having too little experience in certain areas would make you vulnerable in those areas, but having too much experience in specific areas would block you from experiencing things in areas that you are weaker in. Sometimes too much experience in certain things would make you avoid having other experiences that are worse. Certain lifestyle changes can prevent you from craving certain things in exchange of other things, which if you seek to experience good things, you would avoid bad things so that you would be able to experience better things based upon the good things that you experienced. Knowledge is an assumption of certain experiences, like learning a formula, but to use them is another thing, that is to test the assumptions and also to experience it instead of accepting it at face value. To some measure, knowledge can fill in some areas that we lack in. Experimenting is an experience of testing the knowledge. Knowledge can be formed through other ideas, but knowledge is not limited to facts. To reduce knowledge to base level facts and figures is to kill creativity and it is the suppression of true knowledge from increasing.\n\nAt first, this facts based education might seem to help people to have a sense in things that is commonly understood, it is better than no education, but as more you continue, it becomes the limit, as anything that is uncertain is not factual, therefore is false. Many people by the time they become adults, are stripped from their childlike wonder and imagination to the point of being detrimental for complex thinking as they would ignore potential variables not because they want to ignore them, but they were poked in the eyes too much from being able to see it, a mental crutch that at times has gone past the point of no return. The media and the public education system is your enemy under the Aristotelian reductionist slave education for the Goyim while they themselves take a similar Aristotelian reductionist nililistic education for the wealthy aristocratic oligarchs who adhere to the works of Aristotle's model of tyranny, but just because Aristotle made such thoughts popular in Ancient Greece, doesn't mean that such a Satanic system of control didn't exist before in the past. I am just using these terms to make it easier to convey certain concepts with a name.\n\nWhat does all of this has to do with 9/11 again? I am going to throw out some concepts, some names, and some links to other people's research now. I thought that it was imperative for me to say what I've said before throwing out some clues, but this is a multilayered problem, a loaded question that can't simply be answered with one sentence. Like in my previous rant: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/i-dont-like-exposing-recent-false-flag-events/\" target=\"_blank\">I don't like exposing recent false flag events</a>, some of those excuses apply to explaining previous false flag events.

The truth of the matter is that the towers had some of the steel frame pre-loosened as well as some shape charge explosives planted. The aircraft which hit the towers were not commercial aircraft but in fact military drones themselves probably packed with some explosives for added effect. These aircraft did not perform human checkturns, the aircraft were precision guided by the then BEI QRS-11 gyrochip which is now under the defense contractor Systron Donner Inertial. Planes might look huge but they‚Äôre very flimsy otherwise they would not fly. You cannot penetrate steel and even concrete will disintegrate an aircraft. Nazi and Knight of Columbus Jeb (John) Scherff (Bushfraud) hide the data proving that the so-called terrorists couldn‚Äôt fly normal aircraft let alone passenger jets. I should remind you that even the most skilled human pilot could not perform the non-human QRS-11 gyrochip checkturns that day. The elevator shafts were compromised by the use of Orbital ATK‚Äôs solid state rocket fuel surrounded by SmackSonic supposed sound proofing. Other explosives may have been used in parts of the buildings but the main demolition was executed from underground utilizing nuclear detonations as exposed by Russian nuclear expert Dmitri Khalezov.</blockquote>\n\nTaken from <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/conservative-party-start-dirty-tricks-campaign-against-jeremy-corbyn-and-labour/#comments\" target=\"_blank\">http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/conservative-party-start-dirty-tricks-campaign-against-jeremy-corbyn-and-labour/#comments</a>:<blockquote>I must stand back and admit that Jeremy Corbyn may actually be the real deal because this action by the vile Conservative pond scum is immediate, harsh and outright propaganda of the filthiest kind in politics. This reminds me of the hate currently in the US by the Republican scum over the Iran Nuclear Accord. Ask yourself why the Conservatives support the terrorist nation of Saudi Arabia who‚Äôs behind all the real terrorist Arabs in the World funded by British, US and Israeli currency. Even Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders shows his true evil colours by backing Saudi Arabia in policing the Middle East. Ask yourself why Obama won‚Äôt release the 28 pages which would highlight the part involvement of Saudi Arabia in the 9/11 attacks alongside Israel and Britain. Al-Qaeda and ISIS are fronts for British, US and Israeli intelligence. Al-Qaeda was created by the family of Carl M March in Chicago through the U.S. Small Business Administrations 8(a) program by the Senior Executive Service serving the City of London. The Mujahideen that makes up the original al-Qaeda were all trained by Keenie Meenie Services headed in Oman and a division of the British Secret Air Service fronted by the Ministry of Defence but covertly dominated by the New Doge of New Venice known as Queen Elizabeth II. ISIS is funded via Saudi, Turkey, Qatar through the British run HSBC Middle East based in the Qatar. Britain has dominated Persia since 1763 and continues to do so to this very day. The war on terror is a dream of Benjamin Netanyahu and the LIKUD terrorists of Israel and their minions the non-conservatives of the US like Kagan, Wolfowitz, Nuland and company. It‚Äôs time for the Zionists to be put to rest and removed once and for all, we‚Äôre all tired of the Synagogue of Satan as it was always highlighted in the Bible.\n\nOsama Bin Laden wasn‚Äôt assassinated in 2011 as claimed, he was horizontalized back in December of 2001 by a British Secret Intelligence Service agent by the name of Omar Sheikh as exposed by Benazir Bhutto on the David Frost show not long before she herself was horizontalized. The war on terror is a British, US and Israeli farce to bring about a fascist Nazi New World Order of slavery taking the globe into a new dark age of dictatorship by the Zeusian Aristotelian. The role of both Al-Qaeda and especially ISIS is to bring about the attempted destruction of the nation of Russia, that‚Äôs the very end goal as the Middle East is just the start. So it all depends on which side of the fence you sit on as I‚Äôd rather see Hezbollah as a friend than an enemy and I‚Äôd certainly rather have Hezbollah as a friend than terrorist Likud run Israel or Al-Saud run Saudi Arabia.\n\nExpect a lot more dirty tactics from an obviously frightened British political system. I‚Äôve never seen such a dirty tricks and hate campaign like this so quickly against one man in this case Corbyn. When you see such actions of these taking place you have to understand something big is going down. We know there‚Äôs a lot of people in Britain fed up with the current Zeusian system and maybe now we‚Äôre seeing a challenge to the invisible empire of New Venice and all of it‚Äôs forks.\n\nBritain doesn‚Äôt need Trident and if it didn‚Äôt keep sticking its nose in other peoples business we wouldn‚Äôt have so called enemies. Britain always has its slave colony the United States and it‚Äôs arsenal if and when needed. The UK Government is destroying the British Armed Forces at a rapid pace utilizing for one austerity. The UK Government with other New Venice Empire nations in destroying their various military forces in order to just form one force as a world peacekeeping force. So attacking Corbyn for wanting to partially do what these fools are already doing and desire is yet another example of a farce.\n\nFrom now on keep your eyes on various challenges to and happening with the vile British Monarchy. Keep your eyes on the moves played out by Jeremy Corbyn and if there isn‚Äôt a genuine challenger to Corbyn then if these tricks continue then we must support Corbyn. If Corbyn is the real deal and such a threat to the establishment then there will be an attempt on his life through horizontalization so he will need protection to make sure not another Dr David Kelly occurs. I strongly believe Corbyn should build an alliance with President Vladimir Putin of Russia and start talking about exiting the UK from the EU and instead joining the UK into the BRICS New Development Bank and making dealings with the EAEU economic bloc of Eurasia. If we start to see these things coming forth then the future could be rosy instead of a dark age of today.\n\nFinally please note that Jeremy Corbyn and Martin O‚ÄôMalley (US) both support the implementation of Glass Steagall which can save the nation(s) from economic collapse and the Zionist bankster derivative slavery. We must all call for Glass Steagall and start copying the moves of former U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt in order to save the peoples of our nations. This time around we will need more work than just Roosevelt‚Äôs plan but it‚Äôs the foundation that is vital if humanity is to survive. We don‚Äôt want a Zeusian New World Order but we welcome a Promthean New World Economic Order and it‚Äôs about time the alternative media highlighted the different between the two instead of making out they‚Äôre both the same and living in a backward mentality.</blockquote>\n\nThat article is outdated as Martin O'Malley had given up as people are trying to decide who's better between the Jewish Bernie Sanders that even the Zionists dislike and the FBI Division #5 controlled Donald J. Drumpf, AKA: Donald Trump who's got the vote of genuine racists (not to be confused with statisticians that notices trends among racial groups) and White Republicans, though really they both suck, but Hillary Clinton sucks the most. The powers that be prefers Hillary Clinton, so if you're still a registered voter in your own ignorance, giving up more of your liberty to those who you put over you as your servant that becomes your king in place of the king of kings, then don't vote for Hillary, but remember that these voting systems are rigged, and had been rigged even before they were electronic. Also, Jeremy Corbyn is a Zionist dependent on the funding of the Jews and pushes green policies so he's also not to be trusted.\n\nTaken from <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/UHM/new-venice-federal-reserve-is-dying-and-on-the-ropes-as-prince-charles-abuses-gold-bank-brics-head-vladimir-putin/#comment-288\" target=\"_blank\">NEW VENICE FEDERAL RESERVE IS DYING AND ON THE ROPES AS PRINCE CHARLES ABUSES GOLD BANK (BRICS) HEAD VLADIMIR PUTIN</a>:<blockquote>The Office of Naval Intelligence was taken out by an advanced Russian-made SS-N-19 Shipwreck stolen from the wreckage of the K-141 Kursk submarine after it was attacked just over one year prior to the ‚Äòmatch is hot‚Äô event in NYC and Virginia. The missile was launched at a maximum of 380 miles away using a modified vessel located within the Atlantic Ocean most likely under guidance of French military intelligence working alongside the spotters in New York City who were ready to capture footage of the drone attack on the World Trade Center. The Naudet Brothers were French Intelligence plants placed at the scene to document the event just like the dancing Israelis were Israeli Intelligence doing the exact same thing. The target area of the Pentagon was renovated by AMEC Plc including all the security cameras not to mention how the camera equipment used by the Naudet‚Äôs was also AMEC Plc tied to the City University of New York. The footage of 9/11 was all mastered under the Rothschild family owned Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers mastering the camera lens patent pool. The missile attack will have been mastered under the Freemasonic lodge of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights. The events on 9/11 were a metabridge operation meaning a combination of a number of intelligence agencies and so-called nations including; New Venice (Britain), Israel, France, U.S. and Canada along with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The NATO group removed control from the U.S. out over into the hands of the British Ministry of Defence after diverting this power out from Washington then into Chicago before Britain. The 9/11 events were ordered by the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath and the air attacks were planned by the golden griffin mob of the Gray‚Äôs Inn. Two of the biggest names involved in these attacks are not Bush and Cheney but instead it‚Äôs the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Kent. So now you too can feel physically sickened when you watch the footage of the New York Firefighters Concert as you see all those ‚ÄòBritish Invasion‚Äô pop/rock bands playing as the Union Jack flies dominate above the stage. You‚Äôre aware of the twenty-four members of the Bin Laden family flying out of the U.S. after the 9/11 attacks. I bet you weren‚Äôt aware of the private aircraft that within hours of the attacks entered into U.S. during the flight ban and which was carrying both the Duke of Kent and Prince of Wales puppets known as Sir Richard Dearlove (DOK) the head of MI6 along with Sir Stephen James Lander (POW) the head of MI5? Even high-level members of the Central Intelligence Agency were perplexed as to how these two got clearance into U.S. airspace. The New Venice (Britain) Empire 9/11 attacks were yet another 1814 Burning of Washington.</blockquote>\n\nTaken from <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/UHM/hidden-hand-manipulation-of-anti-islam-movie-after-effect-chaos/\" target=\"_blank\">http://theunhivedmind.com/UHM/hidden-hand-manipulation-of-anti-islam-movie-after-effect-chaos/</a>:<blockquote>The Muslim Brotherhood are controlled by the British Secret Intelligence Service and the Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst operation hidden in the Directorate for Intelligence division of the Central Intelligence Agency. Terry Jones is an asset of the Central Intelligence Agency which works closely with the MOSSAD both being created by Sir William Stephenson of MI6 really working for the City of London Corporation through the British Government and the now Intelligence and Security Committee headed by Privy Councilors Michael Ancram and Robin Butler both connected to the ancient Norman powers. The Clash of the Civilizations overtly begins on the day of the God of war (Mars/Tuesday) 11th of September 2012 exactly eleven years since the 9/11 attacks by Bombardier Master Trust, The Royal Canadian Air Force, Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators, UK Ministry of Defence, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Senior Executive Service and The Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath. Eleven being the number of Saturn‚Äôs judgment in the occult World, Saturn being the God of time and known to most Worldwide as Satan. The two towers representing the eleven judgment and the pillars of wisdom, Jachin and Boaz in Freemasonry (Templarism).\n\nWhat you are seeing right now with the anti-Islam movie by Terry Jones is the planned event to kick start serious cascading domino events for the ‚ÄòClash of the Civilizations‚Äô planned as part of the ‚ÄòStrategy of Tension‚Äô tied to the old Masonic P2 Lodge continuum out of both Italy and Argentina headed by Lucio Gelli and his Operation Gladio. Firstly to aid trouble across the Middle East and soon enough to create internal problems in the multicultural Western World in order to aid the false-threat of Al-Qaeda terrorism ready for the Worldwide implementation of Martial Law in the Post democratic era spoken about in the Lisbon Treaty during the zero-growth post-industrial society created by the Club of Rome. The same Club of Rome who covertly created and control the supposed Occupy Movement pushing for Marxism just as the City of London desires with its United Nations. Expect soon enough Michael Chertoff‚Äôs bodyscanners at a shopping mall near you which also aids in the population reduction demands of the Club of Rome through regular tetra-hertz bombardment of the human cells.\n\nMost people are aware of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Nazi connection including the Order of Malta, Dulles brothers. Remembering that the Dulles Brothers were the ones who funded Adolph Hitler and Martin Bormann to the tune of the equivalent of the U.S gross domestic product back in 1933. Both being of the Order of Malta and one even being a Jesuit Cardinal of ultimate power. Needless to say when U.S. President John F. Kennedy crossed this family and the Mercers he was put in his place by the DVD through Permanent Industrial Expositions coming out of Old Europe power base, Montreal, Canada where they were paid like Lincoln‚Äôs Catholic killers by the Bank of Montreal. Many are not aware that the Muslim Brotherhood‚Äôs roots go back to The Honourable East India Company tied to the pirates of the Livery run by The Worshipful Company of Mercers and the City of London Corporation which today rules all the military(Fuellers)-industrial(World-Traders)-pharmaceutical(Apothecaries)-financial(Mercers) complex for the Jesuit Papacy still mastering the Council of Trent and the covert continuation of the counter-Reformation for the Temporal Power of their anti-Christ unHoly See.\n\nA Papacy controlling Jesuit trained, Rome born, King Juan Carlos of Spain the head of the new unHoly Roman Empire (since 1814) through his ‚ÄòKing of Jerusalem‚Äô aka Protector of the Holy Sites of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem ancient title. The Middle East and North Africa being dominated by King Juan Carlos through such branches of his power like the Union for the Mediterranean based in Barcelona and Malta. The ancient crusades is reborn with the same ancient Crusaders such as the Order of Malta commanding military intelligence such as the CIA, DVD, MI6, MOSSAD and the mercenary crusaders such as Blackwater USA/Academi/Xe run by Knight of Malta, Erik Prince. Another wealthy merchant of the Papal Orders, make sure one understands that all recognized Knights of Malta are ruled by the Order of Malta through The Alliance of the Orders of St John of Jerusalem based in Geneva, Switzerland. A Canton ruled by the Papist House of Savoy and the House of Doria and in particular Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV the head of another crusading order, the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus who also like to steal the World‚Äôs water supplies (blue gold) through the U.N Proposition 21 front.\n\nWho has been trying to install the Muslim Brotherhood all over the Middle East bloc? Hillary Clinton working to the Bernard Lewis plan of course. Who is Hillary‚Äôs aide? Huma Abedin the Saudi Arabian born daughter of the head of the Muslim Sisterhood. Are things making a lot more sense now? What did I tell you was behind this agenda all along? I told you they would install the Muslim Brotherhood in order to help create the final Holy War known in the occult as the seventh war and final war (World War III). A seventh war being bought about through Armageddon Freemasonry headed by the Scottish Rite at the Valley of Dallas (the area where Kennedy was slaughtered) covertly mastered by Jesuits who created its first twenty-five degrees in France. Its front founder Alexandre Francois de Grasse was Order of Malta connected through his father. All so the Jesuit Order could control all of the Freemasonry Worldwide seeing as the Jesuits believe themselves to be the only Knights Templar continuum since the Pope actually allowed their origins to survive in the Kingdom of Aragon unlike any other Templars who had to flee (Scotland, Portugal and Switzerland [Moret Sturgeons]). Study the Order of the Calatrava and the Order of the Montesa along with the Los Alumbrados and the Borgia family. Study the Morals and Dogma book of the Scottish Rite by Albert Pike the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite. Note how Albert Pike was mastered by Jesuit soldier, Pierre-Jean de Smet SJ who also mastered Brigham Young and the Mormon Cult, he even gave the Utah Union State to the Mormon cult. Who controlled the KKK? Albert Pike! Notice the connection of the KKK to the Knights Templar? Notice the connection to Italian secret societies through the dress wear? Do you see whats going on?\n\nKnight of Malta, George H.W. Bush is a covert Papist whilst his son John Bush is an overt Papist as a 4th degree Knights of Columbus. John Bush physically kneels to the Pope and kisses his fisher‚Äôs ring in complete subordination. The Vatican and Order of Malta mastered the Nazi continuum out of Nazi Germany into Argentina and the U.S. The CIA through the DVD protected the Nazis in the region from prosecution. The DVD are the masters of the U.S. dope trade and much of the World‚Äôs dope trade with British SIS for the House of Bourbon and The Worshipful Company of Apothecaries. Nikolaus Klaus Barbie was running the dope trade out of Bolivia for decades under Josef Mengele who was mostly based in Canada. Otto Von Bolschwing and Helen Van Damme created the Stanford Research Institute which is closely connected to Hollywood for predictable programming reasons for social engineering purposes connected to the Tavistock Institute for Human Relations. George H.W Bush has controlled the DVD Nazi Odessa (modeled off the Jesuit Order by Himmler) continuum for the last thirty-four years under the power of Dachau, Bavaria. Note George H.W Bush‚Äôs Nazi SS pedigree and true Nazi bloodline connection to the Order of the Bath (powerful control over British Secret Service MI5) just like the old Sir Timothy Garden who planned the 9/11 air attacks from Grays Inn via the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators. Both are/were servants of Great Master Prince Charles.\n\nThe ultimate goal now is to pit Islam vs Zionism against one another utilizing infiltrating fronts in the Middle East (Muslim Brotherhood) and even in Israel. The destruction of both is desired as the slow destruction of all other religions from the inside out is happening and is desired. This is being done through the Jesuit created Charismatic Movement, World Council of Churches and the Ecumenism Movement all controlled from Rome utilizing their inter-religious dialogue as the front to veil their hidden hand power. Note who is seen as the visible head of these vile organizations and how its working to slowly destroy current religions through first merger then complete change in mind-frame through socially engineering towards a Luciferian Doctrine acceptance. The head of this religion will be the Pope in his changed one-World religion wearing new garments and with a new title. This will be no different to when the Senate of Rome became the Red Cardinals and the Caesar became the Pope. He will lead from King Solomon‚Äôs Temple III built by Grandmaster Giuliano di Bernardo. A Temple based in East Jerusalem which the Vatican has overtly run since 1993 with the Oslo Accord signing by Jesuit trained Shimon Peres in Jesuit Washington D.C. All of Israel will be destroyed except East Jerusalem. The Al-Aqsa Mosque will be finally destroyed by the Saudi Binladin Group and covered up as a Western demolition to create a false-flag event for further tension in order to aid the Ordo-Ab-Chao or order out of chaos aka Strategy of Tension. The final secrets of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Al-Quds will be finally in the possession of this Solar cult who will use them to master mankind into the Aeon of Ma‚Äôat or the Age of Aquarius. The Osiris god will become the Horus God as the final Pope (Osiris) is slain and laid to rest.\n\nSo what you are seeing is the agenda of functionalism against the Middle East to break the region down into many regions within one new Middle Eastern bloc based on the European Union model. This will eventually be joined into the European Union as all nations become openly dictated to finally by the United Nations which has legally held control over almost all nations including Syria since 1945 through the UN Charter. The legalese system being controlled by the Middle and Inner Temple of New Jerusalem within the City of London region. A legalese based on Vatican Canon Law from the Roman perfecting of the Phoenician law of the high seas mercantile trading. A system which has come to dominate even Common Law nations since the 1933 bankrupting of these nations by The Worshipful Company of Mercers and the implementation of the Uniform Commercial Code debt prison in unison with the Admiralty law enforcement.\n\nDo not be fooled that these current and past events in the Middle East are the work of Arabs fighting for the region and their religion by removing Western influence. This could not be further from the truth. When one understands who pulls the strings of the region and dictatorships like the Arab-League and the Muslim Brotherhood then one sees through the veils being pulled over the general publics eyes. Rest assured that Peter Hans Kolvenbach down in Tripoli, Lebanon is playing a big role in the planning of these events and it is one of the reasons why he handed his overt power to Adolfo Nicolas SJ in 2008. Adolfo Nicolas SJ being a master of the Far East whilst Kolvenbach is a master of the Middle East. Study the ancient power of Lebanon and Syria in the region to understand why the Jesuits have a powerful base of command there.\n\nWe see agents of the realm like Charles Kruthammer talking on the subject of the U.S. Embassy burning on Fox News which is run by British Intelligence through the Order of Malta‚Äôs Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch a Papist in control of most of the fraudulent counterfeit Bibles out there to lure you away from the Geneva Bible 1560/99 and true-Christianity. Catholicism has never been Christianity, it has been a usurper for the Beast out to takeover Christianity and then destroy it from the inside out as we see today. Catholicism‚Äôs true roots lie with the Mithra religion and Solar Cult worship with Paganism to boot. Charles Kruthammer talks of the Middle East now becoming an Al-Qaedastan. What he does not tell you is that George H.W Bush controls the Bin Laden family. He also does not mention that Al-Qaeda was created by the Marcy family in Chicago through the daughter-in-law of Carl M. Marcy. This was done through the secretive Senior Executive Service via the U.S. Small Business Administration‚Äôs 8(a) program. Al-Qaeda being yet another Western creation to aid in the implementation of the World Government to be fronted by the United Nations and of course as a boogeyman to aid the era of peace between nations. All this can be understood by studying carefully the Iron Mountain Report.\n\nWhat do you think will happen when the current Middle Eastern chaos starts in Saudi Arabia and Iraq along with the other oil producing states? Saudi Arabia is already close to destruction internally and already we see some areas in an oil crisis believe it or not. I think everyone should be prepared for brown out power cuts and lack of food as oil soon becomes scarce for a period of time. Do not think Libya will be the buffer when it too is now going up in smoke. This may be the planned start of the $185-250 a barrel oil ready for the coming destruction of the Middle East for depopulation and easier control. This will be done through cutting off oil production from the region which will also hinder China who will have to rely on Russia for its oil supplies. The hidden U.S. oil fields and the Falklands will be bought into full swing shortly producing oil in an era of $200+ a barrel oil. China and the new Middle East will have to come to the West for their oil needs and pay the extortionate prices. The era of cheap oil is over and it has nothing to do with the fraud called Peak Oil and all to do with Mercers/Fuellers greed. The West has many secret oil fields four times bigger than Saudi Arabia and do not forget it can invade Venezuela at any point to aid oil theft and refinery.</blockquote>\n\nThat is an even older article as we now know that the Kalergi Plan and the Yinon Plan, AKA: Greater Israel Plan is in somewhat opposition with the whole Zionism vs Islam, Atheism vs Christianity scenario. It's now Zionism (Venetian Elite + Jewish Elite) being above everything controlling a battle royale match of Islam, Atheism, Feminism, Protestantism, Catholicism, Orthodoxy in one level, but in another level, millitant african men, millitant arabian men, white women, white alpha men, white beta men, millitant white men and women. Though there are some poor Jews thrown into the colosseum, they serve to make the Jews look innocent. The lower level cults like Freemasonry and militia orders like the SMOM and the Jesuits would be the proxy agents posing as the elite that is watching the battle but is still close enough to be dragged into the battle if some of them team up to destroy a greater evil like what happened in Iceland. If you didn't know, the bankers there were jailed and Israeli products are banned as they had pushed the reset button. Destroying the white race and culture would make things easier for the Elite to control the world as they see Christianity, generally speaking, as the biggest threat as they prefer to destroy Islam later and attempts to use Islam to destroy Christianity instead of letting Christianity take over Islam but that's not going to happen either because many Christian denominations are Zionists that will do what they are told to do and will deceive many to have Christians desire to kill off these millitant muslims.

The funding was funnelled through Middle Eastern channels connecting with both Saudi Arabia and Pakistan just as today‚Äôs MI6 terrorist force the Islamic State is funded by New Venice via Qatar using the HSBC Middle East Bank. I‚Äôve highlighted the role of KPMG behind the start-ups of modern pirate Livery companies in ancient Londinium aka the City of London square-mile from hell. The New Doge of New Venice and her bloodline are on the edge of loosing their power and Empire so now they‚Äôre playing dirty and willing to put the mankind on the edge of extinction with thermonuclear war. If we don‚Äôt remove this Nazi Black Nobility family then the majority of the global population will be wiped out regardless of nuclear war using green policy scams based on false science as a way to destroy and control mankind through the likes of the U.N Agenda 21 program (a system designed so even the herd crave their own demise but don‚Äôt even know it). Keep your both your eyes firmly on the Windsor‚Äôs and enjoy their downfall as they all scurry around like ants exposed under a slap of concrete. All we need to do is pour boiling hot water on those ants and release mankind from the clutches of Satanism and backward dictatorship. The time is now and it will be a Promethean age of discovery and knowledge, a real utopia when it happens.</blockquote>\n\nHere's a bunch of links by the LaRouchePAC, though I suspect some of you dislike him and the research he puts out:\n\n<a href=\"https://larouchepac.com/28pages\" target=\"_blank\">911 Cover-up - Declassify the 28 pages</a>\n<a href=\"https://larouchepac.com/london-saudis-911\" target=\"_blank\">London/Saudi Global Terror Network</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quYYA1wtUwc\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond the 28-Pages -- 9/11: Ten Years Later</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5aGY1egmSI\" target=\"_blank\">The Untold Story of 9/11: A Luncheon with Bob Graham</a>\n<a href=\"https://larouchepac.com/stop-wwiii\" target=\"_blank\">Stop WWIII</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ1xrJjQt10\" target=\"_blank\">Unsurvivable - Feature Film</a>\n\nThis is where I say something profound and make you think about all of this.

I'm glad that God lead me to these things, even though the journey that I've came to these certain conclusions is actually a sad story that has an even sadder implication which I'm going to briefly talk about why the Trivium is unscientific.\n\nAll phenomena comes from noumena, God caused the effect that is reality. That's it, the removal of that faith is the destruction of societies, and the source of many lies taught by Christians and scientists alike by not teaching that truth correctly. It can be possible to utilize the Trivium to reject the Trivium for a better model, but really, you don't want to use the scientific method formulated by Sir Francis Bacon that formulated it in alignment with the Aristotelian Trivium. I had to learn things backwards because nobody tells the truth straightforward. What Aristotle had done is to covertly imply that knowledge/grammar, understanding/Aristotelian logic, and wisdom/rhetoric is all there is, that's the magical formula that all things have meaning. He had covertly inserted a presupposition that faith is separate from science. Although religion can be independent of science, faith cannot be independent of science. Faith comes before knowing anything. The Logic part of the Trivium is probably the most deceptive, because it is a list of \"logical\" absolutes that can't be questioned. With the rejection of the first noumena, God that in turn created or caused the effect of the phenomena, they at times throw at you contradictions that seems to be contradictory but in reality, they create a fallacy by calling what is true to be a fallacy. Many Atheists use a Strawman argument to say that Christians are using circular logic and appeal to authority and other things when they use the bible to prove things yet they don't question if the logical absolutes that they use are always right in every situation and they don't understand, nor even heard of what presuppositional apologists have to say to that as both sides by faith claim to know certain things but the Atheist can't claim to be certain that they know that they know that they know without going in circles, proving logic with logic is illogical but the Christian can claim to know that the world is as God says that it is not only because God had revealed the basics to us as to the world that he says that we live in that is supported by evidence (faith based evidence for the believer), they have an unbroken line of cause and effect and so an unbroken line of logical reasoning and so reality is under his domain, logic exists and that it is universal, not made of matter, and does not change because God made logic, therefore everyone that uses logic to reject God have no grounds to make that claim for logic is his, so only the fool says in their heart there is no God.\n\nDespite all that, presuppositional apologetics had made a grave error, they still use the Trivium or the scientific method. The Trivium or the scientific method is only good for deducing, reducing things based off of what we know through faith through attempts in understanding it and making conclusion with applicable implications as wisdom. This was never the method in finding discoveries. Christians and scientists alike believe that all discoveries come from mistake after mistake after mistake. Although some work is necessary to make discoveries, work in itself is not required to have \"wisdom from God\". Most discoveries are not make through mistakes. Thomas Edison had taken credit for what Nikola Tesla and Charles Proteus Steinmetz had made when he was working under Edison (see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TttHkDRuyZw\" target=\"_blank\">History and Theory of Electricity</a>). Airy's \"Failure\" and some other experiments that did come from \"mistakes\", though the Airy's \"Failure\" experiment was initially made to disprove the existence of the aether so really it was done in evil pretenses against true scientific progression. The scientific method always looks in the past, but inventions are made from looking into the future. Therefore, genuine discoveries contradicts previously held logic, but there's an exception: as long as it doesn't goes against what the bible says. Some people had known a few decades ago that there was more water beneath the earth than above it, all scientifically proven. See: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUaPleXoK8E\" target=\"_blank\">Primary Water Explained</a> <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/New-Water-For-A-Thirsty-World.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/New-Water-For-A-Thirsty-World.pdf</a> Many people had rejected it because it is in line with the narrative of the bible. Then in recent years, some scientists again say the same thing <a href=\"http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/scientists-detect-evidence-oceans-worth-water-earths-mantle/\" target=\"_blank\">Scientists Detect Evidence of 'Oceans Worth' of Water in Earth‚Äôs Mantle</a> but nobody dares to question them only because those scientists had also lied by saying that the water in the forms that they have discovered is not in its liquid form, although geologists for many many decades, perhaps even two centuries, had treated water as a mineral to explain the plentiful different minerals that contained oxygen and hydrogen that comes from a source beyond the explanation plate tectonics give, saying that some ocean water goes under the crust and the upper mantle and gets released again. They will never explain the deep implications of what they had found tangible evidence of. With that same level of deception, scientists renamed the aether and its properties within the realm of \"Quantum Mechanics\" as dark energy, dark matter, and other things to describe a field with Quanta, something that can be counted, material.\n\nBack to Aristotle. Aristotelian science was the first recorded start of the scientific dark age within relatively recent human history that is caused none other than through the disguise of science when it's actually anti-science, anti-progression, anti-God. Again I remind you that science is independent of religion, but science is not independent of faith. The Roman Aristocrats wanting to control the populace, taught their citizens Aristotelian science and they somewhat believe in it as well since for one, Aristotle was pro democracy and anti free republic which Plato was for and two, Aristotelian science as a whole implies that man has no free will of any sort to do what they wanted to as they were taught certain laws and pushed those laws with the junk Aristotle taught concerning physics. He had used deduction and induction to come to his conclusions, since the second part of the Trivium being logic, he had deduced certain things to be true through his induction which were demonstrated. A light feather or leaf doesn't fall at the same speed as an heavier object, but that's Aristotle's \"proof\" (specifically proof from Aristotelian scientist, not necessarily directly from the horse's mouth) that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. With inductive reasoning, he's still true since every time people repeat that same experient, it will stay true, but not until they had done a different experiment altogether. Galileo is attributed to finding that clearly fallacious flaw, but there's some speculation concerning whether he had ever really conducted that experiment, rather, a thought experiment. Modern science try to blame Aristotle's stupidity by promoting Bacon's inductive scientific method over Aristotle's deductive Trivium, but at the same time, whether or not you are being inductive or deductive, the setup itself is the problem that comes from a set of beliefs that looks at the past for answers when discoveries are made from looking at the future for answers. An example of this is seen in our education system. When we learn things, we are being tested if we remember them, but that way of learning restricts creativity. When we learn things, we shouldn't be tested on it, but instead to be motivated to find new discoveries into reality to build up the foundation, not be so grounded in the foundation. Deduction or induction scientific method are equally dangerous because they are stuck in an old paradigm that gives power to the teachers of the rules, not giving authority to those who object to their teachings despite being proven that they are wrong as it all boils down to faith. The establishment controlled closed source science gains power and wealth through spreading lies about physics and nature. Really, the whole deductive verses inductive debate is a red herring.\n\nIn a similar manner, Descartes made his own laws of physics based on his observations and made a conclusion. Whether the conclusion or the premise came first doesn't matter as much when what they insist on saying that is true is the problem if it's not actually true. Just because you can observe something to repeatedly do something doesn't mean that your conclusion about that observation is correct. Inductive reasoning foolishly says otherwise while hypocritically assert that they can't determine absolutes. People intuitively know when they get tricked after the trick is over, yet people have a hard time explaining it unless they know exactly and explicitly as to what that trick was to the point of naming it. No amount of deductive or inductive reasoning can explain the underlying phenomena causing the effect. Divine inspiration is necessary to gain any discoveries. What do I mean by divine? In this context, something beyond a physical explanation. God has made us in our image, and we in turn can know certain things about God's creation because we think like God a little bit, at least enough to be able to not think like animals and lower forms of life and existence like say plants and rocks. God has made creation with omniscient reasoning with a purpose, so certain phenomena has an inherent reason as to how it works which can't be explained only through observation or making false premises. Some people can instinctively know and seek after the truth even though people haven't come up to explain a phenomena ever before in human history and at least before they hear it being explained by others. That's supernatural, and reducing (reductionist reasoning) things to matter or Quanta, Quantity, Quantum, the doctrine of materialism is in direct opposition to one's soul. How can a bunch of chemicals and molecules know which side of the body is the right side and which side of the body is the left side? There are certain things that modern science tries to explain the human nature through materialism, Darwinism, and Aristotelian line of reasoning, but they all fall short when met by true science.\n\nAll modern science have underlying faith and doctrines that it needs to obey or else they get kicked out of the club, but they had occulted certain things so well, they hide the facts to the public the inner most secrets of their nonsense. They insist that virtual protons (quantity, material, physical manifestations) are the cause of magnetism, yet virtual protons are not simply a placeholder for what they hope to find actual evidence for what they want to believe is real by encouraging people to find an explanation to magnetism one day through finding the theorized virtual protons that was never found and will never will be found, while those who share this huge faith in the nonexistent proof of magnetism not explained at all through quantum mechanics and general relativity that is also a professor at a university can comfortably spew logical fallacies for profit of the ignorant sheep. That is the true nature of Aristotelian science, it's not just the \"deductive scientific method\", it also infects the \"inductive scientific method\" with the same destructive occult setup of false science.\n\nAnyways, back to the Romans. In one hand, they had pushed Aristotelian science and philosophy but in another, they pushed draconian laws and kept the people ignorant, careless, and had become the parent of the families as they had provided free food and entertainment at the expense of the liberties of the next generation that bears the debt of working for what their parents didn't work for, all the while promoting degenerate behavior and they had even poisoned their own food and water because the pipes were made of lead, all such ideas formed from the Aristocrats that favored the Aristocracy that Aristotle described for their methods of controlling the populace with mind control. All government steers the mind to move the body, like steering the rudder to move the boat. In that definition, there are many different forms of \"government\" as it's simply another name for mind control. If you can't control your mind yourself, the constitution that the government that you're under becomes your \"constitution\" of your mind. After some time had passed, the Roman Catholic Church enforced the Aristotelian science as the law because of Aristotle's claim that the earth is the center of the universe which is true not because he said so but because it is proven to be so (see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkEfj5DBnpc\" target=\"_blank\">The Importance of Geocenticity</a>) which the bible also states the nature of the stationary earth. The \"Church\" was controlled by Venetians, the spiritual and physical descendants of the fallen Roman Empire's Aristocratic Oligarchy families that even claims to be descendants of the Egyptian Pharaohs. They had simply continued the scientific dark age through Catholicism. It's a lie that the muslims brought back the wisdom of the Greeks, and they were half of the reason there was a dark age to begin with, the other half being the Venetian banking system continuing the same system of monetarism done in the Temple of Apollo. See: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_Qpy0mXg8Y\" target=\"_blank\">Why We Are Afraid, A 1400 Year Secret, by Dr Bill Warner</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRfR6tvUZKs\" target=\"_blank\">Venetian Oligarchy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCmSBfVXEmA\" target=\"_blank\">216 - The Islamic Connection / Total Onslaught - Walter Veith</a>.\n\nThe Quadrivium predates Aristotle's Trivium, so I'm not against those that teach the Quadrivium in proper order: mathematics, then geometry, then music, then astronomy. Science and art are inseparable. The Trivium, and by extension, the Catholic, Freemasonic, Rosicrucian who was knighted by King James I of England, Sir Francis Bacon's \"scientific\" method implies that science and art are separate from, and independent from each other. Kepler had attempted to unite astronomy with music, geometry, and mathematics. With music he had associated the orbits of the planets with ratios between the short side and the long side of the elliptical orbits as he also was fed up with using circles to describe the orbital path when it can be done with significantly less circles by using ellipses to solve the insanity of treating orbits like perfect circles in circles, multiple layers of gears moving inside itself. Some of the things he had seen in the observational data of the orbital path of Mars that he stolen from Tycho Brahe can't be explained through many many circles to lessen the 8 minute error that the model has from the actual observation which everyone before him all used perfect circles. Adding more circles could reduce the error more and more, but it's ultimately not a sufficient answer to what's really going on. His conclusion came from his Quadrivium education. For more about Kepler, see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUwGovJHNts\" target=\"_blank\">The Harvard Yard: Fraud of Modern Education</a>.\n\nSo what is my replacement for the unscientific method? Faith in God + Quadrivium eduction + Classical arts. Although within the Quadrivium education contains music, it doesn't contain other things like classical painting, architecture, and other things. A polymath is exposed to many different subjects, but they don't spend too much time looking into the past as much as looking into the future, they don't have the pessimistic, defeatest attitude that King Solomon/Shelomoh and the general negative tone the bible has concerning human innovation and creativity in creating a better future, a higher standard of living not only through the bible, but also through new inventions and discoveries that helps everyone. Those that use the bible in suppression of true science knows not why God had given them a mind to begin with because they clearly don't use it properly. Anti-science Christians are dangerous people. Anyways, by looking into the future, that's how Leibniz had found the basic laws of physics falsely attributed and stolen by Newton as he had also stolen his calculus and Kepler's research while never properly explaining how he derived to certain conclusions in order to mystify science as the Venetian agent he is. It is hard to describe this method with a name. Why? For one, I'm a Christian, two, as much as I like certain concepts of pre-aristotelian philosophy, it's in itself lacking when it comes down to certain things proven to be false like Pythagoras and Plato's claim of the sun being the center of the planets including the earth, three, I don't think that Aristotle's Trivium and Bacon's scientific method is good enough yet there is no method that has the things that I'm describing, not even \"Creation Science\" is good if they give evidence of creation without having those that they're trying to convince to first accept the truth as there's no reason to give evidence to the fool, the unbeliever that does not have the same faith, and four, it is the occulting, the hiding of knowledge to being privy to those who know the truth had become its own enemy if it's not shared freely to everyone, and is managed freely in an open source type of system for science. Religious and scientific authority needs to be open sourced, responsibility given to the people freely, all the while, not breaking the cause and effect line from God to us. Some might say that because I want the bible to be the final say concerning science that I'm Aristotelian. On the contrary, Aristotle hates morals and God, and although I would want to have the open sourced science platform to be run by Christians, it doesn't have to be run by Christians as people of other faiths could fork it and make their own open source scientific community that does not have the faith that we have but since they are still open source and so are we, there is no censorship going on and any discoveries made can contribute to all open source scientific community.\n\nScience needs to be taken away from the hand of these corporations and governments that push agendas at the expense of the future generations that will suffer greatly and globally as we are already seeing. Academia itself also needs to be open sourced. Any real discoveries made will only be applied and help the economy, unless there are some that wants to keep people under the old system, the old paradigm for easier mind control. Look into the future, motivate everyone to make new discoveries in whatever they do that is for everyone. Humanitarian work and charity is not enough in itself to get out of certain deceptions of the enemy and it's never enough to rely on existing technologies for a growing population as all civilizations require more energy and resources which can be acheived in furthering nuclear fusion technology and stuff like the Searl Effect Generator that also should be funded and have people contribute to it if they can. We need to spread suppressed technologies that improves our health and to improve upon them to not only have people be able to afford it, but to reach to futher new discoveries. That also has to be open sourced as in, not censored because Wikipedia and Big Pharma, even Big Data is behind its suppression. We need to gain back the freedom of the press, \"open source news\" that isn't the deceptive mind control rhetoric that Hollywood casts on you. There of course needs an open source government of sorts ultimately, which many open source communities operate similar to other 501c3 organizations like religious organizations, but they have to not give up its authority to the government. None of such things can be done if nobody seeks to take up their responsibility. The new scientific renaissance has to embrace its Quadrivium roots and also follow an unbroken line of logic, as well as unlearning the junk that we were told to accept that doesn't stand in true research and thus, the absolute truth that exists even if we don't quite get most of it and since we're humans, we never will get it because we don't have omniscience and if we do claim omniscience, we stop learning, but we can keep learning building from what we do know through new discoveries.\n\nTrue Christianity has stagnated in terms of its relationship with true science because people support the old concepts of what the bible provides as what is economic growth, and insists that nothing really had changed in every rise and fall of big empires, that everything that could had been done has been done in the past. Ever since the scientific renaissance that was slowly taken over by the Venetians into the current Aristotelian, Pharisaic form of science that we see today, we had moved from fire to charcoal to coal to oil to nuclear fission, but we had stopped and went backwards by using solar and wind energy and other environmental sources of energy that's ultimately worse than oil because of the energy density from nature is lower and unsustainable for our current population of 7 billion as it takes up too much space for much less than say a nuclear power plant verses a huge solar panel field that gets much less energy per square inch of space it takes up. Without a higher form of energy, global infrastructure projects (not to be confused with destructive enslavement through free trade policies) can't take place for all the world to reach a first world status of higher, improved living standards with collaboration of nations to have the roads connecting to each other to redistribute resources needed in nations and areas that lacks it. Why? To power and increase productivity of steel. See: <a href=\"https://larouchepac.com/energy-flux-density\" target=\"_blank\">Energy Flux Density</a>.\n\nUnlike LaRouche followers, I don't believe that any time soon would we have a truly transparent government by and for the people because it is destined to crash by the inertia of the debt stacking up created in thin air. See: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0\" target=\"_blank\">The Biggest Scam In The History Of Mankind - Who Owns The Federal Reserve?</a> <a href=\"http://www.silverdoctors.com/gold/gold-news/jim-willie-warns-this-is-it-end-game-is-underway-gold-silver-to-be-pushing-10000-400-by-end-of-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Willie Warns Final END GAME Is Underway</a>. Even if the people reinstate the Glass Steagall Act and take out Obama out of his office in the grounds that he's a psychopath and use the 25th amendment, nothing will change the fact that people give up their own God given constitution/mind for the constitution that the nation gives to its people. Unlike Iceland and Russia, perhaps even China and India that seeks an end to monetarism, the rest of the nations are under the many tentacles of the Venetian Oligarchy and its proxies. That doesn't mean the countries that are against monetarism are perfect. There is a dilemma that I see, the freer the people, the fewer they really are in numbers. The only way of combating this is to spread the truth to many people as possible in hopes that they spread it to many people as possible as well. In the individual level, there's self improvement and preparation for the times ahead. There's two kinds of Christians: Puritans and Separatists. Puritans make themselves appear innocent and obey the laws that they're against secretly that they disobey behind the back of the establishment until what they do is not illegal, like in the case of England when the Anglican Church was the only legal church allowed to exist. The Separatists don't hide their true feeling and they get caught protesting against the government. There's a convergence point where both Puritans and Separatists will deal with once they get cornered in which they will make a decision to make, to either flee to another land, or keep fighting for what they believe in, risking death. If they have nowhere to run, they will either be pacifists accepting martyrdom and the blood baptism, or they will take up their arms in battle in self defense to fight for their liberty or receive death in exchange of the lack of liberty. Do you have peace with such a death in your life? Don't fool yourselves into thinking that you can outrun the devil all the time, though we should flee from temptation when we can do so. Can you give no authority to Satan when he tempts you with power and security? Whether you see yourself more of a Puritan that wants to blend into society while maintaining an underground society that is against the government, or a Separatist that wants to give up on society and form your own society that is completely freed from all the oppressive laws of the land and sea for biblical ecclesiastical law, free will within God's will, and true separation of the state and church, we both need to unite for the dire times ahead.\n\nThere has never been a Christian nation, though there was a godly nation recorded in the bible as the Israelites and through the Jews. What do I mean by that? Until Christ Jesus himself comes down to earth to reign, there will never be any government run by the \"Christ\" of the Christians. A Semite is Arabian, so called Jews of the \"Israeli Jews\" by nationality on the unbiblical Zionist state of Israel is racist against Palestinian Jews, Palestinians, and all Arabians, all the people of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, yet they play the anti semite card on you. The Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire is far from being a Christian nation, as well as Ethiopia with Rastafarianism, not even the Puritans that came over to the Americas created a nation that had the literal Jesus Christ in the flesh even though they had a free republic, the nation we call the USA was a democracy built on the free republic which that democratic system was designed to fail from the get go and serves as a tentacle of the New Venetian Empire exoterically known as the British Empire. There is nothing wrong with creating a free republic, but it won't last forever as history tells us. This is why there needs to be a different platform altogether in self governance modeled after the open source community seen as the general Linux community. In some forms, such a system of religious governance exists, but we're so few in numbers, it's sad, really.\n\nI say all this convicted by my conscious to share my dilemma with you. Will you join me in the true resistance?\n\nüí´<strong>Just a reminder 4 Mar 15, 2016 @ 21:56</strong>\n\nI update my articles silently so learn to use archive.is if you want to save a screenshot of an article. USA is already transitioning to becoming a vassal state for China but the New Venetian Empire intends to trigger WW3 by blaming North Korea as the boogeyman as an excuse to take NK's Tungsten supply to further fuel the war business, to get one step closer into China and Russia to destroy them both in order to continue and expand globally their broken system of the already foreclosed and bankrupt central banks of many nations by China's attempt to get rid of the broken system of monetarism that only works through eternal wars and conquest of other nations. Even though the Freemasonic Trump is a Zionist, he has the potential to pull off a \"JFK\" to \"Make America Great Again\" while avoiding getting murdered by Barbara Bush that wants him dead through secret organized groups of crisis actors and even people working with Youtube and ISIS/Daesh/IS/ISIL/Syrian Rebels/Turkey/Saudi Arabia since the last guy that attacked Drumpf was in one of its videos. Xylitol is good for your teeth, but there's no true substitute for sugar except sugar (in its natural form) itself. Agave syrup is extracted with many different chemicals so stick to fair trade brown sugar or coconut sugar or organic raw unfiltered honey, preferably multifloral.

Here's the truth concerning it.\n\n1. Juicing is dangerous\n\nSome of the redeeming qualities concerning juicing is its structured water, enzymes, and many of the qualities that you would read about in say NaturalNews, but spinning water (with some liquid minerals or pink Himalayan salt) would also structure water, high speed blenders would destroy the enzymes, the juice contains high levels of sugar (assuming you juiced it, leaving out the natural fiber), it usually have a cooling effect on the body when if your body is cold, you need to eat and drink something that has a warming effect like ginger tea and garlic, cooked warm or at least room temperature, eating too much plant-based foods will disrupt your Zinc:Copper ratio and your Sodium:Potassium ratio as your body needs more Zinc than Copper, more Sodium than Potassium which plant-based foods have more Copper than Zinc, more Potassium than Sodium while animal meat is closer to the ratio that your body requires, and last but not least, some plant-based foods can be high in anti-nutrients; veggies like cabbage, dark greens and spinach contain anti-nutrients, therefore in order to break down the anti-nutrients, these foods should be cooked or lacto-fermented prior to consumption.\n\n2. Eating alkaline foods can make you sick\n\nEating a high pH diet over a long period would affect your digestion negatively, it will make people weak, some people get alkalosis from eating a lot of alkaline foods, like cucumbers, spinach, green food supplements, etc. You can get a higher concentration of various minerals in meat (including the organs) and such, but they need to be raw, organic, non-GMO if possible. Don't drink too much alkaline water without acidic but raw, organic, non-GMO meats, fats, etc. On the other side, drinking a neutral highly filtered water is also dangerous so be sure to remineralize it with pink Himayalan salt or whatever liquid mineral solution that you prefer though I don't recommend those.\n\n3. Protein powders are toxic\n\nProtein powders are a waste product, they can be contaminated with heavy metals, in nature, protein exists with fat, ergo, I don't think that isolating protein from fat is a good idea, they are too high in naturally occurring aspartic acid (aspartame) and glutamic acid (MSG).\n\n4. You don't need to take much fiber\n\nHigh fiber diets are shown to aggravate malabsorption, so why even take something indigestible in its isolated form? Our guts are designed for relatively large amounts of animal fat (70%), moderate amounts of protein (20%) and small amounts of plant-based foods (10%). Although that would somewhat vary between different races that eats more plants than other foods, I think some of those Asian races had became weaker because of that since not everyone has a body type that can process certain foods while the whole soy craze had created more problems than any benefits which soy has anti-nutrients that blocks protein absorption ironically, but it didn't affect some people that ate more fish, seaweed, and iodine rich food with unfermented soy products like edamame, fake meat, and any form of tofu that uses soy. Some Asians can benefit from not eating so much soy and fiber just as any other people of a different race.\n\n5. Fermented food is good\n\nMany hardcore raw vegans insist that they shouldn't eat dead things, so fermented anything, they detest like the plague. Some more open minded vegetarians benefit from drinking keifer, eating cultured cheese, eating fermented soy beans (natto), pickled food, and other things that ferments like kimchee. Fermentation lets bacteria and some anti-nutrients to break down to be digestible while the good bacteria takes over the bad bacteria (usually) when left to ferment long enough. Some vegans and vegetarians are afraid of the amount of acetaldehyde in fermented food. The largest source of acetaldehyde to the general population is through alcohol consumption (acetaldehyde is formed during the production of alcohol). Alcoholic beverages contain some of the highest concentrations of acetaldehyde. Depending upon the type of alcoholic beverages, and their batch, acetaldehyde content can vary. For example, beer may contain up to 63 ppm. Wine may contain up to 290 ppm. FortiÔ¨Åed wines may contain up to 800ppm. Spirits may contain up to 1159 ppm. Acetaldehyde content in a given food can vary widely depending upon variables such as its variety (i.e., Golden Delicious or Granny Smith), how it was produced or how ripe it is. A semi-ripe banana, for example, could have an acetaldehyde content anywhere between 10.13-16.36 ppm. Yogurt may have an acetaldehyde content between 23-55 ppm. A mild kefir may contain approximately 1.48 ppm. The following is a general list of foods and drinks that contain acetaldehyde: fruits and fruit juice (0.2-230 ppm), vegetables (0.2-400 ppm), dairy products (0.001-76 ppm), bread (4.2-9.9 ppm), tea and soft drinks (0.2-0.6 ppm). If that's their excuse, they should stop eating anything.\n\nWhile it‚Äôs true that fermented foods contain acetaldehyde, it doesn‚Äôt mean that they should be avoided. Acetaldehyde is a key ingredient many healthy traditional foods like yogurt, cheese, butter and buttermilk. Aldehydes have germicidal properties and, as such, have powerful bactericidal and fungicidal potential. There are plenty of other sources of acetaldehyde that I would try to avoid. Aside from alcohol, other sources may include, Candida sp. (yeast) overgrowth, coffee, breathing air contaminated with acetaldehyde from cigarette and other smoke (refineries, wood burning, trash, coal, forest fires), coffee bean roasters, smog (factory emissions, exhaust from on-road motor vehicles and other transportation sources such as trains, ships, farm and utility equipment), synthetic fragrances (air fresheners, scented candles, cleaning products, cologne or perfume), industrially processed foods (additives) and many commercially manufactured materials.\n\n6. Vegetation have low calories, high carbohydrates/sugar\n\nLet's calculate what a diet consisting of 70% vegetation (mostly from vegetables) would mean: If an average adult consumes about 2100 calories per day and their goal is to take in 70% of his/her calories from vegetation that would mean that they would consume 1470 calories from vegetation. One cup of mixed vegetables could contain about 32 calories. This would mean an individual would be consuming approximately 46 cups of mixed vegetables per day (46 X 32 = 1472 calories). One cup of mixed vegetables could also contain about 7 grams of carbohydrates (sugar). If you were to eat about 46 cups of vegetables per day, you would be consuming about 322 grams of carbohydrates per day [46 X 7 = 322]!!!\n\nThe government food guide recommends between 200-300 grams of carbohydrates per day (a recipe to create diabetes, obesity and a host of other health problems). Since we're not designed to consume a lot of carbohydrates, this amount of sugar in our diets would be very destabilizing for our blood sugar and would therefore tax our adrenal glands.\n\nNow, if your dinner plate is taken up by a fatty piece of meat, fish or chicken and it is surrounded by a few kinds of cooked vegetables (which may take up 70% of your plate), that's fine. In that case, in terms of space, vegetables can take up over half of your plate. But because vegetation has fewer calories than fatty animal foods, it wouldn't represent 70% of your daily intake of calories. Fatty animal foods are much more energy dense than plant foods. Among its very important roles, fatty animal foods are the best fuel to stabilize hormones, fuel your adrenal glands and support cell membranes.\n\n7. There will be less food if we don't eat meat\n\nAbout 2/3 of our Earth‚Äôs dry land is unsuitable for farming. It is primarily the open range, desert and mountainous areas that provide food to grazing animals and that land is currently being put to good use. At the present time, there is more than enough food grown in the world to feed all people on the planet. The problem is widespread poverty making it impossible for the starving poor to afford it. In a comprehensive report, the Population Reference Bureau attributed the world hunger problem to poverty, not meat-eating. It also did not consider mass vegetarianism to be a solution for world hunger. If animal husbandry were abandoned in favor of mass agriculture, brought about by humanity turning towards vegetarianism, there would be less food available for the world to eat. Furthermore, the monoculture of grains and legumes, which is what would happen if animal husbandry were abandoned and the world relied exclusively on plant foods for its food, would rapidly deplete the soil and require the heavy use of artificial fertilizers, one ton of which requires ten tons of crude oil to produce. If veganic agricultural systems were to gain a foothold on the soil, then agrochemical use, soil erosion, cash cropping, prairie-scapes and ill health would escalate.\n\n8. You can't get Vitamin B12 from plants\n\nWhile lacto and lacto-ovo vegetarians have sources of vitamin B12 in their diets (from dairy products and eggs), vegans (total vegetarians) do not. Vegans who do not supplement their diet with vitamin B12 will eventually get anemia (a fatal condition) as well as severe nervous and digestive system damage; most, if not all, vegans have impaired B12 metabolism and every study of vegan groups has demonstrated low vitamin B12 concentrations in the majority of individuals. Several studies have been done documenting B12 deficiencies in vegan children, often with dire consequences. Additionally, claims are made in vegan and vegetarian literature that B12 is present in certain algae, tempeh (a fermented soy product) and Brewer‚Äôs yeast. All of them are false as vitamin B12 is only found in animal foods. Brewer‚Äôs and nutritional yeasts do not contain B12 naturally; they are always fortified from an outside source.\n\nThere is not real B12 in plant sources but B12 analogues‚Äìthey are similar to true B12, but not exactly the same and because of this they are not bioavailable. It should be noted here that these B12 analogues can impair absorption of true vitamin B12 in the body due to competitive absorption, placing vegans and vegetarians who consume lots of soy, algae, and yeast at a greater risk for a deficiency.\n\nIt is true that Hindu vegans living in certain parts of India do not suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency. This has led some to conclude that plant foods do provide this vitamin. This conclusion, however, is erroneous as many small insects, their feces, eggs, larvae and/or residue, are left on the plant foods these people consume, due to non-use of pesticides and inefficient cleaning methods. This is how these people obtain their vitamin B12. This contention is borne out by the fact that when vegan Indian Hindus later migrated to England, they came down with megaloblastic anaemia within a few years. In England, the food supply is cleaner, and insect residues are completely removed from plant foods.\n\nThe only reliable and absorbable sources of vitamin B12 are animal products, especially organ meats and eggs. Though present in lesser amounts than meat and eggs, dairy products do contain B12. Vegans, therefore, should consider adding dairy products into their diets. If dairy cannot be tolerated, eggs, preferably from free-run hens, are a virtual necessity.\n\n9. Saturated fats are good\n\nSee: <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/resurrected-videos-from-abc-australia-explode-the-cholesterol-myth/\" target=\"_blank\">Resurrected Videos From ABC Australia Explode The Cholesterol Myth</a>\n\n10. Vegans and Vegetarians probably get Osteoporosis from their diet\n\nDr. Herta Spencer‚Äôs research on protein intake and bone loss clearly showed that protein consumption in the form of real meat has no impact on bone density. Studies that supposedly proved that excessive protein consumption equaled more bone loss were not done with real meat but with fractionated protein powders and isolated amino acids. Recent studies have also shown that increased animal protein intake contributes to stronger bone density in men and women. Some recent studies on vegan and vegetarian diets, however, have shown them to predispose women to osteoporosis.\n\n11. Meat eaters don't get kidney disease because of meat\n\nAlthough protein-restricted diets are helpful for people with kidney disease, there is no proof that eating meat causes it. Vegetarians will also typically claim that animal protein causes overly acidic conditions in the blood, resulting in calcium leaching from the bones and, hence, a greater tendency to form kidney stones. This opinion is false, however. Theoretically, the sulphur and phosphorous in meat can form an acid when placed in water, but that does not mean that is what happens in the body. Actually, meat contains complete proteins and vitamin D (if the skin and fat are eaten), both of which help maintain pH balance in the bloodstream. Furthermore, if one eats a diet that includes enough magnesium and vitamin B6, and restricts refined sugars, one has little to fear from kidney stones, whether one eats meat or not. Animal foods like beef, pork, fish, and lamb are good sources of magnesium and B6 as any food/nutrient table will show.\n\n12. The raw meat/animal product diet is superior to any diet that pushes plant-based food more than animal products\n\nSee these first: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVP9HqV8yoY\" target=\"_blank\">Interview with Dr. Aajonus Vonderplanitz on The Primal Diet - Raw Meat and Fat</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfCmJvCe0UY\" target=\"_blank\">The Roadkill Cure: The Paleo Diet in Lexington, Kentucky</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWDb77lq4wU\" target=\"_blank\">My Raw Meat Breakfast</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2xhlIIueZY\" target=\"_blank\">Eat More Fat? -- Amazing Results</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aMN6NLOTQ\" target=\"_blank\">Butter Makes Your Pants Fall Off</a> then look at these organ meat supplements and its health benefits: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160830033647/http://drrons.com:80/organ-and-glandular-supplements/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Organs &amp; Glands - Grassfed New Zealand, Freeze-Dried</a> then watch a few seasons of \"Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern\" show as well as going to your local \"foreign\"town and eat something you're not used to that is known in their culture to be highly beneficial to one's health, preferably something that's not a plant or a mushroom unless if it's natural remedies which you should have some, but that's not going beyond your comfort zone.\n\nTo limit your palate is to limit the medicine that you take as your food, which is to limit your own lifespan.\n\nHere's some of the sources that I've copypasted from: <a href=\"http://www.pamkilleen.com/frequently-asked-questions/\" target=\"_blank\">Pam Killeen - Frequently Asked Questions</a> <a href=\"http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/vegetarian.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Naive Vegetarian</a> <a href=\"http://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/myths-of-vegetarianism/\" target=\"_blank\">Myths of Vegetarianism - Weston A Price</a>\n\nTaken from <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/genocide-by-deception-global-adoption-of-veganism-could-save-8-million-lives/#comment-6153\" target=\"_blank\">http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/genocide-by-deception-global-adoption-of-veganism-could-save-8-million-lives/#comment-6153</a>:<blockquote>What did I tell you all those years ago? I warned you that veganism would become the normality amongst the goyim aka the herd. One of the organizations behind this genocide through diet and climate scam is none other than Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. One of the biggest names behind this plan is a New Venice Freemason by the name of Elizabeth Kucinich (British) who‚Äôs a member of the Freemasonic lodge called the Worshipful Company of Coopers based in the ancient city of Londinium (New Jerusalem) in New Venice (Britain). Elizabeth Kucinich is the New Venice agent who‚Äôs the personal handler of controlled-opposition Dennis Kucinich. Take a look at Elizabeth‚Äôs Gardenbar business and other ventures since her PCRM days. Now I ask you what would a young pretty woman want with a being like Dennis Kucinich? She‚Äôs assigned by New Venice to handle the controlled-opposition moves of Dennis Kucinich making sure there‚Äôs diversion games and of course no potential negatives for the New Venice Empire. The House of Windsor that currently is the New Doge of New Venice has signed off on Venetian Arsenal originated genocide plans which have been disguised as green policies for the favour of both mankind and the Earth. In reality these plans and the climate scam is designed to remove fifty percent of all global human population from Earth thus death by 2050 and then a further reduction is demanded of thirty-five percent of the survivors by 2100. The ideal of guising the plans by using green policies is so the goyim aka herd will accept their own demise through acceptance of false experts claiming to be scientific genius not to mention the degeneration of the populaces utilizing the plans of Bertrand Russell (highly admired by the Jesuit Order) of New Venice. Veganism may suit one out of five human beings but the other four could suffer chronic illness maybe even death over time if they try this dietary advise. William Donald Kelley mastered the knowledge of eating right for your blood type a long time before others cottoned onto the idea. Many people who‚Äôre vegan soon enough end up suffering from chronic illness! I was a vegan for a decade and quit to become a meat eater and I noticed immediate positive changes when I went back onto meats. Please don‚Äôt be fooled by charlatans, Freemasons/New Venice agents and instead listen to people who‚Äôre independent, experienced as well as nature. Do you see any true Traditional Chinese Doctor telling their patients to stop eating meat? No! My Chinese doctor went ballistic when she knew what I‚Äôd been doing for years and it‚Äôs thanks to her, TCM and prior teachings from another former vegan that I managed to reverse my veganism brainwashing. Veganism is another way for Malthusians of New Venice to brainwash the herd into causing their own demise whilst making it difficult for anyone else to de-program the victim‚Äôs own demise.\n‚òÜ¬¥¬®)\n.¬∑¬¥ ¬∏.¬∑‚òÖ¬®) ¬∏.¬∑‚òÜ¬®)\n‚òÖ(¬∏.¬∑¬¥ (¬∏.*¬¥ ¬∏.¬∑¬¥\n`¬∑-‚òÜ The Unhived Mind\n<a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/09/17/angelina-jolie-says-vegan-diet-nearly-killed-her.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/09/17/angelina-jolie-says-vegan-diet-nearly-killed-her.aspx</a></blockquote>\n\nFor other health articles, see: Therapeuo\n\nüí´<strong>Having some skin problems? Mar 29, 2016 @ 23:19</strong>\n\nHere are some topical solutions:\n\nWhen dealing with skin burns, apply lavender oil or a cloth soaked in colloidal silver water immediately. Depending on the degree of the burn, apply manuka honey or seek immediate medical attention. Fresh Aloe Vera juice might work, assuming you raise some in your home, but lavender oil is preferred.\n\nWhen dealing with scabies, get brimstone/sulphur powder and mix some with anything besides water that's good for your skin like say lavender oil then apply/rub it on the affected area.\n\nWhen dealing with herpes, use colloidal silver gel or use manuka honey.\n\nWhen dealing with shingles, try this: <a href=\"http://www.silvermtnminerals.com/products/silver-topical-gel\" target=\"_blank\">Silver Topical Gel</a> though really, everyone should try that for practically all skin conditions and I recommend people to use it.\n\nWhen dealing with acne or eczema/psoriasis, add some brimstone/sulphur powder to the <a href=\"http://www.silvermtnminerals.com/products/silver-topical-gel\" target=\"_blank\">Silver Topical Gel</a> by applying/rubbing the powder on the affected area after applying the gel, or use a small mixing container for this purpose.\n\nWhen dealing with chronic dry skin, try applying extra virgin olive oil frequently on the affected area, or also use the <a href=\"http://www.silvermtnminerals.com/products/silver-topical-gel\" target=\"_blank\">Silver Topical Gel</a>.\n\nWhen you've tried everything for makeup but you just don't have the skin you want, look into urine therapy seriously.\n\nWhen dealing with cancer stuck beneath the top layers of the skin, inject sodium bicarbonate dissolved in water with a syringe into the cancer and apply a somewhat higher concentration of iodine on top of the skin above the cancer. See: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20151231201723/http://www.curenaturalicancro.com:80/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Tullio Simoncini Cancer Therapy official page</a>.\n\nHere are some dietary solutions:\n\nEat healthy non-GMO, organic, raw, not heated nor frozen fats. Doesn't matter whether if it's plants or from animals, you need good sources of oil to make your own oil. See: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-superior-raw-diet/\" target=\"_blank\">The Superior Raw Diet</a>.\n\nStop drinking coffee. Sounds farfetched to many, but the kidneys have much to do with one's skin. Though dangerous, some people could get rid of eczema by clearing out the kidneys through water fasting but it will tax the kidneys and might hinder kidney function and even your youthfulness when done for a very long time. Try a kidney cleanse if you get bad skin reactions for awhile after drinking coffee.\n\nTake MSM, bee pollen, Lugol's Iodine, probiotics, digestive enzymes, broken cell wall chlorella, other sea veggies, do a liver detox, do a whole body detox, drink a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil every day with a tablespoon of lard or butter or animal fat or just don't drink olive oil, it might not be as good as they say (see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKBsNGiRgAA\" target=\"_blank\">The Lie Behind the Health Benefits of Olive Oil</a>), stop eating junk food, reduce contact with allergens. \n\nHere are some other \"solutions\" for your skin:\n\nTake short, cold showers to tighten up your pores. If you live in a dirty environment, it's not wise to use hot water for your skin.\n\nUse a shower filter to filter out at least the chlorine in the water, at most, the fluoride in the water. Those toxins are absorbed through your skin so it's better to reduce exposure.\n\nChange your bed sheets and plllow sheets every single day. Dust mites and scabies love it if you let them thrive.\n\nSpray some essential oils to items that has frequent skin contact if you can't wash them often or wash them period.\n\nClean up your house and the area around your house. If you can't move yet your body doesn't like your environment, do the best with what you can do and afford to do.\n\nReduce and minimize stress and sources of stress. A good way to tell if you have too much stress in your body is whenever you have strong emotions and if you feel pain in your guts, even just by touching the affected organ(s) associated with that emotion, that's bad. Sometimes other people should do this to you since you subconsciously limit yourself from pushing into your body's guts where it hurts even though normally one can push an inch into their guts without any pain with their fingers. Fat people might need to push into the fat more to tell. A faster way to tell is to find an adequate TCM doctor to teach you the basics on finding blockages on your own body, as well as showing you the blockages on your body (if any).\n\nIn some extreme cases, a dermatologist is required, though even something like keloids can be treated without a dermatologist if they sought after alternatives outside of the petrolchemical based medical system. Some diseases, even dermatologists don't deal with, stuff like leprosy and gangrene must be dealt with ASAP. When in such situations, if you are really and truly desperate, even Homeopathy (which works when utilized properly) is seen as a viable solution to what seems to be a nearly irreversible problem that can only be dealt with through complete separation of the affected area from the body.\n\nüí´<strong>What is race? Mar 30, 2016 @ 02:27</strong>\n\nRace is a word to describe something going from one point to another as fast as they can, as far as they can, better than others besides them that run towards something. Race is an inadequate word to describe \"ethnos\" that is translated as nation in some bible translations. Ethnos is not a social construct, but a divinely placed genetic construct made by God to push inequality that is perpetuated according to its kind. God is the sustainer and author of genetic inequality. Race mixing is unbiblical (not a sin but results to unrighteousness) for both the Jew and the Christian. The differences between ethnic races is prevalent by the organic eye and undeniable by real science. Communism through Black Theology has infiltrated modern Christianity into hating white people that brought Christianity to the western society, although its roots can be found within Roman Catholicism and even the Jews that infiltrated the RCC in collaboration with the Venetians in creating the Jesuit order. All races are created differently with their own weaknesses and strengths that can't be done away with when faced with statistics that shows a general trend among racial groups. We have the technology and data to tell the difference between a Chinese person and a Japanese person with 99% accuracy through DNA sample testing. \n\nJust because people of different races can make mixed race babies doesn't mean that race doesn't exist; it's like saying that colors don't exist because they can be mixed when it should be proof that there are colors to mix with in the first place. Mixed race people have an identity crisis in rejecting the notion of ethnos to be biblical to justify their very existence because the bible speaks against racial mixing so they take on the unbiblical, cultural Marxist, modern, politically correct Christian liberation Black Theology that makes the white man the devil and abolishes the concept of ethnos. There cannot be peace without threats of violence in a heterogeneous society that seeks to destroy the host ethnos, so the righteous thing to ease tension is to have segregation. Misegenation was pushed by Roman Catholic colonies but rejected by Protestant colonies and it is the excuse that had lead people to redefine Holy Matrimony (falsely known as \"marriage\" under the state) to be reduced to subjectivity outside of the biblical definition, for if one rejects one biblical definition concerning Holy Matrimony, everything else also has no jurisdiction and authority because that authority was given up for a different definition from a different authority, although in reality, it never was under the biblical system of limited government to begin with.\n\nMixed race people need to pick one identity over another, but there is only one true religion, one true God, one true Savior, and if they don't identify to be a Christian because they hate Europeans and the Anglo-Saxon people that had enslaved their other half which was biblically justified, they become living examples as to why mixed race people have a problem with being a Christian, especially if they're mullato, meszitos or any hapa mix for that matter that has suffered from Jesuitical, Catholic infiltration and destruction of their ethnos in the past which they give Christianity a bad image as a whole. Even if they are not any percent white(let's not forget that white people have their own ethnos that are different from each other), as long as they are mixed, the existential crisis that they would have if they sought after their roots can't be undone and to not let their suffering pass on, they have to make a choice to marry with one half that they associate with, or marry with other mixed race people to create even more problems unless they become mindless, worldly, materialist sheeple that seeks a shallow kingdom of God on earth while rejecting the coming of Jesus Christ to ever happen just like the communist, adulterous, MLK Jr., which such a system achieved through socio-democracy, the mob rule that is not any of the biblical forms of a righteous government with a communistic taste, though really, Communism is Talmudic and Kabbalistic or Cabalistic, Cabalist, Cabal.\n\nThe people can't confront an enemy that they can't properly identify. The failure to have the proper definition for it is in part the contributing problem that is perpetuating lies and unrighteousness, making them workers of iniquity with \"righteous\" intent that those with the Holy Spirit can identify yet many have problems describing the problem so they in their failure in proper expression of their explanations, lets it go by them to not be condemned by others for having a different view. Religious pluralism plagues even Protestant churches for they mix in Black Theology that is the trojan horse for Communism and Zionist propaganda, paganism and spiritualism, freemasonry and witchcraft, all in one cultural melting tower of Babel crumbling at its feet. Do you want to be without excuse and be certain as to your stance on race, culture, nationality, ethnicity, and the biblical definition of ethnos, or will you take a knee jerk reaction to this, ignoring the truth, and dismissing the truth as mere sophistry, smokes and mirrors? To those who have no ears to hear, they were simply predestined to ignore the truth, and to hear that from me, they would make baseless or false accusations against me when it is not what I say that will make them mad, but the truth itself that God reveals to them, for all truth is of God, for his glory, honor, and praise do I share this in.\n\nThese are some links and sources that I've used, though certain points I have not covered above:\n\n<a href=\"https://prowesternchristianity.blogspot.com/2013/02/a-pro-western-christian-reading-list.html\" target=\"_blank\">Reading List: Pro-Western Christianity</a>\n<a href=\"http://faithandheritage.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Faith and Heritage</a>\n<a href=\"http://faithandheritage.com/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ at Faith and Heritage</a>\n<a href=\"http://faithandheritage.com/2011/01/a-biblical-defense-of-ethno-nationalism/\" target=\"_blank\">A Biblical Defense of Ethno-Nationalism</a>\n<a href=\"http://faithandheritage.com/2012/07/a-proposed-biblical-model-for-racial-origins/\" target=\"_blank\">A Proposed Biblical Model for Racial Origins</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.christianityandrace.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Christianity &amp; Race</a>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx30AKtbDuA1S0U2M1IyanpqM1k/view?pref=2&amp;pli=1\" target=\"_blank\">Identitarian Christianity</a> &lt; if you&#039;re not going to read anything here, at least read this.\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdbOmc5yxWk\" target=\"_blank\">Anti-Miscegenation Laws, Sodomite Marriage, And The Jesuits</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm_Vv3Q24uQ\" target=\"_blank\">Black Lives Matter: The Rise of the \"DINDU\"</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODZ-RUufHgI\" target=\"_blank\">IQ | RACISM and the CONSERVATIVE</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4ZjodXY1DE\" target=\"_blank\"> Feminists vs Nationalists | Stockholm Train Station \"RAMPAGE\" LIE</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxpVwBzFAkw\" target=\"_blank\">Why Women DESTROY NATIONS * / CIVILIZATIONS - and other UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS</a> * UNINTENTIONALLY and/or INADVERTENTLY \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMfk5UeGw4E\" target=\"_blank\">The Endgame - Full White Genocide documentary</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44vzMNG2fZc\" target=\"_blank\"> With Open Gates: The forced collective suicide of European nations - Extended Cinematic 1080p</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJjSzXkm55o\" target=\"_blank\">How Zionists Divide and Conquer</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNMFZZOOZLg\" target=\"_blank\">The Insanity of Christian Zionism!</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJxdIXgMGAI\" target=\"_blank\">THE OTHER ISRAEL</a>\n<a href=\"http://communismbythebackdoor.tv/\" target=\"_blank\">Communism By The Backdoor</a>\n<a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-chosen/\" target=\"_blank\">The Chosen</a>\n<a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/modern-immigration/\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Immigration</a>\n\nüí´<strong>What are modern vaccines? Apr 17, 2016 @ 13:02</strong>\n\nThere are some things I haven't put in my <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/zika-virus-ebola-autism-hivaids-polio-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">Zika Virus, Ebola, Autism, HIV/AIDS, Polio, and more!</a> article because there's some things that needs to be addressed separately concerning modern vaccines. If you haven't gone to <a href=\"http://jimstone.is\" target=\"_blank\">jimstone.is</a>, you should do it, since you'll find the bulk of the information (<a href=\"http://archive.is/CCgIc\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.is/CCgIc</a>) of what I'm about to re-word and in some ways, simplify for my target audience. Really, everything on my website is more of a CliffsNotes study guide for Conspiracy Theories, a How to Understand Conspiracy Theories for Dummies. I've paid up to have my own \"forum\" of things that I've gathered through the ages as a website that I manage to further refine what I have in front of me in words that I know. If it helps others, that's great, but little to nobody knows about this website. Am I calling you a dummy? Who cares, dummy, but if you didn't catch it, I'm calling myself a dummy, my self that is.\n\nAnywho, let's start off with the origin of pet allergies before the 80's: you've guessed it, those viruses were cultured in animal cells which getting allergic to certain animals becomes a side effect. Although even before the mid 1980's there were aluminum, thimersol and other junk that may had caused autism before autism was properly understood in the 1950's as it was in the case of Dr. Aajonus Vonderplanitz which he cured his autism with raw eggs and raw milk during his 20's, modern vaccines ultimately can't be remedied of its dangerous side effects because it uses human cells, primarily from aborted fetuses retrieved from Planned Parenthood at least the majority made in America. Ever since aborted fetus cells were used in the mid 1980's autism rates increased. Beware of human albumin, and the human cell lines MRC-5, and WI-38 ingredients listed in vaccines as ingredients. Do you want to see a official list directly from the CDC? See: <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf</a>. Nobody can separate the viruses from the cells that those viruses came from as in, there is no flawless extraction method (nor any method altogether) to get viruses away from the cells without having some cell DNA and cell tissue mixed into the concoction. Some viruses can only propagate in human cells, therefore, whatever human organ cell that is used to propagate such viruses, your immune system will attack the corresponding human organ cell tissue and DNA, while metals present in the vaccine simply is a magnet of bacteria, fungus/cancer and viruses, generally in destructive synergy with the different types of metals in an increased assault inside your body as your white blood cells are reprogrammed to destroy the host cells while trying to remove the metals in the body, and no, your white blood cells don't know the difference between your DNA and cell tissue from another human's, hence, the increased rates of autism.\n\nMany scientists have now hypothesized that cancer and other childhood neurological diseases such as autistic disorder are caused by mutations in the child‚Äôs DNA. This conclusion is based upon finding numerous mutations in the brains and/or blood of such children which cannot be found in their parents, these are called de novo mutations. They are caused by something that happens to the child after birth (early vaccination). SCPI researches have extensively reviewed the potential health risks posed by this residual human DNA. Based upon that research, SCPI does ongoing research and seeks to raise awareness of the potential health risks of manufacturing medical products on human cell lines. Every child who receives the MMR vaccine gets at least a 10 point IQ reduction for life, and the worst hit develop full blown autism. The implications here is that your brain is not entirely your own, you have a parasitic entity that becomes a part of your brain but in its process of integration, you either get dumber or become a \"gifted\" high functioning autist, and what if I told you, that these elites don't do this without any reason.\n\nProbably the main purpose in creating autistic people is for the technocratic future. According to the England Hypothesis, named after research journalist Christina England, vaccine-induced autism is an intentional chemical manipulation to create worker drones ‚Äì sterile, docile, unable to question the conditions handed to them for their lives, content with boring, repetitive tasks, placid, disposable and interchangeable. In short, autists are the 'deltas' and 'epsilons' of the brave New World Order consistent with the genocidal aspirations of globalization via Agenda 21. Here's a doctor's analysis about it: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p3DHtxjLlg\" target=\"_blank\">DeltaProject</a>. In said globalization hierarchy, the \"Neo Aristocrats\" is at the top, law enforcement is at the middle, delta and epsilon technicians are at the bottom. Most labor is done by robots, the workforce is unnecessary therefore they need to be killed off by softkill while going through mind programming as their offsprings are chemically stunted of their physical and mental growth while they become infertile also chemically which Stevia makes one infertile by the way, which then they push recreational sex and such that won't help population growth anyways. Being creative and multiplying are both the nature of life for us people, which is managed through a patriarchal system that chastises women as God intended in the bible and is simply an historical fact that such societies fluorish while in its impending destruction, matriarchal societies come about but never lasts too long after the destruction of society that man had made and run as leaders. The delta and epsilon autistic males lack proper education and mental capacity to grasp when they should be submissive, assertive, and aggressive as their aggression becomes passive and they don't know how to be assertive while they respond improperly concerning the situations that they are in that they are aware of almost everything that they need to know. As the females become masculine in their roles, they seek masculinity in females since the males being effeminate psychologically and even chemically can't satisfy their desire for masculinity in them while males can't find feminine females since women being \"liberated\" from males see masculine males as their sex toys that they're entitled to, which means less people have sex ironically, especially the men, but in another twist, many of these women pushing for these ideals are unattractive to most men except for whiteknighting kiss ass men that seeks to gain their attention but in utter failure for the most part.\n\nHow would such people gain a living? They simply get free money from the government while having people work for imaginary currencies like bitcoins and such. What do you think Virtual Reality games and games like Minecraft and such is really doing to the minds of impressionable autistic children behind a computer? Labor can be done remotely and virtually for profit. It's either put society in a persistent coma hooked up to an IV forver, or change the current Zeusian system altogether for a better Promethean type of system that's backed by gold and guns with a goal that brings all people together like continuing space exploration for expansion. At a certain point in around 500 years later in real dedication for furthering and utilizing the creative, spontaneous will of mankind properly, space colonization is a plausible feat assuming we continue to multiply, learn to be creative (seeking new scientific discoveries) the right way by bringing forth intuition into intellect of the nature of reality that God had made so that it could be known. Such a Promethean society is in its awakening through the BRICS system, mostly from the support of Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, picking up where JFK and Gaddafi left things.\n\nOne last trick (more to come) the medical industry has done is to abuse the whole \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\" thing which is what they are doing to the whole Zika scaremongering. \"Doctors also are worried that Zika exposure in utero may have hidden effects, such as behavioral problems or learning disabilities, that are not apparent at birth.\", that is the excuse that will push the use of vaccines and the -cides, ignoring that even one percent of the microcephaly cases have actually been exposed to Zika. This is precisely why they are claiming autism rates will hit 50 percent by 2035, because they have their road map. Society cannot survive a 50 percent autism rate, this is cold hard proof that they do not want a New World Order, and instead, they want the near total death of mankind. That death will come via the needle.\n\nA Zeusian system is either Satanic or Luciferian but they're both one and the same. A Talmudic/Kronos/Saturnalian system can also be either Satanic or Luciferian but it's not Zeusian although they can and they are teamed up. The \"New World Order\" that they want to make is a (pseudo)scientific, Luciferian Order that benefits Zeusians (Venetians, Aristocrats) and the Synagoge of Satan/Worshipers of Kronos (Ashkenazi Jews by faith, some Sephardi Jews included). A Zeusian adheres to Aristotle's Aristocratic system as well as the teachings of Bertrand Russell and Aleister Crowley while the Tribe adheres to the Talmud and the Zohar of its mystical, demonic influences that is best described as the djinns as how the Islamic faith describes these malevolent demonic shadow entities that flee when mentioning Jesus Christ with conviction in proper biblical context and faith. The Jews by rabbinical faith continuing from the Pharisees which adopted Babylonian traditions and mysticism after the diaspora again (once before during Daniel's time) where they had elaborated on their oral traditions to the point of writing them down. As long as the Jews are among the Aristocrats, they ultimately have nothing against each other, just different sources of evil that goes hand in hand with each other as equals but truth be told, the worshipers of Kronos and their influences are worse than the Zeusians as they work in all levels of the system while the Venetians tend to pull the strings through smokes and mirrors as time went by, they use less and less of their proxies pertaining to the Jesuits that has lost their power and influence overall in comparison to the power the Jews have over others.\n\nThere are shills within the alternative health realm that claim that nagalase is the cause of the increased rates of autism. Those people (the people behing the \"The Truth About Cancer\" docu-series) do more damage than good when they make such claims because they are implying that you can unchimarize yourself of the de novo mutations which by the way, what affects your flesh and blood brain also affects your flesh and blood heart that contains similar \"brain tissue\", many of those who've \"changed their heart\" started to display behaviors that the organ donor had that was not a part of the behavior that the recipient had before. Your \"soul\" is not complete without your own brain and heart present, and these people say that GMOs can be detoxified and be changed with a organic, non-GMO diet while then implying that de novo mutations can be removed entirely. Oh how wrong can they be! They've even showed homeopathic patients cured of cancer yet in a QnA, reject homeopathy as a reliable cure for cancer or for anything for that matter, pushing the controlled opposition Naturopathy stance falsely misrepresenting what Homeopathics has to say and yes, Homeopathy also works against autism if you find a good doctor that had properly identified your miasms and personality profile that requires a constitutional remedy fit for your personality, although for the most part, your constitution rarely affect remedies that works for most people. There is no known cure for de novo mutations. The Jews opt out of vaccines using human cells while opting in of vaccines using animal cells or simply nothing but metals which can be detoxed when done right, but remember, the State of Israel's average IQ is 94, they're not as smart as they want you to think that they are \"master race\" as naive Protestants overglorify their genetics, but on the other side, they have very low autism rates. Instead of trying to be smarter, they push everyone to be dumber as chattel/cattle, goyim, autistic delta/epsilon sheeple workers in a spiritual coma. Don't take vaccines and seek vaccines that doesn't have human cells when forced to. It does not matter in a logical standpoint whether those cells are from Planned Parenthood or third generation cells that they lie in your face about since either way, vaccines containing them can cause de novo mutations.\n\nüí´<strong>A few things concerning Japan Apr 18, 2016 @ 00:00</strong>\n\nThe Japan that I know is not the Japan that Japanese people living in Japan knows. This is less about their culture but more about their history, religion, economy, politics, and last but not least, a few conspiracy theories.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the Babylonian cult was perpetuated as deities of a different name in Japanese Buddhism and Shintoism, but that is to be expected for most ancient religions. The Jomon people might had went to Valdivia of all places. The root of the Japanese language, originates in Malay language. Japanese Buddhism comes from Tibetian Mithraism which Tibetian Mithraism came from Persian Mithraism which comes from the Sumer/Babylonian cult from Nimrod. There's much more that's not mentioned as often in mainstream archaeology concerning certain origins. If you can understand Japanese, watch these (although I don't recommend his work concerning painting restoration, the whole ancient aliens theory and the reptilians): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auLC7S75Yhs\" target=\"_blank\">1795 Origin of Japanese Êó•Êú¨Ë™û„ÅÆËµ∑Ê∫êby„Åø„Å§„Åé„Éª„Åæ„Åï„Åø„Å§+Á∏ÑÊñá‰∫∫„ÅÆÊïÖÈÉ∑by„ÅØ„ÇÑ„ÅóÊµ©Âè∏Hiroshi Hayashi, Japan</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IYIf_nnbU4\" target=\"_blank\">1758 Mithrasism in Asia„Ç¢„Ç∏„Ç¢„ÅÆ„Éü„Éà„É©ÊïôÔºãË¨é„ÅÆÂØÜÊïô„ÉªÂº•ÂãíËè©Ëñ©Êïôby„ÅØ„ÇÑ„ÅóÊµ©Âè∏Hiroshi Hayashi, Japan</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnxvNTROo3o\" target=\"_blank\">1768 Komainu, Guardian Dogs in Sumer„Ç∑„É•„É°„Éº„É´„Å´„ÅÇ„Å£„Åü„ÄÅÊó•Êú¨„ÅÆÁãõÁä¨by„ÅØ„ÇÑ„ÅóÊµ©Âè∏Hiroshi Hayashi, Japan</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgoYg_Jy7Gs\" target=\"_blank\">1049„ÄêÈáç„Äë „ÄÄÁ∏ÑÊñá‰∫∫„ÅåÁØâ„ÅÑ„ÅüÁí∞Â§™Âπ≥Ê¥ãÊñáÊòéJomon People created Whole Civillization of Pacific Ocean</a>\n\nAlthough there are other theories concerning the creation of Lemuria from the west by black people from people like Frank Joseph and generally the Afrocentrists that sometimes falsely misrepresents key facts, not much is spoken of the eastern influences of Lemuria. In reality, history is a combination of Eurocentrism, Orientalism, and Afrocentrism, though concerning Lemuria, it's more Orientalism and Afrocentrism while concerning Atlantis it's more Afrocentrism and Eurocentrism. Although the word: \"Orientalism\" have different meanings, to make my life simple, what I mean by Orientalism is Oriental studies as Wikipedia describes it as \" ...the academic field of study that embraces Near Eastern and Far Eastern societies and cultures, languages, peoples, history and archaeology; in recent years the subject has often been turned into the newer terms of Asian studies and Middle Eastern studies. Traditional Oriental studies in Europe is today generally focused on the discipline of Islamic studies, while the study of China, especially traditional China, is often called Sinology and the study of East Asia, especially in the United States, is often called East Asian studies. \" but I don't care about political correctness, I mean \"Sinology\" but the Kush territory extends to the east side of the Nile River below Egypt, even extending to the Indus mountains which the Nile River was the true border between Africa and Asia, Kushites were people within said area, NOT as a race, and it's within Asia, below the land of Judah/Israel.

He had a lovely Japanese girlfriend in High School for a while and has been acquainted with the late Brother Daniel Fuji, one of the greatest Japanese missionaries of the 20th Century. Your Editor has charted the dismal history of Japan after the Devil‚Äôs Jesuit Order was formally readmitted into the island nation in 1865. Yet, secretly the Company had been readmitted immediately after that American rogue‚ÄîCommodore Matthew Perry‚Äîopened up Japan to White ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù (especially White Roman Catholic) men in 1854, we White men, to the exclusion of the Protestant Dutch, having been banned from the country for centuries due to one thing‚Äîthe Jesuit quest of reducing Japan and her Emperor to the Pope‚Äôs Temporal Power, Japan then to be used for the submitting of Buddhist China to the Pope of Rome.\n\nThe events following the invasion of Commodore Perry were catastrophic to the sovereignty of old Japan. The Order‚Äôs British Crown under Jesuitess and Apostate Protestant Queen Victoria was used in the attempted submission of Emperor Komei. In 1863 the Emperor issued his ‚ÄúOrder to Expel Barbarians,‚Äù but to no avail: the Shogun refused to enforce the order, the Emperor‚Äôs Protector now in the hands of the Jesuits. In 1865 the Sons of Loyola were formally readmitted over the objection of Emperor Komei, the Order having many friends among the Japanese lords called ‚ÄúDaimyo.‚Äù For this relentless resistance, the Emperor was poisoned in January, 1867, with smallpox, at the virile age of only 36. (Within three days, Crown Prince Meiji ascended the throne at the age of 14, he to reign for over 45 years.) The following year the Emperor‚Äôs great protector turned traitor to Rome, Jesuit Temporal Coadjutor Shogun Yoshinobu was ‚Äúforced‚Äù to resign thus ending the Tokugawa Shogunate (1603-1868)‚Äîonce the foremost enemy of the Society of Jesus in the Far East. Indeed, that same year ‚Äúthe Meiji Restoration‚Äù occurred, Komei‚Äôs adolescent son Meiji, only 14 years of age, began his formal reign under the argus-eyed oversight of Japanese agents serving the Jesuit General.\n\n‚ÄúThe Meiji Restoration‚Äù began the Order‚Äôs Japanese Imperial Empire (1868-1945), the same year the Black Pope would create his ‚ÄúHoly Roman‚Äù Fourteenth Amendment American Empire on the ruins of George Washington‚Äôs Protestant Federal Republic of ‚ÄúThese United States of America,‚Äù 1868. The Jesuits then centralized all political power in Tokyo to be overseen by Jesuit Sophia University later established in 1913 with the blessing of Emperor Meiji. (The Jesuits would do the same in their new American Empire, centralizing all power in Washington, D.C., 1871, this ‚ÄúRome on the Potomac‚Äù to be directed by Jesuit Georgetown University!) In 1877 the last Samurai resistance to the ‚ÄúNew Order‚Äù within Imperial Japan was annihilated thanks to American machine-guns given to Meiji‚Äôs new Japanese Army. (In this selfsame year Roman Catholic Army General Philip Sheridan, building the Black Pope‚Äôs ‚ÄúNew Order‚Äù in Imperial America ‚Äúfrom sea to shining sea,‚Äù defeated the Sioux and Cheyenne Indians during the Great Sioux War.) The Order‚Äôs Hollywood movie titled ‚ÄúThe Last Samurai‚Äù illustrates the event, Knight of Malta Tom Cruise playing the leading role.\n\nIn time, Meiji‚Äôs grandson, ascended the throne in Japan. Fascist Emperor Hirohito would be used by the Jesuit Order in using Rome‚Äôs Japanese Imperial Army to wage war in the Far East, its primary purpose being to totally destroy the Protestant Reformation and the reading of the Protestant Bible among the Chinese, Korean and Filipino peoples. This is how we understand the Japanese Army‚Äôs ‚ÄúRape of Nanking;‚Äù this is how we understand Jesuit Temporal Coadjutor American Army General Douglas MacArthur‚Äôs abandonment of the Philippines resulting in the ‚ÄúDeath March of Bataan‚Äù sacrificing tens of thousands of White Anglo-Saxon American Protestants and Baptists of the Old Protestant South no matter how many Roman Catholics perished! ‚ÄúKill em all; let God sort them out‚Äù is an old Jesuit maxim of war.\n\nTo ignite a world war between the Jesuit Empires of Imperial Japan (1868-1945) and Imperial America (1868-Present), an ‚ÄúEvent‚Äù was needed. Enter Pearl Harbor. As proven by Robert B. Stinnett‚Äôs masterpiece, Day of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor (2000), Masonic FDR and Masonic Hirohito worked together, via the Japanese High Command and the American Office of Naval Intelligence, for the successful attack on America‚Äôs foremost Naval Base in the Pacific. The Order would then use the military colossus of its largely White Anglo-Saxon Protestant American Empire to destroy Japan and its patriotic manhood as the prelude to converting the nation into an economic powerhouse later to be united with the Order‚Äôs Communist China in preparation for the Black Pope‚Äôs Sino-Soviet-Muslim invasion of America.\n\nThis brings us to our current crisis. We must ask, ‚ÄúWhy were the recent earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis imposed upon Japan?‚Äù For those of us who do not believe in ‚Äúcoincidence,‚Äù but rather in a Satanic International Conspiracy for World Government under the Pope of Jesuit-making as well as the Providential Sovereign Hand of the Risen Lord Jesus Christ over the Affairs of Nations, the answer is twofold. The first involves the Devil‚Äôs Jesuit Papacy; the second involves the judgment of the Son of God put upon a nation in open violation of his infallible written Word concerning the Nation of Israel.\n\nAs to the FIRST REASON, your Editor shall repeat his response given to one of his advisers who posed our question above.\n\n‚ÄúAs stated above, Japan has been a most obedient tool of the Pope‚Äôs ‚ÄúHoly Roman‚Äù Fourteenth Amendment American Empire since 1945. With its historic, anti-Jesuit culture totally destroyed by B-29 bombers of the Order‚Äôs Army Air Force commanded by Masonic General Curtis Lemay, it was rebuilt into a commercial slave-state by the U.S. Congress, it receiving credit to pay for that ‚Äúurban renewal‚Äù from the Pope‚Äôs Federal Reserve Bank, the labor and person of the U.S. ‚Äútaxpayer‚Äù serving as collateral further ensuring a future U.S. financial collapse and enslavement of the people under Cartel-Corporate Jesuit fascism. Japan also has one of the world‚Äôs largest navies. Thus, the Jesuits have rebuilt the commercial infrastructure of Japan for a reason, the same reason Communist China‚Äôs infrastructure is presently being built. I believe both have been created so as to unite them both in the building of a massive Asian naval flotilla and military for the planned attack of North America in the future as foretold by Bible-believing ex-priest Jeremiah Crowley in his Romanism: A Menace to the Nation (1912). This is the present Counter-Reformation endgame within the next, say, 20 years. And when the apostate Protestant, Fourteenth Amendment American Empire falls, that will be the formal end of the Lord‚Äôs Grand and Glorious Protestant Reformation. The White Protestant German Empire and White Protestant British Empire disappeared during the 20th Century via the Black Pope‚Äôs Second Thirty Years‚Äô War (1914-1945); the Protestant American Empire will end during the 21st Century‚Äîif Satan‚Äôs Jesuit Generals have their way.\n\n‚ÄúSo why the did the Order use its HAARP and underwater thermonuclear weapons in tandem to create these series of massive earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis in their Japan, a mere commercial colony of the American Empire? Indeed, this is the $64,000 question.\n\n‚ÄúI believe the purpose is primarily to ultimately drive Japan‚Äîthe Japanese people‚Äîinto the arms of the rulers of Red China (as the Japanese and Chinese rulers both work together for Jesuit ends). China will probably extend relief aid to Japan endearing the Japanese people to the Chinese people (two ancient enemies), thereby creating a willingness among the Japanese to abandon the camp of the U.S. and enter into the developing Asian Union headed by Red China. As you know, the Prime Minister of Japan was appointed by the Emperor who is a mere tool of the Jesuits, the Sons of Loyola working from their military fortress of Sophia University in Tokyo. (Notice this ‚Äòdisaster‚Äô) transpired north of Tokyo with the plan of the radiation to be blown east over the Pacific and not south over Tokyo‚Äîthe Jesuits of Tokyo escaping calculated harm.) The relations between Japan and China are not good at present and must be ‚Äúmended.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOther events seem to validate this conclusion of Japan‚Äôs future union with Red China. The Order‚Äôs conspiracy to use its CFR-controlled government of the American Empire to push Toyota into the ‚ÄúGas Pedal Recall‚Äù of 2009 was uncalled for. There was no problem with all those hundreds of thousands of Toyotas. The real purpose behind this injustice was to financially attack the auto giant so as to provide a justification (in the eyes of the Japanese people) for Toyota (also run by Japanese Jesuit Temporal Coadjutors) to move out of the U.S. and into the arms of Red China, then to set up shop inside the Communist giant. China is to be the 21st Century‚Äôs military ‚Äúsuperpower,‚Äù so why not move the world‚Äôs largest auto manufacturer to Red China with the cheapest labor and largest workforce on earth?\n\n‚ÄúAs events play out, there is going to be a horrible, unforgettable mass-death and destruction in Japan. The Japanese Emperor and Jesuit Joe Biden are parties to the plot (Barry Davis Obama is an idiot ‚Äúout of the loop‚Äù merely to play the role of ‚Äúpresident.‚Äù) When top Japanese Samurai nobles are informed of the U.S. government‚Äôs hand in this greatest of Japan‚Äôs desolations since WWII, moved with that internal Japanese rage they will deceptively drive the Japanese people into the arms of the Pope‚Äôs Red Chinese dictators ruled by the Jesuits in Beijing. When this alliance if finalized, the New Panama Canal will have been completed (2015-16) enabling the Chinese and Japanese navies to move their huge carriers through the canal so as to attack the apostate Protestant South via the Gulf of Mexico. And no wonder! For the ‚ÄúGulf oil disaster‚Äù (orchestrated by certain Knights of Malta such as Peter Sutherland) has softened up the U.S. Southern coast enabling a successful beachhead to be established after the attack.\n\nThe SECOND REASON concerns a judgment of the Risen Son of God upon Japan for violating Genesis 12:1-3. Pronouncing both a ‚Äúblessing‚Äù and a ‚Äúcurse‚Äù with regard to both individual and national treatment of the racial sons of Abraham through Jacob/Israel and their ABSOLUTE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT to the land of promise (Genesis 15:18-21), Japan is now experiencing ‚Äúthe curse.‚Äù Japan has sided with the Arab Muslims in their false claim to the land of Israel, a land solely the possession of the racial Hebrew/Jewish/Israelites. Yes, Japan, ruled by the Jesuit Order, has promised to aid the savage Arab Muslims to rebuild the Jordan Valley ‚Äúonce the Jews are removed.‚Äù Indeed, Japan, ruled by the Black Pope, has donated ONE BILLION Dollars to the savage Arab Muslim ‚ÄúPalestinians‚Äù to this end of driving the Jews off of their land and into the sea pursuant to the Palestinian Covenant of 1968. For further information, see Israel Truth Times here!\n\nGod usually uses ‚ÄúSecond Causes‚Äù in His enforcement of this ‚Äúblessing and curse‚Äù of Genesis 12:1-3. With regard to the weather, He can command storms, hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, forest fires, floods, mudslides, urban destruction, etc. But He can also use the means of evil men‚Äîmen in command of the White Power Structure subservient to the Jesuit Papacy now ruling the world‚Äîto bring about these same ‚Äúnatural disasters.‚Äù America is, to a lesser degree, under this ‚Äúcurse,‚Äù its effects having been repeated over and over again for the last 20 years or so. The floods in the breadbasket of the Mid-West, the forest fires in the West, the floods in the South and the snowstorms in the North-East are evidences of ‚Äúthe curse‚Äù due to the American Empire‚Äôs facilitation of the theft of Israel‚Äôs promised land having been taken away from Jehovah‚Äôs ‚Äúholy seed‚Äù (Isaiah 6:13) also called ‚Äúthe holy people‚Äù (Daniel 12:7)‚Äîthe Hebrew/Jewish/Israelitic racial people of the everlasting Abrahamic Covenant.\n\nJapan is now experiencing this national ‚Äúcurse‚Äù via the hand of the Risen Son of God using Satan, ‚Äúthe god of this world‚Äù (II Corinthians 4:4). Satan‚Äôs Jesuit Papacy has been permitted to impose the earthquakes and tsunamis on Japan via high technology, this mass-destruction fulfilling the plans of both Satan and the Risen Lord Jesus Christ. As to Satan‚Äôs plan, he is driving Japan into the hands of his Red Chinese government ruled by his high Jesuits (Jesuit Superior General Adolfo Nicolas being one of them), Satan assembling his ‚Äúkings of the east‚Äù for a future attack into Israel (Revelation 16:12). Meanwhile, God will use this crisis to save His Elect Japanese saints made willing to believe the blessed gospel of Jesus Christ unto eternal salvation!\n\nAs to the plan of God the Father through His beloved Son presently at His Right Hand to Whom the Father has given all power in heaven and in earth (Matthew 28:18-20; Psalm 110:1), High Priest Jesus Christ is enforcing the ‚Äúcurse‚Äù He pronounced in Genesis 12:1-3 before the days of His flesh. In so doing, the LORD is preserving a Jewish presence in the promised land, a presence that is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY if all prophecies concerning the Second Coming of Messiah are to be fulfilled. With no regathered Nation of Israel and with no Jews living in Jerusalem, there can be no Second Coming of Messiah (Zechariah 12:10; 14:1-4; Joel 3:1).\n\nSo let the intense suffering of Japan be a warning to all persons (natural and artificial) and nations, especially those of us in America. ‚ÄúDo not persecute the Jews within your nations! Do not persecute the Jews living in Israel! Do not take the land from the Jews living in Israel!‚Äù For in so refraining ourselves from such persecution and theft, we shall escape the ‚Äúcurse‚Äù and be brought into the ‚Äúblessing‚Äù of the Abrahamic promise we White Gentile peoples and nations of Protestant Western Civilization so desperately need. And in adding the frosting to the cake, we must expel the Jesuit Order from our shores‚ÄîFOREVER, that diabolical creation of Satan, whose agents in governments‚Äîacting in our names‚Äîare bringing the catastrophe of national destruction to all of our nations, which destruction of National Sovereignty and Individual Manhood is so necessary for the Pope‚Äôs Vatican-led, New World Order.\n\nGod help us to legislate the maxims of His Holy Word, the Reformation Bible in the languages of all nations, into our domestic and foreign policies that we might be ‚Äúblessed‚Äù with the peaceable fruit of righteousness including domestic tranquility, plenteous food harvests and economic prosperity. America once experienced this ‚Äúblessing,‚Äù and we can so again‚Äîif we repent!</blockquote>\n\nFor the record, Eric Jon Phelps is mastered by Count Vivian Vivaldi III who has pictures of him shaking hands with Cardinal Angelo Scola. \"Count Vivaldi III\", a Pallavinici cousin, was responsible for messing with Leo Lyon Zagami early on.

With all that in mind, ignore the whole pro Israel nonsense. He also don't know the true source of the Meiji restoration not coming from the Jesuits and Catholicism but based on the principles of the physical economy of Gottfried Leibniz, which he is the true father of the Industrial Revolution itself. The Meiji Restoration succeeded in rapidly transforming Japan into a major world economic power thanks to the theories of Alexander Hamilton and Friedrich List. (Erasmus Smith, a very close collaborator of Lincoln's economic adviser Henry Carey, was sent by the Ulysses Grant Administration as an official economic adviser to the Meiji Restoration.) The tradition of the Meiji Restoration of Okubo Toshimichi and Okuma Shigenobu and their policies were inspired by Alexander Hamilton and Friedrich List: the development of the creativity of human labor and the State development of science and technology which is the source of wealth in society-a tradition that was continued by MITI after the Second World war and by the Mitsubishi Global Infrastructure Fund.

The Japanese economy was based on market share but all has changed after the crash. There's two videos about how Japan functioned that's worth watching: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5Ac7ap_MAY\" target=\"_blank\">Princes of the Yen: Central Bank Truth Documentary „ÄéÂÜÜ„ÅÆÊîØÈÖçËÄÖ„Äè</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEUWxNifJJ8\" target=\"_blank\">Yanis Varoufakis: The Global Minotaur: America, Europe and the Future of the Global Economy</a> although might I remind you that Yanis Varoufakis is George Soros' pet. Ever since Japan implemented SSN style welfare system and NIRP, some of the Japanese people started to buy their own bank vaults and put their inevitably worthless hyperinflated cash there to prevent their money from being removed from their bank accounts.\n\nConcerning what happened on 3/11/11 (322, Skull and Bones number, 11 is the number of judgement), the EJP article I've copypasted here briefly mentions how he thinks happened, but his research is insufficient in comparison to what Jim Stone covers.

Through the ages, martial arts undergo many changes: they adapt to new circumstances, they branch-off and are altered, they are lead by new people. Others die with their inheritors. In the end, what we have may be likened to the message in a game of Chinese whispers; altered from its origins by so many people that any obvious links to its beginnings may be hard to find.\n\nThe many stories that make up karate‚Äôs history have not escaped the Chinese-whisper syndrome. Modern karate‚Äôs origins have been the subject of research and debate for so long that the history of karate now has its own history! This is partly because unearthing karate‚Äôs earliest predecessors requires mapping the entire history of the martial arts in the East.\n\nMany know Okinawa, an island 550 kilometers south of the Japanese mainland, as the birthplace of karate. But let‚Äôs look first to Japan, considered home to most karate systems existing today. Karate is now practiced in an estimated 120 countries and takes many forms. Of these, some of the most famous were founded in Japan after World War II, prominent examples being Mas Oyama‚Äôs Kyokushin and Choiro Tani‚Äôs Shukokai.\n\nAt the same time in Okinawa, the dominant schools (Ryu) were Shorin-Ryu, Goju-Ryu, Uechi-Ryu and Matsubayashi-Ryu. Although there had been karate demonstrations outside Japan in the late 1920s and ‚Äô30s, it was in the post-war years that karate arrived in European and Western countries like Australia. The Japan Karate Association, formed in 1948, assisted in spreading karate worldwide.\n\nThe many styles that developed inside Japan all grew from various Okinawan karate systems introduced to Japan early in the 20th century. Around 1902, karate was added to Okinawan schools‚Äô physical education programs and the secrecy that had surrounded the art lessened.\n\nHowever, some changes were made to kata for the purpose of teaching children and giving public demonstrations, and it is said this contributed to the loss of some knowledge concerning kata bunkai (applications) and thus the hiding of some of karate‚Äôs deadliest defenses.\n\nGichin Funakoshi\n\nShuri-te karate master Anko Itosu (1830-1915) pioneered this development and, though not alone, his student Gichin Funakoshi is the Okinawan most often credited with the establishment of karate in Japan.\n\nIn the early ‚Äô20s, Funakoshi impressed Japan‚Äôs Crown Prince with a karate demonstration and his art was later given support by Judo‚Äôs famous founder, Jigaro Kano, securing karate‚Äôs acceptance by the Japanese.\n\nMany Japanese held racist attitudes toward things Chinese or Okinawan, so these events were vital for Karate‚Äôs growth. The Okinawan‚Äôs originally called Kara-te tou-di, meaning China-hand. ‚ÄòHand‚Äô is a literal translation of te or di, which was used to describe Okinawa‚Äôs fighting arts just as the Chinese used the word for fist. To help karate blend into Japanese culture, the character tou was changed to a Japanese one meaning empty, hence we now have kara-te-do, ‚Äòthe way of the empty hand‚Äô.\n\nFrom there, Kenwa Mabuni founded Shito-Ryu (1928), and Chojun Miyagi established Goju-Ryu (1930). Funakoshi founded Shotokan in 1938 and Hironori Otsuka blended jiu-jitsu with karate (learned from Funakoshi) to form Wado-Ryu in 1939.\n\nUniversities in Tokyo and Osaka formed karate clubs and the art of Okinawan China-hand soon became Japanese. The Butokukai, Japan‚Äôs top combat-arts organisation, also helped Japanise karate, creating standards for teaching and developing ways to competitively test the arts. These were the beginnings of sport-karate.\n\nThe various Okinawan karate schools had always been scattered and disorganised, divided into closely guarded regional and family groups (much like the arts of China).\n\nMany styles existed but the primary three schools were all concentrated in a small area of southern Okinawa and named after their towns of origin: Naha, a town of merchants, Shuri, home to royalty, and Tomari, inhabited by farmers and fishermen. Variation between the styles is partly attributed to the distinct influences of these different classes of society.\n\nShuri-te featured long, low stances and an offensive approach, considered derivative of Shaolin Temple kung fu, while Naha-te is considered the most Chinese, incorporating hard and soft methods, breathing techniques and ki, (Chi or vital energy) control.\n\nTomari-te (which focused on using the arms) developed from these two and together they were the basis for the Japanese styles; Naha-te became Goju-Ryu and Shorin-Ryu is a product of both Naha-te and Shuri-te. From the Goju and Shorin schools emerged Shito-Ryu, and so on.\n\nKarate History Origins\n\nThe facts concerning Okinawa‚Äôs sources of martial arts influence are often vague and unverifiable, some say because WWII bombs have destroyed much of the evidence. Still, aside from the continual development of self defense methods among Okinawans, it is accepted that Chinese martial arts have most greatly influenced present-day karate. In fact, Chojun Miyagi said a style of kung fu that arrived in 1828 was ‚Äúthe source‚Äù of Goju-Ryu.\n\nThis passage of combat knowledge from China is closely linked to a book of Chinese origin called the Bubishi, the subject of Kyoshi Patrick McCarthy‚Äôs book, The Bible of Karate. Published sometime during China‚Äôs Qing dynasty (1644-1911), it details Chinese kung fu history, technique and philosophy.\n\nIt‚Äôs believed the Bubishi was written by a White Crane boxer, Fang Qiniang, the daughter of an Eighteen Monk Fist kung fu stylist who escaped the destruction of the Shaolin Temple by government forces (Shaolin was known to house and train revolutionaries) and settled in Fujian, China. Both feature in the Bubishi, as do their systems.\n\nThis book was kept secret and hand-copied by generations of Okinawan masters; Funakoshi‚Äôs books even contain chapters taken directly from the Bubishi.\n\nMcCarthy‚Äôs extensive research exposed 10 more-or-less plausible theories as to who brought the Bubishi to Okinawa. Featured among them are some Okinawan masters who trained in China, including Uechi-Ryu founder Uechi Kanbun, who studied Shaolin Tiger kung fu in Fuzhou around 1897. Yet, while the Bubishi is of great importance to Okinawan karate, it did not arrive in Okinawa until sometime in the 1800s and was preceded by many more influential exchanges.\n\nCommon folklore tells of karate‚Äôs development by downtrodden peasants, their weapons confiscated by Japanese invaders, who developed secret fighting traditions while their rulers slept.\n\nLegend has it that this is why karate gi‚Äôs look like pajamas because they once were, and the tradition has carried on. However, these romantic origins are considered unrealistic by most historians, as Okinawan combative traditions go back much further.\n\nIn the 800 years between 600 and 1400 A.D., Okinawa experienced territorial fighting under the rule of warrior rulers and in the 10th century military power struggles in Japan saw some warrior clans move to Okinawa. From 794 to 1185, Japan‚Äôs methods of war were introduced, including grappling, swordsmanship and other weapon-arts.\n\nOkinawa‚Äôs regional warring continued until 1429, when the rival groups came under one rule as the Ryukyu Kingdom. In 1507, feudalism (a system whereby peasants farmed for a wealthy lord and fought in his army) was abolished and private ownership of weapons was outlawed. This, says Kyoshi McCarthy, ‚Äúexplains why the Uchinanchu [Okinawans] began intensively cultivating an unarmed means of self-defense‚Äù.\n\nSo, long before karate was exported from Okinawa to Japan, the Japanese were bringing their own combative arts to Okinawa. However, Chinese kung fu‚Äôs influence was more recent and is more evident in the Okinawan karate that exists today. Again, there are many theories explaining how it got there.\n\nOkinawa established trade with China during the Ming Dynasty and by 1393, a group of Chinese referred to as the 36 Families was settled in Naha, Okinawa. There, Okinawans were taught Chinese language, culture and, it is assumed, martial arts. During this period, Okinawan students also traveled to China to study and possibly learn martial arts.\n\nAnother likely source are the sapposhi (representatives of the Chinese Emperor) who, in the 1400s, came to Okinawa for months at a time with many multi skilled people in tow, including security experts. The Chinese kung fu that arrived in Okinawa, possibly by one or all of these means, was then used to police the island.\n\nAfter 1509, with even government officials barred from carrying weapons, these civil defense methods went underground, but were secretly practiced and developed by the middle-level samurai class known as pechin, whose responsibilities included law-enforcement.\n\nIn 1609 Japan‚Äôs Satsuma clan captured the Ryukyu Kingdom and until Okinawa became part of Japan in 1879, eclectic fighting traditions grew. Due to the weapon bans, kobudo evolved through Okinawans making use of domestic and farming implements instead, of which the sai is an example (it is said to have once been a hay-fork).\n\nSome pechin also visited Satsuma and learned the Jigen-Ryu ken-jitsu of the Satsuma samurai; it is thought that the six-foot staff techniques of Okinawan kobudo originated there. One example is Matsumura Sokon, an important figure in Shuri-te who was a security agent for various Ryukyuan kings and studied martial arts in Satsuma and Fujian, China.\n\nBut to fully explore the origins of China-hand, one must look to China. Most brief histories of karate begin with the legend of the Indian monk Daruma (in Japanese) or Bodhidharma, generally described as a skilled martial artist born into a warrior caste.\n\nHe traveled to China around the Sixth Century AD to spread Zen Buddhism, settling at the Shaolin monastery to teach Buddhist meditation and philosophy, and physical movements that included striking ‚Äì the alleged beginnings of the kung fu systems mentioned so far.\n\nHowever, there is evidence of strong warrior traditions existing in China long before the arrival of Daruma (the first emperor to unify China, Qin Shi Huang, for example, left terracotta replicas of his entire army in Xi‚Äôan in 210 BC).\n\nIt could also be logically concluded that fighting methods and traditions existed to an extent in all human societies, just as surely as quarrels and aggression existed. Texts discovered in China, reportedly 4,000 years old, detail systematic physical training, while 2,800 year-old writings describing unarmed combat have also been found in Europe. That aside, the previously mentioned systems of Monk Fist and White Crane kung fu can be traced to Shaolin.\n\nWhile it is uncertain how much of Daruma‚Äôs story is true, the legend is strong and there is little doubt that the texts and exercises introduced to Shaolin have been influential there. However, there have since been many other developments in the kung fu of Shaolin, with various influences flowing into and out from the Temples, leading to the creation of many different styles.\n\nKeeping in mind that traditions are ever-changing, the predecessors of Shaolin martial arts are not necessarily the true origin of karate, just as one person in a game of Chinese whispers has only a small influence on what is whispered at the end of the line.\n\nDue to Okinawa‚Äôs location (just 740 kilometres east of China and 550 north of Taiwan) it attracted the attention of pilgrims, traders and pirates of many races and has therefore had centuries of cultural exchange with Korea, Laos, Cambodia and numerous other Asian cultures with martial traditions.\n\nSome karate historians even say that the need for Okinawa‚Äôs sailors to protect themselves against pirates played a part in the development of Okinawan te, which has existed in various forms for at least 1,000 years.\n\nDespite the focus of Japanese martial traditions on weaponry and grappling during the periods that Okinawa was most exposed to them, their influence on Okinawan karate and kobudo should not be discounted either. So, to provide a complete history of today‚Äôs karate, it would be wise to also include the history of all Japanese martial arts. That, however, would be another story entirely.\n\nA good analogy for the history of karate might be that no child is born of only one parent; they will therefore have four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, and so on. It can be said that all karate systems in existence today are the descendants of many different parents, each with unique genes but also similarities, evidence of shared ancestors somewhere in their lineage.\n\nThat said, it is well worth digging around for the many great individual stories that make up the history of karate. Some of us might also benefit from researching a history that is more personal, immediate and accessible: what of your teacher, his life and his art? Who has he trained with, in what systems? How has karate affected him, and he it? And what of his teacher?\n\nAlthough the past is often more wondrous than any prediction of the future, historians uncover it not only out of curiosity; their common aim, it is often said, is to learn about the present from the events of history. So, by uncovering your instructors‚Äô karate history, you should learn much that will help you on your own journey. You may also choose to learn from the history presented in this article and write it down carefully for future generations.</blockquote>\n\nüí´<strong>Ode to Stupidity Apr 20, 2016 @ 04:20</strong>\n\nThis is a rare rude and very insulting rant.

To me, satire and comedy has its place somewhere in stupidity, it embraces it while being disgusted about it by fueling its vicious cycle of stupidity for some stupid reason that insists that it exists and has its place in existence as if it is a part of our very being, yet there's a good and a bad type of stupid, how's stupid is that, stupid! When I think of stupid, I imagine a 1930's black and white cartoon man with a stooped posture and buck teeth being crosseyed and silly, but sometimes the face changes to someone I recognize. What a nightmare, because it's face is really a mirror. That reflective face however, is actually not others see me. My right side is my left and my left side is on the right, but that's when comparing it to what I see in the mirror. We can see others and laugh, but we can't literally see ourselves with our own eyes the right way without a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSxCZCy5Wsk\" target=\"_blank\">True Mirror</a>. The joke is that there is nothing funny, yet it's still funny, even if we get the right perspective that isn't funny. Stupidity is beyond reasoning, therefore, whatever value it has in laughs is also beyond certain forms of logic yet it has its own formula for it to be the right amount of funny, and making a stupid ode for stupidity is anti humor when you are too stupid to make a joke that's for some stupid reason, is also funny because it's so bad which it defies how things should be which for some reason at times it's funny, how stupid of us to rationalize stupidity with stupidity in stupidity to have a laugh here and there. How can anyone that can grasp stupidity without being stupid? I think it's impossible. Robots can never be stupid because they're dumb unless if they are programmed to laugh at something stupid in which case I say, is proof that God has hardwired us to laugh at stupidity, just in various intensities in some regardless of how smart or dumb they are. Dumbness is not stupidity, stupidity implies that it can be not stupid while dumbness is a condition probably from literal brain damage or from genetic reasons. This is stupid, this isn't an ode anymore, why am I posting this on 4/20 4:20 anyways.\n\nüí´<strong>The two biggest lies concerning the \"Jews\" and other myths Apr 21, 2016 @ 21:38</strong>\n\nLie #1: Jews are Judahites. Lie #2: 6 million Jews died in a burning sacrifice.\n\nThat's it, everything they do is centered around those two lies. Absolutely ZERO Judahites died from cremation and starvation and being overworked and poisoned, etc. It's not called Jew-ish without a reason, and they don't call themselves Israelites but Israeli(e)s.\n\nThe amazing thing concerning this is that I can disprove the core those lies just by sharing you these two links: <a href=\"https://biblicisminstitute.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/jesus-was-not-a-jew/\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblicisminstitute.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/jesus-was-not-a-jew/</a> <a href=\"http://www.radioislam.org/islam/english/revision/six_million_myth.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.radioislam.org/islam/english/revision/six_million_myth.htm</a> but for good measure, here's a third link: <a href=\"https://biblicisminstitute.wordpress.com/2014/08/23/whatever-happened-to-the-hebrew-tribes/\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblicisminstitute.wordpress.com/2014/08/23/whatever-happened-to-the-hebrew-tribes/</a>\n\nThe more shocking claim here for some people is that the word Jew was not only added to the bible (yes even in the Anglican KJV and the Catholic Douay-Rheims bible), it replaced the word of what it used to say: Jehudite/Judahite/Judean through revisions, since the word Jew didn't exist until 1775, and Judaism is of Neo Babylonian-Rabbinical origins, not the continuation of the Levitical system which the Kingdom structure of the Jehudites and the Benjamites continued through the destruction of the lost tribes of Israelites to the pagan nations that had decimated them as God also had decimated the Jehudites and the Benjamites, made Israel desolate, empty, nada, ziltch, nothing left, gone, nihilo, while those that escaped who are not Christians are left to die in the wilderness, and any non Christian Jehudite are no longer in God's covenant. This is the biblicly based interpretation that is hated by the fake Jehudites called Jews that practice Talmudic and Zoharist principles elaborated upon the Rabbinical Judaism (-ism is a common suffix used to identify it as a religion dealing with faith and/or a mental construct/mindset). Since a Jew is a Judaist, for one to claim to be a Jewish-Christian is heresy. It's like a former Luciferian that decided to be a Christian yet favoring Luciferianism as well, had decided to call himself a Luciferian-Christian which is in itself ecumenicalism/pluralism. That's why Ebionites and Nazarenes and such Jewish-Christian hybrid cults were heretical, not because they claim to be Jehudites, but because they claim to be Judaists/Jew.\n\nThe other implications here is proof of Jewish/Judaist's infiltration of both Catholic and Protestant churches, that the Jews are Live Action Role Players (LARPs), that a Messianic Jew is most likely a European (probably with Neanderthal DNA, Samarian blood, and gypsie blood) LARPing as a Jehudite/Judahite first and foremost that's LARPing as a Christian second, gaining unbiblical privilege as \"<a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-chosen/\" target=\"_blank\">The Chosen</a>\" pushing victimhood culture and as the means of political gain and power within such churches for its ultimate destruction of \"Christianity\" or at least Traditional Christianity that hates Jews for who they really are: frauds.\n\nAnother implication here is that you need to from now on, consciously change every word that says \"Jew\" in your bible as Judahite/Jehudite/Judean from now on.\n\nFor the long time reader, please note that I won't bother changing or deleting older posts that might show seemingly conflicting information. Looking at past mistakes and mindsets is helpful to some that wants to transition out of wrong mindsets and cults. Maybe I was wrong about the Holohoax having 5 digit death toll of \"Jews\" or that might had been concerning just one labor camp which then I'm still right, but the Red Cross number is a fairly reliable estimate, and even then, they weren't treated like garbage, they didn't have much resources, resources that the Banker Jews themselves via Britain and France had \"starved\" Hitler's Germany from having. It is because of Hitler that Communism wasn't fully drenched in all of Europa until in recent years, and Communism itself is run by Jews. Again, these Jews are not Judahites, they're Rabbinical Judaists without any mustard seed faith in the Christian God that is the biblical God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel/Jacob which it is he that demanded the desolation of the Jehudites that don't believe in him for the New Covenant, and no, it's not \"Renewed\" Covenant either. What happened in 70 AD was an act of God through Satan's army against those Judean Judaists and Judeans that rejected their true King of the Judeans. No tribe of Israel is \"lost\", they've merged with the world or were all slain by God.\n\nMessianic translations are deceptive despite its seemingly noble task of removing the cow manure translations when certain words can't be properly translated word for word without a loss of meaning which in its place, a transliterated word because there is no equivalent in the language it's being translated in. I read the 1599 Geneva bible with caution because I use a modernized translation of it, but I don't use Messianic \"Scriptures\" (bible is apparently a trigger word for them) full time, only as a reference in what nonsense these Jews are trying to push. Like, a very small percentage of it has accurate interpretation, but many lack the context to discern the majority of the nonsense such translations.\n\nJews are not God's chosen people, Jews and Venetians did 9/11, there was no fire sacrifice of Judeans, Adolf Hitler was funded by Banker Jews and Venetians, the Jews/Saturnalians (Worshipers of Kronos) and Canaanite-Phoenician-Samarian-Venetian-Genoese-Black Nobility Bloodlines/Zeusians had teamed up to create the Jesuits, Zeusians are more covert in their genocidal tactics as softkill programs while the Jews are overt in their destructive power as forced, virtually unregulated immigration policies. Realistically speaking in a different mindset, \"Christianity\", Islam, and other religions are all in great danger from the Jews and the Venetians unless all the nations and blood race kin (ethnos, the extended family) don't keep their ways in check somehow, but first, those religions needs to un-Jew their history, science, culture, and religion. The opposite of divide is to multiply, while the remedy to divide and conquer is rebel/resist and combine. To combine properly is to do dialogue to be able to find a common ground without any side losing ground. To conquer properly is to consume and assimilate with blind conviction by mind control first, by force second, but Jews don't care about ethics concerning the golems.\n\nThe mindset of a Jew is that of a psychopath, that of occult cult leaders, of a murderous serial killer charlatan. Be careful before it's too late for you. Around Jews, never relax. They are worse than Satanists, the Jesuits, Freemasons, etc, and the thing is, many of the poor Jews are duped in the cult of Babylonian Judaism. There is no easy way of breaking the truth to them. The breadpill is even harder for them to accept, the bread broken for us on the cross. The Jews should assimilate to the culture and hopefully the Christian faith and repent from their old ways. Satan uses the Jews because of this. If a Jew that calls himself Christian yet can't let go of their status as a \"Jew\", they are not Christian, simple as that. Anti-Semite means anti-Shem, or simply, Mongoloids/Asians, which includes Arabians and of course, Palestinians, even extends to the right side of the whole Nile River so that includes the Ethiopians. Ashkenazi Jews are of European descent from the Khazarian Empire that declared their citizens to be Jews while the Sephardic Jews are from Sepharad, which is from Mede (Modern Iran) which Mede is Madai, son of Japheth. Sepharad/Sephard comes from the Persian word Saparda. The Ethiopian Jews are being treated as outcasts by Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews yet they don't play the Anti-Semite card since they appear more Hamite (black) than Semite, see: <a href=\"http://www.christianityandrace.org/p/area-in-black-designates-areas-called.html\" target=\"_blank\">Christianity &amp; Race: Was Biblical Kush/Cush Black African?</a> Through victimhood culture, they gain huge privileges in their host nation but they end up destroying their nation which even the Judeans and the Hebrews had done so as the Holy Bible speaks about. The Judaists celebrate Purim since a threat of genocide is grounds for genocide of the host nation in which their success in perpetuating the Holohoax had given them power. Their modern Esther is Anne Frank which is authored (made up) by her father which his book was later had an extended copyright on it. Schindler's list was a completely fictional book and movie meant for the sole purpose of brainwashing. Esther wasn't lying, but the Jew are lying to justify the genocide of the people. The Hebrews, Israelites, and Judeans time after time had destroyed their host nations, so anyone that claim to be a Jew is equally dangerous for those nations as they are the destroyer of all cultures including the Christian Ecclesia/community, not to be confused with Kuriakos/church.\n\nNot all Jews are controlled, but those that are in the inner sanctum will sacrifice some Jews to plead their innocence for their greater \"good\" of their agendas to not be blamed for what they had done to their own. A Jew does not need to repent for being possibly a Judean despite being unable to prove their lineage without dealing with endless genealogy spoken against of as \"proof\" of being a Judean by Apostle Paul, a Benjamite-Judean converted to Christianity. A Jew repents for being a Neo Babylonian Pagan-Rabbinical-Pharisaical-Ebionite-Talmudic-Zoharist-Karaite-Orthodox-Frankist-Sabbatean-Zionist-Reformed-Messianic \"Judaist\" even if they are poor and not within any other cults or other degenerative worldly mindsets or within the upper levels of the powerstructure among the modern versions of the \"Sanhedrin\". The real answer to the Jewish question is to expose everyone to what they are first, and then to keep them away from gaining any power over people, for like the Jesuits, they are deceivers that are outwardly angelic bathed in light, inwardly evil like Lucifer. There are other deceivers out there that uses their same tactics. They may not be in any occult cult, but they are brainwashed by Satan, their hearts are hardened by God, and are placed in high places to deceive even the very Elect. Come out of the Synagogue of Satan, the Whore of Babylon, the Jezebel spirit. Behind the veil they worship Tammuz, celestial bodies above, Moloch, Chiun, Saturn, and the \"Angels\" of the Shemhamphorash (72 names of \"God\") through invoking certain verses in the book of Psalms. Don't heed to the howling sirens that gets activated once you seek the way out of that cult to notify their goons to make their attempts to keep you in a certain mindset through fear and deception. They will always reject logical absolutes, which God is the lawgiver of all logical absolutes.\n\n\"Hebrew\" predates the Israelites as Joseph was called a Hebrew. The bible unfortuntately can't explain this by itself as to how an Egyptian could identify a Hebrew from say a Canaanite or if they've also called a Canaanite a Hebrew. Biblical Judaism was practiced by the Saducees, taken in its extremes by the Essenes, but mostly what we call \"Judaism\" these days is Rabbinical Judaism stemming from the captivity of the Judahites + Benjamites in Neo-Babylon, think book of Daniel. What came off of that is a priestly system that didn't rely on the older, biblical Levitical priesthood. They had adopted the Babylonian cult and created the \"Sanhedrin\", the inner circle comprised of 70 elders that invoke a feminine spirit called the Shekinah Glory, the false Holy Spirit. Anyways, Rabinnical Judaism = Pharisees. After the destruction of Jerusalem, what survived was Pharisaism as these Pharisaical Judaists that somehow fled had went to Babylon and stayed there for a good 1000 years and further increased their system to the point of writing it down as the Talmud and the Zohar, which it's the Zohar that Kabbalism comes from. King Herod the Great was an Edomite raised by Judahites. Even the Judahites admitted to the fact that the real King of the Jews was not King Herod, yet it's the Roman Empire that falsely crowned him king, and it's his son that continues his father's reign later on. The Pharisees and the duped Judahites believed that Caesar is their new King of the Jews (using this term flexibly now) as they didn't want to call an Edomite a Jew, neither call Jesus a King.\n\nA different definition of Judaism has to do with continuing the line of Judah's reign, but without a king, there is no \"Judaism\" so they had to create either a new system or they would have to use the old kingly system just without a king. Rabbinical Judaism became Orthodox Judaism in a sense since they still had the Tanak/Old Testament with them but then came Reformed Judaism that disposes the notion of repenting of their ways before returning to Israel in obedience to God and reduced the already dilluted form of Judaism as Rabbinical Judaism into a mere nationality. British Israelism and Hitler's Germany funded the Jews to return to Israel. Zionism replaced the already corrupt form of Judaism that mixes the Oral Law with the Written Law for pushing only the Oral Law and its views supercede the Written Law. That's probably the reason why some Torah believing, Anti Talmudic Orthodox \"Jews\" that had no proof of being of the tribe of Judah was sent to the labor camps, but I don't know. What I do know is that the controlled Christian alternative media pushes the lie that the 6 million happened. I assume among the 270,000+ or so Jews died in the Holohoax, the traditionalist Jews that resisted Zionism died from Typhus if they weren't assassinated or fled Europe altogether hiding their true anti Reformist faith into USA and other nations. This is why there's tension between the Orthodox Jews and the National/Reformed Jews, but really they're both still Pharisaical. Besides maybe the Karaites, there might had not been any fully anti Rabbinical Judaism these days, but even the Karaites (Torah believing non Orthodox \"Jews\"[yes I'm implying there can be Rabbinical Jews that are also Torah believing traditional, Anti Reformist Jews that are against Reformed Judaism/Zionism]) in some forms push Zionism. I repeat, even the Karaites in some forms push Zionism since just because they're Torah believing Jews doesn't mean they are also always Anti Reformist Jews, so all in all, a kike is a kike. Kike is another word for circle because they used a circle as their symbol of their faith on the immigration forms in USA. They hate anything that looks like a cross so t, T, + doesn't have the bottom part in Israel.\n\nCognitive Dissonance and Identity Politics, that's what keeps Jews of any sect together from the biggest lie that they are Judahites despite the many fractures and schisms within their own. Because they hold onto their falsely concocted identity through blood when the covenant by blood continues only through Jesus Christ and not of the blood of the Judahites which there are no longer on the face of the earth, non believing Judahites and thus by default, all Jews are not God's people by blood because they are not by faith, and even if they are Christians, they're still not Judahites, they're still gentiles of an evil tribe where their political scheme are guised as their faith and blood, of the descendants of Canaan, Phoenicia, Dan, so on and so forth. The tribe of Dan became the Spartans and merged with the Greeks and their symbol was changed from an Eagle to a Serpent which the Sanhedrin worships Satan as the Serpent of the Tree of Knowledge (Kabbalah) behind closed doors. You cannot marry Judahite with Rabbinical Judaism as the word: \"Jew\" or else we be blaspheming when we say Jesus was a Jew. Judas (Greek for Yehudah) hanged himself after selling Jesus Christ out for thirty silver shekels. That was also symbolic of how the Judahites and the proselyte Jews (ALL JEWS ARE PROSELYTE RABBINICAL JUDAISTS THAT JUDAIZE EVERYTHING WITH RABBINICAL PRINCIPLES) will die for their sins of their betrayal, and a sign of the things that were to happen in the time of Jacob's trouble as God made Jerusalem DESOLATE as some non believing Judahite families murdered their children and themselves before the Romans came in. The Messianic Movement is another attempt to reimplement their power over Protestants by coming in as wolves in sheep's clothing, the clothing being a believer in Christ of some of the principles that Christianity teaches, but in doing so, reject the WHOLE GOSPEL MESSAGE. REPENT YOU VILE SERPENT TRIBE, YOU WHORE OF BABYLON, YOU JEZEBEL, SYNAGOGUE OF SATAN, YOU WORSHIPERS OF MAMMON!\n\nI'm a seventh day \"preferred\" Christian man that eats non kosher food, doesn't worship national, pagan, and Christianized pagan holidays, speaks English, believes that the written word of God in its original language was written in Hebrew and Greek but not Aramaic, understands that \"Yah\" to one is another name for a Hermaphodite Moon Goddess while to some, \"Yah\" is the name of God, doesn't push new pronunciations over the old pronunciations of a revitalized dead language with different verbal pronunciations that never properly passed down in generation to generation so had given up on trying to know the pronunciation of the name of God yet accepts the fact that the name of God is not a mere title, understands basic etymology behind so called blasphemous pagan names well enough to know that most of the Messianics' claims are based on pseudoscience or skeptical scholars seeking to undermind Christianity by claiming to have the authority to defining Christology through any excuse non Christian, Atheistic and/or Jewish and/or Pagan Academia pushes, doesn't push cultural Jewish interpretations of the bible when they are clearly wrong, had gone above the mindset of worshiping God on a specific date per week, is not bound to a church/kuriakos, seeks a community/ecclesia not bound to the false mindset of a single pastor being the lord of his servants through their submission of their power to them but instead, in place of that corrupt system, accepts that everyone in Christ Jesus is called to be of the Royal Priesthood therefore, in a community, everyone can be ministers but be ministers of a few elders that in turn are ministers of them and other elders that are also ministers and so on, continuing the role of the minister to be with the elders in the ecclesia to be perpetuated through everyone to be both minister and elder forevermore through this method. In other words, I am aware of their lies and any new tricks of theirs will fall flat in careful inspection.\n\nüí´<strong>The Chinese Jews Apr 22, 2016 @ 15:14</strong>\n\nWhy aren't Chinese people considered trustworthy in comparison to their North East Asian counterparts? Is it merely socio-economic, is it because of Communism, is it because of the Revolutionaries, is it because of the Jesuits, is it because the western media brainwashing us thinking that all Chinese people are untrustworthy to hate China and Russia as the new enemy for future wars? I have a different theory and no it doesn't have much to do with the Jews per se. It is however, important to understand some parts of Chinese history.\n\nThe ancient Chinese characters are encoded with esoteric principles of the Chrisitan faith even before Christianity existed, and no, the Nesotarians, neither the Jesuits has anything to do with it. The Chinese are really the people of Shem, and concerning how God does whatever he likes, he had somehow sneaked in biblical (both Old and New Testament) symbols in certain words. They had also had remembered what to do to worship God from remembering Abel to Noah but not continuing to follow the cult of Nimrod completely.

Some of the Jews as the Hakka had come to China around 1,000 B.C. or around 3000 years back. <a href=\"http://henrymakow.com/2015/11/hakkas-the-jews-of-asia.html\" target=\"_blank\">Are Hakkas Literally the \"Jews of China\" ?</a> It's very likely to be so, but it doesn't end there. This can explain some rituals that weren't explicitly stated being practiced by Noah and before Noah that was done by Moses' Israel like the border sacrifice ritual. Here's some quotes from that article:<blockquote>The Hakkas also played an important role in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP, ÂÖ±‰∫ßÂÖö, Gongchandang), who defeated the Nationalists during the Civil War in 1949 (ÂõΩÂÖ±ÂÜÖÊàò, guogong neizhan). Mao Zedong took over with the heavy backing of the peasantry, and enthusiastic Hakka support. Three of the 12 founding members of the CCP were Hakka (considering that Hakkas were about 3% of the total population). The Hakkas were three times as likely to occupy high government and party positions than other Han Chinese. Six of the 9 Communist bases in southeast China were in Hakka counties. The Communists were also able to take advantage of the Hakka women, acting as reconnaissance agents and guerrilla fighters.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>‚ÄúA Jesuit missionary, going upon some occasion into the province of Honan, found a considerable Synagogue in the city of Kaifengfu. He soon became acquainted with some of its learned chiefs, who introduced him into their Synagogue and showed him one of the Parchments or rolls of the Pentateuch written in Hebrew, together with the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, some of the prophets, and others containing their liturgy and commentaries they owned. They had lost some of the sacred books and some of their targums or paraphrases. This loss was caused by a violent overflowing of the great river, which had laid the capital wholly under the water and had damaged their Torah, or roll of the Pentateuch, and upon which they ordered twelve new copies to be taken from it‚Ä¶..\n\nMy elder brother ‚Äî I am not yet forty years old, but I have thought and talked much with my friends about our ancestors, who were rich and numerous and who worshiped in a fine synagogue, built on the land presented to them bv the Emperor Tai-tsti. This synagogue, you know, has been swept away by ‚ÄòChina‚Äôs Sorrow‚Äô [the Yellow River]. Our ancestors came to this land from the northwest nearly three thousand years ago‚Ä¶.‚Äù</blockquote>\n\nThe Hakkas weren't the only \"Jews\" around. Enter the TKK: <a href=\"http://henrymakow.com/2016/04/are-the-tiao-kiu-kao-jews.html\" target=\"_blank\">Are the \"Tiao-Kiu-Kao\"(TKK) Jews Running China?</a> They came in around 1800 years ago. Here's some quotes from that article:<blockquote>Jews entered China already during the Han dynasty about 1800 years ago and then spread everywhere. The mixed Chinese Jews belonging to the ultra-secret sect practicing black magic are called \"Tiao-Kiu-Kiaou\" Jews. (This roughly means \"those who remove their tendon\" during ritual slaughter.) It is believed that these jews exerted a great political influence in China since ancient times. Since many Jews were busy with international trade they could maintain an international network of rich and influential people across the world, something very useful if you have global ambitions. \n\nTo get a picture of the hidden historic process of the Chinese Jews we note that in the 13th century book \"Travels of Marco Polo\": \"Some accidental observations...show that jews were sufficient enough to be able to exert political influence in China and Tartary\". \n\nThe Chinese jews usually converted to Confucianism or Buddhism over time but they worshipped satanic Kabbalah in secret and they passed on their secrets to their sons when they were 13-years-old. Every Friday they held ceremonies in their local secret fraternity to update the progress of their schemes to take over political, religious, military or commercial power from the gentiles or \"goyim\" as these people refer to \"non-jews\". \n\nJews were expelled from China already in A.D. 845 during the Tang dynasty, indicating that they were scheming already as elsewhere across the globe.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Since the beginning of the Opium trade in 1831, Jews like David Sassoon cooperated exclusively with Jews (ie the Kaifeng jews) inside China to destroy the strength of China and its divinely inspired 5000 year old culture. One such example is the destruction of the Summer Palace, called \"Yuanmingyuan - Garden of Perfect Brightness\" outside Beijing in 1860. It was considered the prime cultural treasure of China, its size being five times bigger than the \"forbidden city\" in Beijing. The destruction of Chinese culture by the Jews is now replicated by cultural Marxism destroying the Western culture. \n\nWe know from the history books that many western jews such as Sidney Rittenberg, Sidney Shapiro and Israel Epstein \"advised\" the CCP when it took power in 1949. Today it¬¥s obvious that the whole creation of the CCP was the final step towards creating a \"Jewish World Dynasty\" with all other countries following CCP¬¥s orders.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>It is no secret to insiders that since several hundred years the Jesuits, the Nazis, the Russian communists, the CIA and the Secret Societies have been interested in occult practices from Tibet and Dalai Lama is received as a King by religious leaders and heads of State throughout the world. \n\nTHE ROOT OF MARXISM AND TIBET\n\nThe German General Ludendorff said it clearly in the 1930s: \"The Tibetan Lamas has emplaced themselves at the head of Jewish and Jesuit secret orders\" (Europa den Asiatenpriestern? [Europe belongs to the Asian priests)], 1941).\n\nTheodor Illion expressed in his book \"In Secret Tibet\" from 1937: \"the lamas...are more dangerous than all their cold and hot hells put together\".\n\nWe also note that Dalai Lama spent almost a year in 1954 with his good friend Mao Zedong before going to India in 1956-1957 to meet their government. After returning to Tibet, he escaped to India again while his home country was invaded by the CCP. Does this sound like a real \"God-King\" standing up for his own people? What was he plotting in Beijing and New Delhi for such a long time?...</blockquote>\n\nWikipedia talks about the Kaifeng Jews a bit to be either been in China sometime before 108 B.C. (assuming Tiberiu Weisz wasn't lying) and temporarily kicked out later sometime in 845-6 A.D. with the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution while some went underground, calling anyone of the Abrahamic faiths \"Hui Hui\" so that includes Rabbinical Judaism or as I prefer to call the Jews: Judaists (see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-two-biggest-lies-concerning-the-jews-and-other-myths/\" target=\"_blank\">The two biggest lies concerning the \"Jews\" and other myths</a> ). The Venetian Marco Polo also noted how there were Jewish merchant traders having a prominent presense in Beijing. Into the 19th and 20th century, even more Jews came in, meddling into politics and like the Bolsheviks, some of the Chinese Jews had hidden their Jewry, \"Crypto-Jew\" when their masters being largely Ashkenazi Jews helped them to install Communism.\n\nXi Jinping and as well as Vladimir Putin had kicked out commies out of their political influence though in comparison to Putin, Jinping is as stupid as they can be in allowing Microsoft to make a Chinese government approved version of Windows 10 OS and devices and which also means the reintroduction of Intel microprocessors. Xi Jinping's New Silk Road and the desire to have dialogue to the NVE (New Venetian Empire) to have a multipolar world power structure between the New International Economic Order (BRICS system backed by gold) and the \"New World Order\", seeking the liberty of Palestine from complete destruction by the fake Judeans, against the illegal State of Israel, trying to keep the US far from China in causing WWIII, he's being portrayed as a modern Hitler the same way Putin is. Comparing the infrastructure and scientific advancements of both Russia and China to the likes of the US, UK, France, Israel, etc., the NVE loses plain and simple. Within the world of money, the Renminbi (RMB) is replacing the Petroldollar (USD). Gas prices being lower than it should be these days in the US means the USD is getting weaker, not stronger as stupid people conclude. Negative Interest Rate Policies means positive for gold. Investing in the stocks of Russian and Chinese companies are the only worthwhile stocks investing in, period. We are on the edge of what is a hyperbolic decline unless Russia and China decides to put an end to the war games of the bankrupt City of London/New Jerusalem/New Venice by indefinitely popping the western bubble through means outside of the broken system as nations like the US slowly degenerate into third world status infrastructure, not just in its politics.\n\nEven though the world are full of deceivers, I theorize in a more religious and somewhat scientific aspect, that the spiritual demonic thrones governing the Chinese race and by extent, Japanese and Koreans as a whole (people of Han) deals with introversion and deception, respectively, because of their generally higher IQ, but the Chinese have more \"Jew\" in their culture, hence, the complete disregard of others as humans but rather as animals through Communist (Jewish) brainwash along with a lack of education and ethics being taught in most of China's poorer prefectures. If Apostle Paul confirmed generalizations of a group of people (the Cretans), then Christians shouldn't be afraid to make generalizations of other groups of people, and no matter how you make it sound appropriate by claiming there's demonic thrones over nations that might justify genetic behavior of the flesh or saying how God made all the races differently and wanted people to live apart from each other, if you're talking to an imbicile, they won't understand no matter what. Hong Kong Chinese people are very \"modernized\" and intellectual people that hate their commie relatives with passion, but unfortunately, they are susecptible to western propaganda in some aspects. The Great Firewall of China can be circumvented with Shadowsocks and FreeBrowser apps avaiable on Google Play for Android devices, and there are other ways like maybe the Opera web browser that now includes a free VPN built into it. Urban cities in China like Beijing are slowly being improved of its infrastructure, making the US subway and metro systems look like uncultured garbage.\n\nIf anything, the current Chinese government is ascending to a new paradigm as envisioned by Lyndon LaRouche, yet the controlled alternative media mocks him strongly. Modern Christian truthers have a very narrow mindset concerning the BRICS and current events. People much older than me believe in outdated lies about Russia and China. I am not saying there aren't any persecution of sorts happening in those places since they don't like unregistered religious communities, but viewing these things from the stance of a victim is to ignore everything else about the whole picture.\n\nüí´<strong>Predicting Events and Astrology Apr 27, 2016 @ 04:40</strong>\n\nIt's so easy to judge an article by its title, but is it predictive to assume what this article is really about, or is it postdiction because I've already spoiled the general theme of this article? Read on and you'll see.\n\nThe way humans rationalize prediction is through looking at the hard data and make generalizations in which some of those generalizations becoming a reality, statistically speaking. The type of events that goes on that interests truthers is generally occultic in its nature but some of these events are not based upon esoteric knowledge but simple geopolitical knowledge like the reason Kamchatka being attacked by swine flu from nearby US labs and strong earthquakes from tectonic weaponry like HAARP (but not necessarily utilizing HAARP) could be from external sources from New Venice in multiple attempts to destroy its Russian military presence both by sea with a nuclear submarine base and air with Russian air defense systems, or like knowing that North Korea has huge deposits of Tungsten that Russia and China would use to fuel its tech and space exploration + mining while New Venice's puppet nations would use that to sustain their endless wars in weaponry. Many geopolitical false flags are less predictable in pinning a specific date, but some of these events are very predictable if you know of specific events that would provoke the elites if the people have things their way like the takedown of MH17 not too long after the BRICS summit meeting started to make Vladimir Putin look bad which he is the true head of the BRICS.\n\nThese people are not to be seen as people but soulless opprotunistic psychopaths that works in multiple aspects in any major historical event pushing a primary agenda as they try to jam in multiple secondary agendas through the controlled mainstream and alternative media. To get a good grip of a general list of agendas see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-unhived-mind-iii-category-description-list/\" target=\"_blank\">The Unhived Mind III Category Description List</a> and be up to date with current events, preferably filtered through semi controlled and uncontrolled alternative media websites but if your BS filter is very thick, you could look at mainstream media for the evil as it really is, though beware, being lied to constantly could potentially destroy your God given willpower to resist evil. There's some examples of pushing secondary agendas with the MH17 takedown that is to destroy Malaysia's economy for claiming the unbiblical State of Israel (formed through the alliance of British (New Venice) Zionists and Nazi Germany) guilty for war crimes, and the takedown of MH370 being used by Australia to come up with the lie that a hundred HIV/AIDS scientists died from it when they had later changed that number to just six, as if they're implying that Putin is hindering science pursuiting a cure for HIV/AIDS when in reality, HIV/AIDS is not real. This is the whole \"kill two birds with one stone\" opprotunistic side of their plans. For more concerning what happened almost two years ago with those planes, see: <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/UHM/new-venice-zionists-shoot-down-malaysian-airlines-mh17-to-ignite-confrontation-with-brics-head-russia/\" target=\"_blank\">NEW VENICE ZIONISTS SHOOT DOWN MALAYSIAN AIRLINES MH17 TO IGNITE CONFRONTATION WITH BRICS HEAD RUSSIA</a>.\n\nSince they are opprotunistic, they can change plans if they like to. In a more recent example that has yet to play out in its entirety, the whole Zika issue (which is a huge farce, see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/zika-virus-ebola-autism-hivaids-polio-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">Zika Virus, Ebola, Autism, HIV/AIDS, Polio, and more!</a>) in theoretical \"Plan A\" is to have the Olympics hosted in London this year, but since that seems unlikely, \"Plan B\" is to let people go to Brazil and go back to their homes then immediately push a whole global epidemic lie of a nonexistent link of the Zika Virus causing Microcephaly in a massive forced vaccination attack on everyone while those who resist taking the vaccines would be taken elsewhere to take the vaccine that isn't the kosher variety that has no human DNA and tissue which means those that opt in for the kosher vaccination will not get de novo mutations in their body and if that occurs in the brain, it makes permanent autism that can't ever be detoxed, ever, while your immune system is reprogrammed to attack your own body.\n\nI've somewhat talked about patterns here: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/synchronicity-and-the-ad-hoc-hypothesis/\" target=\"_blank\">Synchronicity and the Ad hoc hypothesis</a> but I didn't get into when certain predictions are not completely baseless, and I'm not actually against people making predictions, just unfounded ones based on nothing which the whole CERN theory is based on simply because Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity, they're all make believe nonsense that Mathematicians made up to deceive real Physicists and real Electricians that are closer to the truth as to the nature of counterspace/aether and its lower forms as dielectricity, electricity, and magnetism, which incoherent magnetism is called gravity while coherent magnetism is what we think of magnetism. These fraudulent scientists can't define what is a field because they forcefully quantify (quanta, atomism, materialism) what has no quantity, while they insist space has a property when space is inert, it has no properties whatsoever. Ken Wheeler covers this quite well, but most people are simply blockheads that can't grasp this and it's because people in general are very stupid, see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXuINSLqQAg\" target=\"_blank\">Inertia &amp; MAGNETISM: The Conjugate Principles of Force &amp; Motion / Inertia &amp; Acceleration</a>. Anyways, what I am about to get into deals more with observation of how the world seems to tick that seems heretical to many.\n\nTaken from <a href=\"http://www.healingcancernaturally.com/moon-zodiac-transit-surgery.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.healingcancernaturally.com/moon-zodiac-transit-surgery.html</a>: <blockquote>On the moon‚Äôs transit through the zodiac signs and the best times for surgery and taking medications\n\nPure superstition or force to be reckoned with?\n\nhttp://www.healingcancernaturally.com/moon-zodiac-transit-surgery.html\n\nSimilarly to the moon calendars indicating optimum and worst periods for planting and harvesting seeds and crops which hail back to ancient times and are owed to the astute nature observation of our forefathers, there also is a ‚Äúcalendar‚Äù based on similar principles regarding the best and worst periods for having any type of operation.\n\nThe following information on most advisable times for undergoing surgery is predominantly based on German physician Dr. Rudolf Sklenar‚Äôs book Astro-Medizin als Lebenshilfe (roughly: Help From Astro-Medicine)[1]ff. Dr. Sklenar, besides having found and used a successful treatment for cancer (see Successful cancer treatment with Kombucha and coli preparations according to Dr. Rudolf Sklenar), also was a student of astrology.[2]\n\nTo underlign the potentially important role of celestial influences in health and disease and particularly surgery, Dr. Sklenar quotes a case related by famed physician and astrologer Alfred John Pearce (1840 ‚Äì 1923) in his two-volume work Textbook of Astrology (first published in 1911 and republished to this day):\n\nA woman had ovary surgery done by a skilled surgeon when the moon was in Scorpio and moving towards conjunction with Saturn. The patient died the following day.\n\nAs Dr. Sklenar comments, ‚ÄúBetter wait and be called superstitious than kill.‚Äù\n\nSklenar further quotes Pearce as saying, ‚ÄúWith surgery it is advisable, if possible, to await a favourable time and not jeopardize the patient and increase his suffering by operating when the moon is within 17 degrees of the sun, which Cardan calls an ill-fated configuration.‚Äù\n\nPtolemy (c. AD 90 ‚Äì c. AD 168), the Greco-Roman writer, mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet wrote, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt treat with iron (the knife) that part of the body ruled by the sign the moon is transitting‚Äù (meaning for instance that when the moon is in Taurus, one should not operate on the neck or larynx ‚Äì even less so, when Mars is in an unfavourable aspect with the transiting Moon.\n\nDr. Max Kemmerich reported that a number of German physicians tested the above injunction not to ‚Äútouch with iron that part of the body ruled by the sign the Moon is passing through‚Äù. They found indeed that operations showed better results and postoperative bleeding in particular was virtually eliminated.\n\n(Considering that the moon causes the movement of the tides of every body of water on earth and that the human body is largely made of water, one can intuitively see how if indeed individual organs have an intimate energetic connection to various constellations [signs], the moon‚Äôs passing through those signs could influence how the water in those organs will behave [and blood of course is mostly water], as well as other things.)\n\nThat said, Sklenar like others has pointed out that the higher a person‚Äôs ethical and moral development, the less he or she will be subject to astral influences.\n\nSurgery and the stars: each body part ‚Äúruled‚Äù by a sign of the zodiac\n\nEvery part of the body is assumed to be associated with a specific sign, and the sequence from head to toe follows the exact same sequence as the zodiac, i.e. starting with Aries the individual signs move from top to bottom, meaning that Aries ‚Äúrules‚Äù the head region and Pisces the feet region, with the other signs sequentially ruling the areas in-between.\n\nAccording to Dr. Sklenar‚Äôs research, the different parts of the body are ruled as follows (whereby each sign also influences its opposite sign in the zodiac).\n\nARIES corresponds to the head including the face (with one exception: the bony part of the nose is ruled by Scorpio).\n\nTAURUS corresponds to the throat and beginning of neck, palate, larynx, tonsils, occiput (back of the head), and cerebellum.\n\nGEMINI: shoulders, arms, hands, lungs, thymus, upper ribs\n\nCANCER: thorax, abdomen, stomach, diaphragm, lower lung lobes, aorta, upper lobe of liver, breast and mammary gland\n\nLEO: back, spine, heart\n\nVIRGO: belly and umbilical region, intestines, lower liver lobes, pancreas, spleen\n\nLIBRA: loins, inguinal region (groin), kidneys, vascular nerve system of the skin\n\nSCORPIO: genitalia, sexual organs, bladder, urethra, rectum and descending colon, flexor, prostate, osseous part of the nose\n\nSAGITTARIUS: hips, upper half of lower extremities, femur (thighbone), ilium, arteries, veins, sciatic nerve\n\nCAPRICORN: rules the knees, skin (and by reflex; the stomach which is ruled by its opposite sign, Cancer) . (Note that another source additionally relates the teeth to Capricorn.)\n\nAQUARIUS: lower leg, lower half of lower extremities, ankles\n\nPISCES: rules the feet, toes (and by reflex the abdominal region via Virgo).\n\nSurgery and the moon‚Äôs transiting through the twelve constellations (Zodiac signs)\n\nThe moon takes some 2-3 days to pass through each sign. Regarding surgery, according to Dr. Sklenar it is advised to abstain whilst the moon transits through each constellation as follows.\n\nMOON IN ARIES: do not operate on the head, eyes, brain and cerebellum, avoid tooth extractions [this should extend to any strongly invasive oral/jaw surgery];\n\nMOON IN TAURUS: avoid all neck and throat surgery incl. tonsils, vocal chords, thyroid gland, parotid gland, cerebellum;\n\nMOON IN GEMINI: avoid amputations of arm or hand, surgery of the lung and trachea, pleura and lung membrane, anesthesia via ether inhalation (ether anaesthetics);\n\nMOON IN CANCER: don‚Äôt operate for diseases of the digestive organs, don‚Äôt open the thorax (rib cage);\n\nMOON IN LEO: avoid surgery on the spinal cord (medulla), heart, pericardium, cardia, muscles of the back, as well as anesthesia via Chloroform vapor;\n\nMOON IN VIRGO: don‚Äôt have surgery on the abdomen/viscera;\n\nMOON IN LIBRA: avoid kidney surgery;\n\nMOON IN SCORPIO: avoid hernia and appendix surgery, cutting buboes, generally avoid cutting in the inguinal region (groin), urinary and sexual organs, hemorrhoid surgery;\n\nMOON IN SAGITTARIUS: don‚Äôt open the hip area, no surgery on femural hernia, no leg amputation. Mars should not be within the sun‚Äôs orbit.*\n\nMOON IN CAPRICORN: shun surgery on knees, shins, skin;\n\nMOON IN AQUARIUS: don‚Äôt have surgery on the calves, varicose veins, eyes;\n\nMOON IN PISCES: avoid surgery of feet, abdomen, lungs.\n\nOn the importance of other astrological influences\n\nIn reference to the possible impact of additional astrological influences, Dr. Sklenar points out that the power of the moon with its continually changing aspects is of overriding importance, i.e. more essential than any other influence, so that generally speaking one can neglect those with impunity.\n\nThis would render very complex guidelines regarding the best or worst imes for undergoing surgery offered by authorities such as Eileen Naumann in her book Medical Astrology mostly superfluous. Some of Nauman‚Äôs simpler advice (not requiring the assistance of an expert astrologer) includes things such as\n\nFive days before and after the New Moon bodily fluids are at their lowest ebb which reduces the possibility of swelling.\n\nFive days before and after the Full Moon fluids are at their highest which can translate into major swelling and hemorrhaging.\n\nDon‚Äôt undergo surgery when the Moon is void (complications are likely, surgery might be botched up requiring repeat surgery).\n\nShun surgery when the transiting moon is in a mutable sign (i. e. in Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces) and plan it instead when the moon passes through a fixed sign (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius), the latter apparently enabling better results without further complications.\n\nDon‚Äôt have surgical procedures when Mercury or Mars is retrograde. Mercury retrograde (three times yearly for a number of weeks) is well-known for increased frequency of communication problems (misunderstandings) and generally not considered the optimal time to undertake anything new. Mars is considered the planet of surgeons, so when it goes retrograde (a rarer occasion occurring only once every two years and lasting for about ten weeks), surgeons apparently are not at their best. Additionally, Mars retrograde is associated with possibly heavy loss of blood.\n* (Sonnenorbis in German, possibly mistranslated)\n\nMedications and the stars: some pointers by Dr. Sklenar\n\nWhen the moon is in Aries or Capricorn, medications are said to be nauseating.\n\nAvoid taking medications when the moon is in a fixed sign (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius). (The same might apply to supplements.)\n\nPurging or taking medications is best done when the moon is in Cancer or Pisces.\nA note re surgery\n\nHealing Cancer Naturally considers surgery a last option to be resorted to only when other non-invasive and non-toxic avenues of healing (compare Treatment) have been exhausted, are inaccessible, or when there is a life-threatening situation (such as a tumor impinging upon and about to cut off a vital organ such as parts of the brain, the esophagus etc.).\n\nSome concluding advice\n\nWhatever you decide to do, I highly recommend including a request for a most benevolent outcome.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1 This book featuring Dr. Sklenar‚Äôs astromedical work (published by the Austrian ARCTURUS-Verlag) reunites in fact the essence of the work of several medical astrology capacities, including SURYA (Demeter Georgiewitz-Weitzer [1873‚Äì1949]) and SINDBAD (Friedrich Schwickert [1855‚Äì1930], a widely known expert for astrology and hermetic arts) who together authored the older book Astrologie und Medizin. Astro-Medizin als Lebenshilfe includes a chapter discussing the medical astrology of Paracelsus and a contribution by US-American naturopath Nancy Coker. The entire book was thoroughly revised by yet another apparent luminary in the field, Prof. Frank Hofmann. Astro-Medizin als Lebenshilfe is described as furnishing an overall presentation giving equal weight to the astrological and medical aspects of the matter and best meeting the requirements of modern times.\n\n2 Dr. Sklenar very successfully applied astrological considerations in his medical practice for more than thirty years so his written work was based in practical experience rather than theory alone.

Examples of these trends include deficit spending, exponential debt increases, overpriced bond markets, and unbacked paper currencies, to name a few. In an effort to bring clarity in how and when these trends could change direction we analyzed more than 20 different cycles. They almost unanimously point to tectonic shifts in the months and years ahead ‚Ä¶ starting now. We have been warned.\n\nAt this point, we have enough confirmation to accept that the gold and silver crash ‚Äì starting in April of 2013 ‚Äì was the first shot across the board of what is to come.\n\nFinancial crashes and economic collapses are not inevitable, but they seem more likely in the next few years, starting later this summer. Preparation might appear to be a waste of time and resources, but lack of preparation could result in the loss of wealth, incomes, jobs, and lives. Perhaps our leaders will guide the world economies through some upcoming hard times, but they might also aggravate those hard times by following policies that benefit the political and financial elite at the expense of the middle class and the poorer classes. Look at current trends in government and banking, and decide for yourself!\n\nThe next few years are likely to be quite problematic for most of the world‚Äôs population, particularly the poor. People who have the majority of their assets in stocks, bonds and paper debt may also be hurt as the currencies are inflated and purchasing power declines sharply.\n\nWe have presented a summary of cycles for stocks and bonds, war, gold and silver. We show the source of the cyclic information, the relevant timing, and some commentary.\n\nStocks &amp; Bonds\n\nCharles Nenner Research (source)\n\nStocks should peak in mid-2013 and fall until about 2020. Similarly, bonds should peak in the summer of 2013 and fall thereafter for 20 years. He bases his conclusions entirely on cycle research. He expects the Dow to fall to around 5,000 by 2018 ‚Äì 2020.\n\nKress Cycles by Clif Droke (source)\n\nThe major 120 year cycle plus all minor cycles trend down into late 2014. The stock market should decline hard into late 2014.\n\nElliott Wave Cycles by Robert Prechter (source)\n\nHe believes that the stock market has peaked and has entered a generational bear-market. He anticipates a crash low in the market around 2016 ‚Äì 2017.\n\nMarket Energy Wave (source)\n\nHe sees a 36 year cycle in stock markets that is peaking in mid-2013 and down 2013 ‚Äì 2016. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the controlling energy wave is scheduled to flip back to negative on July 19 of this year.‚Äù Equity markets should drop 25 ‚Äì 50%.\n\nArmstrong Economics (source)\n\nHis economic confidence model projects a peak in confidence in August 2013, a bottom in September 2014, and another peak in October 2015. The decline into January 2020 should be severe. He expects a world-wide crash and contraction in economies from 2015 ‚Äì 2020.\n\nCycles per Charles Hugh Smith (source)\n\nHe discusses four long-term cycles that bottom roughly in the 2010 ‚Äì 2020 period. They are: Credit expansion/contraction cycle; Price inflation/wage cycle; Generational cycle; and Peak oil extraction cycle.\n\nHarry Dent ‚Äì Demographics (source)\n\nStock prices should drop, on average for the balance of this decade. Demographic cycles in the United States (and elsewhere) indicate a contraction in real terms for most of this decade.\n\nSun Spot Cycles\n\nThey are due to peak in the summer of 2013 and decline into 2019. Market tops often occur at or near peaks in sun spots. This is an approximate 10 ‚Äì 13 year cycle. Economic and political upheavals tend to occur at or near the peak of sun spot cycles.\n\nLucky 13\n\n1987, 2000, and 2013 marked stock market highs, all 13 years apart.\n\nWar Cycles\n\nLarry Edelson (source)\n\nHis research shows that the world-wide tendency to fight major wars rises and falls over time. He currently projects a peak about 2020 with rising war fever from 2013 until 2020. There is no shortage of possible war zones. As conditions worsen during the balance of this decade, nations will be inclined to distract and control their populace via wars and increased government control and management of the economy.\n\nLong term war cycles\n\n1780, 1860, 1940, 2020? About every 80 years there has been a major war involving the United States.\n\nGold &amp; Silver\n\nAmanita inflation markets model\n\nHe expects a major gold low in 2014/15, and a super bull market running into 2020. He is one of the top timers in the world according to ‚ÄúTimer Digest‚Äù.\n\nAlf Field (source)\n\nHe uses Elliott Wave theory to analyze gold. His first major target for gold is $4500, for Intermediate wave III of MAJOR THREE. Wave IV will be a correction and wave V will take gold much higher thereafter.\n\nCharles Nenner Research\n\nHe expects gold to bottom about now and rally substantially from here. He called the top in gold two years ago. He called for a bottom about now in the $1300s. He expects a large rally that extends several years.\n\nLarry Edelson\n\nHe projects a low for gold in June 2013 followed by a substantial rally until about 2020, possibly to $10,000.\n\nArmstrong Economics\n\nGold is likely to be weak until after October 2015, and then move strongly higher into January 2020. Gold will rise primarily due to the collapse of paper currencies in the period from 2015 ‚Äì 2020.\n\nOther Cycles\n\nComet ISON\n\nThis comet will be visible in October and November 2013 ‚Äì it is expected to be the brightest comet in years, perhaps many decades. Highly visible comets often indicate sudden changes in leadership, political systems, and financial systems. Possible changes are the failure or redesign of the Euro, a dollar crash, assassination of a major leader, impeachment, derivative implosion, martial law, international war, and a major economic default.\n\nJR Nyquist on global cooling and food production (source)\n\nHe discusses long-term solar output cycles. He anticipates that an approximately 200 year cycle in solar output will reduce average temperatures, available water, and crop yields. He expects higher food prices and famine during the next decade. The last cold cycle low was around the time Napoleon marched into Russia.\n\n100 year anniversaries\n\n1913 was an important year. It marked the beginning of the Federal Reserve and the income tax in the US. 2013 has already shown that essentially all digital communications and internet activity are tracked and recorded by the government. It has also marked the authorization for military control and martial law in the United States. Further, bank account and brokerage confiscations (bail-ins) have already occurred and more ‚Äúbail-ins‚Äù are likely. 2013 could mark the beginning of what might evolve into WWIII ‚Äì starting in the Middle East.\n\nFinancial Astrology Cycles\n\nAmanita (Astrological cycles) (source)\n\nHe expects a peak for stocks, bonds, gold, and silver in July or August 2013. Thereafter, those markets should decline, and equities and bonds could crash. Gold and silver should rally into 2020. He anticipates a very difficult time world-wide until 2023. This could include market crashes, financial meltdowns, economic collapse, world war, and increasing government control over the populace.\n\nFurthermore, the timeline between 2016 and 2020 is the most likely period for a derivative implosion.\n\nBradley Model\n\nStock markets peak in early June 2013, bottom in late 2014, late 2017, and 2020. This model anticipates a stock market decline into 2020 from a peak in June 2013.\n\nCrawford: Mars-Uranus Crash Cycle\n\nHe sees a crash window from late 2013 ‚Äì through early 2015. This model anticipates a stock market decline into 2020 from a peak in June 2013.\n\nTarasov model\n\nThe model sees a peak in 2011, bottom in late 2014 and lower low in 2020. It indicates weakening economies and declining global liquidity into late 2014, a short bounce and then further decline into 2020.\n\nAmanita long term equities model\n\nHe expects a high in spring of 2013 and a low in early 2015. This indicates nearly two years of weakening stock markets, world-wide.\n\nSaturn-Neptune hard aspects\n\nPeriod: Late 2015 ‚Äì late 2016. These hard aspects correlate with the bursting of major bubbles. Our best guess for late 2015 would be the bursting of the fiat currency, bond, or derivative bubbles.\n\nGlobal food supplies, as discussed by Amanita\n\nPeriod: 2014 ‚Äì 2034. Global temperatures are likely to decline, substantially lowering crop yields and causing massive starvation. Rebellions, riots, and chaos often begin with food shortages.\n\nSummary\n\nThere are many cycles that suggest a stock market correction or crash is near. That correction/crash will probably be accompanied by a correction in the bond market that reverses much of the bullish action of the past 30 years. (Signs of a bond bear market are already visible.) Gold and silver should rally substantially as their cycles are turning up while money flees the stock and bond markets and attempts to find safety in an increasingly dangerous world. Financially and socially, many cycles have turned downward, and many will not bottom until later in this decade. Much can go badly wrong during the next seven years. Now is NOT the time for complacency or procrastination.\n\nAlong with the decline in equities, bonds, and the value of paper money will come ‚Äì probably ‚Äì more social unrest, considerably higher consumer prices for food and energy, bankrupt local, state and national governments, more debt defaults, higher unemployment, possible monetary and/or economic collapse, and a likely escalation in regional and global wars.\n\nA gradual cooling (NOT warming) will reduce crop yields and drive already high food prices much higher. The world‚Äôs poor will suffer. Hungry people are inclined to rebel and threaten world governments. Hence governments will become more repressive and will increase their information gathering on all those viewed as potentially threatening to the status quo.\n\nPaul B. Farrell of Market Watch sees ‚ÄúDoomsday poll: 87% risk of stock crash by year-end. The link is here.\n\nAlf Field wrote this in 2011 regarding what is needed to fix our monetary system: The Brutal Truths:\n\nThe slate needs to be wiped clean and a new sound monetary system introduced.\nThat will require the elimination of all debt, deficits, unfunded social entitlements, the US Dollar as Reserve currency, and the big one, the $600 trillion of derivatives.\nTo eliminate these problems by default and deflation will cause a banking collapse and untold economic pain, leading to riots and political change.\nPoliticians are appointed for relatively short terms and opt for the easy solutions.\nWhile politicians continue to have the ability to create new money at will, they will do so in order to prevent a melt down on their watch.\nConsequently the odds point to governments wiping the slate clean by generating enough new money to eventually destroy their currencies.\nThe new international monetary system is likely to involve precious metals. It will have to be money that people trust and that governments cannot create at will.\nPreparation is important.

The latter group suggests that astrology is essentially hogwash, reserved for those who are so desperate for guidance that they resort to such ‚Äúentertainment.‚Äù They don‚Äôt feel that whether one is a Leo or Capricorn should dictate a person‚Äôs actions, much less help someone gain insight about their health.\n\nHowever, according to a new Columbia University study, these hesitant folks might want to consider changing their mind. Using computer algorithms to asses a database of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/CUMC health records of more than 1.7 million patients from 1985 through 2013, it was found that a person‚Äôs birth month is actually related to the development of certain health conditions. Furthermore, this large-scale study was considered to more effectively reinforce what smaller studies before it had found in previous years: that there are correlations between birth season and certain health problems.\n\nBirth month research could ‚Äúuncover new disease risk factors‚Äù\n\nThe researchers in this latest study compared birth dates with medical histories, ultimately developing comprehensive data visual maps that outlined statistical information on the topic. ‚ÄúFaster computers and electronic health records are accelerating the pace of discovery,‚Äù said the study‚Äôs lead author, Mary Regina Boland, a graduate student at Columbia. ‚ÄúWe are working to help doctors solve important clinical problems using this new wealth of data.‚Äù\n\nNicholas Tatonetti, author of the study, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, supports her statement. ‚ÄúThis data could help scientists uncover new disease risk factors,‚Äù he says.\n\nThe article, titled ‚ÄúBirth Month Affects Lifetime Disease Risk: A Phenome-Wide Method,‚Äù notes that ‚ÄúPrior methods‚Ä¶suffer from disease selection bias whereby diseases of popular interest are studied more frequently potentially overlooking other important disease-birth month associations.‚Äù They explained that their method is vastly improved over those that were used in the past because it used a ‚Äúhypothesis-free method.‚Äù The article continues:\n\n[This study] confirms many known connections between birth month and disease including: reproductive performance, ADHD, asthma, colitis, eye conditions, otitis media (ear infection), and respiratory syncytial virus. We discovered 16 associations with birth month that have never been explicitly studied previously. Nine of these associations were related to cardiovascular conditions strengthening the link between cardiac conditions, early development, and Vitamin D.\n\nSpecific health conditions and the birth months associated with them\n\nSpecifically, it was found that people born in May had the lowest overall disease risk, while those born in October had the highest. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone born in October should live in fear. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important not to get overly nervous about these results because even though we found significant associations, the overall disease risk is not that great,‚Äù says Tatonetti. ‚ÄúThe risk related to birth month is relatively minor when compared to more influential variables like diet and exercise.‚Äù\n\nNevertheless, the study shows correlations between certain health problems and when a person is born. For example, they discovered that asthma risk is greatest for July and October babies. Data pertaining to ADHD found that approximately one in 675 occurrences could be linked to November births. As for atrial fibrillation, mitral valve disorder and congestive heart failure, the researchers noted that March births appeared to have the highest risks.\n\nAs Tatonetti noted, diet and exercise certainly play a role in overall health. Be sure to eat organic, fresh foods as often as possible and exercise on a daily basis. Doing so will help you stay healthy and keep your body in a better position to tackle any health issues that do arise.\n\nSources:\n(1) http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3117205/Your-birth-month-DOES-determine-ll-sick-Researchers-reveal-ailments-risk-from.html\n\n(2) http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150608111557.htm\n\n(3) http://jamia.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/06/01/jamia.ocv046</blockquote>\n\nTaken from <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/satanic-ritual-abuse-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\">http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/satanic-ritual-abuse-calendar/</a><blockquote>Satanic Ritual Abuse Calendar\n \nJAN 01ST \tNEW YEAR‚ÄôS DAY \tDRUID FEAST DAY\nJAN 07TH \tST.

Many survivors are also affected one to two weeks prior to the celebration of any major ritual as this is the time for preparation rituals leading up to a major event.</blockquote>\n\nAll those articles were shown here to show how relevant Astrology is. The 72 \"angels\" of the Shemhamphorasch have their own specific dates for specific rituals, see: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20151110020825/http://one-evil.org:80/content/entities_demons_72.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://one-evil.org/content/entities_demons_72.html</a>. Whenever there's major planetary conjunctions, certain false flags events are conducted. Any date ending with 11 or 22 are judgement dates relating to Jupiter and Saturn, the real two pillars that is presented with the \"peace\" sign that is the V of Nike, the ring of Saturn which is the true ruler of the celestial bodies. The Jesuits took the ancient star knowledge from Sumer and China and further increased and refined their magic system that borrows from the Zohar, Sir John Dee the Enochian, the Hashashins, even African witchdoctors, they just use everything they can get their hands on, but ultimately, they do that to better serve their Pharaonic-Samarian-Roman-Venetian-Genonese masters. One example of their use of such knowledge is Homeopathy that has hidden roots in Paracelsus' works that Samuel Hahnemann based off his research which Hahnemann probably gotten books concerning Alchemy from the Rosicrucians' library as a Freemason, but the problem is that it is the preferred method of medicine over TCM for the elites. The Rockefellers knowing the evil of petrolchemical medicine, probably done lots and lots of research and concluded that Homeopathy was the best for them. The House of Windsor being half German, half Genoese, zero percent British use the best Homeopathic doctor money can buy, a doctor who also studied about TCM for that matter. There are no incantations being made by those who use Homeopathy, rather, they simply note subtle influences of their remedies in conjunction to Astrology just like TCM also recognizes but TCM also does not conjure demons.\n\nDon't you guys see, ancient star knowledge, astrotheology, astrology, \"Celestiophysics\" is very important to these elites in many different ways from influencing their rituals to their health, their false flags, and other things yet to be mentioned like how the position of the sun's influence on atomic bombs as exposed by Bruce Cathie. Some major earthquakes happen in some celestial alignments. Solar flares have a direct influence to the Earth due to its effect on Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere as it absorbs some of its energy as electricity at the poles while some magnetic lines of force are broken by the solar flares depending on how strong it is, although NASA had placed a tether that grounds to the electrical Earth, even more strongly directing the energy of the solar flares into the Earth which such energy is expressed as strong earthquakes. Dutchsinse's approach is more readily understandable because it's basic plate tectonics knowledge properly utilized by someone with a brain. Although fracking does cause earthquakes. I could go on and on about what causes earthquakes, but the most frightening aspect is that when God tries to change the weather, man can't do anything. Joshua's long day is recorded in many cultures. The stars show patterns that can be scientifically observed carefully to find generalizations of how things might become. Certain natal star signs are preferred over others in recruitment in a witch coven, not that reincarnation exists, rather, generally predictable personality imprinting of people born under certain star signs that were generally observed of their traits. If you got a bunch of generalizations, where certain generalizations overlaps in someone, who they are become generally more predictable. Of course, having specific star signs doesn't mean that you're going to serve Satan, rather, if you are within a Satanic or Luciferian occult cult (some cults can be occcultic but not necessarily completely drenched in Satanism or Luciferianism) because you were just born into it, the chances are, you are going to be used through astrological profiling by how the demons see you as through their divination system so your purpose in such hands of evil people is also somewhat predetermined as well.\n\nNow why does powerful magic systems rely on the stars? One theory (not to be confused with hypothesis) is that demonic entities make a contract to very persistent evil doers to have them certain things when the demons want them to, which the aspect of time being Kronos/Saturn/Shaytan/Satan, the worship of time is done through the observance of God's creation in making a predictable system, but since time is created by God, Satan's pushing mankind to worship the created over the creator as the creator by abusing this predictable system for evil deeds against God's people through terrible people that works in many proxies of their own \"army\". Do these evil doers care about going to hell? Many of them work through proxies, so they think that the karma of the sins that those people do against others for them gets punished for doing what they ought not to while they themselves don't get punished, and they really don't get punished most of the time while their time on Earth, but oh how their stench of their sins rise to heaven from the depths of hell. The Rabinnical Judaists (AKA: Jew, not to be mistaken with Judahite) as well also have the same fate that their Zeusian Venetian Canaanite dynamic duo brothers will deal with. They are already preparing to move to places like Denver, Colorado and Dallas, Texas because of its higher elevation being high enough for a future rise of water levels not caused by HAARP weather modifications or the nonexistant \"Global Warming\" but from God himself through Nibiru/Planet X interfering enough to cause serious damage on Earth's oceans as the center bulge shifts to wherever Nibiru/Planet X influences it, but that's not going to happen until around 2050, so to make people move, coastal places become increasingly harder to live, places like California lead by its Malthusian govenor that emptied out its dams while blaming Global Warming for it, all the while the controlled alternative media blaming its own destruction being from Fukushima radiation when that is absolutely not the case for a lack of water. Japan is thinking of building a wall to prevent being sunk by rising sea levels, and so are some other countries.\n\nIf you have a watchful eye, you can pick up on subtle signs of a setup to a false flag, but every case is different as to what is the reason for that false flag. Predictive programming from the media is somewhat reliable if you knew which TV channel station is controlled by what intelligence group that tries to drop hints to what could or should happen. Movies also does predictive programming. You need to keep the Satanic storytelling thing aside and focus on what specific plans that they intend to do on real places. Explaining what symbols that they flash at you means doesn't help in the sense of trying to find certain specific plans to use later. That is not exposing the Black Nobility bloodlines, that is also not exposing much agendas besides general introduction to the occult and also promoting the degeneration of culture through the wrong kind of \"modernization\". Once you've learn one of their tricks, when you see it again, you won't fall for it again unless they've created a diversion for their real trick. One such instance is how the Jews took over and controlled feminism via Communistic principles which in itself created by the Jews. A proxy group taking the fall for their true masters thing was the reason why Protestantism came about, but in some forms it had backfired as some of these controlled people had Christian humanist principles which took from the scientific renaissance (which was independent from Protestantism) of whatever knowledge they thought was worth preserving as the Puritans left the Anglicans and Quakers that later enslaved Ireland and brought in a huge influx of the Jews into Britain under the reign of Oliver Cromwell, yet in later years, merging with Catholic colonies and adopting the Anglican KJV over the Reformationist's Geneva bible, they had been enslaved to Britain in many levels instead of being just a colony under the Crown Corporation and like the Anglicans, allowed the Jews to rise to power which they take up many seats in congress as Protestantism in America became immensely splintered, highly susceptible to control while taking the control away from the Vatican had given the Venetians and the Knights Templar continuum a separate powerstructure and homeland, a New Venice/Jerusalem to rule over the world as Washington D.C./Little Rome became their military citystate that serves Ancient Londonium.\n\nGet over the mindset that understanding Astrology to being a sorceror or practicing witchcraft. There's much evidence for a predictable system that has actual influences on anything that has biochemical properties on living creatures, you just need to be very careful to not have your observations be muddied with the wrong faith. Little do Christians know how Astrology played a role in predicting the coming of Jesus Christ which was why the Magis even went to Bethlehem to begin with. See: <a href=\"http://torahtimes.org/writings/magi-thinking/article.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Thinking of the Magi</a>. If anything, the stars speak of many biblical truths that are shunned by \"Astronomy\" yet they seek an alternative to the origins of life which is in itself another religion while the Jesuits in their observatories gather intel to conduct certain plans for the future. With more research, we can demystify Astrology. I am not saying that people can know 100% the future through \"divination\", rather, the approach of Astrology I'm talking about is the same approach the government gets metadata on you via social networks or how there are some corelation between certain genomes and the outcomes within people, generally speaking, no absolute claims being made here. The Jesuits use their knowledge on the planets to affect specific chakras during specific alignments with specific biochemical poisons or PSYOPs or space based weaponry utilizing and amplifying the planetary influence over the body for a synergistic attack, and if they knew their victim's birthdate, they would pick the best time and best poison against them, though these days, the way that they (generic high level hitmen) try to get a hit is with parasitic mushrooms like the ones that Jim Stone was hit by a bunch of British looking men in a Mexico mall that patted him down with that junk, but it doesn't have to be that specific exotic weaponry, just knowing that they have terrible stuff that conventional medicine has no cure for, stuff that most alternative medicinal doctors wouldn't know what to do for someone attacked by something exotic as that which has no known name for. What am I talking about? Here's that post which Jim Stone removed later on for his own sake:<blockquote>Jimstone.is ‚Äì World Class Investigative Truth http://82.221.129.208/ifyouareinamericayouprobablycantseethisn2.html\nFeb 29, 2016\n[...]\nI am certain I got nailed.\nIt happened in the week after I found the Tdap link to microcephaly in Brazil. There was a cyber cafe I found that worked for securing the web site, and I had been there a few times. This cyber cafe was at a super crappy 70 percent abandoned outdoor mall. It was a place where you would NEVER see anyone wearing a suit and tie.\nI went there for another password change. Before I got to the cyber cafe, I noticed a 60 year old british looking guy in a suit and tie. And I thought to myself ‚ÄúHe does not belong here‚Äù. Then I saw another. And another. I never said a word to them, yet when they saw me they came to me and surrounded me. They were all smiling and talking, and were touching me in various places. And I thought to myself: That was the perfect Rothchild type setup where they place things on people, and a while later they come down with cancer or some other malady and die.\nAfter about 30 seconds of this, they split up and went separate ways. And it creeped me out.\nThen the crazy stuff started happening. I sprouted a large mushroom shaped growth out the back of my head. Other places they touched me produced similar small growths but I kept them in check by burning them with bleach. I kept quiet about this on the web site because I was still wondering ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù Well, I got the answer to the ‚Äúwhat if,‚Äù so now I am going to say it and give people a heads up -\nI had figured I would try to kill the mushroom off by burning it. It was solid, very tough, and it had a way to commandeer my nerves so if I did anything to it, it was like trying to cut a finger off. I started with a soldering iron but just could not get the muster to do it that way, and also it was so large that a soldering iron just seemed stupid. So I then figured I might be able to get it hot enough if I boiled water in a thick ceramic cup, and then used the ceramic to burn the mushroom over several re-heatings. After about 45 minutes of that fun, the head of the mushroom came off, and I continued to burn the stalk all the way down to skin level.\nAt no point was there ever any blood. And I thought to myself: How did this thing get control of my nerves so well it felt like a body part, without giving those nerves any blood? Anyway it was better that way because I did not end up with a huge bloody mess.\nSo the mushroom was gone. A hole was left where the stalk was, and it dried over. And then the punishment started.\nThe next day I had a headache. It quickly progressed to muscle aches. The other small growths which were on my face, neck, and left arm responded to the death of the big growth, and also died despite the fact I did nothing to them. Somehow they needed the big growth to live. And then I got sick as hell. This is the sickness that has screwed up my writing on this web site for a while.\nThen a large section of skin I never burned on the back of my head turned the same white the mushroom was and dried out. It came off and left a huge long gash on the back of my head that was not the shape of the mushroom stalk. There was never any blood EVER, NOTHING which was really odd because everything that happened would normally leave a huge bloody injury but there was never any blood.\nThe sickness was not contagious. I still cannot figure out what it was. It was awful icky horrible illness, where for an hour my tongue would hurt so bad I wished I was dead, then the inside of my nose would hurt that way, then my throat, then an arm, then this then that whatever, and sometimes I would feel like the flu, then a cold, then food poisoning but it was all nothing, I could not cough up phlegm like a cold. Folks this one was weird, it was like that thing was re-wiring nerves and when it died there was every sort of nervous malfunction one could think of.\nI am still feeling sick, but a few days ago the fever went away and I at least got my strength back. And I am getting a little bit better each day. The sickness was obviously related to burning that thing off, (whatever it was) and the concurrent death of all the other growths when the big one was killed is creepy to say the least. I think that was a genetically engineered organism, probably to give people cancer, and by luck the main growth that gets it all started happened to be in a place I could get to it to kill it rather than have it be inside the liver or wherever, leading to a hopeless situation.\n\nI was suspicious of those three men in suits and ties the moment I saw them. Why did they surround me and ‚Äúfriend tap‚Äù me all over the place and walk off? That just does not happen in every day life. I am confident now that this is how hits are done, when they have someone who does not go to bars, visit prostitutes, or make themselves vulnerable in any way whatsoever. They figured out I was going to that mall to reset passwords and correctly guessed when I would be there. They probably nailed Steve Jobs, Aaron Russo, and others the same way.\nSo I would like to give others in alt media a heads up on one thing to watch out for. I think they finally got sick of me and took action after the Zika/Tdap bust. It had to be something of that sort, because I swear to God I don‚Äôt ever get surrounded by friendly guys in suits who touch me everywhere, and then have things start growing out of me. That was more than just an anomaly.\nIn hindsight I think the following things can be concluded:\nWhen they nail people, there is a master location (a master growth) that has to be there and is probably planted separately from the other growths. If it is not there to communicate with the smaller growths, it is assumed by the small growths that they are on the wrong person and therefore should self terminate. This would make sense, because having a main growth control it all would prevent other people from getting hit by the weapon.\nI don‚Äôt think they ever expect anyone to get the gumption to actually burn anything off the way I did. I chose to burn it off because I was afraid that if I cut it off, pieces of it would enter my blood stream and cause all sorts of problems elsewhere. The only way to nail it for sure then would be to burn it, and that is why I chose that method. I also figured most doctors would be stupid about it and that is why I handled it myself.\nKilling the growth and getting sick could be coincidental, but I doubt it. I doubt it mainly because no one else was sick, and no one else got sick, and the timing was like clockwork, it did not take even a day for the punishment to start. It seemed like a direct correlation. Additionally, this was a very weird illness that could not be pegged down as a cold or flu, even though it had some of the same symptoms. The actual pains were off the charts bad, but nothing ever manifested itself to indicate there should be any pain at all.\nI am surprised the small growths died by themselves. I thought that if there was any connection they would suddenly get bad if I killed the big one. They did not, all they did was die and go away. So there was obviously a connection there, that worked out for the better.\nThis could be ongoing, but so far so good.\n[...]</blockquote>\n\nJim is fine now, he had found a very good doctor that had accelerated the growth of the parasitic whatever it was to its own cellular termination.\n\nüí´<strong>Partial Preterism May 1, 2016 @ 02:36</strong>\n\nThere are some things I don't hear much about, one of them being Partial Preterism. I've always known about Full Preterism, but little to nobody that I know had ever talked about the existence of Partial Preterism.\n\nTaken from <a href=\"https://biblicisminstitute.wordpress.com/2015/10/27/where-is-satan-now/\" target=\"_blank\">Where is Satan now? | Biblicism Institute</a>:<blockquote>He is currently chained and imprisoned in the bottomless pit.\n\n‚ÄúThen I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed‚Ä¶‚Äù Revelation 20:1-3\n\nThe abyss is a horrific place, even for demons.\n\n‚ÄúFor Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man‚Ä¶ And Jesus asked him, ‚ÄòWhat is your name?‚Äô And he said, ‚ÄòLegion‚Äô; for many demons had entered him. They implored Him not to command them to go away into the abyss.‚Äù Luke 6: 29-31\n\nTHE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS\n\nAfter Christ rose from the dead and went up to heaven in 30 AD, He patiently waited 40 years for the disobedient Hebrews to accept Him as Messiah. The reason He waited was because the Hebrews were:\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶beloved for the sake of the fathers; for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience, so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy. For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all.‚Äù Romans 11: 28-31\n\nBut, in 70 AD, Christ unleashed hell upon the disobedient ones. He opened the abyss and allowed its resident demons to escape in order to devour them (through war).\n\n‚ÄúThen the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him. He opened the bottomless pit, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit. Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.‚Äù Revelation 9: 1-4\n\nAll the chalices in Revelation were curses God poured on the disobedient Hebrews who refused to acknowledge Him. The trumpets that blasted their introductions along with the four Horsemen were all designed for those Judahite Hebrews who crucified the Lord. However, those who accepted Him fled Judah/Judea before the beginning of sorrows and of the Apocalypse in AD 70.\n\n‚ÄúBut when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is near. Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those who are in the midst of the city must leave, and those who are in the country must not enter the city.‚Äù Luke 21: 20,21\n\nSoon after Pentecost, Christians took Jesus‚Äôs warning very seriously. They started selling everything they had with an eye towards leaving Judah or Judea.\n\n‚ÄúThey began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need.‚Äù Acts 2:45\n\nThose Christian Hebrews who escaped the infernal LAST DAYS of the Old Covenant embodied 1) ‚Äúall Israel shall be saved‚Äù of Romans 11:26 and 2) the grass of the earth‚Ä¶ (the) green thing‚Ä¶ (the) tree of Revelation 9:4 that were not to be hurt.\n\nConsequently, those Christian Hebrews were the ones who did not have the mark of the beast. Their symbolic number in Revelation is 144,000 (12 tribes squared/Father &amp; Son x 1000/many or 12¬≤ x 1000). Those with the mark of the beast were annihilated.\n\nIn other words, there are NO LOST TRIBES of Israel roaming about. They‚Äôre all DEAD. Besides, if they‚Äôre lost, why don‚Äôt they pick up a cell phone and call someone. After all, this is the 21st century.:-)\n\nThe Apocalypse of 70 AD was the day of reckoning for those who killed the Messiah and the end of the age of the Hebrews and of the Old Covenant.\n\n‚ÄúI am with you always, even to the end of the age.‚ÄùMatthew 28:20\n\nWhile God poured the chalices of His wrath on the disobedient Hebrews and shut down the Old Covenant, the whole earth felt the ripples of the dying Old Order and experienced the birth pangs of the New Order as the physical war spread.\n\n‚ÄúYou will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet the end. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes. But all these things are merely the beginning of birth pangs. Then they will deliver you to be persecuted, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name. At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another. Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many. Because lawlessness is increased, most people‚Äôs love will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved. This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.‚Äù Matthew 24: 6 ‚Äì 14\n\nOnce the Old Order came to an end, Christ zoomed in on Satan the Serpent and had him bound and thrown into the abyss.\n\nWhy?\n\nSo he would deceive the nations no more the way he deceived the Hebrews and the world.\n\n‚ÄúThe god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.‚Äù 2 Corinthians 4:4\n\nHowever, only Satan was bound and thrown into the bottomless pit. The locusts or demons that were released therefrom are still rummaging about, like chickens without heads or in this instance without their head Satan. In other words, their capacity to wreak havoc and their deceptive prowess are limited, but to the spiritually naked (i.e. those without Christ) they still pack a punch, albeit not as impactful as before.\n\n‚ÄúFor we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.‚Äù Ephesians 6:12\n\nSatan‚Äôs incarceration is for a thousand-year period ‚Äì not a literal thousand, just like the thousand in the following verse is not literal either:\n\n‚ÄúFor every beast of the forest is Mine, The cattle on a thousand hills.‚Äù Psalm 50:10\n\nThe word thousand in these instances means many or a great amount. The cattle on the thousand and first and second and third hills do not belong to someone else, they still belong to God.\n\nWith that same understanding, Satan is bound for a thousand-year time as Christ reigns over the earth through the New Order, and no one but God knows when that unlimited period will end.\n\nWhen it does, God will release Satan for a little while.\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.‚Äù Revelation 20: 3\n\nUpon his discharge the following will take place:\n\n‚ÄúWhen the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison, and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore. And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.‚Äù Revelation 20: 7-9\n\nThe beloved city is the spiritual New Jerusalem, not the physical Old One. It is comprised of the Saints of God or Christians.\n\n‚ÄúI saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem‚Ä¶‚Äù Revelation 21:2\n\nChrist will intervene in that final spiritual war by ‚Äúraining fire from heaven‚Äù to destroy the enemies of His Bride the Church Assembly and by shutting down the course of history, thus bringing about the end of the world. This is how Jesus described it:\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, ‚ÄúFirst gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.‚Äù Matthew 13:30\n\nThe tares will be gathered first. Not the Saints.\n\n‚ÄúThen we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.‚Äù 1 Thess 4:17\n\nThen finally:\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶ the devil who deceived them (will be) thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.‚Äù Revelation 20: 7-10\n\nSatan‚Äôs angels along with those who reject Christ and those who supposedly follow Christ but reject His commands will also partake of the eternal fire:\n\n‚ÄúThen He will also say to those on His left, ‚ÄòDepart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels‚Ä¶‚Äù Matthew 25:41\n\n[See How to Become a true Christian and avoid that eternal anguish.]\n\nThose who follow Christ and obey His commands will be rewarded.\n\n‚ÄúThen the King will say to those on His right, ‚ÄòCome, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. ‚Äù Matthew 25: 34\n\nAnd then Christ will start everything over.\n\n‚ÄúThen I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea.‚Äù Revelation 21:1\n\nNo longer any sea is symbolic for no longer any abyss, the pit wherefrom came the demons.\n\n‚ÄúThe dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea.‚Äù Revelation 13:1\n\nTherefore, there will be no more demonic and destructive forces in the new earth to contend with.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSatan is currently in jail, just like an incarcerated mafia don whose goons are running amok in the streets.\n\nThat is why the Apostle Paul penned the following:\n\n‚ÄúThe God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.‚Äù Romans 16: 20\n\nThat crushing was the expected binding of Satan who was subsequently thrown into the abyss.\n\n‚ÄúAnd Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúI saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.‚Äù Luke 10:18\n\nNote\n\nRemember, the entire New Testament ‚Äì including the Book of Revelation ‚Äì was written prior to 70 AD and must be read with that context in mind in order to understand many of its passages.\n\n‚ÄúNot forsaking the assembling of ourselves together‚Ä¶ and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.‚Äù Hebrews 10:25\n\nIn addition, the Word JUDAHITE not JEW is in the Bible. The word JEW is a mistranslation and causes quite the confusion about the Book of Revelation, especially since Jews are NOT the Hebrews of the bible ‚Äì all the Hebrews are irrevocably dead. Therefore, the bible is not talking about the Jews nor about modern-day Israel, but about the Judahite Hebrews of old.</blockquote>\n\nThat's all really great if that really truly is the way it went down and will go down. However, what bothers me, the one thing that makes me wonder if I'm understanding this correctly, all hinges on \"Immediately\" of Matthew 24:29. Did Matthew 24:29-31 happen immediately? The unasked question is that if it's the same as the burning of the tares by fire before the harvest of the wheat, or in other words, if Matthew 24:29-31 took place, does that mean the figurative 144,000 Israelites were \"saved' from destruction as a type of rapture that isn't the traditional form being taught most anywhere while the rapture we're waiting for is not that rapture but yet another different type of rapture? If that is so, then yes this type of rapture is one that will burn all the unsaved people in the world while the saved will be unburned and 1 Thessalonians 4:17-18 would be about that? That would mean the false harvest during Jacob's trouble also already happened. Looking back at <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/a-short-chronological-look-at-the-book-of-revelation/\" target=\"_blank\">A short chronological look at the Book of Revelation</a>, that article no longer feels \"right\". Perhaps the real Harlot was all the non Christian Judahite Hebrews all along, the true \"Synagogue of Satan\". What if God knew that if Satan wasn't sent to the abyss that he would be able to suppress the truth only within the Christian Judahites, never being able to spread much to other nations? It would make more sense, God had slained all the Judahites for the Gentiles' sake for the New Covenant that replaced the Old Covenant that was slain.\n\nThe post apocalyptic \"Synagogue of Satan\" now goes to the Samarians that pretend to be Judahites yet adopt their Pharisaism, moved to Babylon then Europe then all over the world then back in Palestine persecuting Palestinians who were long time ago related to each other but no longer are due to merging with people of other nations, so those people in Palestine are more white than anything, white washed Palestinians against Palestinians that sometimes adopt the Islamic faith. Don't free Palestine, just kick out the Judahite wannabes to Madagascar. Over half a million Palestinians displaced yet these white washed Palestinians want to keep a perpetual state of \"Hiroshima\" to the Gaza strip and the remaining Palestinian land not under the rule of white Palestinians? That's what's going on. Let Palestine be Islamic. They're not the radical Wahhabis being funded by foreign countries. Islam made a pact to the Vatican and by extension all Christians to protect their homes and churches, though that doesn't mean that I'm for Sharia Law, just saying that in comparison to the Jews, real Muslims of the Islamic faith that's against Sufism and such black magic rituals isn't as destructive as the Jews that work behind the scenes to put Christianity and Islam against each other and if both sides knew, both sides would be able to effectively kick out the Jews from high places. What the illegal State of Israel is doing is making experimental weaponry and selling them to other nations. There is no biblical ground for supporting a literal Israel, a literal Jerusalem.\n\nDoes that mean all the Reformers are wrong as to the real interpretation of the Book of Revelation? No. Does it absolutely not apply to any Christian \"Church\" or a specific one like say the Roman Catholic Church? By proxy, the fake Judahites infiltrated Roman Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity, not so sure about the Coptic churches and some fringe churches, but definitely sure that they've used the Protestant Reformation to their advantage, they're milking Protestants dry. See <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/everything-wrong-with-protestantism/\" target=\"_blank\">Everything wrong with \"Protestantism\"</a> concerning that.\n\nWatch in this order: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5yh-LB7sAQ\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5yh-LB7sAQ</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9MYoZEwuQQ\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9MYoZEwuQQ</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTXGfztVqKQ\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTXGfztVqKQ</a>\n\nThough many would disagree concerning what the Reformation Christians believed in, some of them were \"Preterists\" which there's two forms of \"Preterism\" that is known: Partial Preterism and \"Hyper\" Preterism. \"Hyper\" Preterism is saying that all of the events in the book of Revelation had already happened. That's the one many know about concerning Preterism but not Partial Preterism which considers the 1000 year reign as a figurative, symbolic age of the church that Jesus Christ would reign through the Holy Spirit to all of the world through Christians. At the end of that 1000 year reign, the spiritual Jerusalem that is the Christians wherever they are, are in danger since after the figurative 1000 year, Satan gets out of the abyss and deceives many, in tempting people to go against God and His Christians. God puts an end to it all for good through a \"fire baptism\" of punishment that burns up all the unbelievers up and also burns up the oceans and cleanses the whole world. Then everyone gets judged in front of God in judgement day and get sent to either the lake of fire/\"hell\"/gehenna or the new heaven new earth new Jerusalem. Whether or not \"judgement day\" occurs to people immediately after their death is a different matter altogether that really doesn't even matter that much since everyone gets judged by God in the end. Those that prefer premillenialism/futurism are those that believe that God would save them from their suffering that God had predestined them to go through. They can't cope with God being as such, they can't cope with death, they can't handle what history actually says about it, and they don't want to live in a world that the only \"prophecy\" left is to wait for God to burn up the world while before then, Satan (not to be confused with his army) gets to mess around with people, leading them away from God. All but two chapters in the bible is fulfilled, so all that end time eschatology that idiots learned in a bad bible college is a waste of their time and money unless they try to forcefully apply prophecy that had already happened before.\n\nThe Scofield bible pushes \"pre-trib\" that falls under futurism as in, the tribulation is in the future. Those that are \"mid-trib\" or \"pre-wrath\" also technically believe that the tribulation is in the future, ergo, it's still futurism. Those that believe in \"post-trib\" yet believe that's in the future still look forward to seeing the beginning of the book of Revelation to be fulfilled for it hasn't happened in their interpretation. Futurism is inherently premillenialism because they don't include a rapture after the figurative 1000 year reign, they never ever mention that there's other views concerning this and when they do, they would point to the nonsense that is Full Preterism, also known as Hyper Preterism that thinks that the whole book of Revelation and consequentially, the whole bible was already fulfilled, that the \"new heaven, new earth\" is only in \"utopian communities\" among the \"visible saints\", a highly humanitarian perspective that isn't biblical. Only Partial Preterism can be Amillenialism since to the Hyper Preterist, there is no rapture, everything's done and fulfilled. There is a type of \"rapture\" that has not happened which was falsely attributed to the time of Jacob's trouble during the tribulation in Jerusalem from AD 66-70. At some point in history, people somehow mixed up historicism with pre-wrath and post-trib premillenialism and calling pre-trib as futurism when they're all premillenialism and they seek a rapture before the 1000 year reign. This issue had duped the most fundamental of so called Christians, but by the grace of God, I've gotten out of that deceptive mindset. What's worse than the footnotes of the Scofield reference bible is the writings of Francisco Ribera SJ that predates it. In some forms, even the Protestant Reformation itself tried to imply that the Jews are going to be saved when history says otherwise concerning the fall of Jerusalem. Josephus records how the Christians were not there in the destruction of Jerusalem. Only the Christians and the Christian Judahites escaped, the unbelieving Judahites were not saved. Again, the Jews are not Judahites, so they're butthurt for nothing which their lies are built upon. Only a couple theological seminaries teach Partial Preterism to be biblical, since I rarely ever hear anyone talk about it, and I've \"church hopped\" in many denominations.\n\nTo clarify, the Partial Preterist stance is not futurism not because some Partial Preterists don't necessarily believe in the rapture, but because they don't believe that the \"tribulation\" is in the future, but it's in the past while the rapture of the living happens before God cleanses the earth in fire, happens after the end of the church age, while everything else before that like Satan being locked up and the time of Jacob's trouble had happened in the past.\n\nThere's a comparison near the bottom of this website: <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/PartialPreterism/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/PartialPreterism/index.html</a> It says \"8th trumpet\" though there isn't an 8th trumpet, rather, a voice like a trumpet:<blockquote>7th TRUMPET\nA parousia of Christ\nJerusalem\nJudgment on Judaism\nFulfils Matthew 24\nEnds the Old Covenant Age\nProceeds from preaching the Gospel to Jews first throught the oichoumene (Empire)\nSuffering, misery and death\nSatan is bound\nThe beginning of Christ's Kingdom\n\n8th TRUMPET\nThe Final Parousia of Christ\nEarth\nFinal Judgment\nFulfils Matthew 25; 1Thess.4; 1Corinthians 15\nEnd of the Age\nProceeds from the making of disciples of all the nations (Matthew 28:18-20)\nSuffering, misery, and death done away with (Rev. 21:3-4)\nSatan is damned\nThe culmination of Christ's Kingdom (Eph.1:10; 1Cor. 15:24)</blockquote>\n\nüí´<strong>Name of God May 13, 2016 @ 15:33</strong>\n\nThose who say the name of God is only a title of God's authority are only deceiving you. Those who say the name of God is Yah doesn't know that Aramaic is not pure Hebrew yet insists the pronunciation has not changed. Those who say the name of God is unpronounceable might believe in his heart that there is no God. Those who say the name of God yet cannot say the name of Jesus Christ by faith (and in fact, DESPITE the facts) rejects the Father by rejecting the Son and effectively rejecting the Holy Spirit that might depart from their hearts for a false spirit. Those who say the name of God is written AS Jehovah or Yahweh are not necessarily intentionally lying to you but they don't know that both are speculations as to its pronunciation with no deductive reasoning behind their claims. Those who say the name of God comes from the Tetragrammaton is also saying that the Shemhamphorasch invocations of the 72 names of God's fallen angels (demons, djinn, shadow people) are one and the same when none of them are the real name(s) of God, the origin of the 72 comes from the tetractys of the letters of the Tetragrammaton adds up to 72 by gematria. Those who say the name of God is that \"I AM THAT I AM\" or \"I AM\" doesn't know that is not a name but a declaration and a title which is tainted with occulted demonic implications. Those who say the name of God is Jahbulon worships Yareah, Ba'al and Osiris.\n\n\"HVHI\" written from left to right being IHVH has an ancient pictographic meaning from \"Paleo-Hebrew\" which is the old Canaanite script though people say it's Phoenician, it's really both, for Phoenician is Greek for Canaanite. Anyways, it means \"Behold the Nail, Behold the Hand\". The four letters that make up \"I AM\" points to Jesus Christ. Moses was a type of savior, \"I AM\" had sent Moses. \"I AM\" in Egyptian is Nuk, so Moses didn't say it in Egyptian to say the least, and scholars that tried to push future tense for Ehyeh/\"I AM\" do this despite knowing that Hebrew has no future tense. There is no \"holy language\" for we don't speak the language that Adam spoke in, neither did Abraham spoke in \"Hebrew\" until he came to Canaan, and the Israelites probably spoke in Egyptian for awhile until a couple of centuries after Moses lead the people out of Egypt. \"ADONAI\"/LORD is in all caps to signify God's superiority over all the other gods, and that is a title, but it never was meant to be the name of God while the guess names took the vowel points of \"ADONAI\" and mixes with \"IHVH\" to make \"IAHOVAH\" which is to make a NEW name to REPLACE the true name of God, therefore, any pronunciation or spelling based on mixing \"LORD\" with the Tetragrammaton mentioned in the Shemhamphorasch is BLASPHEMY but God will not be mocked because he will punish those who're knowingly against him, he will have the last laugh. \"JEHOVAH\" doesn't make sense for there is no e in ADONAI, so using the 1611 KJV as \"proof\" is ridiculous. Maybe the rumors of Sir John Dee messing with the King James bible might be true, but Protestants were duped into the traditions of the Rabbis and their evil scribes to adopting the false name.\n\nIn example, these are a few false names using the IHUH, YHUH, IHVH, YHVH or IHWH, YHWH Tetragrammaton spellings:\n\nYahueh (ya-hu-eh)\nIahueh (i-a-hu-eh)\nYahuah (ya-hu-ah)\nIahuah (ia-hu-ah)\nYahevahe (yah-e-va-he)\nIahevahe (ia-he-va-he)\nYohwah (yoh-wah)\nIohwah (i-oh-wah)\nYohweh (yoh-weh)\nIohweh (i-oh-weh)\nYahwah (yah-wah)\nIahwah (i-ah-wah)\nYehwah (yeh-wah)\nIehwah (i-eh-wah)\nYehweh (yeh-weh)\nIehweh (i-eh-weh)\nYahweh (yah-weh)\nIahweh (i-ah-weh)\nYahwe (yah-we)\nIahwe (i-ah-we)\nYahueh (ya-hu-eh)\nIahueh (i-a-hu-eh)\nYahuah (ya-hu-ah)\nIahuah (ia-hu-ah)\nYahevahe (yah-e-va-he)\nIahevahe (ia-he-va-he)\nYohwah (yoh-wah)\nIohwah (i-oh-wah)\nYohweh (yoh-weh)\nIohweh (i-oh-weh)\n\nJust because Josephus said that the name of God was four letters, doesn't mean that he is right, for he could be relying of Pharisaic tradition which is not to be trusted. The four letters came from Aramaic or of the Chaldee language based spelling during the exile of the Judahites to Babylonia. Ehyeh in Hebrew is HYH while in Aramaic it is pronounced \"Hawa\" and is written as IHVH replacing the \"I AM\" as an inserted name by the Pharisaic scribes that had removed the name of God with a false name while insisting that \"ADONAI\" is a name, and all the other numerous lies that the Jews (Jews are not Judahites, see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-two-biggest-lies-concerning-the-jews-and-other-myths/\" target=\"_blank\">The two biggest lies concerning the \"Jews\" and other myths</a>) push. The pronunciation of \"Yahweh\" came from the Samaritans' name of God: \"IABE\" which the \"b\" changed to a \"v\" and an \"h\" is inserted after the \"e\", creating \"IAVEH\". Psalms 68:4's \"JAH\" is also edited by the scribes from \"IEH\"/\"JEH\"/\"YEH\" to \"IAH\"/\"JAH\"/\"YAH\" which is a WELL KNOWN pagan moon goddess name and is also the god of time for the Egyptians, making it \"IAHVEH\". The claim that \"Jah\" came from Psalms contradicts Exodus 3:14 and is not a sufficient explanation in and of itself without implying that the scribes ignorantly went against Exodus 3:14. After Gilbert G√©n√©brard died, the \"v\" was dropped for the double u or \"w\", making it \"IAHWEH\". Jehovah and Yahweh are guess names from different, non Hebraic sources and tainted manuscripts of the Pharisees passed down by the Masorites that perpetuated the false traditions of the bible as the MSS which is now immortalized as the modern Textus Receptus through Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener's edits comparing the original Textus Receptus with the Byzantine type texts, while the modern scholars ignorantly pass down the traditions of the Pharisees when it comes to the name of God and vowel point placements to force an interpretation of what originally didn't have any vowel points. They are the names of God of pagan cultures and it is tainted through and through. It was the Masorites that insisted that \"I\" was pronounced as \"Y\" when when there was a vowel after \"I\", the \"I\" has a soft G sound in the Phoenician standard that would make it \"J\", so they were the ones that replaced tradition, making it \"YAHWEH\". Hovah means ruin, diaster, Ahvah means to do perversely, Ahveh means distorting, perverting in Hebrew. Placing \"Jah\"/\"Yah\" after it then calling it the name of God in Hebrew is double wrong. Ya(H)reah is how to pronounce \"Yahweh\" in Hebrew, that is the longer name of \"IAH\". Yareah is moon in Hebrew. Through and through, it is a moon goddess name, the worship of Selene. Islam before Muhammad came along existed as moon goddess worship for it's a synergistic amalgamation between Eastern paganism and Catholicism, see: <a href=\"http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/moongod.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ALLAH ‚Äì the Moon God</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCmSBfVXEmA\" target=\"_blank\">216 - The Islamic Connection / Total Onslaught - Walter Veith</a>.\n\nBefore the Samaritan four letter name was borrowed in the RCC and Protestant churches, it was based on the three letter name, IAO in Greek. There's other four letters like ·º∏Œ±Œø·Ω∫, ·º∏ŒµœÖœé, ŒôŒøœÖœâ, ŒôŒµŒøœÖ, ŒôŒµœÖœé, ŒôŒµœâŒ¨ though some are not from ·º∏Œ±·ø∂/·º∏Œ±œé. Theodoret although being a proponent of the Samaritan guess name said that the Jews said ·ºàœäŒ¨ as the name of God but that's from ehjeh. It is said that IAO is identified with Dionysus, Mithras, etc., and is explicitly a Hebrew God name even though that is debated here not to be so. The Israelites had adopted this false name in their exile in other nations. IAO is YAH/IAH. Clement pushed Iao-ve. The Chaldeans had Ia(o), and Yaho as their god which the abbreviation is Yah. David Livingstone has something to say about IAO in his <a href=\"http://www.conspiracyschool.com/blog/mithraism-zoroastrian-gnosticism\" target=\"_blank\">Mithraism: Zoroastrian Gnosticism</a> article, go and read it. Also, read 2 Kings 23:11, for that is where IAO sun worshiping comes from of which the Phoenician Essenes worshiped in defiance and rejection to the real God.\n\nThe Jeh in Jehoshea comes from the shortened \"Ehjeh\", while \"Je\" comes from \"Jeh\" since the \"h\" is silent. \"Yehsa\" is salvation, but adding a masculine \"s\" makes it \"Yehsas\". Drop the silent \"h\" and change the \"Y\" to the \"J\" as it should be, you'll get \"Jesas\" whereas \"sas\" and \"sus\" are the same pronunciation, nobody is calling Jesus \"Jesoos\". The very word for salvation in Hebrew includes the \"jeh\" in \"Ehjeh\", so Salvation in Hebrew means God is our Savior, Jesus is literally our Salvation, Salvation is inseparable from God, to reject Salvation is to reject God, no one can come to the Father (Ye/Je/Yeh/Jeh) except through Jesus, through Salvation. The correct spelling of \"Jehsa\" is \"Jehsha\" but again, it's pronounced \"Jesus\" (with the masculine gender) in English which is the SAME pronounciation of the Hebrew word for \"Salvation\" which is \"Jehsha\". Those who claim to do things in the name of Jesus Christ yet if Jesus does not know them, they never knew him to begin with. Even the demons tremble at the name of Jesus yet they know who are of Christ despite those that claims to deliver demons in the name of Christ, so they play on a show, a controlled fake exorcism to make the people be convinced of a lie that those who invoke the name of Jesus by mouth alone can be saved without any repentance, without any amending of the mind to the truth, without any faith nor grace. IESOUS is a transliterated name from Jehsha that in other languages is pronounced incorrectly yet it happened to be pronounced correctly in English as Jesus, Gee-sas. Zeus in Greek is pronounced \"dzyooce\" or dis-ooce, which isn't the same as soos or how Zeus is pronounced in English. Yahshua and Yeshu is also fake because Shu is the Egyptian sky god, Joshea is short for Jehoshea changed from the name Hoshea (Oshea in KJV) to Jehoshea. Yeshu is used to blaspheme Jesus, see <a href=\"http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Glossary/Abbreviations/abbreviations.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Glossary/Abbreviations/abbreviations.html</a>:<blockquote>YM\"SH, Y'Sh, Y\"ShU\n\nYimach Shmo Vazichro; For deceased enemies of the Jewish people. \"May his name be wiped out\" (YH\"SH, Y'Sh); or \"May his name and memory be wiped out\" (Y'Shu); Note: This is also a term of disparagement among Orthodox Jews for Yeshua the Mashiach, blessed be He, who blasphemously call Him \"Yeshu.\"</blockquote>\n\nHoshea and Hosea are identical, and it also means salvation. Yahshua then means moon goddess and sky god, Egyptian names that would had been clearly recognized by the early Israelites that retained their knowledge of the Egyptian language. It is only tradition that insists that Joshea's name is Joshua, of demonic tradition that serves to conceal and corrupt the name of Jesus Christ. Moses didn't call Joshea \"Yahshua\", neither did he call him \"Jehsha\" for short so those that say Joshua is how to pronounce Jesus is outright wrong. It's just an error on the part of the scribes that changed the e to u and the eh to o, from Jehoshea to Joshua. The shorter name for salvation was used many times more than Jesus' full first name (Jehoshea) that still means God is salvation. It is also completely unnecessary to push the vowel points for the fake names of God to be used on Jehoshea. Spelling it to make it contain \"YHS(h)WH\" like \"Yahushuwah\" is using the lesser known Pentagrammaton which is also of Kabbalistic origin as the Tetragrammaton. The Jesuits, Rosicrucians, and Freemasons invoke \"IHS\"/\"JHS\" as it's from IHSVH, the Pentagrammaton. Inserting the \"H\" after Jehoshea is probably for no good reason but to deceive. The full name of Jesus and Joshea in the Babylonian Aramaic script is \" ◊ô◊î◊ï◊©◊¢ \" is not the same as \" ◊ô◊î◊©◊ï◊¢ \" or the false IHS(h)VH.\n\nAllhlouia, Allelou-ia(h) is the CORRUPTED pronunciation of the Greek Eleleu-ih, Eleleu-ie that is the archaic form of the Hebrew (or Canaanite/Phoenician) Elohim/Eloah/Eloih in Greek. Westcott and Hort's (suspected Jesuit temporal coadjutors) New Testament has the corrupted pronunciation while the MSS doesn't. Alleluia is the worship of Ia/Iah/Ja/Jah/Ya/Yah but designated for Apollo, but even in its incorrupted \"el-e-lu-ie\", it was the pagan version of Elohim worship as in, demon worship. The Spirit of \"God\" that came into King Saul was translated from Elohim. Elohim is a tainted name for demons in its proper context of the sentence or story, so \"Sons of God\" in Genesis being of the line of Seth, and the \"Sons of God\" in the book of Job being demons, just don't force the demon interpretation for everything with \"Elohim\" without context. The Hebrew \"Elelohe\" and the Greek \"Eleleu-ih\" are identical. The Ancient Greeks might had worshiped God until much later when it became corrupted with a false interpretation of its origins not being before Nimrod's Babylon, but after they had forgotten their true origins. When Jacob named his altar \"El-e-lu-he\" after the God of his salvation and help, it is the same name cried by the multitude in heaven \"el-e-lu-ie\" to Jesus our Lord and Savior. Maybe after Jacob, some Canaanites remembered Jacob's altar and then they became the Greeks later on and retained the ancient worship of God, although the Spartans were of the Tribe of Dan so perhaps the Greeks adopted it from them. From Alleluia to Hallelujah, this is in itself trying to modernize the worship of Jah/Yah in the newer spelling and trying to attach itself to Ya(h)reah and the false guess names. It's El-e-lu-jeh(sha), not El-e-lu-yah(reah). Likewise, it's Messieh, not Messiah.\n\nThe origin of Ieh/Jeh/Yeh never came from IHVH but from HIH and from HIH, IH with the \"e\" vowel points. Since the origin of Ieh/Jeh/Yeh is different from Iah/Jah/Yah, I can't say that people who unknowingly use the \"a\" vowel for Yah really mean the same thing as they think that they do as they insist (A)HIH comes from IHVH like an idiot when \"Eh(y/j)eh Asher Eh(y/j)eh\" was spoken before what should be \"Ehjeh\" for the \"I AM\" that sent you part that is IHVH. The Paleo-Hebrew \"IHVH\" was inserted in what was a blank space in the manuscripts that is written in Babylonian Aramaic Hebrew. The aleph before HIH is a prefix for HIH indicates that it's in first person, it's the \"I\" in \"I AM\" and the vowel points for that aleph sounds like the eh in meh. The root word of AHIH is HIH, but in Babylonian Aramaic Hebrew, it's rendered AHYH and from there, into \"AHAYAH\". That is the unbiblical, alternative pronunciation used in the Kabbalah as \"The Crown\" so it's wrong and corrupted. The Masorites didn't mess with Exodus 3:14 concerning that, so those that say it is AHAYAH is probably referring to the Zohar for inspiration. There are pictures floating around of many Paleo-Hebrew manuscripts with IHVH in it but I am not aware as to the context of the tablet as to why it's used because it's a Samaritan guess name for their moon god but it doesn't automatically debunk what was already stated here. There are some stuff from King Hezekiah's reign that uses IHVH but Hosea's story (concerning Hosea 2:16-17) happened a few kings before Hezekiah came along so the scribes might had unknowingly attributed IHVH to IH as its ephithet though who knows, they might had known all along. There can be something else going on whether its the corruption of the kings of Israel and/or Judah to false idols, fabricated antiquity, image manipulation, or simply talking about something else altogether, we can't be certain, that is for certain that there is much more conflicting evidence concerning the name of God that Big School and Big Church are not sharing to push the false authenticity of the Jews as the Judahites which they aren't. There's also the Mesha Stele that mentions IHVH, but it's the Moabites, they are not Judahites nor Israelites. The Samaritans might had picked up the name of Iabe/Iave from the Moabites, and the Moabites might had picked up the false name from the Judahites and Israelites in their worship of Ba'alim. The Documentary Hypothesis is lacking substantial evidence behind their claims, not even the Jews believe in it, but it could be explained in a different form in which the scribes picking up the false name of God and rewriting the bible with the false names, causing inconsistencies in the bible of what is God's name.\n\nWhether or not IHVH is authentic, the emphasis is directed towards Jesus as I said before, Behold the Nail, Behold the Hand but from left to right or in reverse, so it's HVHI from left to right without the vowel points, just the pictographic meaning in Paleo-Hebrew that borrowed from the Phoenicians. Weird how what is a name attributed to a demon reversed points to Jesus. The Shemhamphorasch invokes 72 angels and 72 demons but really they're one and the same entities. In other words, it's not proof that IHVH is authentic since it's HVHI, reversing a demon's name of the opposite duality meaning. The \"H\" is depicted as a man with both his arms up meaning: Lo, Behold, \"THE\". The \"I\" is depicted as an arm and a hand meaning arm and hand, work, deed. The \"V\" is depicted like a capital Y letter meaning nail, peg, add, \"AND\". IHVH doesn't make sense from left to right and the translation would be like \"Behold the Hand, Behold the Nail\" and whatever you can make of it to make it make sense. Working/hand-man-nails/peg-man? Perhaps IHVH is the demon that wanted to nailed Jesus to the cross? I don't know, pictograms and symbolism have its limits, and it's not a really convincing argument considering that there is no proof that they had used the Proto Siniatic script either. What Jesus said about himself in John 10:6-7, 9-21, 23-31 is describing what his name means as well as what he plans to do, and what the Holy Spirit plans to do after him through him. I find that better than speculations.\n\nEver since the days of Jeremiah or Jeremias, the true name of God was replaced with IHVH which just so happened to be an equivalent to Ba'ali and basically, Ba'al, so any Paleo-Hebrew tablets during and after the days of Jehremijeh that has IHVH etched in, though it can be even further back during every reign of evil kings, and perhaps this problem of calling Ba'al as the LORD as IHVH existed as far back to the early Canaanites even before Abraham left Egypt when he shouldn't had gone to Egypt to start with. What was originally written down as Adonai was pronounced as and replaced with IHVH, which the title of \"LORD\"/Adonai in itself became corrupted by the Kabbalists to invoke and summon demons that put upon themselves any title of God. Yes, even the name of Jesus can invoke demons with that logic, but the pronunciation doesn't matter as much as the faith which one seeks after Jesus in, so if you really repented and received the Holy Spirit, you would call in the name of Jesus in English, Jesus in Hebrew, and avoid calling in the name of Yahshua in Babylonian Aramaic Hebrew, and no, the New Testament was written in Koine Greek before it was written in Syriac (Assyrian-Aramaic) script being translated from the Greek. Yes there's two kinds of Aramaic alphabets but they're both essentially a corrupted form of pre-captivity Biblical Paleo-Hebrew. The dissolved 10 tribes of Israel as the Samaritans of Samaria used Syriac, while the Judahites and Benjamites used Babylonian Aramaic Hebrew (AKA: Jewish Babylonian Aramaic), though only the Judahite + Benjamite + half of the Levite (although they've later rejected the Aaronic Priesthood for the Rabbinism) Judeans (residents of the land of Judah) kept their knowledge of the proper pronunciation while using the improper pronunciation and words that they picked up in Babylon. Jesus might had spoken in 3 languages: Latin, Greek, Samarian Hebrew, Judean Hebrew, biblical Paleo-Hebrew. To him, Hebrew was probably three different dialects although for the purpose of seeking the \"true pronunciation\", we go back from Babylonian/Judean Hebrew to Paleo-Hebrew's Phoenician pronunciation to be applied to the Babylonian/Judean Hebrew then transliterate that into English in order to undo the mess that is Babylonian Aramaic Hebrew. Modern Hebrew is based off of Babylonian Aramaic Hebrew but we are not dealing with that here. Nobody knows what type of Hebrew script was used on the plaque written in three languages: Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Judahites. We technically use the Babylonian Aramaic Hebrew AS \"Biblical Hebrew\" because there isn't much Paleo-Hebrew surviving after the diaspora. In the dissolution of the dead language, \"Hebrew\" became a parasitic language that have slight changes depending on the language of the host nation, see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/jewish-diaspora-languages/\" target=\"_blank\">Jewish diaspora languages</a>. God had preserved most of the truth even through the evil Masorites which I remind you all, the Catholics and Protestants agreed to use their writings. Though I prefer the Textus Receptus, that doesn't mean that it's not without error in its translation but even so, God's word is still preserved despite the various corrupt translations, it doesn't make God's word corrupt.\n\n\"God\" is not a pagan Syrian deity of Gawd/Gad, the etymology is different. This is like comparing \"nega\" in korean (means \"I\") to \"nigga\" in urban English. If God is a pagan name, G-d does not mean Gad, rather, it's \"God-damn\". An hyphen is not used to substitute, rather, used to put two words together as a compound word usually for uncommon words that's not frequently used. G_d or an underline/underscore is to be used to imply that something goes between G and d on top of the underscore, but why does it offend those to refer to pagan names? Do you have Pre Traumatic Stress Disorder like every jew alive under the religion of the Holohoax, pushed through the Rothschilds' Zionistic Secular Jewish Identity? Do you not have faith in \"God\" which you do know what it means? Everyone knows \"God\", Romans 1 tells us that fact.\n\nI don't condemn people who simply say \"Jehovah\" but if they say Jehovah is God, the LORD, the father of Jesus, that is FACTUALLY wrong even if they're technically right since they have to trust the falsified Masoretic etymology and I would interject if I could present all of what I've presented here at some point but I avoid agreeing with statements that isn't true and avoid making a big deal of it. Christians almost globally recognize Jehovah as the Christian God instead of the god of (Rabbinical) Judaism. Those who say Yahweh implies that the god of Rabbinical Judaism is the Christian God which is false even if they don't know what they mean by \"Judaism\" to begin with. I dislike people who say Yahweh or Yah often because they THINK they know and they sometimes also make Christians get rebaptized in the name of Yahshua since some of them believe that they never were saved because they've used a false name. They don't treat it as a different language, they treat it as a religion that supposed to supercede Christianity, and these Messianic type Jews or fake Judahites uses this to feel superior over the goyim Christians. Those that does treat it as a different language when they use Yah over Yeh (both are wrong), they still are obnoxious because they still think they know the right pronunciation when more research says otherwise. They probably believe in the many other various falsehoods of the Talmud and most definitely believe that the Holohoax was real. They also push the four blood moon debunked theory (see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/synchronicity-and-the-ad-hoc-hypothesis/\" target=\"_blank\">Synchronicity and the Ad hoc hypothesis</a>), they're Zionist, they're Freemasons that are mere pawns of Jews, Jesuits, Venetians, they're for the construction of the third temple, and at times overlaps with the various Charismatic movements.\n\nStrange fire is among the Messianics more than it is among those who call upon Jehovah because most non Messianic Christians at least call upon the name of Jesus Christ and don't tell people to reject Jesus Christ for \"Yahshua ha'Mashiach\", but there's still strange fire left among those that call upon Jehovah and even if they call upon Jeh through the name and authority of Jesus Christ there's still a candle lit, not because they invoke that name but because of other reasons like doctrines, their ties with the government, and the structure of the church/kuriakos not being of a community/ecclesia where everyone can be ministers and elders of each other so that they don't need to rely on a mediator that isn't Jesus Christ to help others because they're also ministers as well. We all are called to be ministers, and ministers help people out, but it shouldn't be formed to be of a lordship system as it is in churches/kuriakos. Everyone in these false systems even if they're not tied to the government are in a dangerous occulting cult that hides the truth concerning what the bible teaches plainly for those who has the eyes to see and ears to hear the bible, not me, not others, the bible that speaks for itself yet unfortunately is edited by the Pharisaic scribes here and there. Repent in the name of Jesus Christ in English, Jesus ha'Mashieh in Hebrew, but please, use your mother's tongue, even in Modernized Babylonian Hebrew, but don't say that is biblical Paleo-Hebrew, and don't say the name of God is Yah when even in Babylonian Hebrew, Yah and Yeh are ULTIMATELY INTERCHANGEABLE in Babylonian Hebrew because they don't have vowel points inserted to force one pronunciation and interpretation because it's understood with context just like any language that combines consonants and vowels together in a string. Phoenician/Paleo-Hebrew however, had vowels as LETTERS, like in Greek, not as vowel points inserted in. In Babylonian Hebrew, there could be edits to make it just sounds better than Jeh as Jah in poetic parts of the bible though nobody knows 100% if that's the case, but what is clear is that they had lost their Phoenician based Paleo-Hebrew vowels, therefore, that still doesn't make Je-hovah or Yahweh or Yahshua or anything else okay anymore because we shouldn't be calling God \"Lord\" (which reminds him of Baalim/Ba'ali/Ba'al/IHVH) when he should be our spiritual soulmate, our husband while we're the bride of Christ. Husbands don't marry to be soulmates with their wives, they marry (in Holy Matrimony) to have an helpmate while soul searching is to seek after God and whatever God puts in their heart. Couples should love each other as they love Christ Jesus, but ultimately, there's priorities that is above each other. The bride of Satan is the bride of Ba'al/IHVH, a type of Queen Jezebel and the \"Queen of Heaven\". God doesn't seek his people to call a title as his name that never was his real name. His people (and my people) are destroyed by their lack of knowledge behind this huge deception. Eleleu (God lives, or our God is alive): salvation (soteria), and glory (doxa), and honour (time), and power (dunamis), unto the Lord (Kurios) our God (theos), Jesus Christ. \"Yah\" or \"Jeh\" won't save you, only Jesus Christ can save you from IH/YH and be able to be with IH/YH. Before Abraham, \"I AM\", it was Jesus Christ that was the image of the invisible IH.\n\nA more obscure claim is made, that Hu is the name/word of God tied to the sphinx, Egyptian-Druidism, Tibetian religions, Hinduism, even Rabbinic Judaism because some Rabbinic Jews have a hymn called Adir Hu which the Hu part is God, that the Hu in YesHUa and YaHU and YaHUsHUa is the real name of God, not Yah. There is no biblical Hebrew name of people that starts with \"Hu\" that I'm aware of, and I suspect that this is mere syncretism of the Jews merging and corrupting the name of God with foreign names, unless if you assume that the world's religions copied the proto-Israelites, which if that is case, you are a fool. There's only three absolute conclusions about this article. One is that there is a genuine biblical name of God that doesn't contradict the biblical narrative while the scribes corrupted the text but not enough to completely hide the real name of God. Second is that the Old Testament is corrupted by the Sanhedrin full of blasphemy and syncretism to other deities which some of the stories can only be taken allegorically because it never happened and can't be proven through proper archaeology. Third, there is no genuine name of God although there's genuine biblical titles to describe what He is and authoritative power to those title. Many would believe the latter two conclusions to reject the God of the bible and you can't really blame them, but those who still believe in the fake names of God, they are just really, really, really foolish people.\n\nAnyways, there's a certain point where I've simply just don't care which is to try to uncover biblical Paleo-Hebrew. That task is impossible for now when at first, there needs to be a complete, perfected interlinear that compares all the different source texts and uses the grammatically, contextually, historically accurate forms of every single verse, word, jot, tittle in Babylonian Hebrew first, and then convert it to Paleo-Hebrew. There's also problems in the Greek as well but most of it is translation problems into English, see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/there-is-no-perfect-bible/\" target=\"_blank\">There is no perfect bible</a>.\n\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.jesus-messiah.com/studies/yahweh-full-copy.html\" target=\"_blank\">Yahweh Is A Pagan Name</a>:<blockquote> The Protoindo European god Yayash, Ya√´ or Yave, a protective god whose symbol was a tree, signifying possibly '\"walking\", \"going\", \"a pilgrim\", has been dated back to the Indus River valley, circa 2900 B.C.E. He has been identified with the Turko Syrian Yahveh, a \"sacred animal or organization\".\n\n\"Yahweh appears to have been originally a sky god - a god of thunder and lightning. He was associated with mountains and was called by the enemies of Israel 'a god of the hills'. His manifestation was often as fire, as at Mount Sinai and in the burning bush.\" \"A shorter form, 'Yah', was also used (Exodus 15:2) and some scholars believe that this is the older form, originating in an exclamation to God - 'Yah!' - which came to be accepted as the divine name. Others claim that it is from the root 'hayah', 'to be' or 'to become', and that it meant 'I am that I am' or I will be that I will be'. According to one tradition of the call of Moses, the divine name Yahweh was revealed to him in Egypt: - Great Events of Bible Times\n\n\"Originally, these four consonants [in YHWH] represented the four members of the Heavenly Family: Y represented El the Father; H was Asherah the Mother; W corresponded to He the Son; and H was the Daughter Anath. In accordance with the royal traditions of the time and region, God's mysterious bride, the Matronit, was also reckoned to be his sister. In the Jewish cult of the Cabbala God's dual male-female image was perpetuated. Meanwhile other sects perceived the Shekinah or Matronit as the female presence of God on Earth. The divine marital chamber was the sanctuary of the Jerusalem Temple, but from the moment the Temple was destroyed, the Matronit was destined to roam the Earth while the male aspect of Jehovah was left to rule the heavens alone.\" - Laurence Gardner, Bloodline of the Holy Grail, p. 18\n\nOne of the last items faced concerning the Scriptures is of more recent origin and may account for the vast majority of the linguistic problems that occur. I refer to the reworking of the Hebrew language by the Masorites and Tiberians, between the 6th to 12th centuries C.E. The Masorites were responsible for many of the alterations in the vowels and definitions of the Hebrew words. In that the language had not been a spoken one for at least a hundred years before their endeavor, and not until 1948 was it brought back to life again after not being spoken for nearly 1600 years. This is one reason why meanings of a number of words are unknown thus making it difficult for the modern scholar to rely solely on the Hebrew version as the last authority. This is why the tablets from Ebla are still important as the language is akin to the Hebrew and can give us a clearer understanding of 'uncertain' words.\n- Rev. Robert Palmer (private correspondence).\n\nBecause the Hebrew language does not employ vowels in its written form, the correct pronunciation of the Ineffable Name of God was lost &amp; not rediscovered until about 300AD by the Kabbalists who gave it the title Tetragrammaton, \"the word of four letters,\" &amp; \"the square name,\" or more simply, \"the square.\" At that time the Shem-ha-meforash became represented by the simple form YHVH. -Charles Ponce, Kabbalah, p 175\n\nThis hypothesis is not intrinsically improbable, and in Aramaic, a language closely related to Hebrew, \"to be\" actually is hawa--but it should be noted that in adopting it we admit that, using the name Hebrew in the historical sense, Yahweh is not a Hebrew name. -Ency Brit 11Ed Vol 15 p 321\n\nThe causative theme of hayah is found in no Semitic language, except the late Syriac, but is replaced by that of some other root. Those, therefore who still regard it as causative refer it to hawah, found once in Hebrew in the form hawa \"fell\"; they interpret this as \"he who causes to fall\" (Robertson Smith; cf. Arab. \"haway\". -Ency Brit 1958 Ed Vol 12, p 996\n\nThe oldest exegetes, such as Onkelos, and the Targumim of Jerusalem regard \"Ehyeh\" and \"Ehyeh asher Ehyeh\" as the name of the Divinity.\n-Jewish Ency, Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1925 Ed p 119\n\nToday we cannot know what the original vowels were, but Yahweh is as good as guess as we can make, though other spellings are often used. -Samuel Cartledge, A Conservative Introduction To The Old Testament, p51\n\nIt is perhaps true that God was known only by the word \"Elohim\" from Adam until Abraham. Abraham called God \"Lord,\" ...in Hebrew Adonai (Genesis 18:3). Yet God said in Exodus 6:3 he was revealed to Abraham as Elshaddai and that by his name \"Ehyeh\" as given to Moses at the burning bush, he was not made known to Abraham. It was because Abraham called God \"Adonai\" that the Jews inserted this title meaning \"Lord\" into the scrolls at every instance \"Ehyeh\" was originally written after the revealing of it at the burning bush. There, when Moses asked God about his name, God said it was \"Ehyeh asher Ehyeh\" (translated I Am that I Am): and told Moses, tell them that \"Ehyeh\" (or I AM) has sent you.\n\nSince Moses wrote Genesis after he received the revelation of the new name of \"Ehyeh\" we can assume that Moses inserted into the sacred record the title/name \"Adonai\" or Lord, in such texts as Genesis 4:26. But it must be noted that in Genesis 4:26 the word \"began\" is Strongs #2490 in the Hebrew really means to profane the name of God by calling upon it in blasphemy. This does not mean Enos profane the name of God. It means in his day men began to blaspheme the name of God. The text says: \"then began man to call upon the name of the LORD.\" Properly translated it would say: \"then man blasphemed the name of ADONAI (LORD). First comes the name, men use it in respect, then the evil and wicked begin to blaspheme against it. This is parallel to the name Jesus. First comes the name and men use it with respect, then came the blasphemers against the name which we have had ever since.\n\nNoah had to put up with this prior to the flood. What is being said here is that men from that time, or the time of Enos, began to profane the name of God. Moses called God \"Lord\" (Adonai) here and the word rightly should be \"Lord\" and not as some backward interpolate, YHVH and then Yahweh. There can be absolutely no sacred name used prior to Exodus 3:14-15 other than those names revealed. Those revealed prior to this time were the names \"God\" (Elohim) and \"Elshaddai\" (God Almighty). Any place the title \"Lord\" appears prior to Exodus 3:14-15 is either an interpolation or it must have the meaning of Adonai (Strongs #136, 113). In each case of Abraham using the title \"Lord\" as in Genesis 22:14, the word was not a substitue of the tetragrammaton to then be translated Jehovah or Yahweh. Abraham had to say \"Adonai jireh\" (Lord I see, NOT Jehovah will provide). This is in harmony with the fact that until Moses received the sacred name \"Ehyeh\" at the burning bush, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob knew the Deity only as Elohim-God, Elohim-God-Almighty-Elshaddai, and Adonai (LORD). One fact remaining: the word \"Adonai\" was not a name it was a title therefore God could say to Moses that he was known to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, by the name of Elshaddai, and by his name \"Ehyeh or Ehjeh (the y has a J sound here)\" he was not made known to them (Exodus 6:3).\n\nThe famous Isaiah Dead Sea scroll written in Babylonian Aramaic and shows the interpolation of the tetragrammaton written in the ancient paleo-Hebrew script into a blank space in the original document. This shows us that where the sacred name should have existed or was in the ancient text, blanks were created to insert the false name. Inserting the tetragrammaton into these blanks has beenat a 2,800 year old mystery. Who did it and upon what authority?</blockquote>\n\nThere is a rumor that the DSS is shred up into pieces to be edited by the Vatican to meet their own goals, see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/venetians-infiltrate-jews/\" target=\"_blank\">How did the Venetians infiltrate the Jews?</a>.\n\nSome other sources used to make this article: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wiBtYITrxM\" target=\"_blank\">REVEALED!

If we were to ever substitute the blank space name of God, it should be Jeh or Ehjeh. The English pronunciation of Jesus (/Ààd íiÀêz…ôs/) is the correct pronunciation in Paleo-Hebrew which a letter by letter transliteration would be ŒôŒ∑œÉŒ±œÇ instead of ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ although they're both sound essentially the same since they're both transliterations of the Paleo-Hebrew word: Jehshah that becomes Jesas, assuming that both Paleo-Hebrew and Greek preserve the Phoenician pronunciation of the soft g sound after a vowel for \"I\" that becomes \"J\" and that the \"h\" sound is silent in transliteration while the masuline gender names ends with \"s\". \"Jah\" might had been Jeh but it's derived from IH which is derived not from IHVH but from HIH or Ehjeh but \"Jah\" might be tainted in improper eisegesis and occult syncretization with pagan deities so to avoid confusion, use \"Jeh\" instead. The so called Jews had attempted to ruin the name of God as well as the name of Jesus Christ and had deceived most of the world concerning it to even changing their pronunciation so that they won't utter the real names while substituting them with false pagan names deliberately because they serve Satan after the Zoroastrian model that they've picked up and had integrated into Rabbinism which is now known as \"Judaism\" and \"Zionism\" generally in the modern era, but Satan can't deceived everyone all the time.\n\nüí´<strong>Just a reminder 5 May 15, 2016 @ 14:30</strong>\n\nI'm going to let the dot com site drop so that's NOT going to be my website anymore and it haven't been redirecting to this website and I don't want to pay for two domains anyways.

People are born odd or even of a random number from 1 to near infinity but never 0 or infinity. When people get older, they come in contact with \"operations\" like add, subtract, multiply, divide, squaring, etc., while certain sources of knowledge provides extra numbers that at times comes with operations by default. Whether or not it's good is another matter in itself. A culture where everyone thinks mostly the same are mostly odd or even. Whichever one's the dominate are ironically affected by their \"opposite\". However, for an even to affect odd people or vice versa, they need to have a certain set of operations and numbers that would be significant enough for most of their targeted people to retain without much fear of data loss and misinterpretation of the formula that they're presented to as ameme or saying or concept or whatever is the objective concept that they want to express to their target group to be more like the concept that you shared to them. It needs to bypass some mental firewalls of personal formulas to filter out certain things that the being dislikes, but targeting a group is not the same as targeting an single being, which depending on how specific of a range of a number that you want to change them into that would be unscathed relatively through the random variable numbers and operations of that being's own mental firewall, the formula for it is adjusted and more information that they provide about themselves would be vital to counteract their algorithmic barriers of certain unwanted formulas of unwanted range of numbers that they don't want to become. In a massive group, the entropy or the length of data as words would be shorter than this very sentence but would be around a short sentence or a phrase which in itself without context can go under the radar to people and have them changed to be even or odd through a trojan ideology not properly and explicitly addressed separately. For those that are not easily duped, the amount of words needed grows exponentially, the more specific the target group becomes to find the \"key\" to their minds.\n\nWhen people come together as a couple, if they're a good couple, their number would change and be in each other's range of a mutual identity number that they both can identify as a same number. If they have children, they would seek to formulate the child to be within the range that they want the child to have in every step of childhood that they go through and eventually reach a certain range that they are comfortable letting them go in. Though the child is born odd or even, they are not stuck that way usually unless they were born with a cubic root filter or some other operatives and variables built in that is hard to penetrate, if not, impossible to unlock by mankind that would create a different number to them that you didn't want to express that way to them. This affects even \"smart\" people that are good in some things but very terrible in other things because of how hardwired they are, and it's not really their faults, usually their parents that had injected them a random number generator into them as a vaccine that overflows their processor memory and short circuits certain pathways that prevents them from understanding 3+2=5 despite knowing 2+3=5 as an example. To change a group of evens into odds requires one odd man to come in contact with those evens by adding or subtracting but not multiplying or dividing without some other numbers and operations as memes. To the most resistant one, they require their own special key or formula that involves a trojan concept that attacks the weakest part of their arguments then replacing it with the trojan that later injects the specific number or range of desired numbers to make them change, but even if that fails, when they get enough of the group to change, then the odd one out becomes the remaining resiliant even guy that to them looks like an odd while they still believe that they're the true evens.\n\nMultiple times in everywhere in many forms, people became odd because I've peeled away their layers by looking at the wave of formulas that changes to suit what they want from me. Most of the time, for me, it is pastors, politicians, teachers and women that do these dishonest games in plain sight, hiding their true motives when at the last possible moment as possible. In real life, the masters of this are the \"elites\" whether you call them a ethnic race, ideological race, religious race, commonwealth race, incorporated entity, specific names or titles of individuals or groups, those that knowingly do what they do against people are few yet bountiful, taking advantage over people unfairly and unrighteously using every trick of the book of lies from their hellish father, Satan and his army. Compromises are necessary in certain situations, but not when it makes you a hypocrite that serves two masters. God speaks in positive feedback, top down, honest and the truth. Some people made the grave error treating certain parts of the bible to be taken a certain way that hinders the truth through enforced authority, the abuse of the intellect which in turn creates an abuse of the intuition without intellect and falsely justifies their corruption with bible verses taken out of context as they believe they are above reproof despite evidence on the contrary. They become snooty bastards that pretend to be adopted into God's family yet they treat you like slaves as they push lordship, serfdom, hide what they think and know by pushing works based salvation or Arminianism or \"lordship salvation\" THROUGH THE PASTOR as their MEDIATOR between them and God which is going on even in Protestant denominations while they think that they have the Holy Spirit because of how they appear to seem to be right when they don't see how broken that way of rule is dishonest and a misinterpretation of the bible. Of course it's still possible to trick them under the guise of Christian Humanitarianism with a Calvinist twist into serfdom to pay for a building and for its insurance that burdens the members. It doesn't have to be this false paradigm after the model of the false church of Simon Magus that took over Christianity which its basic structure is to this day being done and taken out of the context of the bible of its true meaning and purpose for that time.\n\nAt first, having an open mind would help, but once you've really truly grasp the Holy Spirit, he will close off lies from coming into the heart, but the mind needs to catch up and unfortunately, it seems like for most people, they aren't running with Christ Jesus in their brains as well as their hearts, which makes the suseptible to certain lies in the mind and to some measure, even in their hearts as well through their personal key that is suited around the type of sin that they have, but people can't make keys to people hearts, only their minds which in their own consent would they might open their hearts as well to legion as the sin of the keymaker transfers to their target as a wrong mindset which then in turn convicts the victim to sin because of their flesh that gets unlocked by the key to sin. People can bind their own flesh that was set free only after they get rid of sin first through repentance which that choice can only be made after God had chosen you first to be saved. Only the Holy Spirit can kick out demons in your soul, but you can train your flesh to sin less, and you do it because God compells you to his will, not to be saved by your own power, not to be saved by power merely borrowed from God to do it yourself. Through the Holy Spirit's power can you bind demons to the abyss that you send them to by name/attribute like gluttony, pornography, greed, specific phobias, and other things that tempts you to sin, but the majority of this problem is to train your own flesh that God had made to sin anyways and put your soul in a corruptible body anyways, and we suffer through this to build character and for whatever reason that's sufficient to God's thinking that's above ours.\n\nIn a world full of odds (if odds are evil), the evens in this example are few and rare, but resilient evens are exponentially rarer, yet at the same time, it's easier to change odds to evens than to change evens to be better evens. Likewise, to evil people, it's easier to corrupt people than to make corrupt people even more corrupt in a higher level through very evil deeds that they don't do directly yet are responsible of causing that effect through multiple proxy layers that can't be traced back to you especially if it's in a memetic form, a mindset propagated among the odds.\n\nThe very act of sharing my thoughts using my knowledge in memetics is in itself applied memetic engineering. Many of the things that I've shared are things that I've already shared previously in some forms. I do it because I believe in it because it's the truth revealed to me, but to others, it's just repetition for those who read my stuff to slowly grasp certain concepts that I've been constantly trying to convey. In one hand, this method is used to break out of certain mindsets but on the other hand, it is used to break down mental barriers which the media, churches, schools, and even your close friends and family uses such tactics against you and sometimes but rarely for your own good. Memetics are not so much concerned about how the mind work although it requires to know how the mind works, it is simply another form of persuasion that can be spread to the point of being shared by others and have people be willing propagators of the concepts that you've shared. It is at times less about arguing about facts and more about being a mental virus that spreads to others easily in the least amount of effort possible for maximum profit. Although censorship methods, media manipulation and propaganda techniques all hand in hand work best used all together, it isn't in itself memetic, especially these days where memes are generated usually within the internet which gets dilluted and overused into the media by lazy writers. That being said, internet censorship methods, internet media manipulation and intenet propaganda techniques still exists and funded by big corporations and governments and secret governments though anyone can do it, as long as you can make it appear to be spreading and increasing in its influence through some social media, which usually works better through shills and of course, more than one guy behind the monitor. Shills aren't necessarily paid, they can be trolls, whiteknights, or a believer of a cause whether controlled or not. Depending on their target audience, it can range from posting image macros with the Impact font used to convey a short point, to a paragraph, to a full blown article, to a book, to multiple books, and so on. Real memes aren't forced per se, but they come from some sort of original content which simply needs to not appear fabricated or too try hard or something. I make it all boring in this article because you're probably not my target audience if you find this boring, but on the other hand, if it wasn't boring, it doesn't mean that it's successful by any means in being spreadable as a meme.\n\nEasy, spreadable memes are simplex in its rhetoric, but it's deceptively rhetorical when those that question it wouldn't know as to the context and the ulterior motive of which said meme are shared. Everything that people share as words needs to be carefully interpreted and examined to what it really means because accepting things at face value accepts the trojan concept behind the seemingly \"rhetorical\" self explanatory concept portrayed within the meme. A truly rhetorical question is a very persuasive question that appears to answer its own question very persuasively asserting a presupposition as the truth. Context is necessary as to what they really mean by their words that they are occulting in plain sight as to what they are covertly conveying. This is not plain speech that they use against you. They are very indirect and their definitions are unclear despite how many different ways that they try to convey to you. In other words, they are dishonest when they are conflicted as to what they want to say against what you want to hear. It's simply sugar coating. If they constantely sugar coat things around you and if you're not stupid as in, they're not dumbing it down for you to might grasp the concepts presented (although simplification of definitions most of the time makes a new different definition that isn't the real definition), they can be dangerous people. When they purposely use fallacious arguments as logical absolutes like making a positive claim while forcing the listener to give out said claim that the speaker needs to give out said claim for himself in order to make it a proper excuse to begin with, they're basically falsifying evidence against you while they're too corrupt to see what they are doing, becoming highly judgemental (in the evil, abusive, unworthy sense of the word), authoritative (in its corrupt form) workers of iniquity. If they seek evil, they will get evil, yet if they are evil, they will get evil from themselves yet say it came from others. When they want others to think you're evil, they do \"astroturfing\". Almost all forms of government (gubernare, mind control, religion is a form of mind control) is abusive mind control against others instead of helping others control their minds for themselves and also together in a fair manner where everyone is both the servant and the minister to servants which they call friends and family.\n\nAgain, Christianity doesn't have to be a hierarchal, abusive system. After all, even the bible is subject to interpretation which is not predetermined by the philosopher kings in a top down system like the EU and general lordship serfdom works as, the people being both elder and leader can self regulate and help each other, not bound to flesh and blood family like the aristocratic oligarchs which is in some ways in between Plato's Republic and Plato's Democracy but Plato's concepts are flawed and based off of Jethro's system which worked but it wasn't good enough, hence the reason why Israel sought to make a king. Do I say that's \"the\" reason why? No, but what I do know is that the Levitical system was not supposed to be limited to the Levites but be extended to every Israelite, not limited to a tribe that's egotistically call themselves to be chosen to rule over people, which through Jesus Christ, that can be possible.

Karlstrom, Emeritus Professor of Geography, March, 2016\n\n‚Ä¶ the individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists.\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover\n\nI have been trying to understand and expose both the 9/11 and man-caused global warming deceptions for many years. To this end, I have spent countless hours researching, writing articles, and compiling pertinent information on my www.911nwo.com, www.naturalclimatechange.us, and www.waterwatchalliance.us websites. I‚Äôve long suspected that one day it might become obvious that both of these terror-deceptions derive from the same source and serve the same basic ends. I also dared to hoped that some day it might be possible to summarize this research in just a few pages. Voila! The following is my first attempt to synthesize the most pertinent conclusions from the above websites:\n\nPertinent Background: Understanding the 9/11, global warming, and many other ‚Äúfalse-flag, state-sponsored, synthetic terror‚Äù frauds requires some understanding of history and the Judeo/Babylonian ‚ÄúSynagogue of Satan‚Äù and its innumerable minions, secret societies, cults, and false religions. It requires some understanding of the modus operandi, that is, the fundamental tricks and lies of the occult Judeo/Babylonian/Satanic system and its main sources of political power, including the Judeo/Babylonian financial system. Those who lack an understanding of these elements may find it difficult, even impossible, to understand the significance and ultimate objectives of the 9/11 and global warming operations.\n\nUnfortunately, in the present climate of ‚Äúpolitical correctness,‚Äù it is almost impossible to even mention the word, Jew. But to properly understand our present plight, we must understand Judaism. Few individuals have studied the New Age Movement and its occult parent, Judaism, more thoroughly than former Air Force Officer, author, and Christian, Texe Marrs. In ‚Äú2015 Summary and Progress Report of 9/11, New (Jew) World Order, and American-Israeli Wars of Aggression; by Texe Marrs‚Äù (on this website; http://911nwo.com/?p=4036), Marrs observes:\n\n‚ÄúThere are insane religious ideologies at play here‚Ä¶ (Jews) believe that their god, in the form of a great serpent, will help them to take over and conquer this world and mend it. (They believe they) are a ‚Äúchosen people‚Äù of God, the ONLY chosen people of God, and (their) most holy books (are) the Talmud and the Kabbalah, which they hold in deeper admiration than even the Old Testament in the Bible‚Ä¶. (And) so they transmit these teachings to their youth, and the youth grow up to believe that:\n\n1) Israel shall be the headquarters of the whole earth.\n2) Israel will have a world court.\n3) It will have judges in the Sanhedrin who will make decisions affecting all of mankind.\n4) Israel will become a ‚ÄúGreater Israel;‚Äù it will expand to take all the Middle East.\n5) Israel will continue to expand to eventually to become the ‚ÄúGreater, Greater Israel.‚Äù And according to the Yinon Plan, it will eventually encompass the entire globe, including the United States.\n6) Jews want to accomplish ‚ÄúTikkun Olam‚Äù (the reordering, the fixing, the mending, the rehabilitation of this planet).\n7) They believe that their god, in the form of a great serpent, will help them to take over and conquer this world and mend it.\n8) So it is a Jewish New World Order that they are expressing.‚Äù\n\nSince Jews are a dominant force in the US and the world today, both financially and politically, and since it is a Jewish New World Order that is being constructed, it is appropriate to recall Charles P√©guy‚Äôs insight:\n\n‚ÄúEverything begins in mysticism and ends in politics.‚Äù\n\nBritish author, Douglas Reed (‚ÄúThe Controversy of Zion‚Äù), cogently observed that:\n\n‚ÄúJudaism is a political program disguised as religion.‚Äù\n\nOf course, various time-lines of historical events can be selected to bolster different conclusions/interpretations of events. In my opinion, the following time-line most accurately explains the true import of the 9/11 and man-caused global warming deceptions:\n\nThe New Testament tells us that the devil tempted Jesus in the desert, offering Him all the kingdoms of the world ‚Äúif thou wilt fall down and worship me.‚Äù Jesus rejected the offer and claimed that he was the Messiah (i.e., the son of God). After the Jews rejected and crucified their Messiah, He rose from the grave. Jesus‚Äô disciples then created an extraordinarily successful religious sect, Christianity. Meanwhile, the leaders of the Pharisaic ‚ÄúSynagogue of Satan‚Äù accepted Satan‚Äôs deal and they have been working to establish Satan‚Äôs kingdom on earth ever since.\n\nThus, we can trace the effort to usher in Satan‚Äôs one-world-government/one-world-religion far back into history. A few pivotal events demonstrate the point. The Council of Nicaea (325 AD) was ‚Äúthe first in a series of many councils that created an orthodoxy for Jewish/Babylonian religious doctrine masquerading beneath Christian verbiage‚Äù (Hendrie, 2012). Thus, Hendrie concludes that the Roman Catholic Church was founded as a crypto- (secret) Jewish institution from its beginnings. In 1534 AD, Ignatius Loyola and Francis Borgia founded the Jesuit Order or ‚ÄúSociety of Jesus‚Äù as a covert military organization within the Catholic Church. Loyola, a crypto-Jew, was a member of Los Alumbrados (‚Äúthe enlightened ones‚Äù), a secret society of Gnostic origins that combined Eastern mysticism with monotheistic religions and mystery religions. The Alumbrados believe(d) that when a person‚Äôs soul reaches a state of ‚Äúperfection‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnion with God,‚Äù they can commit any criminal, immoral and sinful acts without staining their souls. Most Christians regard this form of ‚Äúillumination‚Äù as demonic possession. Loyola and Borgia were commissioned by Alessandro Farnese of the (primarily Jewish) Black Nobility.\n\nOn May 1, 1776, Adam Weishaupt, a (Jewish-born) professor of Law at the Jesuit University of Ingolstadt in Germany, founded the Bavarian Illuminati aka ‚ÄúOrder of Death.‚Äù Funding and support for this Jewish secret society came from the ‚ÄúFrankist‚Äù (Sabbatean-Satanist) ‚ÄúElders of Zion‚Äù and the (Jewish) House of Rothschild. Weishaupt developed a Secret Cell or ‚ÄúPerfect Terrorist‚Äù Cell Model wherein Illuminati initiates reported to a Superior who they did not know. The purpose of the Illuminati was/is to usher in Satan‚Äôs kingdom on earth and to implement one-world (Luciferian) religion/one-world (Luciferian) government. To accomplish this, Weishaupt devised a plan to destroy all religions, nations, monarchies, private property, and the family. At the Council of Wilhelmsbad in 1782, the Illuminati took control of the highest degrees of Freemasonry. They have controlled Freemasonry and a host of related (Satanic) secret societies ever since.\n\nSoon thereafter (1789 and 1787, respectively), the Illuminati and its proxy, Masonry, fomented the bloody French Revolution (‚ÄúReign of Terror‚Äù in which some 40,000 were beheaded and 1-3 million were killed) and spread ‚ÄúSecular Constitutional Democracy‚Äù to America. In 1848, with financial support from the Rothschild family, Karl Marx, a Jewish Satanist, co-authored ‚ÄúThe Communist Manifesto,‚Äù which re-iterated the Illuminati goal to destroy all nations, religions, monarchies, the family, private property, etc. The Jewish Plan for world takeover was again committed to writing in the ‚ÄúProtocols of the Elders of Zion‚Äù at the time of the First Zionist World Congress in 1897. In 1917, Jewish financiers and revolutionaries funded, fomented, and directed the Russian Revolution. During the next seven decades of communism (which is actually Talmudic Judaism), 66 million white Christians were exterminated and Soviet Russia was reduced to a hell on earth. Chinese communism was also created, funded, and directed by Jews; and Jewish-puppet Mao Zedong murdered over 100 million of his own people.\n\nThe Satanic power structure, aka ‚ÄúSynagogue of Satan,‚Äù can be likened to a pyramid with Satan (the all-seeing eye) as the capstone. We can identify the underlying stones as ‚ÄúJews‚Äù (who perennially form a ‚Äúnation with the nations‚Äù fifth column subversive element), the House of Rothschild/‚ÄùKing of the Jews,‚Äù Masonic Orders and other secret societies/cults/false religions, the Vatican, Jesuits, Illuminati, International Bankers/Wall Street/City of London (‚ÄúJew Money Power‚Äù), the Committee of 300 (formerly heads of British East India Company), the Tavistock Institute (world‚Äôs brainwashing center in England), Israel, British Crown, House of Rockefeller and other Satanic Illuminati families, Black Nobility, Council on Foreign Relations (whose membership is over 80% Jewish), United Nations (aka ‚Äúthe world instrument‚Äù), the corporatocracy, U.S. government as directed by CFR, PNAC Zionist ‚Äúneocons,‚Äù and intelligence agencies (CIA, NSA, DIA, ONI, Mossad, MI6, etc.), Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, Nazi International, Communist International, Christian Zionists, the Jew-controlled media and entertainment industries, Mafia, Club of Rome, Opus Dei, New Age Movement, DHS Fusion Centers, most alphabet soup government agencies, etc. Together, these comprise the so-called ‚Äúsecret‚Äù or ‚Äúshadow government‚Äù which has ruled America, especially since the unconstitutional passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.\n\nI must qualify the above generalizations. From my own experience, I know that many outstanding individuals are Catholics and also may be member of other organizations listed above. So how could so many organizations possibly be involved in a nefarious plot to usher in the Satanic kingdom on earth? I have gleaned that: 1) most of these institutions are hierarchical, 2) the leadership of each seems to be involved, to varying degrees, in pedophilia, homosexuality, the occult, etc. and many may also be ‚Äúpossessed,‚Äù 3) lower echelon members of these institutions are controlled through propaganda, mind control, and financial incentives and are carefully screened so that only those who have been properly ‚Äúcorrupted‚Äù rise to positions of power, 4) some kind of ‚Äúhive mind‚Äù communication system(s) is (are) operative within the ‚Äúcult‚Äù aka ‚ÄúJudeo/Masonic/Satanic conspiracy,‚Äù and 5) through possession, ‚Äúpowers and principalities‚Äù may control key individuals and institutions.\n\nThat said, overwhelming evidence indicates the United Nations was/is intended to be the prototypical one-world government; Judeo/Masonic/Satanism is to be the one-world religion; and the New World Order capital is to be in Jerusalem. And Satan‚Äôs principal tools, now as always, are deception and terror.\n\nThe Global Warming Fraud: The man-caused global warming deception, which forms the centerpiece of the phony environmental movement, was initially devised by the ‚ÄúReport From Iron Mountain‚Äù and the Club of Rome think tanks. This fraud provides: 1) pretext for the United Nations to tax and control all economic activity by controlling usage of hydrocarbon fuels, and thus, to become the de facto one world government, 2) the cover story and funding platform for geoengineering/chemtrail/weather warfare depopulation programs now being implemented worldwide by the UN and cooperating governments, and 3) justification for imposition of UN Agenda 21 (‚ÄúAgenda for the 21st century‚Äù aka Agenda 2030), which aims to control all aspects of human life and thus, usher in the ‚ÄúJewish Utopia‚Äù/‚ÄùJewish World Empire‚Äù/‚ÄùTikkun Olam‚Äù (Hebrew for ‚Äúre-invention of the world‚Äù), i.e., the one-world Luciferian government/religion system.\n\nOperation 9/11: The 9/11 false-flag terror attacks were contrived and executed by think tanks and military/intelligence forces on behalf of Israel and other elements of the ‚ÄúSynagogue of Satan.‚Äù Major roles were/are played by the Jewish/American ‚Äúneo-conservatives‚Äù/‚ÄúProject for the New American Century‚Äù (PNAC) group, which has dictated policy to the Bush II and Obama White Houses, as well as high-ranking members of Congress/military/intelligence and other treasonous elements within the U.S. government. 9/11 is still being covered up by the Jew-controlled media and American government. Operation 9/11 serves as pretext for: 1) the phony and endless ‚Äúwar on terrorism‚Äù at home and abroad which is bankrupting America, financially, politically, culturally, and spiritually, 2) prosecuting a series of wars of aggression on behalf of Israel to destroy Arab nations in order to create ‚Äúgreater Israel,‚Äù and 3) imposition of a global counter-intelligence/Gestapo Police State that targets innocent civilians (Christians, dissidents, etc.) for elimination in worldwide gang stalking operations. This global police state is backed by almost limitless funding and is being implemented by innumerable organizations (Dept. of Homeland Security, CIA, FBI, military intelligence agencies and local police (LEIUs)), and vast networks of citizen spies/secret-society spies/sayanim spies and spies from certain religions, cults, etc. The global mind control/gang stalking programs employ sophisticated electronic weapons (HAARP, GWEN Towers, ‚Äúnon-lethal weapons,‚Äù etc). These systems and technologies comprise other powerful means for mass genocide/depopulation.\n\nIt is especially important for citizens to understand that Anglo-American-Israeli elites have long created and controlled their designated ‚Äúenemy,‚Äù ‚Äúterrorist groups,‚Äù etc., including the Nazis, the Mujahideen, the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and now ISIS. It is also essential to understand that there have been many other state-sponsored, synthetic false flag terror events and ‚Äúwar triggers‚Äù in addition to Operation 9/11, including the sinking of the Maine (Spanish-American War trigger), the sinking of the Lusitania (World War I trigger), the Gulf of Tonkin non-incident (Vietnam War trigger), the 7/7 London Bombings, the Oklahoma City bombings, Sandy Hook, the Boston Marathon bombings, the recent Paris and Belgium terrorist attacks, as well as many other staged incidents designed to create fear at home and direct war policies and ‚Äúcounter-terrorism‚Äù against designated enemies at home and abroad.\n\nNew (Judaic) World Order: The objectives of the Luciferian New (Jew) World Order apparently are recently codified in the Georgia Guidestones. Not surprisingly, these 10 objectives bear a strong resemblance to the original Illuminati goals of 1776:\n\n1) ‚ÄúMaintain humanity under 500 million‚Äù (Translation: Depopulation/genocide of 6.5 billion people).\n2) ‚ÄúGuide reproduction wisely, improving fitness and diversity‚Äù (Translation: Eugenics, genetic modification, and transhumanism; elite Jews are to live forever; Gentiles are to be exterminated or become/remain as slaves).\n3) ‚ÄúUnite humanity with a new language‚Äù (Translation: This harkens back to the story of Genesis 11:1-9 in which humanity had one common language and tried to make themselves equal to God by reaching heaven via the Tower of Babel).\n4) ‚ÄúRule passion-faith-tradition with tempered reason‚Äù (Translation: Destroy all religions).\n5) ‚ÄúProtect people and nations with fair laws and courts‚Äù (Translation: Impose Jewish Noahide Laws on all Gentiles in order to control and justify extermination of Christians, etc.).\n6) ‚ÄúLet all nations resolve external disputes in world court‚Äù (Translation: Establish World Court in Jerusalem in which Noahide Laws are enforced for all Gentiles).\n7) ‚ÄúAvoid petty laws and useless officials‚Äù (Translation: No lawyers will be provided for Gentiles. The only penalty for breaking any of the Noahide Laws will be murder by beheading. Decisions of the Jewish Supreme Court (Sanhedrin) will be final, incontestable, and immediately enforced).\n8) ‚ÄúBalance personal rights with social duties‚Äù (Translation: Impose collectivist Jewish values and remove all personal liberty and private property for ‚Äúgoyim‚Äù).\n9) ‚ÄúPrize truth, beauty, love, seeking harmony with the infinite‚Äù (Translation: Everyone is supposed to worship the Judeo-Masonic god, Lucifer).\n10) ‚ÄúBe not a cancer on the earth. Leave room for nature. Leave room for nature‚Äù (Translation: Implement the Agenda 21 ‚ÄúMap of Death,‚Äù which stipulates that over 50% of America is to become off-limits to all human activity. The remainder of humanity will be ‚Äúre-settled‚Äù into ‚ÄúHuman Settlement‚Äù zones as per United Nations edicts. Man is now to be divided into ‚Äútwo species.‚Äù The ‚ÄúChosenites‚Äù script would have the Jews, considered divine, own the entire world. Non-Jews, regarded as animals and beasts by the ‚ÄúChosenites,‚Äù would become slaves of the Jews or be exterminated. Judeo/Masonic/Paganism/nature worship/Luciferianism would replace all other religions.\n\nToday, we are well advanced toward this age-old objective of the establishment of Judeo-Satanic world government/world religion. The first Jesuit Pope, Pope Francis, is now calling for a New World Order and the merger of all religions into a one-world-religion (under the crypto-Jewish Jesuit/Catholic umbrella). He encourages all nations to buy into the global warming hoax and relinquish their national sovereignty accordingly. He tells us that homosexuality is OK and that everyone goes to heaven. Meanwhile, the Jewish Sanhedrin was re-established in 2004 for the first time in 1600 years. And in 2015 and 2016, the U.S. military is conducting massive drills across eight southwestern states. If an appropriate ‚Äútrigger event‚Äù were to occur, such as a nuclear attack, a financial collapse, a natural disaster, etc., while these drills are operational, the drills could ‚Äúgo live‚Äù (just as 9/11, 7/7, and many other ‚Äústate-sponsored terror events‚Äù ‚Äúwent live‚Äù), thus possibly initiating the second (Rothschild-fomented) American civil war and perhaps World War III. Today, American troops and military advisers are in about 150 (of 195) nations. And the major contenders in the current Presidential race are either Jews (Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders) and/or Masons and Zionists (Donald Trump and Ted Cruz).\n\nChristian authors, such as Texe Marrs, have applied the metaphor from Revelation, observing that America has become the ‚Äòbeast‚Äô whereas Israel/world Jewry is the ‚ÄòHarlot,‚Äô ‚ÄòMystery Babylon the Great,‚Äô that rides the ‚Äòbeast.‚Äô Certainly, Biblical prophecy and the ancient plan of secret societies seem very close to being fulfilled‚Ä¶\n\nSummary: I realize that most humanists and secularists might regard the foregoing analysis as implausible, impossible, and perhaps even loony. However, I would emphasize that historical evidence and commentary supporting these conclusions are so voluminous that it appears they coincide with what we experience as ‚Äúreality.‚Äù Historically, the modus operandi of Satan and his minions, human and (apparently) otherwise, is to use deception and terror to manipulate and ultimately to destroy humanity. And just as Jesus characterized the Pharisees, modern Judea/Israel, animated by the same dark ideologies, are also well-described as ‚Äúchildren of the devil‚Äù/‚Äùchildren of hell‚Äù who are now driving the world toward their apocalyptic vision of ‚ÄúTikkun Olam‚Äù or ‚ÄúJewish Utopia.‚Äù As one of innumerable historical commentaries (See ‚ÄúQuotes on Zionism‚Äù under the heading: The Controllers on this website), the 1890 (Catholic) book, ‚ÄúThe Jewish Question in Europe,‚Äù states:\n\n‚ÄúWho then, with dispassion, having investigated the facts and documents, cannot but conclude that there has never been ambition more mad and tenacious, and none more frankly stated as that of the Jews. They arrogate to themselves the conquest of the world, of reigning over all the nations by overthrowing them, of subjugating all the peoples to themselves. And they appropriate the right to stake their claim on all of the blessings of the universe, their legitimate birthright given them by God. It is amazing to read and hear about this terrible challenge by a fistful of men, about 8 million of them, who course among the five hundred million others, and who seriously wish to enslave them, and dream of doing so!‚Äù\n\nIndeed, the Jew‚Äôs own most holy book, the Babylonian Talmud, states:\n\n‚ÄúWhen the Messiah returns, every Jew will have 2800 slaves.‚Äù (Simeon Haddarsen, fol. 56-D)\n\nIn light of these and many, many other facts and insights, it is clear that Operation 9/11 was a false-flag, state-sponsored, synthetic terror event designed to initiate World War III and usher in the new Satanic/Jewish World Order/Antichrist Kingdom. Meanwhile, the global warming deception is pretext for empowering the United Nations to become the prototype world government and occult religious system that would completely re-structure and control all human activity as per Agenda 21 (aka Agenda 2030). Both of these elaborate deceptions serve the Jewish/Illuminati Plan for world conquest.\n\nDouglas Reed observed in his 1956 classic, ‚ÄúThe Controversy of Zion,‚Äù not only that ‚ÄúJudaism is a political program disguised as religion,‚Äù but also that communism and Zionism are two aspects of the same diabolical plan; with communism designed to destroy all the Gentile nations and Zionism designed to strengthen Israel to become the one remaining world state. Today, I suggest that the phony ‚Äúwar on terrorism‚Äù and UN Agenda 21 both advance this identical historic plan.\n\nConclusions and Solutions: Based on the voluminous information compiled on my three websites (911nwo.com, naturalclimatechange.us, and waterwatchalliance.us) and elsewhere, the above connections and conclusions seem indisputable, irrefutable, and ineluctable. That‚Äôs the ‚Äúbad news,‚Äù at least in the short term. And yet the New Testament tells us (365 times!) to ‚Äúfear not;‚Äù and Jesus said: ‚ÄúTake courage, it is I. Do not be afraid‚Äù (Matthew 14:27). John 4:4 assures Christians: ‚ÄúYe are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.‚Äù And John 3:8 assures us that Jesus Christ came to destroy the works of the devil. And Ephesians 5:11 admonishes us: ‚ÄúHave no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.‚Äù Clearly, for individuals, the moment of choice seems to be at hand. We can choose to follow Jesus Christ to eternal life or we can follow the ‚Äúworld (Satanic) system‚Äù to eternal perdition.\n\nOur individual choices can affect the fate of nations and other institutions which today, also face the moment of choice. If our nation would survive and prosper today, it must find ways to expel and/or curtail these diabolical Judeo-Masonic influences. I suggest this might be accomplished by: 1) holding on to our Christian faith and our God-given, inalienable rights as spelled out in the Bill of Rights of our U.S. Constitution, 2) canceling the multi-trillion dollar national debt now owed to private central banks as ‚Äúodious debt‚Äù and replacing our current money system with a Constitutionally-based system, 3) repealing the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the National Security Act of 1947, the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, and the host of executive orders that now enable Presidents to usher in Martial Law virtually at their own whim, 4) withdrawing from the United Nations, 5) eliminating and outlawing all Jewish lobby groups as well as Jewish ownership of the media/entertainment industry, 6) stopping all foreign aid to Israel, and 7) bringing American troops home from military campaigns that advance the Judaic/Israeli goal of Jewish world government.\n\nReferences\n\nHendrie, E., 2012, Solving the Mystery of Babylon the Great; Tracking the Beast from the Synagogue to the Vatican, Great Mountain Publishing, 373 pp.\n\nReed, D., 1985, The Controversy of Zion, Veritas Publishing Company (Pty) Ltd., Midland DC, Western Australia, 587 pp.</blockquote>\n\nHow unfortunate that he doesn't mention much about the Black Nobility and the Venetians, and he's behind in certain aspects of the whole Jesuit and Jewish conspiracy that I've already covered but it's a good summary of basically one year of my early understanding concerning the Jesuits. Anyways, let's talk about some horrible things, combining agendas. I'm going to use mostly health related issues to make it easier for me to make some examples.\n\nChemtrails + Vaccines as in, the stuff in vaccines but in aerosol form = Vaxxtrails (Even Chuck Norris knows that it exists)\nChemtrails + Candida = Cancertrails (Candida causes cancer)\nChemtrails + GMO seeds + \"Agent Orange\" Herbicide = All in one GMO seed planting, soil destroying terraformation Chemtrails\nChemtrails + Fluorine = OF2 Chemtrails\nChemtrails + DDT = Poliotrails (DDT toxicity causes Polio)\nChemtrails + UFOs = Stealth spraying using cloaking devices\nChemtrails + blue paint = Invisible Chemtrails\nInvisible Chemtrails + UFOs = Nearly foolproof invisible spraying from cloaked aircraft when uncloaked becomes a UFO to create cognitive dissonance for Alien Agenda which leads to the False Messiah Agenda\nGMO food + Vaxxtrails = Worse than dog shit\nVaccine injected GMO food from All in one GMO Terraformation Chemtrails = Even worse than cat shit\n\"Soylent Green\" soil made GMO foot + Vaxxtrail = Why\n\"Soylent Green\" + GMO + Vaccines = Is this some kind of a sick joke to you?\nVaccines + Fluoride = Synergestic overall poisoning\nVaccines with human tissue, DNA + GMO DNA = Increased rates of permanent de novo mutations\nVaccines with human tissue, DNA + Candida = Cancer causing vaccines\nVaccines + DDT = Polio causing vaccines\nInvisible Vaxxtrails with human tissue, DNA + Fluoride + Candida + DDT + UFO = \"Very bad\"\n\"Very bad\" + metals + HAARP based tech = \"Worse\"\nInvisible Vaxxtrails + specific or all destructive bacteria/virus/fungus/GMO/Xenobiological weaponry = \"Also very bad\"\n\"Also very bad\" + metals + HAARP based tech = \"Even worse\"\n\"Also very bad\" + mandated vaccines to combat \"Also very bad\" = \"Also even worse\"\n\"Even worse\" + UFO = \"Even more worse\"\n\"Also even worse\" + UFO = \"Also even more worse\"\n\"Also even more worse\" then thermonuclear detonation = \"Can it get even worse?\"\n\"Can it get even worse?\" + 2050 Planet X/Nibiru water level rising = \"How can this even happen?\"\n\"Soylent Green\" + GMO = junk food with flavor additives derived from aborted fetus cells from abortion clinics and as well as other things salvagable from a human corpse\n\"Soylent Green\" + recycled human feces + GMO + Xenobiological pathogen = \"Yes it can get much worse than this\"\nChild Protection Services stolen, Satanic Ritual Abused, sexually violated children's unharvested leftover body parts as \"Soylent Green\" + Chemtrails = Soylent Green rain (Yes I'm implying that any country's \"Child Protection Services\" equivalent is a part of the Satanic Black (as in Black Nobility, evil) Pedophilia Network)\nChild Protection Services stolen, Satanic Ritual Abused, sexually violated, vaccinated, tumor filled, drugged and poisoned children's unharvested leftover body parts as \"Soylent Green\" who were fed \"Soylent Green\" as well as GMOs and feces + Invisible Vaxxtrails + UFO + metals + depleted uranium + GMO seeds + HAARP based tech + specific or all destructive bacteria/virus/fungus/GMO/Xenobiological weaponry = \"You should stop giving them any more bright ideas\"\n\nAt a certain point, the above examples went out of hand, but who knows, it's relatively feasible for them to do. You do know that humanure is being used in China and in some places in S. Korea, right? There are UFOs cloaking as airplanes, and most chemtrails are in fact, man made xenobiological pathogenic substances that acts like bacteria, virus, fungus yet not a part of the natural DNA or RNA, rather, XNA and other forms of man made nucleic acids, which these are not GMOs but they're worse and eventually, there could serve as a link towards transhumanism, hijacking the body to be hooked up through xenobiological interfacing the \"mothership\" via Wi-Fi. Xenobiology is not \"Aliens\", they're man made. If there are real aliens, they could had wiped us out in a flash so stop worring about what's out there.\n\nChemtrails causes global cooling which causes the earth to heat up its core which in turn creates more earthquakes and potentially triggering Yellowstone's supervolcano to erupt to elongate the earth's cycle of rising and falling temperatures that's only slightly being affected by mankind but is mostly affected by the solar flux input received from the sun that is affected by its place in the solar system whether if it's moving into a cool or warm zone, and then Planet X/Nibiru would move the earth's bulge of its oceans all over in low elevation areas predicted around 2050 while slowly its effects being increasingly felt around 2030, Deep Underground Millitary Bases are already made to hide just in case of these situations, which they could blame the rising of the sea level to the Aliens which then the Alien Agenda would happen to destroy all religions and then push the False Messiah Agenda. World War III could happen, but it doesn't need to happen, but if it does happen, these agendas won't happen, it would be the immediate extinction of the human race, sending everyone into a Post Nuclear Apocalyptic world. In the mean time, the New World Order is already implementing softkill programs as well as direct psychological operations to replace most of Christianity by replacing the White race with Black and Arabic people and the religion of Islam while Asians and Latin Americans succumb to Communism which is a Venetian-Jewish-Jesuit-Masonic invention and then implement the UN police state and the destruction of borders, everyone being autistic and working for virtual currency while the robots does the manual labor, then eventually, through the False Messiah, every Jew would get their own permanent slaves and rule over the world, keeping all the races mixed so that they lose their sense of identity as well as culture and religion. False flags would only be robbing people of their privileges of their perceived \"freedom\" that they never had to start with, while causing controlled economic breakdowns in countries that they dislike as well as having wars and funded revolutions. False flags could also push RFID tech into the vaccines itself, or even as Vaxxtrails with Xenobiological pathogens that attaches itself and the RFID chip into the body as one hybrid entity. It's so easy to combine certain tricks once you know a good bulk of them, though some of them have yet to be done, from the looks of it, they're exploring all options.\n\nSatan's plans all melt into one central goal, but God is real, God is in control, he will not let Satan's goals come to pass.\n\nüí´<strong>How did the Venetians infiltrate the Jews? May 25, 2016 @ 08:15</strong>\n\nTaken from http://one-heaven.org/canons/sovereign_law/article/87.html and http://one-heaven.org/canons/sovereign_law/article/88.html (emphasis added):<blockquote>Article 87 - Talmud\n\nCanon 6052\n\nThe Talmud is the central text of the Aryan Civilization of UrAn (Iran) and the first major text written in Ebri (Hebrew), commissioned to the Babylon Yahsiva (Academy) by BalKhan Baba Rabban and first published no earlier than 300 CE.\n\nCanon 6053\n\nThe name Talmud comes from the Persian tal meaning ‚Äúmany, numerous‚Äù and mud meaning ‚Äúto cry, to groan or call‚Äù. Hence the literal translation of the word is ‚Äúto cry or call many times to gad (god)‚Äù.\n\nCanon 6054\n\nThe structure of the Talmud as first introduced by BalKhan Baba Rabban from 300 CE included two (2) major works being the original sacred scripture of the Mizdah and the addition of the Gamara:\n\n(i) The sacred law of the Aryans originally introduced by ArdaShah I (224-244 CE) was called ‚Äúthe mirror of way of god‚Äù or ‚ÄúSisa SedaRam‚Äù and ‚Äúgood deeds; reward‚Äù or ‚ÄúMizdah‚Äù comprising of six (6) ‚Äúbooks of worship‚Äù or ‚Äúseyda‚Äù being Seeds, Festivals, Women, Damages, Holy Things and Purities; and\n\n(ii) The new scriptures added by BalKhan Baba Rabban were called Gamara, with gam meaning \"step to, come to\" and ara meaning \"prayer, praise (to gad). The Gamara was the instruction to the new priests called ‚ÄúRabbi‚Äù on how to interpret the Mizdah.\n\nCanon 6055\n\n<strong>The Talmud created at the Babylon Yahsiva (Academy) by BalKhan Baba Rabban is properly called the ‚ÄúBabylonian Talmud‚Äù and was the only version of Talmud created until the 16th Century when the Venetians through the Jesuits created a hybrid document integrating the Mithraic-Iudaic laws of the Septuaginta to create the ‚ÄúJerusalem Talmud‚Äù.</strong>\n\nCanon 6056\n\n<strong>The section of more modern Talmud known as the ‚ÄúTosfefta‚Äù meaning ‚Äúadditions‚Äù are wholly fraudulent changes, first printed in the 13th Century in Venice and Vienna.</strong>\n\nCanon 6057\n\n<strong>The section of more modern Talmud known as the ‚ÄúMasechtot Qetanot‚Äù meaning ‚Äúminor tractates‚Äù were created and first printed in the 13th Century in Venice, yet fraudulently claimed to have been created during an earlier era at a different location.</strong>\n\nCanon 6058\n\n<strong>The section of more modern Talmud known as the ‚ÄúHalakha‚Äù meaning ‚Äúpronunciation‚Äù are wholly fraudulent changes, first printed in the 16th Century in Venice and London in order to integrate the Septuaginta via the six hundred and thirteen (613) public laws, fifty (50) private laws and three (3) secret oaths that make up the claimed ‚ÄúMosaic Law‚Äù into the Talmud in what was then called the ‚ÄúJerusalem Talmud‚Äù.</strong>\n\nCanon 6059\n\nThe Talmud was purposely designed to introduce a number of ‚Äúinnovations‚Äù that changed the religion of Manes when it was first published by BalKhan Baba Rabban from 300 CE:\n\n(i) The new sacred text was no longer written in Persian, but a secret code language known as Ebri (Hebrew) for which only a few at the Babel (Babylon) Academy knew how to read and speak. This closed down direct access to scripture and ensured tight control over the faithful; and\n\n(ii) A new priest class known as the Rab and ‚ÄúRabbi‚Äù meaning ‚Äúmaster, teacher of gad‚Äù were commissioned as the only ones to translate the scripture from Ebri (Hebrew) to the people; and\n\n(iii) The deity of worship of Manes, being Seytan (Satan) was renamed Sabaoth, or ‚ÄúLord of Hosts‚Äù and his name and identity was forbidden to be spoken or revealed, except by the most senior priests. Instead, the common people were to use the word ‚Äúgadan‚Äù or ‚Äúgad‚Äù meaning ‚Äúone who overpowers, defeats, injures or rapes‚Äù; and\n\n(iv) Faithful were required to now kneel on a prayer rug and bow down in daily prayers and worship the ruins of Babel (Babylon) as the original home of ‚Äúgad‚Äù or ‚Äúgod‚Äù, praising his name; and\n\n(v) Devout were required to now wear a knitted woollen skull cap called a ‚Äúkapi‚Äù from the ancient word for ‚Äúmonkey‚Äù to identify themselves as servants of ‚Äúgad‚Äù or ‚Äúgod‚Äù and especially during prayers and ceremonies; and\n\n(vi) Slaves and bonded workers (boda/bode) do not really possess a soul (Ahu-Man), so they do not reincarnate. Therefore, boda/bode may be lawfully treated as less than domestic/farm animals. Only Hu-Man (human) possess an animal soul and Ba-Man (brahman) who possess a superior spiritual soul reincarnate.\n\nCanon 6060\n\nAs followers of the Talmud knowingly or unknowingly worship Seytan (Satan) as the Father of Darkness, those who worship using the Talmud are by definition in complete dishonor with Divine Law, Natural Law and the Divine Creator and deliberately prone by design to ‚Äúextreme mental illness‚Äù.\n\nCanon 6061\n\n<strong>In the 16th Century, the Venetian-Magyar decided to undertaken a plan to reunite all Samaritan (Khazar) diaspora under their control through the Jesuits in the design of the Jerusalem Talmud and the introduction of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) as a translation of the unholy Septuaginta into Hebrew. However, the plan did not fully succeed.</strong>\n\nCanon 6062\n\n<strong>In the 17th Century, the Venetian - Magyar decided to create a new cult through Ottoman influence known as the Sabbateans, also known as the AshkeNazi by completely re-writing and corrupting the original Babylonian Talmud into the most disgusting, unrecognizable, perverse, spiritually dishonorable work in history in order to create a cult of extreme sociopathic illness. The plan worked and the AshkeNazi version of the Babylonian Talmud now dominates the ‚ÄúJewish faith‚Äù with obscene and fraudulent references such as:\n\n(i) In the 17th Century AshkeNazi corruption of the Babylonian Talmud version of Moed Kattan the words that if a Jew is tempted to do evil he should ‚Äúgo to a city where he is not known and do the evil there‚Äù; and\n\n(ii) In the 17th Century AshkeNazi corruption of the Babylonian Talmud version of Eurbin that whosoever disobeys the rabbis ‚Äúdeserves death and will be punished by being boiled in hot excrement in hell‚Äù; and\n\n(iii) In the 17th Century AshkeNazi corruption of the Babylonian Talmud version of Baba Kamma and commended by Rabbi even today that Jews may use lies and subterfuge to ‚Äúcircumvent a Gentile‚Äù; and\n\n(iv) In the 17th Century AshkeNazi corruption of the Babylonian Talmud version of Sanhedrin that if a non Jew hits a Jew, ‚Äúthe gentile must be killed‚Äù and that a Jew ‚Äúneed not pay a gentile the wages owed him for work‚Äù; and\n\n(v) In the 17th Century AshkeNazi corruption of the Babylonian Talmud version of Sanhedrin that a Jew ‚Äúmay have sex with a child as long as the child is less than nine (9) years old‚Äù and a Jew ‚Äúmay marry a three (3) year old girl‚Äù; and\n\n(vi) In the 17th Century AshkeNazi corruption of the Babylonian Talmud version of Soferim as a solemn rule for all Rabbi that ‚Äúeven the best of the gentiles should all be killed.‚Äù; and\n\n(vii) In the 17th Century AshkeNazi corruption of the Babylonian Talmud version of Baba Kamma that if a non Jew hits a Jew if ‚Äúan ox of an Israelite gores an ox of a Canaanite there is no liability‚Äù but ‚Äúif an ox of a Canaanite gores an ox of an Israelite‚Äù then ‚Äúthe payment is to be in full‚Äù; and\n\n(viii) In the 17th Century AshkeNazi corruption of the Babylonian Talmud version of Baba Kamma and Baba Mezia that ‚Äúif a Jew finds an object lost by a gentile it does not have to be returned‚Äù and in Sanhedrin that ‚Äúwhat a Jew steals from a gentile he may keep‚Äù; and\n\n(ix) In the 17th Century AshkeNazi corruption of the Babylonian Talmud version of Sanhedrin that when a Jew murders a non-Jew, there ‚Äúwill be no death penalty‚Äù; and\n\n(x) In the 17th Century AshkeNazi corruption of the Babylonian Talmud version of Yebamoth that ‚Äúall gentile children are animals‚Äù and in Abodah Zarah that ‚Äúgentile girls are in a state of filth from birth‚Äù; and\n\n(xi) In the 17th Century AshkeNazi corruption of the Babylonian Talmud version of Yebamoth ‚Äúa woman who had intercourse with a beast is eligible to marry a Jewish priest.

Some of the Venetian Black Nobility have Jew blood in them, which the House of Hanover and the House of Habsburg were \"infiltrated\" by Ashkenazi Jews pretending to be Germans, Crypto-Jew Black Nobility. Some so called Jew genes are actually Norman genes, the elite Jews and the Black Nobility are in an alliance together. As revealed in <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-chosen/\" target=\"_blank\">The Chosen</a>, Venice was a Jewish State, so early on, the Ancient Roman Aristotelian Synarchist Oligarchal Nobility were not only exposed to the Jews, they had much time race mixing and being \"the chosen ones\" through blood when those Jews are not even Judahites as I've exposed here: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-two-biggest-lies-concerning-the-jews-and-other-myths/\" target=\"_blank\">The two biggest lies concerning the \"Jews\" and other myths</a> and here: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/partial-preterism/\" target=\"_blank\">Partial Preterism</a>. They compliment each other in their own different forms of the same evil.\n\nTaken from <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160331195230/http://www.johndenugent.com:80/the-norman-conquest-gives-england-to-jews/\" target=\"_blank\">The Norman Conquest gives England to Jews</a>:<blockquote>By 1694, 400 years after the Expulsion, the Jews were so firmly back in the saddle, having also come back from Holland as illegal immigrants in the 1680s, one by one, family by family, on ships, that they then could then found and control the Bank of England. As Lord Rothschild (Mayer Amschel Bauer Rothschild) infamously said: Give me control of a nations currency and I care not who makes its laws.\nInterestingly, the Human Genome Project (HGP) has been shedding light on both Norman and Jewish genes as they moved into England. The HGP has been mapping all the genes of the human races as they spread out over the world (starting with the genes of scientist Craig Venter and Nobel Laureate James Watson of DNA fame). One can clearly see the Norwegian (Norman) gene R1b1b2a1a1d moving from southern Norway down to Rouen, in Normandy, France, and then going up across the English Channel and into the eastern half of England.\nOne can also see the Jewish gene, the so-called Ashkenazi-Norman gene, labeled R1b1b2a1a4, on the move, a gene nicknamed Ivanhoe, evidently after Sir Walter Scotts judeophilic novel.\nThis gene came from western Ukraine to the Baltic, through Germany and stopped at Rouen, Normandy, France, before moving to the northern half of England and into Scotland.\nAs a result of these genes and their bearers, from 1066 on, English history changed, and not just in calling swineflesh by the French word pork. It became a land, as Shakespeare wrote, of a pound of flesh‚Ä¶.. rule by usurers.</blockquote>\n\nUpdate: It seems as though The Unhived Mind had copy pasted the original article here: <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/UHM/how-did-the-venetians-infiltrate-the-jews/\" target=\"_blank\">How did the Venetians infiltrate the Jews?</a> so I've decided to clarify where I get my claim about some Norman genes being identified as a Jewish/Ashkenazi/German gene so a Norman-Germanic gene, which Ashkenazi Jews primarily identify as being genetically Germanic than anything else as they should be because they're a proselyte, dilluted race while the Sephardic Jews are less dilluted but they're technically judaized Samaritans, and the nine and half (half of the tribe of Levites) tribes were not \"lost\", they were no longer a part of God's kingdom as they became one with the surrounding pagan countries.\n\nüí´<strong>The rudimentary constituence of Satan's cults May 30, 2016 @ 14:45</strong>\n\nEveryone needs to get back to the basics and start with the transcendental <a href=\"http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/\" target=\"_blank\">proof that God exists</a> which is the only God, all other \"gods\" are idols. Most that call themselves Christian that can't pass that website's test honestly are probably not Christian to begin with. Any sort of evidence and bible study can only be dealt with among the believers that had repented of their sins, the repentence that can only be done through God by his grace chooses to revive what was dead in total depravity to give his sheep (goats can't turn into sheep did you know, unless you believe in instantaneous evolution) the heart to be able to choose to follow him through the Holy Spirit which the gift of God comes before repentence can even be done to receive the gift of God which that action comes not from you but from God through the blood of Christ through you. A dead man can't revive himself to take a free potion of life. If you go out of order, you are still under total depravity, that work is not with the sound faith, you open up yourself to a completely destructive systematic theology that give up their religous ground for the very things that it believes in. Through presuppositional apologetics can systematic theology can work to the point of being able to correct canons and other writings in an unbroken line of logic that comes from God, not from man's fallacious reasoning without the light of God illuminating the world through him that is the truth and is above the truth, creating the truth, logic, and so on. Reading from Genesis to Revelation multiple times per year without having a basic outline of systematic theology through presuppositional apologetics will make it hard for you to even truly grasp <a href=\"https://carm.org/basic-christian-doctrine\" target=\"_blank\">basic Christian doctrine</a>.\n\nIt is through this which I've come to know that many things that Calvinism (AKA: the Reformed Faith) is about makes sense in seeking to be in order instead of being out of order, but people seem to take things out of context, out of order to disprove the things that are biblical about Calvinism as the unbiblical, unjustified, cherrypicked, redefined form of Calvinism that those who truly \"get it\" would reject like the claim that people can know 100% that they are \"saved\" when God doesn't give out 100% guarantee certificates while many proponents against Calvinism that call themselves Christians think that they can obtain such guarantees through works out of the order that the bible clearly states, but they're usually willingly rejecting the truth when they read bible verses that's taken in order in context that is against their out of order faith. Saying a prayer doesn't save people. If people can be good enough to go to heaven, then there's no reason to believe in Jesus Christ our savior and renders salvation through faith alone, grace alone, to naught. Those who are \"Presuppositionalists\" are not confined within \"Calvinism\" and at times mentions the five solas in its proper context, and yes even some Lutherans are anti Arminianism, but the five solas are at times, used out of order (of course epistemologically speaking) by Lutherans in debates. So called classical apologetics and even evidential apologetics give up their epistemological certainty for ontological uncertainty, starting from assuming things that are not to work their way into things that are through evidence and through extra biblical (non biblical) sources. In doing so, they had already given ground to lies to grow and tip the scales being weighted by how much more one side can dish out their evidence of their own presuppositions. Another way of understanding this is that they willing let themselves be dragged down to their foolishness and through foolishness trying to debate out of foolishness in foolish terms and implications when ultimately, they know their worldview better than the classical and/or evidential apologist as they entertain their foolishness which to a fool is wisdom.\n\nConcerning <a href=\"http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/other-worldviews/\" target=\"_blank\">other worldviews</a>, knowing the <a href=\"https://carm.org/cults-outline-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">basic outline of a cult</a> would help, as well as learning what they believe in will help one understand them enough to refute them through presuppositional apologetics of course. The more obscure the cult, the less information about them is out available in the internet, but they should be able to properly express their beliefs enough to make it clear enough to differentiate themselves by their own definitions from other religions but that doesn't mean that they aren't lying or that they're generally the same but with a different label, and so on. I say that most cults have some sort of Arminianism derivative. That's a generalization from my own observation of many cults. It's my own conclusion based off of their claims, some of which I've asked them directly as to what they believe, but most of the time, epistemologically, they contradict somewhere yet they see it as a necessity when it doesn't have to be as such in their foolishness.\n\nHere's some more generalizations concerning Satan's cults. The beliefs of the inner circle of the cult tends to be different from the outer circle of the cult. They tend to gradually tell you what they believe in while slowly changing your opinions enough through propaganda and using a holy text, sometimes deliberately misinterpreted. They avoid sharing what they truly believe in openly. They make you invest money to gain any footing among them. They do good works yet say damnable heresies the longer you're with them. They throw red herrings at you from avoiding confrontation. They have a top down lordship structure of systematic control over you. They make threats as if they're valid arguments to their corrupted conscious. They can't take any form of constructive criticism. They play the role of the spiritual mediatrix in place of Jesus Christ as if you can't go to God without Jesus but through that mortal. They can't properly conduct disputes righteously since one side is always more powerful and condescending within the cult. They are ecumenical in their stance, pushing pluralism, a heretical form of religious inclusivity allowing other cult people like Jews (see <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-two-biggest-lies-concerning-the-jews-and-other-myths/\" target=\"_blank\">The two biggest lies concerning the \"Jews\" and other myths</a>), Reiki masters (most likely a part of a witch coven), Swedenborgians (believes in Arianism, Open Theism, Arminianism, also have Kabbalistic influences), Ebionites, Gnostics, Arianists, Arminianists (can degenerate into Semipelagianism, Open Theism, Process Theology, Liberal Naturalism, Naturalism, Empiricism, Atomism, Materialism, Agnosticism, Atheism, Nihilism and from Nihilism, any stupid cult), Roman Catholics (actually works salvation and paganism), non believers, et cetera, in corrupting the body with sin while pushing exclusivity through works meriting for salvation. They ignore what you said would happen while later it actually happens yet they blame you for their own fault of the dangers of an ecumenical policy, the dangers of rejecting the Trinity, the dangers of pushing Arminianism. They use doublethink as well as groupthink. They do all the bad stuff as partially covered in <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/odds-and-evens/\" target=\"_blank\">Odds and Evens</a>. They pretend to have it all figured out when they actually make stuff up in the way and find some random verse implying that they're justified in their actions yet assert that they're \"THE ONLY WAY\".\n\nIn conclusion, to stand firm against them is to first have God change your heart so that you might be able to genuinely repent (which only God knows if you had truly repented), then learn presuppositional apologetics, learn the five solas and TULIP, learn basic Christian doctrine, read but also understand and believe in the bible, use lexicons, dictionaries, law dictionaries, and interlinears, use non transcendental evidence only among those that believe in the same Christian God in bible studies, formulate a systematic theology based on presuppositional apologetics in an epistemological sense as a Christian. The steps after that would be about joining or forming a real ecclesia/community of saints but if you find yourself in a cult, you should know what to do when the time comes.\n\nNote: Ontology does not presuppose epistemology as the fools claim, but as a Christian, God presupposes nature, God created nature, what he says is the truth, therefore, he presupposes ontology, epistemologically speaking. That is why transcendental proof derived from presuppositional apologetics is necessary. When it comes to matters of history, though there are relative interpretations there can be a unified, epistemological explanation to make sense of ontological, relativistic interpretations of history. Those that plead for an ontological approach of apologetics reject the epistemological, transcendental reality and truth of this world to be from the Christian God solely. An appeal to naturalism comes from the ontological explanation of reality. Natural law that rejects what the bible says is not of the nature of God's divine, family, royal, ecclesiastical law. Natural law that is outside the jurisdiction of God's Divine law through pretend, temporary means since Satan does not own God's Divine law, only the fall from Divine law as Natural law. It is from this so called Natural law where many religions formulate their \"golden rule\" outside of God's jurisdiction but again, it's still in God's dominion, he simply didn't revoke Satan's power completely yet but he had and will destroy evil once and for all.\n\nüí´<strong>The Unhived Mind IV Category Description List Jun 1, 2016 @ 10:43</strong>\n\nThis is from The Unhived Mind IV website as of June 1, 2016 in the info sections that each has various categories of which when one selects a category, it links to the selected category page and shows a description about the category along with articles pertaining to the category.\n\nCompare to <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-unhived-mind-iii-category-description-list/\" target=\"_blank\">The Unhived Mind III Category Description List</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/vaccination-inquisition/\" target=\"_blank\">Vaccination Inquisition</a>\n\nVaccinations don‚Äôt cure disease and instead they create disease, chronic-illness, genetic changes and death. Vaccines are used as a tool for depopulation, genetic code changing and dependency on pharmaceutical drugs due to chronic illness as a result of the injection and all under the disguise of false help. Make sure you‚Äôre aware of the Simian Virus 40 which is a carcinogenic viral agent that causes cancer and its present in Salk polio vaccines among the other one-hundred and fifty other contaminants just in one vaccine. Vaccines are creating numerous crippling illnesses now even from birth onwards and they‚Äôre certainly used in the dumbing down of humans both young and old. The idea of vaccination stems from Jesuit soldier Francis Xavier SJ who‚Äôs work was then utilizing by Venetian elements such as Edward Jenner who ended up being a guise for the Jesuits as people believe Jenner was more to do with the creation of vaccines. From day one vaccines were sought as a way of poisoning not of health.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/pandemic-flu-pneumonic-plague/\" target=\"_blank\">Biological warfare and Pandemic</a>\n\nThe pandemic Level 6 influenzas and other similar epidemics are great ways to depopulate human areas. A better option would be to use the pneumonic plague as was trialled in the Ukraine (D225G) during the supposed swine flu (H1N1) level 6 pandemic. Always remember that no natural animal virus can affect a human being without man-made interventions and genetic engineering in laboratories tied to the CDC/WHO. Vaccines are the preferred way to vector these plagues in order to prevent elitists suffering the same fate. For a more indiscriminate method of vectoring then the use of the waterways and the aerosol campaign can be used with the latter being hidden under Stratospheric Aerosol Geo-engineering disguise.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/surveillance-network/\" target=\"_blank\">Surveillance Network</a>\n\nThe New Venice Empire wishes know everything about you and your exact location 24/7 utilizing microchip implants and computer systems such as the BEAST in Brussels and numerous others tied to the five (six eyes if you include Israel) eyes network and the NSA including the secretive underground network beneath and near the main campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. You‚Äôll soon see mandatory ID card systems being brought in, along with fingerprinting and Iris scanning manipulated into action by synarchist methods of false-flag terrorism and supposed cybercrime. Implants will made fashionable through the pre-conditioning and predictive programming methods firstly creating acceptance and a need on bracelets before the final push for an internal implant. In order to force those who don‚Äôt want to comply with implant and wearable slavery and microwave radiating then employment and purchasing will require the Mark of the Beast. The masonic lodge over this agenda is the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists who‚Äôs members including the likes of Bill Gates a member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/global-police-state-post-democratic-society/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Police state post democratic society</a>\n\nThe end goal for society under the New Venice Empire is complete synarchist domination over the slave populace. As this governance rolls in, the police forces will become more militarized until eventually the police and military become one and known as the World police. This World police will enforce the will of the synarchist Empire over the slaves making sure the people can never become free of the Zeusian control systems. Welcome to the nightmare of the Club of Rome and the vision of Jamal ud-Din al Afghani that is now termed the post-industrial zero-growth society under the New World Order. Democracy will no longer exist either in mind or in reality, all you need to do is study the European Union and read its Lisbon Treaty to understand the way the world already has and will change in the near future if it‚Äôs continued to be ruled by both the followers of Zeus and Kronos.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/medical-quackery-death/\" target=\"_blank\">Medical Quackery &amp; Death</a>\n\nWhat many term the medical system we term it for what it really is and that‚Äôs a medical mafia which some call ‚Äòbig pharma‚Äô. This mafia is run by two Masonic lodges known as the Worshipful Society of London Apothecaries and the Worshipful Company of Barbers along with families such as the House of Rockefeller a master of the American Medical Association. The so-called health-care services around the world are the greatest source of deception and genocide on the populace serving Memorandum 200 and the Global 2000 Report. All synthetic drugs damage both the Kidneys and Liver function leading to a complete breakdown of the viscera network of the human body.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/intelligence-network-false-flags/\" target=\"_blank\">Intelligence network false flags</a>\n\nThe synarchist New Venice Empire advance their agenda by the use of Ordo-Ab-Chao meaning order out of chaos. These Zeusians know that the public will never accept the agenda so instead these evil doers create a crisis which sparks enough fear in the slaves so they‚Äôll accept the agenda as the solution to the current crisis (problem, reaction and solution also known as the totalitarian tiptoe). Please look into two operations known as Gladio and Northwoods to understand the way these synarchists really think and act. Intelligence agencies and military forces such as NATO carry out these false-flag events (to be blamed on others) but the large events like 9/11 are a combined effort by numerous agencies and these are known as metabridge events. The 9/11 attacks were connected to British SIS, Israeli Mossad, French DGSE, NATO, Royal Canadian Air Force, the Anglo-Germanic DVD as well as the Octopus network such as Serco, Amec, Orbital ATK and others all of which serve the Black International synarchist New Venice Empire.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/precious-metal-investment-true-wealth/\" target=\"_blank\">Precious metal investment &amp; true wealth</a>\n\nOnce you realize that almost all paper cash is nothing but trash then you‚Äôll need to be on the lookout for precious metals and other tangible assets in order to attempt to preserve and maybe increase your wealth through times of hardship in the economy. Right now you should be investing a large percentage of your wealth into physical gold/silver bullion. In the long-run you should find that silver ends up being the better out of the two in as it soon becomes rare due to lack of recycling of this precious metal and this should start from as early as 2019 onwards. Silver also has a long way to go just to match the old 16:1 ratio against gold. The elites of the New Venice Empire still use bullion to this day as highlighted by Lord James of Blackheath in his speech about Foundation X at the House of Lords connected with Lord Sassoon. In the united states of America both gold and silver are the only lawful and legal tender of the nation as governed by the American Constitution.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/chemicalsynthetic-poisons-and-toxins/\" target=\"_blank\">Chemical/synthetic poisons and toxins</a>\n\nThe dangerous chemical aspartame originates from genetically engineered E. Coli and it has been proven to be carcinogenic meaning cancer-causing as well as numerous other dangerous conditions including blindness. Try to watch a documentary called ‚ÄúSweet Misery: A Poisoned World.‚Äù The research and knowledge from Dr Russell L Blaylock will be of much use in your own truth seeking on this subject. Make sure you know the various different aliases for aspartame such as aminosweet. Notice there‚Äôs another poison released by the name of Senomyx which is a substitute for the brain damaging monosodium glutamate. Always read food labeling and ideally stay clear of any foods that have a bar-code. \n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/abortion-and-sustainable-development/\" target=\"_blank\">Abortion and sustainable development</a>\n\nStudy the ‚ÄòMemorandum 200‚Äô written by the Synagogue of Satan‚Äôs Heinz Kissinger who‚Äôs a member of both the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire as well as the Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst. Study the ‚ÄòGlobal 2000 Report‚Äô by the Club of Rome organization tied to another member of the DVD known as, Mikhail Gorbachev the former leader of the Soviet Union. I‚Äôd also suggest you read the ‚ÄòPopulation Bomb‚Äô by Paul Ehrlich. Today you‚Äôre being brainwashed into your own demise using ‚Äòsustainable development‚Äô which is nothing more than genocide under the United Nations Agenda 21 programme.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/the-famine-agenda/\" target=\"_blank\">The famine agenda</a>\n\nThe populaces of the Western World are to dramatically have their living standards drop closer to Second World status in order to match the rest of the developing World as we all become one under a global governance known as the New World Order mastered by the New Venice Empire. It‚Äôs food and water which control the people of the planet and these needs are to be severely depleted in order to bring about a culling of the population especially of those within the third World. Once the depopulation of the third World becomes really visible the Empire will then push for GMO crops in order to supposedly help combat shortages and disease. In truth the GMO agenda is desired to control the Western World which now has economies that rely on income from sickness due to the implementation of the Club of Rome‚Äôs, Post Industrial Zero Growth Plan. Expect food and water shortages as well as rations and expect to be forced to live as a Vegan and never to see salt and meat ever again if the Freemasonic Lodge known as the Worshipful Company of Coopers gets its way. The removal of meat from the diet is in order to create chronic illness and lower the sexual desires of the victims who are this prey. The end goal is for the human life-span to be reduced to around the age of thirty-nine years old in the general public. Please make a note how the U,N food programs WFP and the FAO are headquartered in Rome, Italy.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/gun-control-and-the-2nd-amendment-of-america/\" target=\"_blank\">Gun control and the 2nd Amendment of America</a>\n\nThe New Venice (Britain) Empire wish for a totally unarmed slave populace which can be easily governed under synarchist control as visioned by the likes of Jamal ud-Din al Afghani as the global governance is about to be laid down. An unarmed populace cannot defend itself from tyrannical leaders. Crime rates always drop where guns are held by the general populace which puts fear in the mind of the potential criminals. Synarchism controls rely on chaos to aid bring in the desires of the Empire (Ordo-ad-Chao). As the agenda progresses you‚Äôll hear of more gun events (mostly staged) in both the United States and Switzerland where guns are still available to the populace. Once all the arms are rounded up in the U.S. by foreign United Nations MJTF (FINCEN) troops, the Americans will finally find out that the U.S. Constitution no longer stands as of 1945 but especially since 1992 similar to how the Vatican was taken over in 1827 and more obviously in 1963. American lands are no longer American and instead they belong to the United Nations and others as collateral on the national debt. The signing of the Charter of the United Nations was the start of this takeover by the U.N.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/the-new-world-order-temporal-power/\" target=\"_blank\">The New World Order</a>\n\nThe New World Order is a synarchist bought about fascist system based on the revival of the occult as the New Venice Empire takes use into what Blavatsky called the Age of Aquarius. The entire World is to be dominated by the elite forces of the New Venice Empire known as the Black International who‚Äôs priest class master the Kabbalah and work with the human-hating Djinn forces. All forms of cultures will be destroyed as everyone will become the same as each other and trapped within a Luciferian Doctrine which will be the one-World religion along with a one-World economic system enforced by a one-World police force under the elite dictatorship utilizing Kabbalah magick and technology. Extensive mind re-framing and social engineering will take place in order to change the normality into the new normality for all to follow the left-hand path of Lucifer. These social engineering systems will be mastered and devised by the Mind Benders of the Venetian Arsenal and its forks in New Venice (Britain) and the United States utilizing the likes of Common Purpose, Common Cause, Stanford University, University of Essex and the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations. During the reign of Pedro Arrupe SJ as the Black Pope he had to prepare his Jesuit soldiers for this coming New World Order a long time before George H.W. Bush of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath came out with the term in the 1990s. Americans should closely monitor the power of New Venice (Britain) over the States especially with the likes of their Senior Executive Service.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/the-aerosol-programme/\" target=\"_blank\">The Aerosol Programme</a>\n\nAerosols are being vectored Worldwide across our skies raising environmental pollution and pathogens which have killed and diseased many people. Now after years of this we‚Äôre seeing the collateral damage manifesting as Morgellons disease across America and other sprayed Countries. Thanks to the Office of Naval Intelligence we now have Operation Clover Leaf, Operation Red Sky, Operation Rain Dance right above our heads tied into the Civil and Military Open Skies treaties.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/the-hermaphrodite-agenda/\" target=\"_blank\">The Hermaphrodite Agenda</a>\n\nThe ultimate goals of the hermaphrodite agenda are the reduction in population, removal of violence, removal of class and removal of gender. Why the removal of gender? Well as gender is removed then so is class but it‚Äôs not only about the class issue but also about the one being, the divine hermaphrodite as these Kabbalists attempt to turn humans beings into Gods aided by technologies (modern magick). In other words the Adam &amp; Eve of modern times or the Superman fighting against God‚Äôs Kryptonite meaning God‚Äôs encryption code to his matrix. The majority of the populace will no longer know let alone care about sexual labels such as heterosexual and homosexual as most will be what‚Äôs currently termed bisexual with the rest being shared between what is currently known as same-sex and opposite-sex participants. The whole ideal of todays forms of sexuality will no longer exist in the slightest especially as the State starts to product the children in laboratories. The idea of a relationship will not exist as people live single lives and sexual needs become that of an animal instinct rather than that of love call it a free-love society if you will based on the work of H.G. Wells. Laboratory children will be bought into force as human fertility is removed by the use of medical and chemical intervention such as the likes of the HPV vaccine or similar. Take a look at the predictive programming movies called ‚ÄòGattaca‚Äô and ‚ÄòChildren of Men‚Äô for a glimpse of some of the things to come in the near future. I would also recommend you read Bertrand Russell‚Äôs book ‚ÄòThe Impact of science on Society‚Äô.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/earth-changes-and-scalar-biowarfare/\" target=\"_blank\">Earth Changes and Scalar biowarfare</a>\n\nMembers of the Jesuit Order were first people to fully understand seismology and the ionosphere. I strongly suggest you study there actions down at Manila Observatory since 1951. When you understand how the ionosphere can be manipulated to direct earthquake then all will soon become clear. Look into ionospheric heaters such as EISCAT and the connection to the Open Skies Treaty in conjunction with the Stratospheric Aerosol Geo-engineering program by the U.S. Air Force. Do some research on the USAF‚Äôs document called ‚ÄòOwning the weather in 2025‚Äô. Weather warfare has been taking place for decades utilizing space based weapons platforms and satellites in conjunction with the technologies mentioned earlier such as scalar interferometers.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/cell-phones-microwaves-emf-and-wifi/\" target=\"_blank\">Cell phones, Microwaves, EMF and Wifi</a>\n\nCell phones and Wi-Fi are made up of microwaves and Extra Low Frequencies which interfere with the body and produce a host of symptoms of ill-health such as Hodgkins Lymphoma. The intelligence agencies now have technology to utilize your cell phone as a real weapon via resonant frequency and microwaves utilizing Electronic Counter Counter-Measure units. Agencies such as MI6, CIA, MOSSAD and FBI Division Five have access to Stoner and Venus EECM devices. If you want to understand microwave radiation then I recommend you study the work of Barrie Trower who‚Äôs an expert on microwave weaponry.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/latest-health-news-updates/\" target=\"_blank\">Latest health news updates</a>\n\nAll the latest news on health from around the World.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/natural-healing/\" target=\"_blank\">Natural Healing</a>\n\nHomeoepathic remedies and Herbal medicines have been used for centuries to reverse/control ailments and disease. These types of treatment are the natural methods of true healing and real health-care and not just the masking of symptoms known as disease management which the allopathic treatments are known for. I should remind you that most of the synthetic drugs used by the medical mafia have their origins from God‚Äôs plant Kingdom such as the Periwinkle and Mistletoe for synthetic chemotherapies along with Foxglove for synthetic heart failure medication,\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/intelligence-network-dope-inc/\" target=\"_blank\">Intelligence network Dope Inc</a>\n\nIntelligence agencies control the illegal trade of drugs such as heroin and cocaine as exposed by Gary Webb, Brian Downing Quig and Michael Ruppert. This control system of New Venice goes back to Opium Wars against China. The global economy is propped up by a second covert economy which is based on heroin not the black gold known as oil. Black operations that cannot be funded by the the public purse end up being financed by drug profits laundered and washed by banking houses and the stock markets aided by the Exchange Stablization Fund tied to the U.S. Treasury. If you want to know the true powers behind the drugs trade then you have to look at families such as the Houses of Windsor and Bourbon along with Harriman, Sassoon, Keswick, Astor and others including the secret networks such as Chapter 322. For a most excellent insight into the drug trade by this Empire then you must read the book ‚ÄòDope Inc‚Äô written and updated numerous times by Lyndon LaRouche a former adviser to Ronald Reagan.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/unidentified-flying-objects/\" target=\"_blank\">Unidentified Flying Objects</a>\n\nMost Honourable Military Order of the Bath member, Ronald Reagan spoke of the opportunities from a threat within space. You have constant predictive programming since the Roswell crash in movies like ‚ÄòSkyline‚Äô, ‚ÄòBattle Los Angeles‚Äô, ‚Äòindependence Day‚Äô, ‚ÄòWar of the worlds‚Äô not to mention numerous television series such as ‚ÄòV‚Äô and ‚ÄòColony‚Äô. All of these programming systems are part of what is known as Project Greenstar which is a social engineering program to create the idea of alien lifeforms and a future contact. Why? So the Zeusians can finally destroy all the World‚Äôs current religions and replace them with a one-World religion based on the Luciferian Doctrine which is nothing more than the occult revival through the New Age Movement working closely with Freemasonic Lodges such as the Martinists and their Ordo Templi Orientis. Any life-forms that are presented as aliens will be genetically engineered by man in underground laboratories. The real threat to mankind is from the forces of the Djinn and right now they‚Äôre winning as their followers put their desires into actions.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/the-ice-age/\" target=\"_blank\">The Ice Age</a>\n\nThe Earth has been cooling not warming since 1993 as we enter into a fifty to seventy-five year long Ice-Age. The Solar output from Sun has dramatically diminished and will stay like this during this Ice-Age cycle. Strange warming patterns in some parts of the planet isn‚Äôt down to global warming but instead it‚Äôs just interference by the U.S. Air Force and others with the various levels they spray the Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering program. If the SAG program is laid down at a high altitude then the Earth cools even further but if these aerosols are laid lower then even the low solar output can be magnified in heat on the ground. What you‚Äôll notice is the winters will be harsher and break more cold weather records.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/the-destruction-of-the-n-h-s/\" target=\"_blank\">The destruction of the N.H.S</a>\n\nThe National Healthcare Service is being purposely destroyed from the inside out by Common Purpose in order to gain public acceptance of a privatized healthcare system modeled on the U.S. (who at this point in time want to model their system on the socialized NHS). As with the transport and other privatized systems these services will dramatically lower standard and increase costs. The NHS has massive debts due to the purposeful indebting of the organization to aid attempts at putting the service close to bankruptcy again to gain acceptance of a private takeover. The serious debt comes in the way of crippling Private finance initiative debt instead of using Government issued credit or even debt at a small interest rate. All you need to know is that the problems of the NHS are only major due to deceptions and in reality they could all be easily solved and funded if Prometheans were in charge instead of Zeusians.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/the-world-commerce-system/\" target=\"_blank\">The World commerce system</a>\n\nVarious economic news\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/the-economic-depression/\" target=\"_blank\">The Economic Depression</a>\n\nFull economic collapse could happen at any moment in time as the economy is hanging on by the last tiny thread, it‚Äôs kind of like the fully brain-dead human on life support denying the inevitable. The economic system of the New Venice Empire is mastered by the Freemasonic lodges of the Worshipful Company of Mercers, Worshipful Company of International Bankers along with the Guild of International Bankers, The Bankers Club, TheCityUK and The Worshipful Company of Traders. The economic system is dominated by Oleron Law or the Canon Law based Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The idea is to eventually crash the economy to further enslave the populace within a new economic model dominated by the International Monetary Fund and it‚Äôs Special Drawing Right as the World‚Äôs reserve currency. The new economic model will be an all electronic system working on the lines of the blockchain technology and will be tied to the likes of the Universal Postal Union based in Berne, Switzerland and the Freemasonic Lodge known as the Worshipful Company of Technologists. Let‚Äôs not forget how the head of the Rothschild controlled central ‚Äòwar‚Äô banks is non other than the Bank for International Settlements also based in Switzerland and located in Basel.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/mass-civil-unrest-disobedience-protest-and-strikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Mass civil unrest, disobedience, protest and strikes</a>\n\nAs the New World Order grip takes over the slave populaces the uprisings will start in many forms whether it be simple protests or even social unrest. Some of these events will be synarchist staged such as the riots in Britain during 2011 whilst others will be genuine people who‚Äôre tied of being a slave on the plantation. These events will be utilized by New Venice in order to have an excuse for the need of a post-democratic society enforced by a world police force.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/sherman-skolnick/\" target=\"_blank\">Sherman Skolnick</a>\n\nSherman Skolnick was known as the Judge buster of Chicago and an excellent researcher of criminal and conspiratorial activities which even ended up getting him kidnapped.

Joe Vialls was plagued by the intelligence networks who would constantly harass him and seize his donations made through Templar networks such as PayPal. Much of Joe‚Äôs work has disappeared off the Internet and we must keep his work alive as it‚Äôs all of vital importance especially his initial work on the mind controlling color code system which I believe is well underway with the new mandatory digital televisions and their millions of colors at very high resolution.\n\n<a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/category/aids-and-the-non-existent-hiv-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\">AIDS and the non-existent hiv fraud</a>\n\nThe so-called Human Immunodeficiency Virus has never been isolated and simple doesn‚Äôt exist. The fraudster Robert Gallo was awarded the Sword of Ignatius Loyola at St. Louis University back in the year of 1988. Let me remind you that Jesuit soldier, Francis Xavier SJ was the mastermind of the vaccination eugenics agenda. With the hoax of HIV they achieve a population culling through deception and pharmaceutical abuse whilst at the same time aiding the promotion of condom use meaning population reduction. Eventually people will be forced to have go through mandatory false-testing for this non-existent virus. AIDS symptoms have existed since time began and they‚Äôve increased through chemical usage.

The New Venice Empire is in a severe state of collapse and warfare is it‚Äôs means of a short continuation of its life-support. The BRICS is the dominate force when it comes to both military and economics and so New Venice needs to ignite a global conflict if it fails to topple the nations of the BRICS by the usual methods of infiltration, coup and color revolution. The problem New Venice has right now is that Russia and China are the true superpowers especially Russia from a military point of view. We could soon witness the full collapse of the British Zeusian/Kronos system resulting in a Promethean victory which will destroy the slave model the world has been chained within for many centuries. I‚Äôd like to point out how the U.S. Pentagon origins are based on the Jesuit war rooms of the Villa Farnese in Luzio. The New Venice Empire built up the United States plantation as the front to carry out its dirty deeds and thus take away suspicion from the British Isles.

Some people who are outside of it in some aspects can get what they want and spit out the dead man's bones out of the white washed walking tombs. They are Eustace Mullins, Lyndon LaRouche, John Coleman, and Webster Tarpley. There are people that try to attempt to get whatever they get right out of them while exposing their more questionable matters. Though it is rare, there are people who treat every bad guy equally evil and worth pointing out like the Synarchists behind Rome and perhaps the previous three beast nations, the Jews (Synagogue of Satan, the \"Gog\" which is the name of a Khazarian king), the Venetians, the Knight Templars, the Freemasons, the Jesuits, other Jewish-Venetian controlled Catholic Militia Orders, the Los Alumbrados, the Barvarian Illuminati, and so on. Trying to find sources that exposes them all equally is hard to do, but some come close like Craig Oxley, Texe Marrs and David Livingstone. Do I think they're 100% right? I haven't seen that happen yet. Anyways, the four giants as I call them, have been exposed by some within, and some from outside reliable sources.\n\nTaken from <a href=\"http://www.whale.to/c/check.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.whale.to/c/check.html</a>:<blockquote>Eustace Mullins Exposed Dr. John Coleman In 1992\n\nAccording to the late, great Eustace Mullins, Dr. John Coleman (the name he goes by, anyway) not only lifted the materials he used in his books and lectures from both Mullins and Lyndon Larouche publications, but he also may have lifted material from the Anti-Defamation League‚Ä¶while working as a Mossad agent-agitator against America!\n\nCheck out below what Mullins had to say about Coleman back in 1992, and see if what Mullins said holds any water. Given that it‚Äôs from Mullins, I‚Äôd say it holds a glass that is over half-full.\n\nSome Illuminating Background On The Character ‚ÄúJohn Coleman‚Äù, Agent-Agitator Finally Exposed\n\n(Editor‚Äôs note: Regular readers will recall that much space in the 9/8/92 LIBERATOR was devoted to explaining an insipid array of attacks from one ‚ÄúDr. John Coleman‚Äù aka John Clarke and likely actually one Joseph Pavlonsky, of Russian Khazarian origin. It seems that some of the excellent sources ‚ÄúColeman‚Äù ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù material from have seen fit to discuss this colorful character and in so doing, provide an illuminating ‚Äî if sadly destructive ‚Äî pattern of activity we would share with our readers. The following is an extract from an article purportedly by Eustace Mullins in Lawrence Patterson‚Äôs publication Criminal Politics for July or August of 1992.)\n\nA specter is haunting the American conservative movement ‚Äî a specter using an alias (among others) of Dr. John Coleman. Coleman bills himself as ‚Äúthe World‚Äôs Greatest Intelligence Expert ‚Äî with secret but highly placed ties to British Intelligence.‚Äù He appeared out of the blue at a Bob White, Sound Monetary Conference meeting in Costa Rica in 1984.\n\nWith no sponsorship ‚Äî other than the seminar sponsor, a Dr. Harold Brown ‚Äî and no documentation, Coleman managed to convince the attendees that he was indeed one of the world‚Äôs important experts on international intelligence. He claimed to be privy to the most carefully guarded secrets of the individuals who clandestinely rule the world.\n\nHowever, Coleman said he would share these secrets only if certain carefully observed guidelines were maintained. The most important of these was that he would never be asked to furnish any personal background information ‚Äî any documentation or any source from which he obtained his ‚Äúsecret information.‚Äù Such restrictions would scream ‚Äúconfidence artist‚Äù to most people. But when he met James K. Warner (editor of the Christian Defense League newspaper) ‚Äî in 1984, he justified his refusal to reveal background information on himself or his sources by claiming that ‚Äúhe was subject to assassination threats.‚Äù\n\nHe snared Jim Warner by confiding in him one of his closely guarded secrets ‚Äî that his name was not Dr. John Coleman at all, but that it was, in fact, John Clark. Coleman stated that by giving Warner this private information, he was actually placing his life in his hands. As he was an accomplished confidence artist, Coleman convinced Warner that he should offer him a position. Warner responded to him by employing him as a writer for the Christian Defense League Report.\n\nColeman would send in material which indeed contained startling information (but was totally undocumented, [and] would soon win him an enthusiastic following among Warner‚Äôs readers. Coleman also supplied a great many audio tapes which were offered to Warner‚Äôs readers. Each of course supplying ‚Äúsecret information.‚Äù This began a five year relationship which proved to be filled with pitfalls for Warner, who was after all a small underfinanced businessman.\n\nNot only did Coleman continue to refuse [to provide] any documentation, but he made frequent demands for salary increases‚Ä¶extra expenses for himself and his family‚Ä¶and advances on his salary which exceeded the projected totals of several years salary. Warner was in no position to meet these demands, but in his anxiety to retain Coleman, he dug deep into his own pocket and also issued frantic fund raising appeals for Coleman. The result was that Warner was nearly bankrupted and conservatives nearly lost an excellent source of out of print books and independent information.\n\nIt should be noted that it is a common technique for an infiltrator to attempt a financial raid on a host target ‚Äî thereby rendering the host target unable to continue in business. An example of this would be the Rockefeller faction attempting to take over the National Rifle Association some 15 years ago with a grandiose plan which would have bankrupted the NRA‚Ä¶\n\nMullins Material Had To Be Discontinued‚Ä¶ Or Else!\n\nThere were other problems which Coleman created for Warner. One of them was his continuous demands that Warner cease any articles or sell any books written by myself, Eustace Mullins. I had, in fact, been writing for Warner for more than a decade. Warner attributed this obsession to mere jealousy on Coleman‚Äôs part. In fact, it went much deeper.\n\nColeman‚Äôs vaunted sources of information were not secret at all, but were discovered by me in the process of reviewing his printed statements. Here are the results of my study: about 30% of his material was lifted from my own writings and about 70% was stolen from Lyndon Larouche publications. Principally, Coleman would rely on feature articles in the Executive Intelligence Review magazine. The material was simply rewritten by Coleman and crudely puffed up to five or six times its original length. Unfortunately, Warner never noticed.\n\nFinally I became so concerned about the quantity of material lifted from the Larouche publications by Coleman that I decided to let Jim Warner know that his ‚Äúnew star‚Äù was lifting most of his ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù from Larouche publications.\n\nSome months later, Warner received an indignant letter from the Larouche office, complaining about Coleman‚Äòs plagiarism of the Larouche material. When Warner confronted Coleman, Warner was assured that it was simply an effort by the Larouche group to sow dissension. Coleman claimed he had only seen one copy of the Executive Intelligence Review in his life. Sometime later, when Coleman claimed to have left the country for South Africa, some of his effects were stored at the Warner warehouse. Among them, Warner found two boxes of well-thumbed issues of Larouche magazines. Sure enough, this proved to be the source of many of Coleman‚Äôs ‚ÄúBritish intelligence‚Äù connections. But Warner‚Äôs readers were trapped, and they were besieging him with requests that he bring Coleman into the public spotlight through meetings and seminars.\n\nColeman finally did appear at some meetings for a few months. But then, Warner was hit with still more demands for more loans and salary advances. He tried to find other employment for him, sending him off to a part-time job with a long time supporter,William Makinney, of Florida. Bill Makinney was lured by the promise that Coleman could make some extremely profitable deals for him. Later he was disappointed when Coleman arrived with his wife and son, and Coleman demanded the use of a Lincoln town car and memberships in the most exclusive Palm Beach Clubs and nightly meals in the most expensive restaurants.\n\nEven worse he spent much of his time closeted in a room at Makinney‚Äôs home. He claimed to be making long distance phone calls to the head of the South African gov‚Äôt. Makinney was later unable to find records of any such phone calls in his billing. Soon Makinney asked him to leave and put him on a plane the sadder but wiser.\n\nWarner was again assailed by constant demands for more money. Warner finally decided that the only way to meet the demands was to hold public meetings with Coleman as the star. Coleman, who had billed himself as the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Greatest Orator‚Äù proved to be a lack luster speaker, who read in a dull monotone from his type written speech, The meetings were a failure. Meanwhile, Warner had purchased a car for Coleman‚Äôs use and a computer for Coleman‚Äôs use at a large home which Warner rented for him. Coleman rarely appeared at the Warner offices citing his fear of assassination.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, Warner discovered at the meetings, Coleman attempted to make financial deals for himself, showing no loyally to Warner whatsoever. Finally, Warner informed him that he was fired. Warner was required to obtain a warrant to cease the automobile and computer that were loaned to him. Then he realized that Coleman had obtained an illicit copy of his mailing list. Coleman began issuing appeals to Warner‚Äôs subscribers claiming that I had had him discharged in order to become an editor of another Warner publication.\n\nFinally, Coleman showed in California where he was guest of one Dr. Arnold Geisbret, of Glendale, CA. Geisbret has an interesting background. He is an attendee at many rightwing meetings, including those of Lawrance Patterson‚Äôs National Bankruptcy Seminars. He would take copious notes and interrogate everyone that would talk to him. Geisbret, obviously, intended to collect as much information on the right-wing as possible. Coleman, meanwhile, went from one address to the other in California using Warner‚Äôs mailing list as a source of suckers.\n\nAt each resident, he would spin a spiteful tale of having been cruelly used by Jim Warner who had taken all of his money. Meanwhile, Coleman would make threatening calls to Warner informing him that he would launch a national campaign against him if he refused to make a financial settlement. Wishing to avoid legal problems, Warner settled a substantial sum of money on Coleman, all to no avail. Coleman not only launched a campaign of denunciation against Warner using his mailing list of subscribers, but he also began a surreptitious mailing campaign using pseudonyms to accuse Warner of sexual offenses and of being a double agent. These defamatory letters were also mailed to Warner‚Äôs mailing list.\n\nGreat Success‚Ä¶ In Spreading Discord!\n\nColeman was achieving great success in spreading consternation and discord throughout the conservative network. I began to realize his true motives. Rather than a greedy confidence artist ‚Äî with an ability to rewrite other‚Äôs materials as his own ‚Äî it became obvious to me and to those that knew him, that he was more than likely a highly trained double agent, whose handlers would unleash the ‚Äúattack dog‚Äù on an unprepared patriot community a step at a time. One source I have spoken with claimed that he has been trained in Israel by a Mossad unit ‚Äî and had been known there as Joseph Pavlonsky.\n\nWe later discovered that he entered the United States on an English passport recorded by the INS as #A20211168 issued to ‚ÄúJohn Clarke.‚Äù Interestingly, when Warner accompanied him to get a driver‚Äôs license in Louisiana, he claimed he had applied for a social security number although none was forthcoming. Even though he had been in the United States for almost a decade, he had been driving in the Western states on a Louisiana license, and had never obtained a U.S. green card or work permit.\n\nOn To Carson City, Nevada‚Ä¶As ‚ÄúSpace Commander‚Äù\n\nNext comes Coleman‚Äôs employment with one George Green who operates a nonconformist publication titled Phoenix Journal Express which is supposedly representing the statements from a space being ‚Äî (yes, we said space being) by the name of Gyorgos Ceres Hatonn!!\n\nHatonn is the claimed commander of a fleet of space ships from the galaxy of Pleiades. These spaceships have been deployed over the California border with Nevada for several years. This has proved to be convenient for all concerned because the people of Pleiades, interestingly enough, do not require a U.S. work permit from its employees. Coleman is now writing the material for Hatonn. Interestingly enough, he gives advice about International Banking, but amazingly, is always negative on Sterling denominated investments and, interestingly, Swiss banking as well.\n\nUnder the auspices of George Green‚Äôs Phoenix Journal Express, and America West publishers of Tehachapi, California, Coleman finally published his first and only book ‚ÄúThe Committee of Three Hundred‚Äù. After examining this book, it has proven to be the usual amalgam of his borrowings from my various textbooks and, again, from the Larouche magazine.\n\nThe foreword to the book is very revealing. He again takes the opportunity to sow more dissension in the conservative movement. It is a vitriolic denunciation of the movement claiming it was ‚Äúpart of a carefully crafted and orchestrated program to discredit him (Coleman) and run by secret government agents and informers embedded in the so-called Christian right wing ‚Äúidentity movement‚Äù. The invective goes on at some length repeating the slanders of his previous circulated hate letters. The Committee of 300 contains nothing new and is an amalgam of others‚Äô materials.\n\nMaterial Lifted From the Anti-Defamation League!\n\nHaving reviewed the material of the anti-defamation league, I can say that Coleman‚Äôs smear attack in his foreword against the ‚Äúso-called Christian right wing‚Äù is atypical material taken from the guide books of the anti-defamation league. His denunciation of the ‚Äúidentity movement‚Äù is also taken directly from ADL literature. For years the ADL has considered the ‚Äúidentity movement‚Äù its number one opponent and target in the United States.\n\nA Potent Agitator‚Ä¶ Working Against America!\n\nWhatever the truth or falsity of the claims of Dr. John Coleman (alias John Clarke, alias Pavlonksy), it is clear that he is a potent agititor working among American conservative publishers. Lawrence Patterson has also had a brush with him and he has recently succeeded in taking in Colonel Arch Roberts, who ran a lengthy review of his book.\n\nHe has constantly sown seeds of discord and hate for his own devious purposes and will undoubtedly continue to pit patriot against patriot for as long as he is allowed to betray, impede and infiltrate without exposure. Hopefully, this article which has been submitted to Criminal Politics magazine of which I am a contributing editor, will help to expose John Coleman as a foreign agent.</blockquote>\n\nThough highly critical and hypocritically exposes generally the same thing Mullins does concerning the Kabbalah, David Livingstone made an article called <a href=\"http://www.conspiracyschool.com/blog/eustace-mullins-occultist-and-disinfo-agent-far-right\" target=\"_blank\">Eustace Mullins: Occultist and Disinfo Agent of the Far-Right</a>:<blockquote>Among the modern-day classics of conspiracy literature is Eustace Mullins‚Äô Secrets of the Federal Reserve, which continues to define perceptions of the nature and purpose of the cabal that is currently suspected of secretly manipulating the world. However, as revealed in Orwell‚Äôs Nineteen Eighty-Four, conspiracy culture is often deliberately manipulated in order to call out and neutralize potential dissidents.\n\nAs closer look at the career of Mullins reveals a typical example of the nefarious networks involved in nurturing feats of a ‚ÄúJewish conspiracy‚Äù on behalf of American intelligence and the Zionists. After World War II, the CIA recruited leading Nazis and neo-Nazis, who went on for form a Fascist International, which served the organization in their fight against ‚Äúcommunism.‚Äù Like their predecessors, this fascist network continued to cultivate the feat or a ‚ÄúJewish‚Äù conspiracy as a sly method on the part of Zionists to continue to justify continued support for the state of Israel, and to cultivate sentiments favorable to World Bank and IMF policies of neoliberalism, falsely known in the conspiracy community as ‚ÄúLibertarianism.‚Äù\n\nMullins was mentored in his research on the Federal Reserve by Ezra Pound. As demonstrated in Transhumanism: The History of a Dangerous Idea, Pound was not only a notorious fascist, but also one of the key occult figures of the twentieth century, with deep ties to the CIA. A close friend of Golden Dawn member Yeats, Pound was an expatriate American and a major figure of the early modernist movement, and helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as T.S. Eliot, James Joyce, Robert Frost and Ernest Hemingway.\n\nPound was also a close friend of James Jesus Angleton, a Knight of Malta and key member of the Georgetown Set who created the CIA. Angleton, the long-time chief of Counterintelligence, was the head of the CIA‚Äôs Vatican Desk as well as the Israel Desk. Angleton was responsible for liaison with Israel‚Äôs Mossad and Shin Bet agencies, crucial relationships that he managed for the remainder of his career. Angleton also become responsible for the Lovestone Empire, the network run for the CIA by Jay Lovestone. A former head of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), later a trade union leader, Lovestone worked with foreign unions using covert funds to construct a worldwide system of anti-communist unions. According to CIA agent and later Watergate burglar Howard Hunt, ‚Äúthe Communist Party of the United States, in fact, at the moment, was practically a branch of the Justice Department.‚Äù[1]\n\nDuring World War II, the Italian government paid Pound to produce radio broadcasts criticizing the US and in particular the Jews. As a result, Pound was arrested for treason by American forces in Italy in 1945 and interned at St. Elizabeth‚Äôs Hospital in Washington, D.C, where he became a patient of MK-Ultra psychiatrist Dr. Winfred Overholser. As Colin Ross explained in The CIA Doctors, it was there that Dr. Winfred Overholser Sr. funded LSD research through the Scottish Rite Committee and was at the center of the mind control network.[2] St. Elizabeth‚Äôs is also where presidential assailants, serial killers or other federal cases are kept, such as Ezra Pound and John Hinckley, Jr. who shot Ronald Reagan.\n\nMullins was himself a fascist and a member of National Renaissance Party (NRP), a key organization of World Union of National Socialists (WUNS). The organization was created in 1962, when veteran US Navy Commander George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party (ANP), met with National Socialist Movement (NSM) chief Colin Jordan, and agreed to work towards developing an international network between movements as an umbrella group for neo-Nazi organizations across the globe.\n\nFollowing Rockwell's assassination in 1967, NRP member Matt Koehl became head of WUNS as well as the ANP, later known as National Socialist White People‚Äôs Party. Koehl was the leader of a self-defined religious organization called the New Order, which describes itself on its website as follows: ‚ÄúWe are the Movement of Adolf Hitler. We are His heirs. He has given us a commission, which it is our duty to discharge.‚Äù[3] New Order was a successor organization to the original American Nazi Party (ANP), founded by Lincoln Rockwell, which became a self-styled National Socialist religious group which promotes Esoteric Nazism as an alternative faith for ‚ÄúAryans.‚Äù\n\nThe NRP, which founded in 1952 by James Madole, became a concern to the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA), an investigative committee of the United States House of Representatives, who regarded both fascism and communism as ‚Äúof grave concern to the committee.‚Äù Their report, Preliminary Report on Neo-Fascist and Hate Groups continues, ‚Äúboth seek to destroy our constitutional government and supplant it with a godless dictatorship in which the individual is deprived of his rights and liberties to become an abject slave of the state‚Ä¶ Those who would support the extreme right today do as great a violence to our national institutions as do those on the extreme left.‚Äù[4] The report concludes that these organizations exploited racial and religious hatreds to gain financial support, and that many of them were led by ‚Äúracketeers‚Äù mainly concerned with gaining financial reward by their activities.\n\nThe NRP publication, the Bulletin, referred to Hitler as the ‚ÄúGeorge Washington of Europe‚Äù and promised: ‚ÄúWhat Hitler accomplished in Europe, the National Renaissance Party shall accomplish in America.‚Äù Its nine-point program advocated abolition of parliamentary government in the US in favor of government by a ‚Äútrained elite‚Äù establishment of a fascist corporatism, encouragement of racial pride, preservation of the ‚Äúwhite Aryan‚Äù race by gradual deportation of racial minorities, and denying Jews American citizenship, professional and political posts and the right of intermarriage. John M. Lundoff, Brooklyn chairman of the NRP, in the April 1952 Bulletin asked the youth of America to choose between ‚Äúparliamentary democracy with its empty promises and discord or the clear, brave, and youthful Fascist principles outlined here.‚Äù[5] Similarly, in a leaflet entitled, ‚ÄúAsiatic Barbarism Versus Western Civilization,‚Äù Madole proclaimed:\n\nOnly the superbly efficient totalitarian economic systems of Fascists, National Socialist, and Communist regimes are adaptible [sic] to the strain of TOTAL WAR as practiced in the 20th century‚Ä¶ The spirit of democracy is a glorification of weakness and cowardly conduct. It glorifies the coward instead of the fighter, it raises feeble weaklings to leadership rather than a trained, iron-hard, and youthful elite‚Ä¶\n\nMadole's NRP was frequently in the headlines during the 1960s and 1970s for its involvement in violent protests and riots in New York City. Although he never attracted more than a small group of followers, Madole, according to Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, established himself as the father of postwar occult fascism. Madole's ideas on race were developed from Blavatsky whom he quoted to the effect that the Jewish Kabbalah derived from Aryan sources in Central Asia.[6]\n\nMadole‚Äôs slogan for the NRP was taken from Edward Bulwer-Lytton: ‚Äúno happiness without order, no order without authority, no authority without unity.‚Äù[7] Alongside books on Theosophy, the NRP literature list included Gerald Gardner‚Äôs The Meaning of Witchcraft, Lewis Spence‚Äôs The History and Origins of Druidism, Paul Carus‚Äô History of the Devil and the Idea of Evil and a number of books on runes.[8] According to Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Madole ‚Äúwanted to translate mankind and the world into the authoritarian utopia of a revived Vedic hierarchy, employing violent and draconian means if necessary. The sectarian religion of Theosophy, borrowings from Hinduism, paganism and Satanism, and mystical biological and eugenic ideas all served to explain and justify his militant attack on the democratic and liberal institutions of the modern world.‚Äù[9]\n\nThere were also close relations between the NRP and the Church of Satan, of Anton Lavey. Madole and LaVey met frequently, and Madole is said to have erected a large satanic altar in his apartment, which included an image of Baphomet, and Madole played LaVey‚Äôs recording of the Satanic Mass at several NRP meetings. One NRP bulletin shows a picture of Madole and an SE trooper with the high priest of the Temple of Baal. But the Church of Satan was soon undermined by schismatics who started rival cults. Douglas Robbins, another ex-leader from the Church of Satan, cultivated close links with the fascist NRP of James Madole, and formed the satanic Order of the Black Ram with some other NRP members ‚Äúto celebrate the ancient religious rites of the Aryan race.‚Äù[10]\n\nMullins founded the Free Ezra Pound Committee (FEPC) of which Matt Koehl was chairman. Researcher Ernie Lazar published a scathing report of Mullins‚Äô dubious past and neo-Nazi affiliations based on several FBI reports, showing that Mullins altered FBI documents which he reproduced in his book, excising portions which referred to his homosexuality, his anti-Semitism and his connections to neo-Nazis and racial extremists. The HCUA reported that Mullins ‚Äúeulogizes‚Äù Hitler in the anti-Semitism NPR‚Äôs Bulletin and wrote an article titled ‚ÄúAdolf Hitler: An Appreciation,‚Äù in 1952. In his self-published virulently anti-Jewish book The Biological Jew, Mullins compares Jews with biological parasites.[11]\n\nMullins was a roommate on several occasions in New York City and Chicago with Matt Koehl, with whom he had a homosexual affair. Eustace Mullins, Matt Koehl and Edward Fleckenstein were arrested near Middletown, New York circa 1955 in connection with their sodomizing of a hitch-hiking teenage boy in the back seat of a car in which they all were travelling. This probably accounts for why Mullins is described in FBI memos as follows: ‚ÄúMullins is a warped, degenerate and depraved individual.‚Äù[12]\n\nKoehl was also the Youth Section Leader of the American Committee for the Advancement of Western Culture (ACFAWC), founded by H. Keith Thompson, and of which Mullins served as ‚ÄúTreasurer.‚Äù Thompson served as a communications officer aboard the USS Mt. Olympus, the flagship of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition of December 1946 to April 1947. Byrd led 4,000 military troops from the US, Britain and Australia, known as Operation Highjump, to establish the Antarctic research base Little America IV. However, according to popular legend, the Byrd expedition was an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù and encountered heavy resistance from Nazi ‚Äúflying saucers‚Äù and had to call off the invasion.\n\nThompson resigned from the US Navy in order to accept commission as a Second Lieutenant in the US Marine Corps. However, in February 1949, he faced a General Court Martial on charges of ‚Äúscandalous conduct tending to destruction of good morals (sex deviate) and Maltreatment of Person Subject to His Orders.‚Äù[13]\n\nThompson hoped that the ACFAWC would become a coordinating group for white racial and nationalist activities of groups around the world. James Madole and other officers and members of the NRP also were represented on the ACFAWC, which had the role of serving as ‚Äúa high policy planning group for the coordination of racial nationalist activities in America, Europe, Africa, and Asia.‚Äù Among others associated with ACFAWC were Benjamin H. Freedman, a convert from Judaism to Roman Catholicism who became anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist activist. Freedman was well known to the ADL and the American Jewish Committee as an active supporter of the Arab cause in the Middle East.\n\nFreedman was a financial backer of the author Conde McGinley, publisher of the periodical Common Sense, to which Mullins was a frequent contributor. In 1954, Rabbi Joachim Prinz (1902-1988) was awarded $30,000 in a libel suit against McGinley for having called him a ‚Äúred rabbi.‚Äù The HCUA described Common Sense as \"almost exclusively a vehicle for the exploitation of ignorance, prejudice and fear\" and as ‚Äúa clearinghouse for hate propaganda throughout the country.\" A typical 1962 article in Common Sense was an ‚Äúexpose‚Äù entitled: ‚ÄúZionist Invisible Government Plotting To Establish a World Government Under A Red Dictatorship Led By Asiatic Marxist Jews.‚Äù[14]\n\nAround the end of his life, Mullins began writing for Willis Carto‚Äôs magazine Barnes Review. Carto a longtime figure on the American far-right was an influential political racial theorists through the Liberty Lobby and successor organizations which he helped create. The Liberty Lobby, which was active in the 1950s, is regarded as the source of an insurgent wing of the Patriot Movement through its promotion of themes of White supremacy and anti-Semitism. While in prison for possessing falsified passports, Francis Parker Yockey was visited by Carto who eventually became the chief advocate and publisher of his ideas.\n\nYockey was active with many far-right causes around the world and remains one of the seminal influences in many extremist right movements. By fusing anti-Semitism with anti-Americanism, Yockey identified the United States rather than Russia as Europe‚Äôs main enemy. Unlike most European and American neo-Fascists who advocated an alliance with the United States against Communism, Yockey spent the rest of his life attempting to forge an alliance between the worldwide forces of Communism and the international network of the extreme Right.\n\nYockey believed that true Rightists should aid the spread of Communism and Third World anti-colonial movements wherever possible, with an aim toward weakening or overthrowing the United States. Yockey spent part of 1953 meeting Gamal Nasser in Cairo, and maintaining links with the CIA‚Äôs leading Nazi, Otto Skorzeny, Hitler‚Äôs former star commando.[15] Yockey worked briefly for the Egyptian Information Ministry, writing anti-Zionist propaganda, seeing Arab nationalism as another ally to challenge \"the Jewish-American power.‚Äù\n\nYockey was continuously pursued by the FBI for over a decade and was finally arrested in 1960, when authorities discovered falsified passports and birth certificates in his suitcase. Betraying his interest in the occult, papers found at the time of his arrest included his own essays on the principle of polarity in the psyche, a book on palmistry and politics, and a bibliography of books on the ‚Äúsecond body,‚Äù on reincarnation and on cosmic rays.[16]\n\nCarto also belonged at one time to the John Birch Society.[17] In Roads to Dominion: Right-Wing Movements and Political Power in the United States, sociologist Sara Diamond noted that to reduce the cost of producing and distributing anti-Communist materials, corporations turned to non-profit organizations such as the JBS.[18] According to Eustace Mullins, who claims that he was told personally by one of its founders Revilo Oliver, whom he regarded as a ‚Äúgood friend,‚Äù that the JBS was created by Nelson Rockefeller who appointed Robert C. Welch, a 32nd degree Mason, to found and run the organization.[19]\n\nWhen Revilo Oliver left the JBS, he became editorial advisor for Carto‚Äôs Institute for Historical Review. Carto ran a group called Youth for George Wallace to aid the third party presidential campaign of George Wallace in 1968. Wallace‚Äôs anti-desegregation campaign galvanized much of the American far-right and white supremacist groups. A memo in the FBI file of Eustace Mullins discusses an article he wrote which was published in Conde McGinley‚Äôs Common Sense, that developed the theme ‚Äúthat the Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation in schools is the culmination of a Communist International directive to the CPUSA to use the Negro racial issue and the issue of civil rights as a method to weaken America.‚Äù Mullins lied, claiming the document: ‚Äúis in the files of the FBI today but the Director is under strict orders not to reveal (it) at any cost because it would brand the Supreme Court as a front or agent of the Communist International.‚Äù[20] No such document was ever found.\n\nWhen the campaign failed, he converted what remained of the organization into the National Youth Alliance. As National Chairman for this group, Carto was successful in recruiting Dr. William Pierce, who after Rockwell‚Äôs death, reorganized it into the American neo-Nazi group, the National Alliance in 1974, of which Pierce became the leader.\n\nIn 1987, Mullins wrote a strange work called The Curse of Canaan, which regurgitates ideas expressed by Christian Identity minister William Potter Gale. Gale, a former senior officer on General Douglas MacArthur‚Äôs staff, warned the world that a satanic Jewish conspiracy disguised as communism was corrupting public officials and the courts, undermining the United States and wrecking its divinely inspired Constitution. Jews, explained Gale, were offspring of the devil, while non-whites were ‚Äúmud people‚Äù and whites were the real Hebrews of the Bible. ‚ÄúArise and fight!‚Äù Gale preached in an infamous sermon broadcast to Kansas farmers in 1982. ‚ÄúIf a Jew comes near you, run a sword through him,‚Äù he summoned them. But, it turns out that Gale was descended on his father‚Äôs side from a long line of devout Jews, as explained Daniel Levitas.[21]\n\nMullins followed the course of history as a battle between the descendants of Shem against the descendants of Canaan. The descendants of Canaan are polluted through interbreeding with a ‚Äúpre-Adamite‚Äù population, who are black-skinned, and with demons from the time of the Sons of God of Genesis. Throughout history they represented parasitical merchants, beginning with the Phoenicians and to the Black Nobility of our time. The descendants of Shem, or Semites, he believes, should not be confused with the Jews, who are impostors descended from Edomite Khazars. The descendants of Shem are the builders of civilization, and ancestors of the Irish. Thus, explains Mullins, ‚Äúthe history of mankind for the past three thousand years has been the history of struggle between the fair-skinned descendants of Shem and the darker-skinned descendants of his brother, Ham, yet you will not find this struggle defined in any historical work.‚Äù\n\n\n[1] Saunders.

LaRouche has had bodyguards connected to the Ku Klux Klan in the United States. The KKK is a Catholic controlled organization since Albert Pike took it over and have their clothing based on the secret societies of Catholic Italy such as the P2 and Teutonic Knights. Albert Pike was the Sovereign Commander of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. Albert Pike was mastered by Jesuit soldier, Pierre-Jean de Smet SJ and it was the Jesuit Order who really created the Scottish Rite in order to take over Worldwide Freemasonry aka Templarism. The Jesuits being the original Aragon Templars spared by the Pope connected to the Order of the Calatrava and Order of the Montessa. So now can we see the Papal connections?\n\nI remember Tarpley attacking people for highlighting the Jesuits! These are Catholics my friend just like most the anti-Zionist crowd and they all have a Papal agenda. Sovereign Washington DC has no power over the Sovereign Vatican. The Vatican controls Washington D.C. which was created out of Roman Catholic land belonging to the Pope and Carroll families. You have part of Virginia and part of Maryland giving us the Virgin Mary or Queen Semiramis of Babylon. It was the same Carroll family who created Georgetown ‚Äòmilitary fortress‚Äô University which dominates Washington D.C and the United States of America. The U.S. Pope aka Cardinal Timothy Dolan has no allegiance to the U.S. and every allegiance to the Pope (Sun door) to which is he one of many hinges. Timothy Dolan does not control the United States either, he is mastered by the Jesuit Order power at Washington D.C. which is Thomas Smolich SJ who answers directly to James Grummer SJ a direct aid to the Superior General based in the Curia Generalizia in sovereign Borgo Santo Spirito protected by Jesuit trained King Juan Carlos of Spain‚Äôs CNI intelligentsia.\n\nNow getting back to Washington D.C. you will notice this is where Webster Tarpley lives and thus this should also ring alarm bells. At one time this area was known as little Rome in 1663 property records and today it is modeled off Rome such as the Capitol Building (Farnese Acorn of Zeus) etc. May I remind you that Washington D.C. was planned at the Villa Farnese in Luzio, Italy way before anyone had a clue it was to be. Villa Farnese being the old war rooms of the Jesuit Order and the Council of Trent counter-Reformation and the model for The Pentagon that is the open military power over the World today. Lets remind ourselves that the Council of Trent still stands today and that it curses all protestants with death over one-hundred times.\n\n-= The Unhived Mind\n\nI remember when the patriotic British Constitutional Group citizen arrested a judge at Birkenhead Court. The first thing Tarpley said was that it was a British Intelligence controlled event. This arrest was nothing to do with British Intelligence, the event was all by patriot people for the nations of England, Scotland and Wales. Tarpley was trying to take the excitement and big event away from the arrest by trying to turn truth sayers into suspicious people against the BCG.\n\n-= The Unhived Mind</blockquote>\n\nTaken from <a href=\"http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress4/webster-tarpley-the-jesuits-are-on-the-side-of-the-british-empire/#comments\" target=\"_blank\">Webster Tarpley ‚Äì The Jesuits are on the side of the British Empire</a>:<blockquote>Yes Tarpley was once connected with LaRouche but there was obviously some sort of disagreement that took place. I guess Tarpley wanted to do what he wanted to do rather than what Lyndon wanted. I think Tarpley is more practical than Lyndon LaRouche and as Lyndon says, being practical is a major downfall. Dr John Coleman took most of his work from the Executive Intelligence Review which is one of the finest intelligence groups around. You have to take the good angles of all three of these people and add them together with other knowledge gained that fits your gut feeling. I‚Äôve said that people quoting the Superior General of the Jesuits claiming he ruled the world is wrong to do so. The quote that‚Äôs quoted comes from 1720 and as you heard by 1767 the Jesuits were hindered not to mention finished in 1773 at the hands of the Pope. So what may have been somewhat true at one time doesn‚Äôt mean it continues. Now if you‚Äôre zionists or another shadow group ask yourself wouldn‚Äôt it be a good idea to put all the attention on another power and twist it so this misinformation diverts attention away from yourself? Right now it is quite obvious who‚Äôs ruling the roost and it‚Äôs in your face but if one highlights it then the censorship and suppression occurs. So for example when I put a video on Jewtube titled ‚ÄòZionism vs Islam blah blah‚Äô the video was quickly removed but the exact same video titled ‚ÄòCatholicism vs Islam blah blah‚Äô was left up until the entire channel was censored months later. The holohoax is a prime example of the censorship and forced control. Both Tarpley and LaRouche shield the enemy whilst exposing parts of the enemy so whilst we find out about Venice from these people we don‚Äôt get to understand the connection of Venice (The Chosen) with Satanic Samaria. So as I‚Äôve said before eat the meat and spit out the bones. LaRouche will explain how British powers took over certai Jewish powers he was working with in Israel but when you understand the New Venice to Venice to Samaria connection then you can see it‚Äôs still all down to the tribe. People seem to think that Britain is all about some kind of European white race nobility but Britain sings to the tune of the Juda pied piper.\n\n‚òÜ¬¥¬®)\n.¬∑¬¥ ¬∏.¬∑‚òÖ¬®) ¬∏.¬∑‚òÜ¬®)\n‚òÖ(¬∏.¬∑¬¥ (¬∏.*¬¥ ¬∏.¬∑¬¥\n`¬∑-‚òÜ The Unhived Mind\n\nhttp://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress3/catholics-unveiled-masonic-jewish-plot-in-1936/\nhttp://www.catholicvoice.co.uk/pinay/\n\n\nLyndon LaRouche is the only man who‚Äôs actually been within the high end political and government systems as he‚Äôs been an adviser to President Ronald Reagan. Lyndon was the main guy behind the idea and creation of the Strategic Defense Initiative and for this he was jailed by George H.W Scherff (Bushfraud). Why? The SDI was a Promethean idea and programme that was to be used for the good of mankind but of course the Zeusian filth scuppered it and belittled the programmed. The only part of the SDI programme they let you use or know of is the GPS network. The Scherff family were directly behind the attempted assassination on Ronald Reagan. LaRouche has dealt with world leaders and even today many Promethean governments follow his ideas and work aided by his wife Helga LaRouche who‚Äôs usually in Asia aiding BRICS like projects. The whole model of the BRICS system is based on the work of Lyndon LaRouche. The underpinnings of the conspiracy arena actually stem from Lyndon LaRouche and Eustace Mullins which is similar to how the true underpinnings of the exposure of World War 2 comes from David Irving and Ernst Zundel. These kinds of people are what I term originals meaning they give totally original information based on real research where they‚Äôve gone through documents at the highest levels and pay a lot of money for such documents. In other words these people are the true sourcers of real information. So for example why listen to Edward G. Griffin about the Federal Reserve when he‚Äôs regurgitating information that Eustace Mullins presented a long time before him. If Mullins hadn‚Äôt sourced the information thanks to Ezra Pound then Griffin wouldn‚Äôt have made his exposure of the Federal Reserve. You don‚Äôt see a lot of credit to LaRouche because most of the alternative media is fully controlled by the Scherff (Bushfraud) family. So instead the Scherff‚Äôs create pied pipers using part LaRouche data hoping you never fall onto LaRouche. LaRouche is a very dangerous figure to the Scherff‚Äôs because he‚Äôs a genius in his mind, has the connections but more importantly he has serious Promthean solutions. What the Scherff‚Äôs don‚Äôt want is solutions and that‚Äôs why the alternative media almost always never gives a true solution. The alternative media was designed to divert and create selfhelplessness. It‚Äôs totally idiotic not to think that the alternative media is mostly controlled by the enemy. Even some of the somewhat legit alternative media ends up being infiltrated.\n\n‚òÜ¬¥¬®)\n.¬∑¬¥ ¬∏.¬∑‚òÖ¬®) ¬∏.¬∑‚òÜ¬®)\n‚òÖ(¬∏.¬∑¬¥ (¬∏.*¬¥ ¬∏.¬∑¬¥\n`¬∑-‚òÜ The Unhived Mind</blockquote>\n\nWhen's all said and done, some might try to group me with the sources that I've cited and take things out of context. Though I am an Anti Zionist, I'm not Anti fake Judahite-Samaritan/Khazarians as a race, I'm Anti Rabbinism which is Pharisaism which had managed to trick all those that call themselves Jews and rejecting that Judahites died out while Christians replaced them biblicly through Jesus Christ as the temple was made desolate by God. Does that mean that I'm anti immigration? Of course not, I'm anti OPEN immigration, pro limited integration immigration, where \"limited\" for a big country like USA is limited to around a quarter of a million per year instead of a million legal immigrants and the uncounted million of illegal immigrants per year(See: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ9dhqo0LA8\" target=\"_blank\">Roy's 'Jay-Walking' on Capitol Mall reveals real immigration tradition</a>) for a total of 2+ million legal and illegal immigrants per year. The fake Judahites need to be kicked out of power, not necessarily kicked out to Madagascar as Hitler contemplated in doing. They can live among the people, just as people, without their Satanic religion that is where Catholicism although was already pagan, had gotten Babylonian paganism from the Jews. Am I for the facist Christian Identity movement? Of course not, but Identitarian Christianity is not the Christian Identitarian Movement which though both are Anti Zionists, the Christian Identity movement claims to be \"the real Jews\" to be their race whether it be white, black, brown, malay, red, yellow, but the other being Identitarian Christianity doesn't. I don't have a drop of white or black blood in me and since I believe that the non-repentive Judahites died out which the Christian Judahites became just Christians abandoning their Jewish (Rabbinism) ways, I'm far from being a Christian Identitarian. Abraham's seed is Christ Jesus which through Christ are we adopted in God's family, not through the Judahites, not through the Jews, Jesus Alone saves. Just because LaRouche and friends in the \"EIR\" promotes certain humanitarian solutions doesn't mean that he's wrong, neither is his retelling of history based off of much research to be wrong. He exposes the Jesuits occasionally, the Jews, but his focus is mostly \"Promethean\" (see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/eleven-past-nine/\" target=\"_blank\">Eleven Past Nine</a> to learn what \"Promethean\" means in this context) solutions which isn't always practical short term, but long term solutions through long term goals. That doesn't mean I think Pythagoras and Plato was correct in everything they say which both got their inspiration partially in Egypt, Phoenicia, and the Hebrew Kabbalah. There's possibly some connections between Moses and the oracles of Orpheus as David Livingstone exposes: <a href=\"http://www.conspiracyschool.com/blog/plato-kabbalist\" target=\"_blank\">Plato the Kabbalist</a>. This could however be the Jews trying to take credit for Gnosticism of what they never made themselves like say the platonic solids being one of them.\n\nDo I think David Livingstone is 100% correct? He believes that the tomb of Jesus was found while promoting a humanistic, politically correct form of Jesus that the Jewish Ebionites pushed in their delusion at least exoterically while esoterically pushing the concept of the race as the \"Messiah\" like any Jew sneak into any form of Christianity that they manage to infiltrate. Matt Slick, Chris White and many others including the professors that were interviewed by the film crew debunked James Tabor's tomb which he disregards what Christian Apologists and the professors had give out their specific biblical and historical requirements in finding Jesus' tomb if there is one still intact. Do I think Craig Oxley is 100% correct? You can see here how his opinions had changed about Lyndon LaRouche and Webster Tarpley, though he thinks Tarpley is wrong about some things. He's probably indifferent to Christianity after he removed his controlled alternative media ties to Eric Jon Phelps and friends then came out with exposing the Jewish and Venetian takeover of Catholicism and how the Reformation was controlled. He's probably still partial to Sumerian myths more than the bible itself while trying to have an open mindset in things he's not sure about. Do I think that I am what I don't agree with that others share that I shared a part of their concepts without explaining as to what I take in and spit out? Don't you think it's really childish to try to label me at this point? I'm a puzzle piece that doesn't fit in any jigsaw puzzle except in God that I'm made whole. I have the wisdom and faith by the grace of God not be caught up in trying to please man through a false form of justification through works as if it merits salvation. It is because God had given me the mercy to know the epistemological nature of truth through God through the Holy Spirit received through the blood of Christ that covers me, not my own works nor blood that I can be able to discern and have comfort. My work is sharing the truth which I've labored in gathering intel and typing these words out. I am not saved because I do these things, neither do I know if I'm 100% saved, but I don't worry about my own salvation because whatever happens, God's will is done. I might be God's instrument and robot, but it isn't I that makes the sound nor controlling my own will.\n\nTaken from <a href=\"http://www.henrymakow.com/catholic-church-always-crypto-jewish.html\" target=\"_blank\">Catholic Church Always Crypto Jewish</a>:<blockquote>JESUITS SPREAD CHURCH CORRUPTION\n\nBlizzard claims that the doctrine of the Protestants was corrupted by Talmudists. There is no doubt that factions within the Protestant Reformation were undermined by Judaic/Babylonian religious beliefs.\n\nHowever, Blizzard has it backwards. The Judaic/Babylonian corruption flowed from Rome. For example, Augustus Toplady (1740-1778), the author of the famous hymn Rock of Ages, concluded that Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609) was a secret agent of the Jesuits. Arminius' purpose was to infect the Christian church with heathen Catholic doctrine. Arminius was not the only Roman Catholic agent of deception sent to undermine Christian doctrine; there have been many others.\n\nToplady's conclusion about Arminius was not just based upon circumstantial inference. The Jesuits themselves have revealed that Arminius was their secret agent sent to poison the doctrine of the Protestant churches. William Laud (1573-1645), the Archbishop of Canterbury, was working secretly with the Jesuits to infect the Church of England (Anglican Church) with Roman Catholic doctrine, including Arminianism. Laud was executed for treason.\n\nA secret Jesuit correspondence found after Laud's death confirmed Arminianism was a \"soveraigne drugge\" designed to undermine the Church of England. The Jesuit reiterated in the letter for emphasis the importance of Arminianism: \"But, to return unto the maine fabricke:--our foundation is Arminianisme.\" As we see today the Jesuits have been largely successful. There are only slight differences today in the doctrines of the Anglican Church and those of Rome. The Anglican Church today has completely gone over to Arminianism.</blockquote>\n \nAlthough I have Ted Pike's \"The Other Israel\" (I don't call people \"reverend\", I don't revere them nor the saints) documentary in my <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/links/\" target=\"_blank\">Links</a> page doesn't mean that I'm an Arminianist. However, I do think his stance on the <a href=\"http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/PseudoBibicalEsther.html\" target=\"_blank\">Book of Esther</a> being removed from the biblical canon is fine by me. A real Christian's work will never flourish because a real Christian won't play the game of the elites that keeps them down. I don't admit defeat, but I do realize how foolish some Christians have in creating a utopia without Jesus burning every goat up from a fire baptism before creating a New Heaven, New Earth, New Jerusalem. See: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/partial-preterism/\" target=\"_blank\">Partial Preterism</a>. Do I think that there isn't any form of prophecy still going on? I'm more flexible when it comes to the book of Revelation but I'm a Historicist first, Partial Preterist second so yes I do think the Book of Revelation was written before 66 Anno Domini or else Christian Apologists would have to call Apostle John concocting postdiction as prediction, which he is not.\n\nThe four giants of the Venetian Conspiracy movement had given way for people a better grasp of history, but it must not ever be only through their spectacles, we must not forget all sides of history before we come to an epistemological interpretation from ontological sources of history. Only through biblical Christianity can there be an epistemological understanding of the drama of mankind throughout the ages, for it is all His story, not ours. It is such a shame that so little people are generally close to what I'm looking for in my research, many of them don't know the mystery of gravity or incoherent magnetism (look up Theoria Apophasis' videos on Youtube) nor the basis of all effective diets as exposed by Butter Bob Briggs and by Aajonus Vonderplanitz in a different sense.

Let‚Äôs just take my religion by itself. Christianity... The church is bigger than any government in the world. Then you add in Muslims, you add in Hindus, you add in all the different religions, and you use those houses of worship as distribution centers, not just for spiritual care but for health care. What could be done?\n\n‚ÄúGovernment has a role and business has a role and churches, house of worship have a role.

So anyway, then in the 21st century I said that now we‚Äôre going global.‚Äù (Speech to Religious Newscasters Association Convention in 2005)\n\nHere we see that, despite the positive connotations attached to the word, ‚Äúreformation‚Äù does not necessarily mean that the end result will be the spiritual enrichment of Christianity, in other words, a Christianity more faithful to Scripture. To ‚Äúreform‚Äù may also mean ‚Äúto form again,‚Äù which is to restructure and, by implication, to change into a completely different entity. ‚ÄúTransformation‚Äù‚Äîa trendy redefinition of ‚Äúreformation‚Äù‚Äîis also a term commonly heard from today‚Äôs Evangelical leaders. Given their unbiblical teachings, a ‚ÄúTransformation of the Church‚Äù by false teachers like Rick Warren would ‚Äútransform‚Äù Christianity into another religion, even if it retained the nominal label of ‚ÄúChristian.‚Äù \n\nPlans for a future and final Reformation of the Church were developed by leading occultists of the 17th century Rosicrucian Enlightenment. The documentation we present on this report represents our research into the Rosicrucian infiltration of the Protestant Reformation and the Rosicrucian plan for yet another ‚Äúre-formation‚Äù of the Church. Actually, our research was originally undertaken to determine if the Protestant Reformation was from the outset a work of the Rosicrucians for the purpose of dividing and conquering Christianity.\n\nThe following outline contains information gleaned from various sources, but primarily from the works of high level occultists, with special focus on the Rosicrucians.

Despite their differences, this league of religions will be most united in three particular areas:\n‚Äú1. To foster the view that all religions (in which they mistakenly include Christianity) share the same God and are one in their ultimate ambitions. 2. To create permanent world peace and justice through cooperation with a similarly-confederated form of world government (e.g., the United Nations). 3. To propagate the concept that biblical, evangelical Christianity is a hindrance to ‚Äòevolutionary‚Äô progress and spiritual growth on this planet.‚Äù (Alan Morrison, The Serpent &amp; the Cross, K. &amp; M.

Is it to live through the centuries of the future, and to continue to play a part in moulding the thought of the evolving western races? If it is to live, it must regain the knowledge it has lost, and again have its mystic and its occult teachings; it must again stand forth as an authoritative teacher of spiritual verities, clothed with the only authority worth anything, the authority of knowledge. If these teachings be regained, their influence will soon be seen in wider and deeper views of truth; dogmas, which now seem like mere shells and fetters, shall again be seen to partial presentments of fundamental realities. First, Esoteric Christianity will reappear in the ‚ÄòHoly Place‚Äô, in the Temple so that all who are capable of receiving it may follow its lines of published thought; and secondly, Occult Christianity will again descend into the adytum, dwelling behind the veil which guards the ‚ÄòHoly of Holies‚Äô, into which only the Initiate may enter‚Ä¶‚Äù (Annie Besant, Esoteric Christianity, pp. 26-7)\n\nMEDIEVAL Gnostic sects\n\nThe Merovingian Jews converted to Christianity and founded monastic orders in order to infiltrate the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n‚ÄúThe Merovingian Franks (450-741) built monasteries as a means of infiltration...for Merovingian monasteries later became Benedictine/ Cistercians... Pope Gregory the Great‚Ä¶promoted Benedictine monasticism. His feast day is the day he became pope, September 3 [590 AD]. This was accomplished by the infiltration of the Church, for Gregory was part of that infiltration. Sept. 3 became a day of victory for the Red Movement when he was installed as their pope, for Gregory marks the history of the papacy in that he was the very first ‚ÄòMONK‚Äô to become a pope.‚Äù (Merovingian Infiltration of the Church Through Monasticism)\n\nGnostic sects of the Middle Ages preached the divinity of man, and called this false gospel the Eternal Evangel.\n\n‚ÄúJohn of Parma, Boccaccio, Petrarch, St Catherine of Sienna, and St Bridget of Sweden...as also various sects, Waldensians, Albigensians, Begards, Dolcinists, all of whom, according to Quinet, Joachim of Fiore and the Eternal Evangel appear as a constant...‚Äù - 256:79\n\n‚ÄúLeroux saw the thirteenth century as one of extraordinary religious ferment and, with a fine disregard for doctrinal differences, put all the heretics into one basket -- Amalricians, Albigensians, Waldensians, Cathars, Apostolic Begards, Followers of Eon de l‚ÄôEtiole, and Pierre de Bruys, Joachites, and so on -- for according to him they were all preaching the doctrine of the new evangel, of a religion superior to Christianity.‚Äù - 256:88\n\n‚Äú...[George Sand] echoes Leroux in pointing to all those earlier ‚Äòvoices of St John‚Äô who sustain the heresy of the Evangel, including Joachim of Fiore, John of Parma, St Francis...

Men could only suggest that both popes should be persuaded to resign (which they would not), or that a great council should be held, as long before at Nicea or Chalcedon. Canon law, however, would not recognize the possibility of such a council unless convened by the pope, and the fourteenth century canonists had worked out an extreme doctrine of the plenitude of papal power. The study by the twelfth century canonists at Bologna of the Digest and the Code had influenced the concept of papal sovereignty: theologians, for the great canonists were theologians, had restated the limits of the plenitudo potestatis papae after this study of Roman sovereignty. Dr. Walter Ullmann, in his recent notable book on Medieval Papalism, quotes the fourteenth century papalists as asserting that the pope, in the fulness of his power, was beyond the reach of any mortal, emperor, king or any other. There was no one who could say to the pope, ‚ÄòCur ita facies?‚Äô The pope could do and say whatever he pleased to do and say in all and everything: he was above the law, whether natural (and, as it were divine) or whether humanly devised. The Roman principle that the prince was above the law was translated to the ecclesiastical prince. All human and divine law was entrusted to him alone: whoever resisted his power, resisted the ordinance of God. ‚ÄòIn the conception of the canonists,‚Äô Dr. Ullmann writes, ‚Äòthe pope was truly God on earth.‚Äô‚Äù (Margaret Deanesly, The Significance of the Lollard Bible)\n\n‚ÄúPopes, Cardinals, and officials of the Chancery and Apostolic Camera appointed bishops, collected taxes, and imposed disreputable political interdicts and excommunications throughout much of Christendom with greater abandon than ever before. They did so in tight association with countless princes and other representatives of the late medieval Establishment. Bankers were particularly welcome in their entourage. As Alvaro Pelayo, himself a fervent supporter of the Holy See, noted in De planctu ecclesiae, ‚ÄòWhenever I entered the chambers of the ecclesiastics of the Papal Court, I found brokers and clergy engaged in weighing and reckoning the money which lay in heaps before them.‚Äô (Pastor, I, 72).\n\n‚ÄúA myriad of astonishing abuses, many of them the product of exceedingly pro-papal canonists influenced heavily by Roman Law and purely utilitarian power considerations, became associated with the Avignon administration. Charitable covers for raking in illicit funds were multiplied. Sees were left vacant or filled in ways that furthered the increase of gross curial muscle and wealth. Legal cases were painfully delayed so as to milk more loot from long-suffering plaintiffs and defendants. And, once again, all this was done in dangerous cahoots with locally important political and banker hacks.\n\n‚ÄúEven more destructive was the treatment of diocesan matters as property rather than pastoral questions. Bishoprics were assigned either to curial officials‚Äîto provide, from their endowments, salaries the Papacy could not otherwise pay‚Äîor to friends of political allies whose cooperative behavior needed to be rewarded. Since it was impossible for papal employees to leave their governmental positions in Avignon to tend to even one diocese‚Äîmuch less the two or more often entrusted to their misuse‚Äîepiscopal charges inevitably entailed the same absenteeism already practiced by the pope himself. Perhaps the most bizarre long term development from such unfortunate policies was to be the creation of nominal ‚Äòbishops‚Äô who were often not even priests. Lay ‚Äòbishops‚Äô got the revenues from their ‚Äòproperty‚Äô, and then employed some hireling to do the episcopal tasks they themselves could not legitimately perform.\n\n‚Äú...Avignon‚Äôs abuses merely confirmed the convictions of those who already thought of the Church and her mission as a blasphemous work of Satan. This was the major reason why her scandals were so detested by orthodox believers.‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Great Western Schism‚Äù) \n\nJOHN WYCLIFFE\n\n‚ÄúA word then about Wycliffe‚Äôs anti-clericalism, a factor now so much stressed as one of the causes of the sixteenth century Reformation. Anti-clericalism did not begin with Wycliffe or in England: it existed in France at the beginning of the fourteenth century. It spread from the south French university of Montpellier, a great law school, which trained most of the anti-clerical courtiers and ministers of Philip IV...\n\n‚ÄúTo sum up, then: Wycliffe‚Äôs translation of the whole Bible was an undertaking with a political side: the lay party could use it against the clericals: disendowment was in the air. But the spiritual side of Wycliffe‚Äôs intention was much the stronger. He desired to put the clock back: to restore the Church to her poor and primitive state. He had no realisation that in destroying the institutions of the Church of his day he might be endangering the Christian religion itself...‚Äù (Margaret Deanesly, The Significance of the Lollard Bible)\n\nThe purge of the Knights Templar occurred from 1307 to 1314 at which time the Merovingian Pope and his curia were setting up their headquarters in Avignon. John Wycliffe was born in 1327 and entered the political scene around 1376, at the close of the Avignon Papacy and onset of the Great Schism. Wycliffe may have been an agent of the network of the secret societies that Henry Saint Clair had established on the British Isles. According to Prince Michael Stewart, President of the European Council of Princes, said to be a constitutional advisory body to the European Union, following the Templar purge on the Continent, the Celtic Church of Scotland welcomed the refugee Knights Templar who then formed the Order of the Rosy Cross. The first order of business of the Knights of the Rosy Cross was to meet with the Pope at Avignon. \n\n‚ÄúThe established Roman Church may have betrayed the Templars, but in Scotland they found something far more trustworthy and tangible: a sacred royal house, and a Priest-King of the Celtic Church succession. ...the Knights became part of the Scottish Government as the appointed Royal Bodyguard, with the Order established as ‚ÄòGuardian of the King of Scots by day and by night‚Äô... A new order was then formed, called the Elder Brothers of the Order of the Rosy Cross, and several of the Rosy Cross Knights then sailed to France for a meeting with Pope John XXII at Avignon. \n\n‚ÄúMany historians have presumed therefore that the Knights Templars must have been disbanded in Scotland, but this was not the case; it was simply that [Robert the] Bruce had contrived the secret Order to become even more secretive. Indeed, the Order of the Knights of the Rosy Cross...was a very successful cover.‚Äù (The Forgotten Monarchy of Scotland, p. 65)\n\nHaving formed the secretive Order of the Rosy Cross in Scotland, the Templars sent a contingent of Rosy Cross Knights to France for a meeting with the Pope at Avignon. This is documented with a footnote: ‚ÄúThe Vatican Archives, Rome‚Äù What would prompt the persecuted Templars to return to the headquarters of the Catholic Church which had martyred many knights of their Order? The high-level meeting between the fugitive Templars and the Avignon Pope reeks of collusion. The Templars‚Äô newly-formed Order of the Rosy Cross had been absorbed into the Celtic Church of Scotland, and it is with the Celtic Church of Scotland that a connection to John Wycliffe is found. On the website of The Bible Museum, Inc., a source for rare and antique Bibles, is a chronological history of the English Bible. A section of this history, titled ‚ÄúThe Pre-Reformation History of the Bible,‚Äù states that a secret society known as the Culdees ‚Äúchose John Wycliffe to lead the world out of the Dark Ages.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOn the Scottish Island of Iona, in 563 AD, a man named Columba started a Bible College. For the next 700 years, this was the source of much of the non-Catholic, evangelical Bible teaching through those centuries of the Dark and Middle Ages. The students of this college were called ‚ÄòCuldees‚Äô, which means ‚Äòcertain stranger‚Äô. The Culdees were a secret society, and the remnant of the true Christian faith was kept alive by these men during the many centuries that led up to the Protestant Reformation‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúIn the late 1300‚Äôs, the secret society of Culdees chose John Wycliffe to lead the world out of the Dark Ages. Wycliffe has been called the ‚ÄòMorning Star of the Reformation‚Äô‚Ä¶\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶It was not as a teacher or preacher that Wycliffe gained his position in history; this came from his activities in ecclesiastical politics, in which he engaged about the mid-1370s, when his reformatory work also began. In 1374 he was among the English delegates at a peace congress at Bruges. He may have been given this position because of the spirited and patriotic behavior with which in the year 1366 he sought the interests of his country against the demands of the papacy. It seems he had a reputation as a patriot and reformer; this suggests the answer to the question how he came to his reformatory ideas.‚Äù (Greatsite.com)\n\nAccording to The Bible Museum, Inc., the name ‚ÄúCuldee‚Äù means ‚Äúcertain stranger,‚Äù however, according to the Ancient Order of the Culdees of Iona, the word means ‚ÄúChaldea,‚Äù as in ancient Babylonia: ‚ÄúOrigin of the word Culdee. The name Culdee comes from Chaldee, (Chaldeans pronounce the word Chaldee as Kaldee or Culdee), in the sense that it alludes to Abraham the Chaldee, who left his home, worldly wealth, kindred and idol making to find the Promised Land.‚Äù The 1611 King James Version used the word ‚ÄúCaldees‚Äù with reference to the Babylonians or ‚ÄúChaldeans,‚Äù which was the updated spelling in later editions.\n\nSee: The Lollard Movement: Avignon Papacy: John Wycliffe\n\nJAN HUS\n\n‚ÄúWe often think of Martin Luther lighting the torch of the Reformation, but the Czechs have the oldest Reformation tradition in mainland Europe. Long before Luther nailed his theses to the door of Wittenberg Church in 1517, the Czechs had established their own national Protestant church with their own vernacular Bible and hymn book. In 1406 or 1407 and perhaps as early as 1385, Czech students studying at Oxford brought back to Prague the writings of John Wyclif.\n\n‚ÄúThe rector of Charles University in Prague, Jan Hus (1372?-1415), a man of outstanding intellectual gifts and personal integrity, took up Wyclif‚Äôs ideas. In particular, he took up the belief that, in true remembrance of the Last Supper, the Communion, or Eucharist, should be given in both kinds‚Äîbread and wine. The chalice became the symbol of the Hussite revolution, and Hussite supporters were often referred to as ‚ÄòUtraquists,‚Äô meaning ‚Äòin both kinds.‚Äô Jan Hus was a great scholar and a gifted preacher. Between 1402 and 1403 the Bethlehem Chapel in the Old Town district of Prague was regularly packed, standing room only, with people eager to hear him expound on the Bible in their own Czech tongue.\n\n‚ÄúIn 1412, Antipope John XXIII declared war on Naples and, to raise money, instituted the practice of selling indulgences ‚Äî official forgiveness by the Church. Hus was outraged and was promptly excommunicated for his protest. Outlawed from Prague, Hus wandered about the countryside preaching and spreading Reformation ideas throughout the country. In 1415 the Council of Constance invited him to explain his views and promised him safe conduct. It was a trap: on false charges he was condemned as a heretic and burned at the stake on July 6, 1415. It was his birthday he was just forty-three years old. Jan Hus began, and Comenius continued, even in exile, the reformed group that came to be called the Unitas Fratrum (the Unity of Brethren), also now known as the Moravian Church, which still exists with a worldwide following. Its formation was formalized in 1457, and it is the oldest of all Protestant churches, with its own hymn book (1505) and Czech-language Bible.‚Äù (The Rosicrucian Enlightenment Revisited, p. 201)\n\n‚ÄúPrague became a Mecca for those interested in esoteric and scientific studies from all over Europe. Hither came John Dee and Edward Kelly, Giordano Bruno and Johannes Kepler. However strange the reputation of Prague in the time of Rudolph it was yet a relatively tolerant city. Jews might pursue their cabalistic studies undisturbed (Rudolph‚Äôs favourite religious adviser was Pistorius, a Cabalist) and the native church of Bohemia was tolerated by an official ‚ÄòLetter of Majesty‚Äô. The Bohemian church, founded by John Huss, was the first of the reformed churches of Europe. Rudolph‚Äôs toleration was extended to the Bohemian church and to the Bohemian Brethren, a mystical brotherhood attached to its teachings. Prague under Rudolph was a Renaissance city, full of Renaissance influences as they had developed in Eastern Europe, a melting pot of ideas, mysteriously exciting in its potentiality for new developments.‚Äù (Francis Yates, The Rosicrucian Enlightenment (p. 26)\n\n‚ÄúWyclif came from England, they explain, from whom Huss took his teaching, alluding to Wyclif‚Äôs influence on the Hussite reformation.‚Äù (Yates, p. 32)\n \nTHE PROTESTANT REFORMATION\n\nThe Reformation divided and destabilized the Roman Catholic Church so that it no longer had the manpower to prosecute heretics.\n\n‚Äú[I]n 1546...Rosslyn...chapel‚Äôs centenary year, the Church of Rome was in a bit of a tizzy.

But this is not all.

Let me explain how this has been done.\n\n‚ÄúWe have induced some of our children to join the Catholic body, with the explicit intimation that they should work in a still more efficient way for the disintegration of the Catholic Church, by creating scandals within her. We have thus followed the advice of our Prince of the Jews who so wisely said: ‚ÄòLet some of your children become canons, so that they may destroy the Church.‚Äô Unfortunately, not all among the ‚Äòconvert‚Äô Jews have proved faithful to their mission. Many of them have betrayed us! But, on the other hand, others have kept their promise and honoured their word. Thus the counsel of our Elders has proved successful.‚Äù \n\nSource: From a series of speeches at the B‚Äônai B‚Äôrith Convention in Paris, published shortly afterwards in the London Catholic Gazette, February, 1936; Paris Le Reveil du Peuple published similar account a little later. (The Catholic Gazette, February, 1936)\n\n‚ÄúAlthough it frequently produced heretics, Italy was no haven for them; the vast majority of nonconformists of Italian origin found it possible to survive only by fleeing the vicinity of the pope and his Inquisition. Among the many classed as heretics by the Roman church, some were distinctly heretical even by our more exacting definition. Two of the most influential were an uncle and a nephew, Laelius and Faustus Socinus (1525-62 and 1539-1604), whose quest for freedom of thought led them from Italy first to Rhaetia (modern Graub√ºnden, Switzerland), and then to Poland. In Poland Faustus took advantage of the nation‚Äôs unique religious tolerance to lay the foundation of modern Unitarianism.\n\n‚ÄúIn contrast to the doctrines of Hoffman, Menno, and Schwenkfeld, these Italian thinkers emphasized not the grandeur of Christ‚Äôs humanity, but its normalcy. Although Servetus had denied the preexistence of Christ, he acknowledge his divinity as the natural Son of God and died with a prayer to Jesus on his lips. The Socini were far more rationalistic and critical. Jesus was a true man‚Äìotherwise he would not have been able to die‚Äìand as man he could not have been God. Of course this is precisely the argument Paul faced when he wrote, ‚ÄòChrist crucified...unto the Greeks foolishness‚Äô (I Cor. 1:23). The reversion to this line of argument makes it look as though the theological struggles of the first five centuries of Christianity were all for naught. This collapse of centuries of laborious theological work within less than half a century of the outbreak of the Reformation is alarming to those of us who believe that the Reformation was a necessary corrective to the doctrinal as well as moral failings of medieval Christianity. It gives substance to the traditional Catholic charge that the Reformation principles of Scripture alone and private interpretation open the floodgates to theological chaos. It is also possible, and in fact to some extent it is even evident, that much of this rationalistic skepticism, criticism and unbelief was active in pre-Reformation Catholicism. Luther‚Äôs successful defiance of Rome and the Inquisition released the pressure seal that had kept skepticism confined, and permitted it to boil over, but Luther did not create it; it had be brewing for centuries...\n\n‚Äú...perhaps we can see in the Reformation era the end of trinitarianism as the unquestioned conviction of Christians.‚Äù (Heresies: Heresy and Orthodoxy in the History of the Early Church, Harold O.J.

Each side was represented by a rose, York by a white rose, and Lancaster by a red rose. At the end of the struggle a partly Welsh noble named Henry Tudor became king. Henry claimed to unify in his person the two rival sides. He chose as his symbol a rose with both red and white petals (i.e. a large white rose with a smaller red rose overlaid on it) and with five green leaves around it. Dr. Clifford Smyth of Ulster supplied Yair Davidiy with color photographs of pictures from the Tudor Period depicting the Tudor rose. These paintings show that there then existed in England a real breed of rose that looked like the Tudor Rose. This rose, unbeknown to Henry, was (says the above quoted Zohar) the symbol of Israel. Henceforth the red and white petal ‚ÄòTudor Rose‚Äô became the symbol of the English monarchs and therefore of England itself. It still is an official symbol of Britain.

Just as all life evolves toward Divine Perfection, so too do metals evolve toward gold. It is this essential process of evolution that the alchemist accelerates with the product of his labor, the catalytic Philosopher‚Äôs Stone, the red powder that transmutes base metal into purest gold. The enigmatic reality behind such a magnum opus can not be explained but only demonstrated. In just such a manner religious gnosis demands direct personal experience rather than pedestrian faith.‚Äù - ‚ÄúWho Were the Alchemists?‚Äù Alchemy Web Site\n\nLuther however repudiated the Kabbalah and the Rabbinic commentaries which rejected the Christological interpretations of the Old Testament Messianic prophecies.\n\n‚ÄúLuther interested himself for a time in the Kabbalah, perhaps under the stimulus of Reuchlin‚Äôs works, but found no great attraction therein. It served him for the most part with material for his attacks upon Rabbinical literature, though on one occasion he says that if he be permitted to submit to the Kabbalistic method, he would say the Tetragram was a symbol of the Holy Trinity, a statement which he deduced from the meanings and the sum of the numbers of the letters. But unlike Pico de Mirandola, instructed by Jochanan Aleman, or Reuchlin, instructed by Antionius Margarith, Luther was repelled by the Kabbalah, and turned to sterner stuff.\n\n‚ÄúHe found this in the Rabbinical commentaries which, with the assistance of his Hebrew professors at Wittenberg, he employed for the explanation of the doubtful ‚ÄòChristological‚Äô passages of the Bible... For the most part, he professed to take the very opposite of Rabbinical suggestions; only rarely does ‚Äòhis Rabbi Solomon‚Äô (Rashi) please him; he heaps adjectives of villification upon the sayings of the Rabbis, calling them ‚Äòdreams, fables, vagaries, absurdities, sophistries, vanities, gossip‚Äô and so forth. He accuses the Jews of being responsible for errors in Jerome; he mocks as Judaistic any insistence upon the rules of grammar in the interpretation of debatable texts... Hence he accused the Jewish critics of his Bible translation of being under the spell of Rabbinic rationalism and literalism, and of desiring for a second time to obscure the text.‚Äù (Louis Israel Newman, Jewish Influence on Christian Reform Movements, pp. 643-645)\n\nLuther‚Äôs seal appeared a century later on a Rosicrucian Manifesto, The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz, authored by Johann Andrea who was Grand Master of the Prieur√© de Sion from 1637-1654.\n\n‚ÄúLuther‚Äôs crest with a black cross on a red heart upon a white rose‚Ä¶set beside an expansion on the letters, F.

Like others before him, Montgomery presumed that no other evidence, save Andreae‚Äôs unfortunate choice of the name Christian Rosencreutz for a persona in the Chymische Hochzeit, linked him to the manifestos. However, Edighoffer and Brecht, working independently, discovered evidence of Andreae‚Äôs involvement in several of the treatises, most notably Confessio fraternitatis.(6) In a commemorative work for his friend Tobias Hess, Andreae had gathered together thoughts and notes from Hess‚Äôs manuscripts as Theca gladii spiritus, sententias quasdem breves vereque philosophicas continens (Strasbourg, 1616), which contained enough citations from Andreae‚Äôs own work, such as De Christiani Cosmoxeni genitura, Judicium (Strasbourg, 1612, dedicated to Hess), to make clear that they had at the very least worked collaboratively.(7) Most importantly, it contains quotations from the Confessio and the Invitatio fraternitatis Christi, which was issued in two parts in 1617 and 1618. Andreae, who alone was responsible for these selections, can thus be clearly linked with two of the three major Rosicrucian tracts, Chymische Hochzeit and Confessio.

The first known Illuminati order (Alumbrado) was founded in 1492 by Spanish Jews, called ‚ÄòMarranos,‚Äô who were also known as ‚Äòcrypto-Jews.‚Äô With violent persecution in Spain and Portugal beginning in 1391, hundreds of thousands of Jews had been forced to convert to the faith of the Roman Catholic Church. Publicly they were now Roman Catholics, but secretly they practiced Judaism, including following the Talmud and the Cabala. The Marranos were able to teach their children secretly about Judaism, but in particular the Talmud and the Cabala, and this huge group of Jews has survived to this very day. After 1540 many Marranos opted to flee to England, Holland, France, the Ottoman empire (Turkey), Brazil and other places in South and Central America. The Marranos kept strong family ties and they became very wealthy and influential in the nations where they lived. But as is the custom with all Jewish people, it did not matter in what nation they lived, their loyalty was to themselves and Judaism.\n\n‚ÄúThe following information is going to be a ‚Äòshock‚Äô to all Roman Catholics. In 1491 San Ignacio De Loyola was born in the Basque province of Guipuzcoa, Spain. His parents were Marranos and at the time of his birth the family was very wealthy. As a young man he became a member of the Jewish Illuminati Order in Spain. As a cover for his crypto Jewish activities, he became very active as a Roman Catholic. On May 20, 1521 Ignatius (as he was now called) was wounded in a battle, and became a semi-cripple. Unable to succeed in the military and political arena, he started a quest for holiness and eventually ended up in Paris where he studied for the priesthood. In 1539 he had moved to Rome where he founded the ‚ÄòJesuit Order,‚Äô which was to become the most vile, bloody and persecuting order in the Roman Catholic Church. In 1540, the current Pope Paul III approved the order. At Loyola‚Äôs death in 1556 there were more than 1000 members in the Jesuit order, located in a number of nations.\n\n‚ÄúSetting up the Jesuit order, Ignatius Loyola devised an elaborate spy system, so that no one in the order was safe. If there was any opposition, death would come swiftly. The Jesuit order not only became a destructive arm of the Roman Catholic Church; it also developed into a secret intelligence service. While the Popes relied more and more on the Jesuits, they were unaware that the hardcore leadership were Jewish, and that these Jews held membership in the Illuminati Order which despised and hated the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n‚ÄúIn 1623 Marranos formed an order in France called ‚ÄòGuerients,‚Äô which in 1722 was changed to an Illuminati Order.\n\nHow Satan Moved in the Centuries\n\n‚ÄúA baby boy was born on February 6, 1748, in Ingolstadt, a city in the German state of Bavaria, 192 years after the death of Ignatius Loyola. His parents were crypto Jews. The name of the boy was Joseph Johann Adam Weishaupt. The Father of Adam held a position of professor at the city university. Adam was educated in the Jesuit Order where he was exposed to the Jesuit organization and its political agenda. Here is a young Jew, who from early childhood learned that he had a secret allegiance to the Talmud and the Cabala, but outwardly he was a dedicated Roman Catholic.‚Äù (How the World Government Rules the Nations)\n\n‚ÄúIlluminati, I-lu-ml-na‚Äôti (‚Äòthe illuminated‚Äô), the name given to themselves by an association of people who professed to have attained to a higher knowledge of God, and heavenly things, and a deeper insight into the spiritual world than the rest of mankind. They were represented by the Alombrados in Spain and the Guerients in France. In the last half of the 18th century a sect of mystics rose in Belgium which from its foundation 1 May 1776 at Ingolstadt, spread over a large portion of Catholic Germany. At first they called themselves ‚ÄòPerfectibilists.‚Äô Their founder was Adam Weishaupt (q.v.), a professor of canon law at Ingolstadt.‚Äù (The Americana: A Universal Library, Vol. 11 )\n\nIgnatius of Loyola was trained at the University of Paris, Montague College, which John Calvin attended during the same time.\n\n‚ÄúHe made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and then studied in Barcelona, Alcala, and, finally, at the University of Paris, where he received the Master of Arts in 1534. Still his fervor did not slacken. At Paris he was to meet companions who were like-minded in spiritual outlook and whose names would become well known in Jesuit annals: Francis Xavier (a Spanish Basque like Ignatius), Favre, Laynez, Salmeron, Rodriguez, Bobadilla. Together they would become ‚Äòthe Company‚Äô, the first Jesuits, defenders of the faith in heretical times. (Defenders of the Faith in Word and Deed, C. P. Connor, p. 54)\n\n‚ÄúThis hub of philosophic thought at the College of Montague trained not only John Calvin, but other important figures of the Catholic Reformation in that day. It is interesting to note that the famous Catholic humanist, Desiderius Erasmus, studied at the College of Montague in 1495, as did Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Catholic monastic and Counter Reformation order, the Jesuits, in 1536. (Calvinism: Spiritual Fusion)\n\nThe Jesuit Order was similar to the Rosicrucian Order in its attachment to the Hermetic occult tradition.\n\n\"Yet of all the branches of the Roman Catholic Church it was the Jesuits who were most like the Rosicrucians. The Renaissance esoteric influences behind the formation of the Jesuit Order have not yet been fully studied. The Order made great use of the Hermetic tradition in appealing to Protestants and to the many other creeds which it encountered in its missionary work. The Hermetic and occult philosophy of the Jesuits received a tremendous formulation in the work of Athanasius Kircher, whose vast work on Hermetic pseudo-Egyptology was published in 1652 and who constantly cites with profound reverence the supposed ancient Egyptian priest, Hermes Trismegestus ...\n\n\"Through their common attachment to Hermetic tradition, the Jesuits and the 'Rosicrucians' were thus foes with a love-hate relationship through a kind of similarity. We have seen that in the furore the Jesuits tried to draw over Rosicrucian symbolism, suggesting that the two Orders were the same, and manufacturing similar emblematics. So the issues could become confused.\" (Frances Yates, The Rosicrucian Enlightenment, p. 230)\n\nJohn Calvin\n\n‚ÄúWe will argue in Chapter 10 that some of the principle architects of the Protestant Reformation, in particular John Calvin of France and John Knox of Scotland, were descendants of Sephardic Jews... We propose that the Reformation, beyond being a movement against Catholicism, should be seen as a movement toward Judaism.‚Äù (When Scotland Was Jewish, pp. 94, 200)\n\nJohn Calvin studied at the University of Paris, Montague College, during the same time period as Ignatius of Loyola.\n\n‚ÄúSeveral able men taught this decade at Montaigu, although we cannot be sure that Calvin attended their courses. ‚Ä¶we may mention the presence at Montaigu of the Scot John Mair (1469-1550). It would be a rather piquant thing if Calvin had been the student of John Mair, who counted Ignatius Loyola among his students. The first Jesuit and the most famous of the Reformers would have followed the same course, with an interval of some years. (Ignatius Loyola, born in 1491, was Calvin‚Äôs elder by eighteen years; he died in 1556, eight years before the Reformer.) Unfortunately, no proof exists that Calvin received instruction from the Scot. The latter had long resided in Paris before returning to his distant country in 1531. He counted among his numerous students John Knox, the future Scottish Reformer. But whether or not he was directly influenced, Calvin repeated in his writings a certain number of themes Mair contributed to popularizing: emphasis on faith, predestination, stressing of the Word, and above the assimilation of logic and grammar. These themes are too precise for one to deny the possibility of an influence by John Mair on John Calvin‚Äôs thought, and too general for one to draw the least positive conclusion from them.‚Äù (Bernard Cottret, Calvin: A Biography, p. 20)\n\nEvidence of Calvin's Jewish ethnicity and religion\n\nJOHN CALVIN / CAUVIN (1509-1564)\n\n‚ÄúJohn (Jean) Calvin was born in 1509 in Picardy, France; the family name was perhaps actually Cauvin. John‚Äôs father, Gerard, was employed as an attorney by the Lord of Noyon. Of John‚Äôs youth we know only that he served the noble family of deMontmor and studied for the priesthood. In early adulthood, Calvin moved to Paris, where he became friends with the two sons of the French king‚Äôs physician. Given their surname and their father‚Äôs occupation, Nicholas and Michael Cop were likely of Crypto-Jewish descent. 7\n\nCalvin‚Äôs father persuaded him to abandon training for an ecclesiastical career and instead pursue an education in the law. However, in 1529 Calvin decided instead to seek an education in the humanities under scholar Andrea Aciate 8 in Bourges, France. Calvin was joined there by a friend from Orleans, Melchior Wolmar. Wolmar instructed Calvin in Greek and later in Paris, Calvin became proficient in Hebrew, as well. From 1532 to 1534, Calvin experienced a religious epiphany, turning to Protestantism. Concurrently, his friend Nicolas Cop was elected rector of the University of Paris. Calvin helped prepare Cop‚Äôs inaugural address which was strongly Protestant in tone. As a result, Cop was ordered to appear before the Parisian Parliament, but fled instead to Basel, Switzerland ‚Äì a Protestant stronghold.\n\n‚ÄúAt the time, a war was in progress between Francis I and Charles V, so Calvin was forced to make his own way to Switzerland through Geneva. In Geneva, William Farel 9 (bearing a Sephardic surname), founder of the Reformed Church in Geneva, convinced Calvin to stay and help preach the new Protestant theology. Calvin obliged and set up several Protestant religious schools in the city.\n\n‚ÄúHowever, theology within the new Protestant movement was in flux; a diversity of theological positions was present even from the earliest days, perhaps due to the desire to overthrow the strict orthodoxy of the Catholic doctrine. Thus Calvin‚Äôs views were shared by some but not by all Reform theologian of the time period. Calvin next moved on to Strasbourg where he married a widow, Idelette de Burre, in 1540. He continued to preach, write and teach in Strasbourg, establishing himself as one of the prime movers of the new theology.\n\n‚ÄúFrom this capsule biography we learn that Calvin‚Äôs father was an attorney in Picardy, which contained at the time a flourishing Marrano colony. 10 Obviously his father was literate and well-educated; he was also an advisor to nobility ‚Äì common traits of Crypto-Jews. Gerard Cauvin was clearly ambitious for his son, guiding his career with an eye toward social and economic advancement. He was not a force of Catholic religious fervor or conventional piety.\n\n‚ÄúWe read also that John chose to learn both Greek and Hebrew, languages which would have permitted him to read the Old Testament (i.e. Torah) in its original form, rather than relying upon Christian translations into Latin. We perceive as well that he favored universal literacy, a Judaic value, that two of his closest friends had Sephardic surnames, and that he married a woman named Idelette de Bure, evidently of possible Sephardic descent. A surviving sketch of John Calvin shows him with leather head covering, full beard and dark features. While we do not presume to judge the sincerity or Christian orientation of his beliefs, we do hold that he was of Crypto-Jewish descent, that he moved in circles that included Marranos, and that his theology would naturally have been influenced by these ancestral and communal ties.‚Äù 11 (pp. 50, 200-201, 204)\n\n7.

One should also not fail to emphasize the importance of the conversion of Saint Paul in the body of Christian literature. Every conversion is, in its way, a road to Damascus. But why did Calvin not cite the Apostle Paul here? Why, moreover, contrary to the expectations of his readers, did he employ the figure of King David?‚Äù (Bernard Cottrett, Calvin: A Biography, p. 69. See: Young Calvin by Alexander Ganoczy)\n\n‚ÄúNow, if my readers derive any fruit and advantage from the labor which I have bestowed in writing these Commentaries, I would have them to understand that the small measure of experience which I have had by the conflicts with which the Lord has exercised me, has in no ordinary degree assisted me, not only in applying to present use whatever instruction could be gathered from these divine compositions, but also in more easily comprehending the design of each of the writers. And as David holds the principal place among them, it has greatly aided me in understanding more fully the complaints made by him of the internal afflictions which the Church had to sustain through those who gave themselves out to be her members, that I had suffered the same or similar things from the domestic enemies of the Church. For although I follow David at a great distance, and come far short of equaling him; or rather, although in aspiring slowly and with great difficulty to attain to the many virtues in which he excelled, I still feel myself tarnished with the contrary vices; yet if I have any things in common with him, I have no hesitation in comparing myself with him. In reading the instances of his faith, patience, fervor, zeal, and integrity, it has, as it ought, drawn from me unnumbered groans and sighs, that I am so far from approaching them; but it has, notwithstanding, been of very great advantage to me to behold in him as in a mirror, both the commencement of my calling, and the continued course of my function; so that I know the more assuredly, that whatever that most illustrious king and prophet suffered, was exhibited to me by God as an example for imitation. My condition, no doubt, is much inferior to his, and it is unnecessary for me to stay to show this. But as he was taken from the sheepfold, and elevated to the rank of supreme authority; so God having taken me from my originally obscure and humble condition, has reckoned me worthy of being invested with the honorable office of a preacher and minister of the gospel. When I was as yet a very little boy, my father had destined me for the study of theology. But afterwards when he considered that the legal profession commonly raised those who followed it to wealth this prospect induced him suddenly to change his purpose. Thus it came to pass, that I was withdrawn from the study of philosophy, and was put to the study of law. To this pursuit I endeavored faithfully to apply myself in obedience to the will of my father; but God, by the secret guidance of his providence, at length gave a different direction to my course. And first, since I was too obstinately devoted to the superstitions of Popery to be easily extricated from so profound an abyss of mire, God by a sudden conversion subdued and brought my mind to a teachable frame, which was more hardened in such matters than might have been expected from one at my early period of life. Having thus received some taste and knowledge of true godliness I was immediately inflamed with so intense a desire to make progress therein, that although I did not altogether leave off other studies, I yet pursued them with less ardor. I was quite surprised to find that before a year had elapsed, all who had any desire after purer doctrine were continually coming to me to learn, although I myself was as yet but a mere novice and tyro. Being of a disposition somewhat unpolished and bashful, which led me always to love the shade and retirement, I then began to seek some secluded corner where I might be withdrawn from the public view; but so far from being able to accomplish the object of my be desire, all my retreats were like public schools. In short, whilst my one great object was to live in seclusion without being known, God so led me about through different turnings and changes, that he never permitted me to rest in any place, until, in spite of my natural disposition, he brought me forth to public notice. Leaving my native country, France, I in fact retired into Germany, expressly for the purpose of being able there to enjoy in some obscure corner the repose which I had always desired, and which had been so long denied me. (John Calvin, Preface to the Psalms)\n\nCalvin was not baptized as an adult and justified infant baptism as the continuation of God‚Äôs covenant of Jewish circumcision.\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶John Calvin‚Ä¶was unsound at the very foundation of the Christian faith. Calvin never gave a testimony of the new birth; rather he identified with his Catholic infant baptism. Note the following quotes from his Institutes: ‚ÄòAt whatever time we are baptized, we are washed and purified once for the whole of life‚Äô (Institutes, IV). ‚ÄòBy baptism we are ingrafted into the body of Christ ... infants are to be baptized ... children of Christians, as they are immediately on their birth received by God as heirs of the covenant, are also to be admitted to baptism‚Äô (Institutes, IV).‚Äù (FBIS, ‚ÄúThe Calvinism Debate‚Äù)\n\n‚ÄúWe have, therefore, a spiritual promise given to the fathers in circumcision, similar to that which is given to us in baptism, since it figured to them both the forgiveness of sins and the mortification of the flesh. Besides, as we have shown that Christ, in whom both of these reside, is the foundation of baptism, so must he also be the foundation of circumcision. For he is promised to Abraham, and in him all nations are blessed. To seal this grace, the sign of circumcision is added.\n\n4. The difference is in externals only\n\n‚ÄúThere is now no difficulty in seeing wherein the two signs agree, and wherein they differ. The promise, in which we have shown that the power of the signs consists, is one in both, viz., the promise of the paternal favour of God, of forgiveness of sins, and eternal life. And the thing figured is one and the same, viz., regeneration. . . . Hence we may conclude, that every thing applicable to circumcision applies also to baptism, excepting always the difference in the visible ceremony. . . For just as circumcision, which was a kind of badge to the Jews, assuring them that they were adopted as the people and family of God, was their first entrance into the Church, while they, in their turn, professed their allegiance to God, so now we are initiated by baptism, so as to be enrolled among his people, and at the same time swear unto his name. Hence it is incontrovertible, that baptism has been substituted for circumcision, and performs the same office.\n\n5. Infants are participants in the covenant\n\n‚ÄúNow, if we are to investigate whether or not baptism is justly given to infants, will we not say that the man trifles, or rather is delirious, who would stop short at the element of water, and the external observance, and not allow his mind to rise to the spiritual mystery? If reason is listened to, it will undoubtedly appear that baptism is properly administered to infants as a thing due to them. The Lord did not anciently bestow circumcision upon them without making them partakers of all the things signified by circumcision. He would have deluded his people with mere imposture, had he quieted them with fallacious symbols: the very idea is shocking. This distinctly declares, that the circumcision of the infant will be instead of a seal of the promise of the covenant. But if the covenant remains firm and fixed, it is no less applicable to the children of Christians in the present day, than to the children of the Jews under the Old Testament. Now, if they are partakers of the thing signified, how can they be denied the sign? If they obtain the reality, how can they be refused the figure? The external sign is so united in the sacrament with the word, that it cannot be separated from it; but if they can be separated, to which of the two shall we attach the greater value? Surely, when we see that the sign is subservient to the word, we shall say that it is subordinate, and assign it the inferior place. Since, then, the word of baptism is destined for infants why should we deny them the signs which is an appendage of the word? This one reason, could no other be furnished, would be amply sufficient to refute all gainsayers. The objection, that there was a fixed day for circumcision, is a mere quibble. We admit that we are not now, like the Jews, tied down to certain days; but when the Lord declares that though he prescribes no day, yet he is pleased that infants shall be formally admitted to his covenant, what more do we ask?\n\n6. Difference in the mode of confirmation only\n\n‚ÄúScripture gives us a still clearer knowledge of the truth. For it is most evident that the covenant, which the Lord once made with Abraham (cf. Gen. 17:14), is not less applicable to Christians now than it was anciently to the Jewish people, and, therefore, that word has no less reference to Christians than to Jews. Unless, indeed, we imagine that Christ, by his advent, diminished or curtailed the grace of the Father - an idea not free from execrable blasphemy. Wherefore, both the children of the Jews, because, when made heirs of that covenant, they were separated from the heathen, were called a holy seed (Ezra 9:2; Isaiah 6:13), and for the same reason the children of Christians, or those who have only one believing parent, are called holy, and, by the testimony of the apostle, differ from the impure seed of idolaters (I Cor. 7:14). Then, since the Lord, immediately after the covenant was made with Abraham ordered it to be sealed, infants by an outward sacrament (Gen. 17:12), how can it be said that Christians are not to attest it in the present day, and seal it in their children?‚Äù (John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book IV, Chapter 16)\n\nCalvinism‚Äôs 5-point T.U.L.I.P. was derived from Gnostic Judaism.\n\nTotal Depravity\n\nUnconditional Election\n\nLimited Atonement\n\nIrresistible Grace\n\nPerseverance of the Saints\n\n‚ÄúThose, therefore, whom God passes by the reprobates, and that for no other cause but because he is pleased to exclude them from the inheritance which he predestines to his children...\n\n‚ÄúThe decree, I admit, is, dreadful; and yet it is impossible to deny that God foreknow what the end of man was to be before he made him, and foreknew, because he had so ordained by his decree. Should any one here inveigh against the prescience of God, he does it rashly and unadvisedly. For why, pray, should it be made a charge against the heavenly Judge, that he was not ignorant of what was to happen? Thus, if there is any just or plausible complaint, it must be directed against predestination. Nor ought it to seem absurd when I say, that God not only foresaw the fall of the first man, and in him the ruin of his posterity; but also at his own pleasure arranged it. For as it belongs to his wisdom to foreknow all future events, so it belongs to his power to rule and govern them by his hand.‚Äù (John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, III.xxiii.1, 7)\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòGnosis‚Äô means knowledge. The Gnostic religion was based on the possession of this knowledge: knowledge of God and things divine, either through direct mystical experience, or through the possession of a secret body of doctrine which had been handed down to the initiates...\n\n‚Äú...[T]here was a form of pagan Greek Gnosticism and a pre-Christian Jewish Gnosticism... The Gnosis, the knowledge which ensures salvation, is the realization by man that he contains a spark of God, and of the necessity of awakening from the half-life he leads on earth...to a full consciousness of his divinity and of how it has been ensnared in matter. This awakening can lead to several reactions. In any case, the Gnostic is one of the elect...\n\n‚Äú...two heresies in particular do show evidence of contact with the sources of the Secret Tradition. These are the heresy of the Cathars and that of the Free Spirit... The word ‚ÄòCathar‚Äô probably comes from the Greek ‚Äòpure,‚Äô [cf. Puritans] and the Cathar doctrines show the sect to have been Gnostic of the ascetic type... Strictly speaking it was not a heresy, but a rival religion; and as such it was ruthlessly wiped out...\n\n‚ÄúIt is interesting to note that Calvin‚Äôs theory that those destined to salvation would ‚Äòknow‚Äô of this and thus be numbered among the elect, is a fair approximation of Gnostic doctrine and had to some extent been anticipated by the heresy of the Free Spirit.‚Äù (James Webb, The Occult Underground, pp. 199, 207, 239)\n\n‚ÄúAs to the Albigenses, their name derived from Albi, a town of the Languedoc, covered not one but many sects issued from Manicheism and Arianism, and counted also many Jews or judaised Christians. Under this appellation of Albigenses, historians, whether political or religious, have almost unanimously included the Cathares.‚Äù (Edith Starr Miller, Occult Theocrasy, pp. 163-164)\n\n‚ÄúThe face (of Frederick V) is not one‚Äôs idea of a Calvinist face, but Calvinism, in the Palatinate, was the carrier of mystical traditions, of the Renaissance Hermetic-Cabalist tradition which had moved over to that side. Frederick‚Äôs spiritual advisor was an ‚Äòorientalist‚Äô; perhaps, like Rudolph II, he sought an esoteric way through the religious situation.‚Äù (Francis Yates, The Rosicrucian Enlightenment, p. 172)\n \n‚ÄúWhat virtues and what vices brought upon the Jew this universal enmity?

Because he was exclusive, and his exclusiveness was at the same time political and religious or in other words, he kept to his political, religious cult and his law...This faith in their predestination, in their election, enveloped in the Jews an immense pride; they came to look upon non-Jews with contempt and often hatred, when patriotic reasons were added to theological ones.‚Äù (L‚ÄôAntis√ámitisme, (1894) Bernard Lazare; L√áon de Poncins, The Secret Powers Behind Revolution, (1929).\n\nGraphical representation of the 5 Points of Calvinism is the Pentagram.\n\nReformation Theology\n\nUNCONDITIONAL ELECTION\n\nCALVINIST PENTAGRAM\n\n\"5 POINTS\" OF CALVINISM\n\nLIMITED ATONEMENT\n\nIRRESISTIBLE GRACE\n\nTOTAL DEPRAVITY\n\nPERSEVERANCE OF THE SAINTS\n\nNotice that the Reformed Theology website depicts ‚Äú5 point‚Äù Calvinism as a triangle.

Hunnius contends that Calvin was a ‚Äòjudaizing‚Äô theologian‚Äîone who favored a Rabbinic Jewish interpretation of Old Testament prophecies‚Äîand that Calvin‚Äôs interpretations undermined the New Testament teachings concerning the Incarnation, the doctrine of the Trinity, and the death, resurrection and ascension of Jesus. Hunnius provides the reader with a passionate and substantial refutation of Calvin‚Äôs flawed interpretations, and upholds the apostolic understanding of the connection between Old Testament Messianic prophecy and the New Testament fulfillment of those prophecies.‚Äù (Paul A. Rydecki (Translator), James D. Heiser (Introduction)\n\n‚ÄúAegidius Hunnius‚Äô treatise would be an eye-opener for Christians who are under the influence of Calvinism, as well as those who wish to refute John Calvin‚Äôs writings with solid evidence from Scripture. Hunnius, a 16th century Lutheran theologian, exposed and powerfully refuted John Calvin's false exegesis of the Old Testament Messianic prophecies, which the Apostles, Church fathers, Christian apologists and pastors had used for 1500 years as Scriptural proof that Jesus was the promised Messiah. Almost single-handedly, John Calvin‚Äôs voluminous writings had managed to pull the rug out from under the Church by criticizing and rejecting the traditional and generally accepted understanding of the Messianic prophecies and promoting instead the interpretations of unbelieving Jewish rabbis who misapplied them to David or Solomon. Hunnius‚Äô treatise presents, I believe, the most convincing evidence available that John Calvin was a Judaizing heretic who disingenuously undermined for future generations, not only the doctrine of the deity of Jesus Christ, but also of the Trinity. The power and scope of Hunnius‚Äô treatise is most eloquently summarized in the full title:\n\n‚ÄúTHE JUDAIZING CALVIN, that is, Jewish interpretations and corruptions by which John Calvin has, in detestable fashion, shamelessly corrupted the clearest passages and testimonies of the Holy Spirit regarding the glorious Trinity, the deity of Christ and of the Holy Spirit, and especially the prophecies of the Prophets regarding the coming Messiah ‚Äî His birth, suffering, resurrection, ascension into heaven and session at the right hand of God.‚Äô‚Äù (Amazon Review)\n\nFor documentation read Chapter 5 of The Judaizing Calvin: Sixteenth-Century Debates over the Messianic Psalms.\n\nCalvin was an ecumenist.\n\n‚ÄúCalvin...in a memorandum probably in December 1560...described the ‚ÄòFree and Universal Council‚Äô that was needed ‚Äòto put an end to the existing divisions in Christianity‚Äô. It must be free with respect to place of meeting, personnel, and procedure, and bound only by Scripture. Location should be central to the attending nations. This interesting document offers what is virtually an agenda for the Council, listing numerous points in dispute in the realms of doctrine, worship and polity. Calvin‚Äôs council was to be a conference on Faith and Order -- with power. The Pope was not excluded, but he must submit to the council‚Äôs decisions and swear to abide by them. Calvin insists that while a national synod may undertake internal reform, only a genuinely universal council can allay the troubles of Christendom.‚Äù (Rouse, History of the Ecumenical Movement, pp. 33-34)\n\n‚ÄúEdinburgh 1910 gave the impulse which issued in the World Conference on Faith and Order (at Lausanne in 1927).‚Äù (Rouse, History of the Ecumenical Movement, p. 360)\n\n‚ÄúNow Martin Luther and John Calvin have all made it abundantly clear that they did not think of the church formation which they saw growing up in their lifetime as the last word. On the contrary, they all thought in terms of the Church Catholic and prayed for the restoration of the full catholicity and unity of the church.‚Äù (Harold E. Fey, History of the Ecumenical Movement, Vol. II, p. 123)\n\n‚ÄúAt the time of the massacre of the Waldensians by Francis I (1545), Calvin did his utmost to arouse German and Swiss protests to the French government and to bring relief to the survivors. In a letter to Bullinger (24 May 1561) he praised the heroic zeal of young volunteers in ministering to their partially restored communities.\n\n‚ÄúJohn Calvin‚Äôs outlook was ecumenical from the outset, but interest in Church unity was probably quickened by his contacts with Bucer and Strasburg (1538-41). He worked in close harmony with Bucer and formed a friendship with Melanchthon (Luther‚Äôs assistant), whom he met first at Frankfurt in 1539. He took a minor part with these men at the Colloquies of Worms, Hagenau and Ratisbon (1540-41). \n\n‚ÄúCalvin had already, during his first period in Geneva, sought a unification of the Swiss Protestants, and had criticized Bucer for his over-zealous insistence on the Wittenberg Concord when this was presented in Berne.‚Äù (Rouse, History of the Ecumenical Movement, pp. 48-49)\n\nCalvin enforced the Old Testament Law in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n‚ÄúCalvin was vicious toward his enemies, acting more like a devouring wolf than a harmless sheep. Historian William Jones observed that ‚Äòthat most hateful feature of popery adhered to Calvin through life, the spirit of persecution.‚Äô Note how he described his theological opponents: ‚Äò...all that filth and villainy...mad dogs who vomit their filth against the majesty of God and want to pervert all religion. Must they be spared?‚Äô (Oct. 16, 1555). He hated the Anabaptists and called them ‚Äòhenchmen of Satan.‚Äô Four men who disagreed with him on who should be admitted to the Lord‚Äôs Supper were beheaded, quartered, and their body parts hung in strategic locations in Geneva as a warning to others. He burned Michael Servetus (for rejecting infant baptism and for denying Christ‚Äôs deity). Calvin wrote about Servetus, ‚ÄòOne should not be content with simply killing such people, but should burn them cruelly.‚Äô‚Äù (FBIS, ‚ÄúThe Calvinism Debate‚Äù)\n\nCalvin‚Äôs 1st edition of the Institutes led to the charge of Arianism and his execution of Servetus‚Äô launched the Unitarian movement.\n\n‚ÄúIt must be remembered that the doctrine of the Trinity and the first edition of the Institutes‚Äô paucity of reference to it, had, in 1537, earned Calvin a charge of Arianism by the Reformer Pierre Caroli. In 1554, the year following Servetus‚Äô execution in Geneva for the religious crime of anti-Trinitarianism, Calvin produced the theological tract Defensio orthodoxae fidei, contra prodigiousos errores Michaelis Serveti Hispani, in which he attempted to demonstrate, after the fact, that the doctrine included the necessity of capital punishment for its proper defense. The great irony is that while Michael Servetus was read widely, he had no disciples. Without a doubt, his death inspired incalculably more heterodoxy than his life and writings.‚Äù (‚ÄúCalvin on the Trinity,‚Äù Kurt Anders Richardson)\n\n‚ÄúAs has been shown, Hunnius also implicates Calvin in practices of trickery and subterfuge. He paints Calvin as a crafty, devious, and deceitful exegete who is not completely honest or straightforward about the consequences of his exegesis. Hunnius intends to demonstrate for his audience the dangerous ramifications of Calvin‚Äôs exegesis, namely, that it shatters the exegetical foundation of Christian teachings of Trinity and the deity of Christ, as well as christological prophecy in the Old Testament. 28. Hence, he judges Calvin to be ‚Äúan angel of darkness, who comes forth from the abysmal pit to twist Scripture and destroy the grounds of defense of the Christian religion against Jewish and Arian adversaries.‚Äù 29.\n\n‚ÄúFinally, all of these charges culminate in Hunnius‚Äôs charge of judaizing against Calvin. By denying the literal sense of these Psalms as prophecies of Christ, Calvin ‚Äúbends the most sacred words from Christ to the gambling games of Jewish glosses.‚Äù 30. When Calvin identifies the literal sense of these Psalms with their reading concerning the life of David, Calvin, says Hunnius, is reading like a Jew. When Calvin undermines the authority and power of apostolic readings of these Old Testament texts as prophecies of Christ and gives them a secondary or even a questionable status, then he‚ÄîHunnius contends‚Äîis promoting Jewish objectives. The deceitfulness and craftiness that Hunnius sees in Calvin‚Äôs exegesis is, most unfortunately, very much in line with a long-standing medieval Christian depiction of Jews. Thus, Calvin‚Äôs exegesis has not just opened Christianity to the heresy of Arianism but exposed it to the greatest danger of all, according to Hunnius‚Äînamely, to a way of reading the Old Testament in which Christ is no longer the primary or central content.‚Äù (G. Sujin Pak, The Judaizing Calvin, p. 111)\n\nJohn Calvin was a crypto-Jew and an agent of the Prieur√© de Sion.\n\n‚ÄúContrary to general belief, Calvinism is of Jewish origin. It was deliberately conceived to split the adherents of the Christian religions and divide the people. Calvin‚Äôs real name was Cohen! When he went from Geneva to France to start preaching his doctrine he became known as Cauin. Then in England it became Calvin. History proves that there is hardly a revolutionary plot that wasn‚Äôt hatched in Switzerland; there is hardly a Jewish revolutionary leader who hasn‚Äôt changed his name.\n\n‚ÄúAt B‚Äônai B‚Äôrith celebrations held in Paris, France, in 1936 Cohen, Cauvin, or Calvin, whatever his name may have been, was enthusiastically acclaimed to have been of Jewish descent (The Catholic Gazette, February, 1936).\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòAs long as there remains among the Gentiles any moral conception of the social order, and until all faith, patriotism, and dignity are uprooted, our reign over the world shall not come...And the Gentiles, in their stupidity, have proved easier dupes than we expected them to be. One would expect more intelligence and more practical common sense, but they are no better than a herd of sheep. Let them graze in our fields till they become fat enough to be worthy of being immolated to our future King of the World...We have founded many secret associations, which all work for our purpose, under our orders and our direction. We have made it an honor, a great honor, for the Gentiles to join us in our organizations, which are, thanks to our gold, flourishing now more than ever. Yet it remains our secret that those Gentiles who betray their own and most precious interests, by joining us in our plot, should never know that those associations are of our creation, and that they serve our purpose.\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòOne of the many triumphs of our Freemasonry is that those Gentiles who become members of our Lodges, should never suspect that we are using them to build their own jails, upon whose terraces we shall erect the throne of our Universal King of the Jews; and should never know that we are commanding them to forge the chains of their own servility to our future King of the World...We have induced some of our children to join the Christian Body, with the explicit intimation that they should work in a still more efficient way for the disintegration of the Christian Church, by creating scandals within her. We have thus followed the advice of our Prince of the Jews, who so wisely said: ‚ÄòLet some of your children become cannons, so that they may destroy the Church.‚Äô Unfortunately, not all among the ‚Äòconvert‚Äô Jews have proved faithful to their mission. Many of them have even betrayed us! But, on the other hand, others have kept their promise and honored their word. Thus the counsel of our Elders has proved successful.\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòWe are the Fathers of all Revolutions, even of those which sometimes happen to turn against us. We are the supreme Masters of Peace and War. We can boast of being the Creators of the REFORMATION ! Calvin was one of our Children; he was of Jewish descent, and was entrusted by Jewish authority and encouraged with Jewish finance to draft his scheme in the Reformation (which was to convince Christians it was alright to charge usury and other damnable heresies which are in violation of God‚Äôs Laws).\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòMartin Luther yielded to the influence of his Jewish friends unknowingly, and again, by Jewish authority, and with Jewish finance, his plot against the Catholic Church met with success. But unfortunately he discovered the deception, and became a threat to us, so we disposed of him as we have so many others who dare to oppose us...Many countries, including the United States have already fallen for our scheming. But the Christian Church is still alive...We must destroy it without the least delay and without the slightest mercy. Most of the Press in the world is under our Control; let us therefore encourage in a still more violent way the hatred of the world against the Christian Church. Let us intensify our activities in poisoning the morality of the Gentiles. Let us spread the spirit of revolution in the minds of the people. They must be made to despise Patriotism and the love of their family, to consider their faith as a humbug, their obedience to their Christ as a degrading servility, so that they become deaf to the appeal of the Church and blind to her warnings against us. Let us, above all, make it impossible for Christians to be reunited, or for non-Christians to join the Church; otherwise the greatest obstruction to our domination will be strengthened and all our work undone. Our plot will be unveiled, the Gentiles will turn against us, in the spirit of revenge, and our domination over them will never be realized.\n\n‚Äú‚ÄôLet us remember that as long as there still remain active enemies of the Christian Church, we may hope to become Master of the World ...And let us remember always that the future Jewish King will never reign in the world before Christianity is overthrown...‚Äô‚Äù\n\nSource: From a series of speeches at the B‚Äônai B‚Äôrith Convention in Paris, published shortly afterwards in the London Catholic Gazette, February, 1936; Paris Le Reveil du Peuple published similar account a little later.

We will propose that Knox was the son or grandson of Sephardic Jewish √©migr√©s to Scotland. Courtesy of Scottish National Portrait Gallery.‚Äù (When Scotland Was Jewish, p. 8)\n\nThe Scottish reformers were Sephardic Jews who migrated from Spain.\n\n‚ÄúWe propose that many, perhaps most, present-day Scots are descended from the same types of ancestors who produced these personages. Further, we suggest that their forbears were Mediterranean Jews from France, Spain and Portugal... As we shall show, Scotland was not, and is not, predominantly Celtic, nor is its ethnic history even known with accuracy.‚Äù (Ibid. p. 9)\n\n‚ÄúWe also provide documentation suggesting that perhaps the majority of Scots people, especially those in the southwest and northeast of Scotland, are of Sephardic Jewish descent. And we argue that many of these same Scots today continue to practice a ‚ÄòReform‚Äô type of Judaism. It is called Presbyterianism.‚Äù (Ibid. p. 7)\n\nThe Protestant Reformation was a Judaizing movement.\n\n‚ÄúCuriously, few scholars have actively pursued this angle of investigation in exploring the origins of Protestantism. We suspect it is for the same reasons Scottish history is normally told as a monothematic battle for independence from the British ‚Äòelephant‚Äô that one popular writer finds himself ‚Äòin bed with‚Äô (Kennedy 1995) ‚Äì told with such partisan zeal, in fact, that ‚ÄòScots‚Äô and ‚ÄòScottish‚Äô come to be defined only as a counterfoil to ‚ÄòBritish,‚Äô eclipsing all other strains of nationality and culture that went into the making of modern Scotland. We propose that the Reformation, beyond being a movement against Catholicism, should be seen as a movement toward Judaism.‚Äù (Ibid. p. 200)\n\nThe mother of John Knox was a Sinclair of the Merovingian Jewish bloodline that will produce the Antichrist.\n\n‚ÄúJohn Knox was born sometime between 1505 and 1515 in or near Haddington, the county town of East Lothian. His father, William Knox, was a farmer. All that is known of his mother is that her maiden name was Sinclair and that she died when John Knox was a child.\n\n‚ÄúKnox knew that the queen regent [Mary of Guise, of Scotland] would ask for help from France. So he negotiated by letter under the assumed name John Sinclair with William Cecil, Elizabeth‚Äôs chief adviser, for secret negotiations, but he was forced to return to Scotland when he was recognized.‚Äù (Mason Shefa, Presbyterianism, pp. 61, 71)\n\n‚Äú[William Knox‚Äôs] wife, John‚Äôs mother, was a Sinclair, a clan with a reputation for much pride of race.‚Äù (Geddes MacGregor, The Thundering Scot, 1957, p. 1)\n\nSee: The Merovingian Dynasty: Identity of the False Christ\n\nJohn Knox married a member of the Merovingian Stewart bloodline.\n\n‚ÄúIn 1564 Knox remarried at the age of 50 to Margaret Stewart, age 17, a member of the royal Stewart family.‚Äù (When Scotland Was Jewish, p. 203)\n\nSee: The Merovingian Dynasty: Prince Michael Stewart\n\nLike John Calvin, there is no record of John Knox‚Äôs conversion to Jesus Christ.\n\n‚ÄúKnox did not record when or how he was converted to the Protestant faith.‚Äù (Mason Shefa, Presbyterianism, p. 61)\n\nMore biographical evidence that John Knox was Jewish.\n\nJOHN KNOX (1513/14? to 1572)\n\n‚ÄúDetails of John Knox‚Äôs childhood and even his birth date are unknown. Historians believe he was born around 1513 or 1514 in Haddington, Scotland. It is known that Knox attended a university, but unknown whether it was St Andrews or the University of Glasgow. 12 It appears unlikely that Knox graduated, choosing instead to take up the priesthood as a career around 1540. By the early 1540s he was serving as a theological lecturer and by 1545 had come under the influence of George Wishart, a Lutheran-oriented minister. In March 1546, Catholic Cardinal Beaton ordered Wishart burned at the stake for heresy and Scotland entered the bloody throes of the Reformation.\n\n‚ÄúThe Cardinal himself was killed by an angry mob of Protestants, among them John Knox, who stormed his castle at St. Andrews. The Protestant radicals were soon defeated, however, and Knox was sent in chains to serve as a galley slave in France for 19 months. When pro-Protestant King Edward VI of England obtained his release, Knox made his way back to the Scottish borders, serving as a royal minister in Berwick and New Castle. Sickly Edward soon died, however, bringing the staunchly Catholic Mary Tudor (‚ÄòBloody Mary‚Äô) to the throne of England. Knox fled to Europe, first to Frankfurt, Germany, and then on to Geneva, Switzerland, where he joined forces with John Calvin and also assisted in the translation of the Bible from Latin to English, resulting in the Geneva Bible. It was also in Geneva that Knox wrote the tract ‚ÄòFaithful Admonition‚Äô (1554) which advocated the violent overthrow of ‚Äògodless rulers‚Äô by the populace. He became pastor of the English Reformed Church in Geneva (1556-1558) and subsequently published his tract ‚ÄòFirst Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women,‚Äô which attacked the policies and right to rule of Catholic monarchs Mary of Guise (Scotland) and Mary Tudor (England).\n\n‚ÄúIn 1577, several Protestant Scottish noblemen, including James Stewart, the Earl of Moray (see chapter 1), signed a covenant declaring Protestantism the national religion of Scotland. Knox had been in correspondence with them and returned to Scotland at their request in May 1559. With Knox‚Äôs leadership, the Scottish Parliament declared itself a Protestant nation and adopted the ‚ÄòScots Confession‚Äô; Catholicism was banned from Scotland.\n\n‚ÄúIn 1560, a general assembly was held to assist the reformation of the Scottish church. By 1561, the ‚ÄòBook of Discipline‚Äô was adopted by the Scottish Parliament, placing Calvinist Presbyterian structure at the center of church governance. In this treatise, Knox outlined a system of education and welfare covering the entire Scottish population that was to be financed by the sale of former Catholic properties. 13 Knox also redesigned the content of the worship service itself, determining that all rites and practices must be based in scripture.\n\n‚ÄúTo go a little more deeply into Knox‚Äôs theology, let us have a look at the recent biography by Rosalind Marshall (2000). While Marshall never doubts that Knox was a whole-hearted Christian, she characterizes him as modeled largely after the Old Testament prophets. In her narrative, Knox emerges as a Biblical purist, much like the Jewish Karaites. He believed that the Bible was the word of God and that only the scriptures should serve as a religious guide. Among his favorite texts were the book of Daniel, Psalms (especially Psalm 6), Exodus and passages describing David and Moses. He was virulently anti-Catholic and anti-Spanish, viewing both Mary Stuart Queen of Scots and Queen Mary of England as ‚Äòidolatrous harlots‚Äô and ‚ÄòJezebels.‚Äô He advocated that ‚ÄòGod should send a jehu to slay Mary Stuart.‚Äô 14 He once threw a painting of the Virgin Mary into the river saying (p. 25), ‚ÄòSuch an idol is accursed and therefore I will not touch it.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúHe railed against women as monarchs, especially Mary of England, stating that under her rule the English were ‚Äòcompelled to bow their necks under the yoke of Satan and of his proud mistress, pestilent Papists and proud Spaniards‚Äô (Marshall 2000, p. 107). 15 His exhortations to his congregants were likewise rooted in the Old Testament (p. 145). For instance, he applied Psalm 80 (‚ÄòTurn us again, O Lord God of Hosts, cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved‚Äô) to current events, equating his present congregation to the ancient Israelites.\n\n‚ÄúKnox also urged the adoption of Mosaic law as the governing rule of Scotland. Under it, ‚Äòcertain crimes [including] murder, blasphemy, adultery, perjury and idolatry‚Äô (Marshall 2000, p. 67) would be punishable by death. He further proposed that Scotland create a universal system of education so that every individual in the population would be literate and able to read the scriptures; he also envisaged a universal charity system to care for the indigent, ill and disabled. All three of these concepts are rooted in Judaic tradition, not in Christianity. Knox described the resulting society as on in which events on Earth would mirror those in Heaven ‚Äì a metaphor which Marshall attributes to St. Augustine, but which could just as easily, and more immediately, be derived from the Cabalistic tradition in France. In Knox‚Äôs view, Scotland was ‚Äòa new Israel dedicated to upholding God‚Äôs law‚Äô (Smout 1969).\n\n‚ÄúBy 1656 the Scottish Parliament had institutionalized Sabbatarianism, ‚Äòforbidding anyone to frequent taverns, dance, hear profane music, wash, brew ale or bake bread, profanely walk or travel or do any other worldly business‚Äô on the Sabbath (Smout, p. 79). Also forbidden on the Sabbath were ‚Äòcarrying in water or casting out ashes,‚Äô a provision that had been in effect in Aberdeen as early as 1603, according to Smout (p. 79). These restrictions echo in remarkable detail the Jewish mitzvoth regarding the keeping of the Sabbath (Gitlitz 2003, pp. 317-354).\n\n‚ÄúKnox also developed very detailed guidelines for the religious training of ministers. ‚ÄòTrainee ministers would study not only theology, but Hebrew, mathematics, Physics, economics, ethics and moral philosophy‚Äô (Marshall 2000, p. 153), a curriculum that appears to be patterned more on the Islamic and Jewish ideals emanating from Spain and southern France than on any prior Christian education scheme.\n\n‚ÄúKnox advocated that every household have its members instructed in the principles of the Reform religion, so they could sing the psalms at Sabbath services and hold household prayer services morning and evening in their homes (Marshall 2000, p. 153) Both parents were to ‚Äòinstruct their children in God‚Äôs law‚Äô (p. 29); highly reminiscent of the familial worship practices of Orthodox Jews. Virtually the only exceptions to the Judaic nature of his religious ideology were the absence of dietary rules, or kashrut (for instance, a prohibition of pork); and the requirement that males be circumcised.\n\n‚ÄúExamining Knox‚Äôs family and friends helps shed some additional light on his thinking and sympathies. Among his most ardent supporters was Thomas Lever, formerly master of St. Johns College in Cambridge and later a Protestant minister living in Zurich. Lever is a surname of Semitic origin. Descendants of this same family afterwards immigrated to the American colonies and established the Lever Brothers Corporation; they were practicing Jews. Also among the early Protestants in Frankfurt , Germany, with one of the largest Jewish communities in Europe, were Thomas Parry (a common Sephardic surname) and John Foxe (=Fuchs, an Ashkenazic surname). When Knox returned to Scotland, he lodged in the house of a ‚Äòwell-known Protestant merchant, James Syme‚Äô (Marshall 2000, p. 89), and had for his assistant another Scot, James Barron (both, of course, are Sephardic surnames).\n\n‚ÄúIn 1652, Knox performed the wedding ceremony uniting Lord James Stewart and Lady Agnes Keith, a former a man who was self-consciously of Jewish descent and the latter a woman from an Aberdonian family that we have suggested was also of Jewish origin. Knox himself had married Marjorie Bowes (the surname Bov√©e is French Jewish), and the couple named their two children Nathaniel and Eleazer, Old Testament Hebrew names uncommon at the time. When Marjorie died in 1560, she gave her sons their blessing, ‚Äòpraying that they would always be as true worshippers of God as any that ever sprang out of Abraham‚Äôs loins‚Äô (Marshall 2000, p. 155) ‚Äì a strange injunction for a Christian mother.\n\n‚ÄúIn 1564 Knox remarried at the age of 50 to Margaret Stewart, age 17, a member of the royal Stewart family. Of course, because of its linking of a noblewoman with a commoner (especially one who had presided over Catholic Mary Stewart‚Äôs downfall), and because of the pairing of a young woman with an elderly man, this marriage makes little sense ‚Äì unless it is viewed from a Judaic perspective. As Marshall (2000, p. 1999) explains, Knox was the ‚Äòleading minister‚Äô in Scotland at the time. If we recognize Knox as the Head Rabbi, then his marriage to a woman of the ruling house, and of Davidic descent, makes eminent sense. 16.\n\n‚ÄúSo, can we prove that either John Calvin or John Knox were of Marrano descent? No. But we can sum up our case by pointing to the preponderance of the evidence, which suggests that their ancestors were Jewish and that they, themselves, were aware of this. If we are correct in this inference, then perhaps the ultimate irony is that the Spanish Inquisition ‚Äì intended to crush Judaism and send Spain‚Äôs Sephardim into ignominious exile ‚Äì actually had the opposite effect. The displaced Jews, like so many tiny floating seed from a milkweed pod, landed on fertile ground in Holland, France, Scotland, Germany, Switzerland, and England, where they grew into the Protestant Reformation.‚Äù (When Scotland Was Jewish, pp. 50, 201-204)\n\n12. Howie states that Knox was sent to St. Andrews to study under John Mair or Major, and M‚ÄôGavin in his note attempts to reconcile this fact with a record at Glasgow of 1520.\n\n13. We have seen above how consistent this vision is to the Jewish ideal of Zedakah.\n\n14. Compare the description of Marrano attitudes toward Mary in Gitlitz (2002), pp. 142-144. Often couched in mock theological arguments or told in the style of ribald miracle stories, this Marrano trait might be termed ‚ÄúMarioclasm,‚Äù the angry ridicule of Mariology and all Catholic superstition connected with it.\n\n15. In the absence of Marrano ancestry, Knox‚Äôs antipathy toward Spain is virtually inexplicable. No histories of his life mention his traveling to Spain or even actually known any Spaniards. Thus there do not seem to be any negative personal experiences to account for his hatred of Spain.\n\n16. With Margaret, Knox had three daughters, Martha, Margaret and Elizabeth; again, all Biblical names. Martha married Alexander Fairlie/Fairleigh; Margaret married Alexander Fairlie/Fairleigh; Margaret married Zachary (du) Pont; and Elizabeth married John Welsh.\n\nUsed by Permission. Elizabeth Caldwell Hirschman &amp; Donald N. Yates, When Scotland Was Jewish: DNA Evidence, Archeology, Analysis of Migrations, and Public and Family Records Show Twelfth Century Semitic Roots, 2007, McFarland &amp; Co. Publishers.\n\nA review of When Scotland Was Jewish noted the extreme brutality of the Reformation in Scotland under John Knox.\n\n‚ÄúWell this does explain the extreme brutality of the Scottish Presbyterian reformation. I was just recently reading two different eye witness accounts that both said it was worse than the persecution by the early Romans. Another account called the Scottish reformation a revolution rather than a reformation. I know for a fact those that signed the Declaration of Arbroath were clearly not Scots just by what they wrote in the document. John Knox‚Äôs mother was a Sinclair. I guess that‚Äôs why Rosslyn Chapel wasn‚Äôt touched when Knox‚Äôs Presbyterian mob was destroying statues and burning churches throughout Scotland. Rosslyn Chapel built by a Sinclair before the reformation houses a statue of the fallen angel Lucifer, the Green Man from pagan religions plus Islamic and Judaic symbols. And they try to pass it off as a Christian chapel. Being just outside of Edinburgh I guess Knox must have missed it. Not. During the ethnic cleansing of the Highland Clearances Knox was counting the commercial benefits of a stolen country. If people with Highland descent from around the world knew the full truth about that period in Scottish history they would demand a formal apology from what is left of the Presbyterian church. But then with what Hirschman and Yates have to say possibly the formal apology should be coming from a different group.‚Äù (LDS &amp; The Sephardic Connection: Seeding the Protestant Reformation)\n\nTHE REFORMATION:\n\nROSICRUCIAN CONNECTIONS\n\nPART 3\n\nROSICRUCIANS &amp; PROTESTANTS TOGETHER\n\nThe Rosicrucians infiltrated the Protestant Reformation and labeled their movement ‚ÄúEvangelical,‚Äù after the medieval heresy of the ‚ÄúEternal Evangel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIn some way...there was a connection the Cathars, who were tied with the Bogomils and the older Manichaeans, or followers of Mani. It was from here at the close of the Cathar influence in the Albigensian Crusades that a young boy of the German nobel house of Germel was prepared for training in Persia when he was to come of age. The legend of C.R.C. [Christian Rosencreutz] that was the focus of the first Rosicrucian manifesto published in 1614 was an allegorical vehicle based upon his life and work. Geoffrey de St. Adh√©mar had also been originally from a town in the Albigensian lands of the Cathars. He later was tutored in the tradition, and co-founded the first Militae Evangelicae in 1089.‚Äù (Rosicrucian Library)\n\n‚ÄúA Society allied to the Rosicrucians and incorporating much of their philosophy was founded at Lunenberg in 1571, under the name Militia Crucifera Evangelica. The MSS of this Society refers to the Rose and Cross. This organization cooperated with another in Holland, known as the ‚ÄòFriends of the Cross.‚Äô‚Äù - ‚ÄúChristian Rosencreutz‚Äù (S.R.I.A.)\n\n‚Äú...it was only with Schelling that the medieval heresy of the Eternal Evangel reappeared. When in 1831 he began to deliver his famous lectures on The Philosophy of Revelation in Munich, he felt himself to be invested with a great mission to announce the universal religion to come, the Church of St John... It has been said that ‚ÄòMany a listener...had the impression that he was watching the rise of new stage of consciousness and the birth of a new religion.‚Äô... Like others, Schelling saw St John as the apostle of the future in concord with Moses, Elijah, and John the Baptist in the Old Dispensation, he placed Peter, Paul, and John in the New, representing the three stages in the Christian Church. Peter was the Apostle of the Father, Paul of the Son, while John was the Apostle of the Spirit who was leading mankind into the full truth of the future. The first stage was that of Catholicism, the second of Protestantism, but the third will be the perfect religion of mankind.‚Äù - 256:62 \n\nSee: Heeding Bible Prophecy: New Scripture: New Gospel\n\nProtestantism was infested with Rosicrucians by the 17th century.\n\n‚Äú. . . the Fraternity (of the Rosy Cross) has taken on a new significance through the finding of the vault in which Brother Rosencreutz is buried. The door into this vault was miraculously discovered, and it typifies the opening of a door in Europe which is greatly desired by many. \n\n‚ÄúThe description of this vault is a central feature of the Rosencreutz legend. . . . The tomb of Rosencreutz was under the altar in the vault. . .\n\n‚ÄúThe discovery of the vault is the signal for the general reformation; it is the dawn preceding a sunrise. ‚ÄòWe know. . . that there will now be a general reformation, both of divine and human things, according to our desire and the expectation of others; for it is fitting that before the rising of the Sun there should break forth Aurora, or some clearness or divine light, in the sky.‚Äô The date at which the vault was discovered is indirectly indicated as 1604.\n\n‚ÄúThis very peculiar document, the Fama Fraternitatis, thus seems to recount, through the allegory of the vault, the discovery of a new, or rather new-old, philosophy, primarily alchemical and related to medicine and healing, but also concerned with number and geometry and with the production of mechanical marvels. It represents, not only an advancement of learning, but above all an illumination of a religious and spiritual nature. This new philosophy is about to be revealed to the world and will bring about a general reformation. The mythical agents of its spread are the R. C. Brothers. These are said to be reformed German Christians, devoutly evangelical. Their religious faith seems closely connected with their alchemical philosophy, which has nothing to do with ‚Äòungodly and accursed gold making‚Äô, for the riches which Father Rosencreutz offers are spiritual; ‚Äòhe doth not rejoice that he can make gold but is glad that he seeth the Heavens open, and the angels of God ascending and descending, and his name written in the Book of Life.‚Äô‚Äù 46:45-6\n\n‚ÄúApart from (Johann Valentin) Andreae. . .there are two writers who are generally recognized as the chief exponents of Rosicrucian philosophy. These are Robert Fludd and Michael Maier. Though both Fludd and Maier denied that they were Rosicrucians, they both spoke with interest and approval of the Rosicrucian manifestos, and their philosophies are, roughly speaking, in line with the attitudes expressed in the manifestos. But the modes of thought which are veiled in the fictions of the Fama, Confessio, and Wedding are developed by Fludd and Maier into whole libraries of weighty books which were published in the years following the appearance of those three exciting works...\n\n‚ÄúIt is thus with a sense of satisfaction, as of a confirmation from another quarter of the correctness of the historical line of approach followed in the preceding chapters, that one notes that the major works of Fludd and Maier were published in the Palatinate during the reign of Frederick V. . . Maier was a Lutheran. . .‚Äù 46:70, 73\n\n‚ÄúFludd. . .approves the manifestos. The Brothers, he maintains, are true Christians. They are not wickedly magical or seditious. They would not have trumpeted their message aloud had they been wicked people. Like Lutherans and Calvinists they are against the Pope but are not therefore heretical. Perhaps these Brothers are truly illuminated by God. . .‚Äù 46:75\n\n‚ÄúWhen later defending himself from the charge made against him in England that he had had his books printed ‚Äòbeyond the seas‚Äô because the magic in them forbade their publication in England, Fludd quotes a letter from a German scholar stating that the printer (that is De Bry) had shown his volume before printing to learned men, including some Jesuits, who had all admired it and recommended publication, though the Jesuits disapproved of his sections on geomancy and wished them omitted. They were, however, evidently not omitted. Fludd is convinced that his volumes are not distasteful to the Calvinists, amongst whom his printer lives, nor to the Lutherans ‚Äòwhich are his bordering neighbours‚Äô, nor even to the Papists, who have approved them, but he ignores the fact that, according to himself, the Jesuits had not wholly approved.\n\n‚ÄúThe first of Fludd‚Äôs Oppenheim volumes, the ‚ÄòHistory of the Macrocosm‚Äô of 1617, is dedicated to James I, a most impressive dedication in which James is saluted as ‚ÄòTer Maximus‚Äô, the epithet sacred to Hermes Trismegestus, and as the most potent and wise prince in the world. The significance of this dedication stands out now that we more fully understand the significance of the publication of Fludd‚Äôs books at Oppenheim. Fludd and his Palatinate publisher were assuming the interest of James in a work published in his son-in-law‚Äôs dominions. They were drawing this most potent prince into their philosophy, assigning to him a Hermetic role. If this book circulated much in Germany, or in Bohemia, it would have confirmed their impression, or illusion, that thought movements in the Palatinate had the approval of James.\n\n‚ÄúWe can also now begin to see the situation more clearly from James‚Äôs point of view. His son-in-law, and that son-in-law‚Äôs advisers and friends, were not only trying to involve James in a political line of action of which he disapproved--the activist polity which was leading towards the Bohemian enterprise. They were also trying to involve him in a philosophy of which he disapproved. James was desperately afraid of anything magic; this was his most deep-seated neurosis. He had disapproved, of (John) Dee, would not receive him, and relegated him to a kind of banishment. And now, in his son-in-law‚Äôs domains, there is published an immense work on the Dee type of Hermetic philosophy, dedicated to him, and attempting by that dedication to draw him into that point of view, or to give the impression that he is favourable to it. . .‚Äù 46:77-78\n\n‚ÄúMaier, (was) a devout Lutheran Christian (Fludd was a devout Anglican). . . Whatever else they may represent, Fludd and Maier are most certainly Hermetic philosophers, representing a kind of Hermetic Renaissance at a time when the original Hermetic impulses of the earlier Renaissance were waning in some quarters.‚Äù 46:82\n\n‚ÄúMaier may have been influenced by a (Giordano) Bruno tradition as well as by the Dee tradition. We know that Bruno claimed to have founded a sect of ‚ÄòGiordanisti‚Äô among the Lutherans. (See Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, pp. 312-13) Maier was a Lutheran; his intensively Hermetic religious movement might therefore have included some Bruno influence, might be an attempt at the Hermetic reform of religion, the infusion of greater life into religion through the Hermetic influences, such as Bruno had so passionately advocated. On the other hand the strongly alchemical aspect of Maier‚Äôs movement points to Dee as the major influence. Perhaps in the Palatinate type of Hermetic reform, currents descending from the Dee type of Hermetic tradition mingle with a Bruno type.‚Äù 46:85\n\n‚ÄúMaier is activated by a very strong religious Hermetic impulse, as strong, in its way, as that which had moved Giordano Bruno in the late sixteenth century, though combined in Maier with Lutheran piety---the sort of combination one might expect if Bruno‚Äôs influence took root in Lutheran circles in Germany.‚Äù 46:88\n\n‚ÄúThe criticism of the R. C. Brothers. . .rests on the following points. It is suspected that their activities may be subversive of established government;. . . There is a frequently made general accusation of magical practices. (ff. Defenders maintain that their magic is good and godly.) Finally--and this is one of the most important points--their enemies complain that the religious position of the R. C. Brothers is not clear. Some call them Lutherans, some Calvinists, and some Socinians or Deists. They are even suspected of being Jesuits.\n\n‚ÄúThis is suggestive of what may have been one of the most important aspects of the Rosicrucian movement, that it could include different religious denominations. As we have seen, Fludd claimed that his work found favour with truly religious persons of all denominations. Fludd was a devout Anglican, friend of Anglican bishops; so was Elizabeth Stuart, the wife of the Elector Palatine. The Elector was a devout Calvinist, as was Christian of Anhalt, his chief adviser. Maier was a devout Lutheran, as was also Andreae and many of the other Rosicrucian writers. The common denominator which would draw all of them together would be the macro-microcosmic musical philosophy, the mystical alchemy, of which Fludd and Meier were the two chief exponents. . .‚Äù 46:97-98\n\n‚ÄúThe R. C. movement collapsed when the Palatinate movement collapsed, when those inspiring vistas opened up behind the Elector Palatine and his brilliant alliances failed utterly with the flight of the King and Queen of Bohemia from Prague after the Battle of White Mountain, when it was realized that neither the King of Great Britain nor their German Protestant allies would help them, when the Hapsburg troops moved into the Palatinate and the Thirty Years War began its dreadful course.‚Äù 46:100\n\n‚ÄúGiordano Bruno as he wandered through Europe had preached an approaching general reformation of the world, based on return to the ‚ÄòEgyptian‚Äô religion taught in the Hermetic treatises, a religion which was to transcend religious differences through love and magic, which was to be based on a new vision of nature achieved through Hermetic contemplative exercises. He had preached this religion, enveloped in mythological forms, in France, England, and Germany. According to himself, he had formed a sect in Germany, called the ‚ÄòGiordanisti‚Äô, which had much influence among the Lutherans.‚Äù 46:136\n\n‚ÄúJohann Amos Komensky, or Comenius, born in 1592, was six years younger than Johann Valentin Andreae, whose works and outlook influenced him enormously. Comenius was one of the Bohemian Brethren, the mystical branch of the oldest reformation tradition in Europe, that stemming from John Huss. Comenius and Andreae had much in common. Both were devout, reformed clerics; both were interested in new intellectual movements which they grafted on to their native piety, the German Lutheran tradition in one case, in the other, the Hussite tradition.\n\n‚ÄúComenius received his first schooling in his native Moravia and afterwards attended the Calvinist university of Herborn, in Nassau. In the spring of 1613, Comenius left Herborn and made fro Heidelberg to continue his studies at the university. . .\n\n‚ÄúComenius was attending the lectures of the Heidelberg professor David Paraeus . . .(who) was interested in uniting Lutherans and Calvinists; both he and the other professors who lectured to Comenius were closely associated with the Elector Frederick. 46:156\n\n‚ÄúThe face (of Frederick V) is not one‚Äôs idea of a Calvinist face, but Calvinism, in the Palatinate, was the carrier of mystical traditions, of the Renaissance Hermetic-Cabalist tradition which had moved over to that side. Frederick‚Äôs spiritual advisor was an ‚Äòorientalist‚Äô; perhaps, like Rudolph II, he sought an esoteric way through the religious situation.‚Äù 46:172\n\nThe Rosicrucian ENLIGHTENMENT\n\nThe Rosicrucians planned another Reformation which would come through Evangelical Christianity.\n\n‚Äú(Francis) Bacon died in 1626. In 1627 there was published from his papers an unfinished and undated work in which he set forth his Utopia, his dream of an ideal religious and scientific society. It takes the form of an allegory, about the discovery by storm-tossed mariners of a new land, the New Atlantis. The inhabitants of the New Atlantis had built there the perfect society, though remaining entirely unknown to the rest of the world. They were Christians; Christianity had been brought to them in early times, an evangelical Christianity which emphasized brotherly love. They were also in an advanced state of scientific knowledge. In their great college, called Salomon‚Äôs House, an order of priest-scientists pursued researches in all the arts and sciences, the results of which they knew how to apply for the benefit of men.\n\n‚Äú...The religion of the New Atlantis has much in common with that of the Rosicrucian manifestos. It is intensely Christian in spirit, though not doctrinal, interpreting the Christian spirit in terms of practical benevolence, like the R. C. Brothers. It is profoundly influenced by Hebraic-Christian mysticism, as in Christian Cabala. The inhabitants of New Atlantis respect the Jews; they call their college after Solomon and seek for God in nature.‚Äù 46:125-9\n\n‚ÄúWe need a reconstruction of our theology on the basis, not of God‚Äôs sovereignty, but of God‚Äôs holy love to all mankind, which he has made in his own image, and redeemed with the blood of his own son. Every age must produce its own theology.‚Äù - 208:476-7\n\n‚Äú. . .a message which is closely parallel to that of the Fama, the need for a new reformation since former attempts at reformation have failed, for a movement which should emphasized Christian love and charity as its main inspiration. . .‚Äù - 46:135\n\n‚ÄúThe Rosicrucian manifesto may now take on a somewhat wider meaning. It calls for a general reformation because other reformations have failed. The Protestant Reformation is losing strength and is divided. The Catholic Counter-Reformation has taken a wrong turning. A new general reformation of the whole wide world is called for, and this third reformation is to find its strength in Evangelical Christianity with its emphasis on brotherly love, in the esoteric Hermetic-Cabalist tradition, and in an accompanying turning towards the works of God in nature in a scientific spirit of exploration, using science or magic, magical science or scientific magic, in the service of man.‚Äù - 46:139\n\n‚ÄúAt some time around 1617. . . (Johann Valentin Andreae) urged the formation of ‚ÄòChristian Unions‚Äô, or ‚ÄòChristian Societies‚Äô. These societies or unions were to be inspired by aims very similar to those expressed in the Rosicrucian manifestos. They were to give expression to a renewal in religion, or a new reformation, to encourage by precept and example the spread of Christian charity and brotherly love, and to engage earnestly in intellectual and scientific activities for the good of mankind.‚Äù 46:140\n\n‚ÄúAndreae‚Äôs most important work, the description of the ideal or utopian city of Christianopolis. . .begins by deploring the oppression of the church of Christ by Antichrist, which has aroused the determination to restore light and dispel darkness. Luther‚Äôs reformation is now to be succeeded by a new reformation. The drama of Luther‚Äôs days ‚Äòmay be played out in our own day‚Äô, for ‚Äòthe light of a purer religion has dawned on us.‚Äô Men of fervent spirit. . .have called for a time of meditation and spiritual renewal and for the spread of a new outpouring of the Christian spirit in these times.‚Äù 46:145\n\n‚ÄúThe intense Christian piety of Dee-inspired Christianopolis would perhaps be nearer to Hartlib‚Äôs strong evangelical pietism and mysticism than Bacon‚Äôs cooler temperament.‚Äù - 46:181\n\nThe Puritan Protectorate (1653-1658)\n\nThe term ‚ÄúPuritan‚Äù comes from the same root word as the heretical ‚ÄúCathari‚Äù who believed themselves to be ‚Äúpure‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúThe word ‚ÄòCathar‚Äô probably comes from the Greek ‚Äòpure,‚Äô and the Cathar doctrines show the sect to have been Gnostic of the ascetic type. They believed that the world had been created by an evil being‚Äîthat there were a series of spheres of being between God and the material world-that procreation was evil because it introduced another spark of the divine into matter. These are familiar tenets. In the Languedoc the Cathars flourished, until in 1207 Pope Innocent III solicited help from the magnates of the North to crush the dangerous heresy. Strictly speaking it was not a heresy, but a rival religion; and as such it was ruthlessly wiped out.‚Äù (Webb 207)\n\nOliver Cromwell, the Puritan ‚ÄúLord Protector‚Äù of England, Scotland and Ireland, was financed by Jewish elites.\n\n‚ÄúWhen King Charles I was brought into disagreement with his Parliament a Jewish Money-Baron in Holland named Manasseh Ben Israel had his agents contact Oliver Cromwell. They offered him large sums of money if he would carry out their plan to overthrow the British Throne. Manasseh Ben Israel, and other German and French money-lenders financed Cromwell. Fernandez Carvajal of Portugal, often referred to in history as ‚ÄòThe Great Jew,‚Äô became Cromwell‚Äôs Chief Military Contractor. He re-organized the Round Heads into a model army. He provided them with the best arms and equipment money could buy. Once the conspiracy was under way, hundreds of trained revolutionaries were smuggled into England and were absorbed into the Jewish Underground. The same thing is going on in America today.\n\n‚ÄúThe head of the Jewish underground in England at that time was a Jew named De Souze. The Great Jew, Fernandez Carvajal, had used his influence to have De Souze appointed Portuguese Ambassador. It was in his house, protected by diplomatic immunity, that the leaders of the Jewish revolutionary underground remained hidden and worked out their plots and intrigue.\n\n‚ÄúOnce the revolution had been decided upon, the Jewish plotters introduced Calvinism into England to split Church and State, and divide the people.‚Äù (Chronology of The International Conspiracy)\n\nParliament severed negotiations with King Charles I on January 17, the day on which the Prieur√© de Sion elects Grand Masters.\n\nJanuary 17, 1648 - ‚ÄúEngland‚Äôs Long Parliament passes the Vote of No Address, breaking off negotiations with King Charles I and thereby setting the scene for the second phase of the English Civil War.‚Äù - Wikipedia\n\nUnder Cromwell, Parliament took control of the English monarchy and eliminated witch trials.\n\n‚ÄúAnd amongst the earnest enthusiasts for the model society, and its vast possibilities for expansion, was Samuel Hartlib. ...it was the Andraean combination of evangelical piety with science, and the utilitarian application of science, which inspired Hartlib‚Äôs untiring efforts.\n\n‚ÄúAnd with Hartlib, and his friends and helpers John Dury and John Amos Comenius, the movement returned to England, for it was in Parliamentarian England [Cromwell/Puritan], which had returned to the old Elizabethan role of champion of Protestant Europe, that Hartlib saw the best chance of establishing the new reformation. As the R. C. Fraternity had represented hopes raised by the English alliance, through the Elector Palatine‚Äôs English marriage, so, when those hopes failed, it was towards an England restored to its Elizabethan role that Hartlib and his friends turned for support for their ideals of universal reformation, their continuation of the Rosicrucian dream under other names.‚Äù 46:155\n\n‚ÄúThose in England, and they were many, who were dissatisfied with the non-Parliamentarian and anti-Puritan, or even potentially Papist, policies of James I and Charles I, looked with longing towards that Protestant royal family at The Hague which represented a possible succession to the throne...\n\n‚ÄúElizabeth was not only popular with loyal monarchists of Protestant sympathy; she was also popular with Parliamentarians. The Parliaments under James and Charles had always been sympathetic to her and when Parliament overthrew the monarchy, Parliamentarians still continued to feel respect for Elizabeth of Bohemia. In fact, it may be asked whether if she had succeeded to the throne there might never have been a revolution. Parliamentarians, and Oliver Cromwell himself, did not really object to monarchy as such. Oliver thought that monarchy of the Elizabethan type was the best form of government. The objection was to monarchs who tried to rule without Parliament and whose foreign policy was not directed towards the support of the Protestant cause in Europe. Elizabeth Stuart was free from these objections to her royal relatives. In fact, she and her husband really represented the kind of foreign policy which Parliamentarians would have wished James and Charles to follow. It is thus not surprising that the revolutionary Parliament recognized the right of the Queen of Bohemia to its support. She had received a pension from Charles I which Parliament continued. From her court at The Hague, Elizabeth was thus in a position of being able to follow vicissitudes in England without entirely losing touch with either side. Though she remained absolutely firm in her sympathy for her brother Charles, and was horrified by his death, there were some aspects of Parliamentarian and Cromwellian thinking which were not so much out of line with her position.\n\n‚Äú(Elizabeth) was, so to speak, the ideological link through whom the thoughts of the three ‚Äòforeigners‚Äô, Hartlib, Dury and Comenius, could become acclimatized in an England which was throwing off monarchical despotism.‚Äù - 46:173-75\n\n‚ÄúThere has never, I think, been suggested that James‚Äôs doubtful attitude towards Baconian science might be connected with his very deep interest in, and dread of, magic and witchcraft. These subjects had a fascination for him which was tied up with neuroses about some experiences in his early life. In his Demonology (1597) James advocated the death penalty for all witches, though he urges care in the examination of cases. The subject was for him a most serious one, a branch of theology. Obviously James was not the right person to examine the - always rather difficult - problem of when Renaissance Magia and Cabala were valuable movements, leading to science, and when they verged on sorcery, the problem of defining the differences between good magic and bad magic. James was not interested in science and would react with fear from any sort of magic.\n\n‚ÄúIt is not surprising that when old John Dee appealed to James for help in clearing his reputation from charges of conjuring devils, James would have nothing to do with him. Dee‚Äôs fruitless appeal to James was made in June 1604. The old man to whose learning the Elizabethan age was so infinitely indebted was disgraced in the reign of James and died in great poverty in 1608. Bacon must have taken good note of James‚Äôs attitude to Dee, and he must also have noted that survivors from the Elizabethan age of mathematics and magic, of navigational boldness and anti-Spanish exploits, were not sure of encouragement under James as they had been under Elizabeth. Northumberland and Raleigh pursued their studies in prison in the Tower under James, working at mathematics and alchemy with their learned associate, Thomas Hariot.\n\n‚ÄúObviously, Bacon would have been careful to avoid, in works intended to interest James, anything savouring of Dee and his suspicious mathematics. Even so, Bacon did not succeed in allaying James‚Äôs suspicions of scientific advancement, however carefully presented.\n\n‚ÄúAnd even more obviously, it was not the way to influence James in favour of his son-in-law‚Äôs plans and projects in the Palatinate and Bohemia to associate him with a movement which wrapped its designs in enchanted vaults and invisible R. C. Brothers, who could easily be turned into sorcerers by witch-hunters. Among the many mistakes made by the friends of the unfortunate Elector Palatine, the Rosicrucian manifestos may have been one of the worst. If any rumour of them came to James‚Äôs ears, and any rumour of their being associated with Frederick, this would certainly have done more than anything else to turn him against Frederick, and to destroy any hope that he would countenance his projects.\n\n‚ÄúThus Frances Bacon as he propagated advancement of learning, and particularly of scientific learning, during the reign of James 1 was moving amongst pitfalls. The old Elizabethan scientific tradition was not in favour, and some of its major surviving representatives were shunned or in prison. The late Queen Elizabeth had asked John Dee to explain his Monas hieroglypica to her; King James would have nothing to do with its author. Bacon, when he published The Advancement of Learning in 1605, would have been aware that James had repulsed Dee in the preceding year. And moreover the exported Elizabethan traditions, which had gone over to the Palatinate with James‚Äôs daughter and her husband, were not in favour either. Francis Bacon was one of those who regretted James‚Äôs foreign policy and urged support of the Elector Palatine. Here, too, the writer of English manifestos for the advancement of learning would have to walk warily, lest he might seem to much implicated in movements in the Palatinate.‚Äù - 46:123-25\n\n‚Äú(Hartlib, Dury and Comenius) were the men who came to England and tried to propagate here, universal reformation, advancement of learning, and other utopist ideals. They represented Bohemia and Germany in exile and dispersion, and if we add to them Theodore Haak, who acted as Comenius‚Äôs agent in England, we have the Palatinate represented, for Haak was a refugee from the Palatinate.\n\n‚ÄúIn 1640 the Long Parliament met, angry at Parliament‚Äôs long exclusion from the affairs of the nation, angry at the domestic policy pursued by the monarchy, and angry, above all, at its foreign policy, which had been one of ‚Äôpeace with ignominy while the cause of Protestantism was going down abroad‚Äô. When, by the execution of Strafford, this Parliament seemed to have broken the ‚Äòtyranny‚Äô, the way seemed open for a new period in human affairs to begin. A mood of great enthusiasm was generated and thoughts turned to far-reaching vistas of some universal reformation, in education, in religion, in advancement of learning for the good of mankind. . .\n\n‚ÄúIn this thrilling hour when it seemed that England might be the land chosen by Jehovah to be the scene of the restoration of all things, when the possibility dawned that here imaginary commonwealths might become real commonwealths, invisible colleges, real colleges, Hartlib wrote to Comenius and urged him to come to England to assist in the great work. Though Parliament did not actually sponsor the invitation, there was general goodwill behind it, and behind a similar one to Dury. In a sermon delivered to Parliament in 1640, Comenius and Dury were mentioned as the philosophers who should be followed in future reforms. Comenius in far away Poland was overjoyed. He believed that he had a mandate from Parliament to build Bacon‚Äôs New Atlantis in England.‚Äù - 46:177-8\n\nOliver Cromwell revived the Rosicrucian Order as Freemasonry.\n\n‚ÄúThe Christian group ‚ÄôGold und Rosenkreuzer‚Äô (Golden and Rosy Cross) was founded by the alchemist Samuel Richter (Sincerus Renatus) in Prague in the early 18th century...as a deeply hierarchical secret society, composed of internal circles, recognition signs and based upon alchemy treatises... Its members claimed that the leaders of the Rosicrucian Order had invented Freemasonry and only they knew the secret meaning of Masonic symbols. According to this group‚Äôs legend, the Rosicrucian Order was founded by Egyptian ‚ÄòOrmusse‚Äô or ‚ÄòLicht-Weise‚Äô who emigrated to Scotland with the name ‚ÄòBuilders from the East‚Äô. Then the original Order disappeared and was supposed to have been resurrected by Oliver Cromwell as ‚ÄòFreemasonry‚Äô.‚Äù (Answers.com)\n\nJohn Webster (Calvinist/Rosicrucian), Parliamentarian chaplain, changed public attitudes toward the occult sciences.\n\nWebster, John\n\nAffiliation: Calvinist\n\n‚ÄúA Puritan who was active on the Parliamentary side in the Civil War and did not conform at the Restoration.\n\n‚ÄúWebster is best known for a famous attack on the university curriculum, Academiarum examen, urging laboratory observation as in chemistry, a work drawing upon the Paracelsian tradition and on Van Helmont, and indebted as well to [Robert] Fludd [Grand Master of Prieur√© de Sion].\n\n‚ÄúHe published Metallographia, 1671 (possibly an earlier edition in 1661), which again displayed his debt to Paracelsus and Van Helmont. Both in England and on the continent, this book was considered an important work on metals and on minerals.\n\nHe also engaged in a debate on witchcraft with Glanvill, Casaubon, and More. Webster rejected witchcraft because Glanvill, Casaubon, and More linked it with magic and the occult sciences, which Webster, the Paracelsian, defended... Chaplain in the Parliamentary army, 1643-8...‚Äù (The Scientific Revolution)\n\n‚ÄúThe, as it were, public acknowledgement of the Fama and the Confessio may have encouraged John Webster, a Puritan divine, to come out with a remarkable work in which he urges that ‚Äòthe philosophy of Hermes revived by the Paracelsian school‚Äô should be taught in the universities. Webster goes very deeply into the kind of doctrines that are behind the Rosicrucian manifestos, urging, like them, the replacement of Aristotelian scholasticism by a Hermetic-Paracelsist type of natural philosophy, through which to learn the language of nature rather than the language of the schools. His only mention of the ‚Äòhighly illuminated fraternity of the Rosie Cross‚Äô is in connection with the ‚Äòlanguage of nature‚Äô, which he speaks of as a secret known to the ‚Äòdivinely inspired Teutonic Boehme‚Äô and ‚Äòin some measure acknowledged‚Äô by the Rosy Cross Fraternity, and interesting (and undoubtedly correct) insight into the affinity between Boehme and the Rosicrucian manifestos.\n\n‚ÄúWithin the ‚Äòphilosophy of Hermes‚Äô, Webster includes mathematics particularly as recommended by John Dee in his Preface to Euclid from which Webster quotes at length, with ecstatic encomiums of Dee. He also profoundly reveres that ‚Äòprofoundly learned man Dr. Fludd‚Äô, and he is under the impression that if authors like these--and his book is an amalgam of Paracelsist, Agrippan and similar Renaissance magico-scientific type of thinking, with Dee and Fludd as his favourites---were taught in the universities, ‚Äòthe arcana and magnalia of nature‚Äô arrived at by Francis Bacon might be brought to perfection. . .\n\n‚ÄúIn the heart of Puritan England, this Parliamentarian chaplain produces a work which is right in the Renaissance magico-scientific tradition, culminating in Dee and Fludd, and he thinks that this is what should be taught in the universities, together with Baconianism. . .‚Äù - 46:186\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶Meric Casaubon, in Of Credulity and Incredulity (1668) discusses many wonders which the enlightenment of his age had now proved to be natural phenomena. But he is alarmed at the spread of rationalism and too deeply imbued with reverence for the Bible to question any doctrines which were supposed to emanate from that source. So he condemns as atheists and uneducated all those who denied a league between the devil and men, and dwells on the enormous volume of testimony, ancient and modern, literary and judicial, in proof of sorcery. And yet it is manifest that these scholars were pleading a lost cause. Men believed in witchcraft so long as its horror, grotesqueness and defilement fascinated their imagination. The earlier demonologists had quoted Scripture and the classics to the full, but their conviction really rested on the prurient or ghastly anecdotes with which this superstition abounded. The spell of mystery and horror still exercised its power over the vulgar, and broadsides continued to report cases of bewitchment; but the age had learnt to criticise its own ideas and educated apologists already showed a degree of sensibility and intellectual refinement quite inconsistent with these beliefs. The superstition still seemed to thrive because it had not yet been confronted with the purer, keener outlook of the restoration.\n\n‚ÄúThis was the work of John Webster. His book The Displaying of supposed Witchcraft (1677) does not contribute any new material to the controversy; in fact, he admits himself that the demonographers had already been ‚Äúquashed and silenced‚Äù by Wier, Tandler, Scot, Ady and Wagstaffe. But, while reproducing their arguments, whether based on theology or common-sense, he did more than they all, by bringing the controversy into an atmosphere in which the superstition could not live: the atmosphere of confidence in nature and reverence for an immaterial God. Now that Hakewill, Harvey, Newton and Locke were teaching men to investigate and not fear the mysteries of life, Webster insists that all evidence in support of sorcery should be subjected to the same scientific scrutiny. Besides, what need was there to suspect the handiwork of the devil in any miracle, when ‚ÄúMr. Boyl‚Äù was able to ‚Äúmanifest the great and wonderful virtues that God hath endowed stones, minerals, plants and roots withal,‚Äù when Van Helmont had already proved that metals have even greater healing power and Paracelsus had ascribed this power to God. Now that natural laws were being discovered, Webster represents this God, not according to the old anthropomorphic ideas, but as a transcendental spirit, who rules men through their thoughts and wills. Satan is merely one of the means of communication. Hence, if there is a league between the devil and a witch, it is ‚Äúinternal, mental and spiritual‚Äù; the league which always exists between a malefactor and the spirit of evil. For Webster is the first to point out‚Äîwhat many of his contemporaries must have felt‚Äîthat the current theory of witchcraft was utterly unworthy of the modern conception of human nature. Neurasthenics, whose imaginations have been infected with stories of ghosts and goblins, may conceive themselves to be the victims of all kinds of malpractices and diseases. But the devil only enslaves men by ‚Äútheir corrupt wills and dispositions.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWebster‚Äôs book by no means drove out superstition. The belief in necromancy, sortilege and magic exists at the present time in cities as well as in rural districts and will always be found wherever the great emotions of life 84 are wrought to a higher pitch than the intellect. But The Displaying of supposed Witchcraft marks the time when this error definitely lost its hold on men‚Äôs lower passions and on the sense of human degradation. The period of witch persecutions has universally been regarded as the darkest blot on English civilisation and it produced a literature no less dreary. Witch treatises, with a few exceptions, are voluminous, rambling and ill-constructed dissertations in which patristic dogmas and scholastic arguments are endlessly reiterated. And yet one is almost tempted to regard this controversy, together with the civil war pamphlets and the puritan tirades, as an inevitable phase in the evolution of English modern thought. Movements like the renascence, which appeal chiefly to courtiers and scholars, who, after all, are only the surface of a nation, can well be inspired from foreign sources. But when a whole people change their attitude of mind, the impulse must come from within. We have seen how social and political influences drove popular writers to the most extravagant thoughts and utterances, thereby creating an atmosphere in which great works cannot thrive. But, at the same time, it must be remembered that, if informal literature ran to excess, it became, in this way, a self-exposure, and startled the whole nation into an effort towards higher civilisation.

John Wagstaffe‚Äôs Question of Witchcraft.‚Äù (Bartleby)\n\nRosicrucian poet, John Milton, was Cromwell‚Äôs Foreign Secretary from 1649 to 1660.\n\n‚ÄúDuring this time, also, 17th Century Rosicrucians protected each other and their sacred works by simply hinting at their connection with the Brotherhood. They made signature marks or gave signs in papers and books in order for others of like mind to identify their works at any time it was necessary. The title page of Milton‚Äôs first edition of Paradise Lost in 10 Books, states that it was ‚ÄúLicensed and Entred according to Order.‚Äù The title page of the second edition in 12 Books, however, says only, ‚ÄòPrinted by S. Simmons next door to the Golden Lion‚Äô. Thus, a ‚Äòlicensing‚Äô suggests the sanctioning, and the determination must be made as to the intent of the use of the word, ‚ÄòOrder.‚Äô The ‚ÄúGolden Lion‚Äù is an esoteric symbol seen in many of the Hermetic engravings from the Middle Ages and Renaissance that are linked specifically with the Evangelicals or Rosicrucians, among the many names that identified these certain Hermetic resources. Being ‚Äònext door‚Äô is being close to or in the same ‚Äòplace‚Äô as something else, i.e., of like nature, even if in this case, it may be a different ‚Äòaddress,‚Äô i.e., a different name. (Ref. Addendum for Images of Title Pages)\n‚ÄúAdditionally, it was a pronounced Rosicrucian practice to scatter partial hints at connections with the Rosicrucians among several different written works, so that taken alone, it would not be obvious as to the meaning. If identified together, such ‚Äúhints‚Äù are consistent with the Rosicrucian practice of marking and linking sacred material for the future.\n\n‚ÄúJohn Milton‚Äôs Sixth Elegy, as one example of a separate part, states the very purpose of his whole body of writing. It is one of the most important messages of Milton to be understood in combination with his life‚Äôs devoted purpose.\n\n‚Äú. . .if you would like to know what I am doing . . . I am singing the prince of peace, the son of Heaven, and the blessed ages promised in the sacred books. . . . For the true poet is sacred to the gods, he is a priest of the gods; and his inmost soul and his lips breathe out Jove.‚Äù ‚ÄîJohn Milton (1608-1674), Sixth Elegy\n\n‚ÄúParadise Lost, in its stated purpose, ‚Äúto justify the ways of God to men,‚Äù is an elucidation of the Sixth Elegy‚Äôs general purpose statement. Taken together, the ‚Äúhints‚Äù from his title pages and Milton‚Äôs own purpose statements in Paradise Lost and the Sixth Elegy, can mark him with the 17th Century Rosicrucian movement, even aside from other such examples. However, even if the specifically Rosicrucian identification could only be a coincidence, Milton‚Äôs work is certainly marked by the same profound Rosicrucian themes of his Hermetic and natural imagery that are largely pantheistic, and consistent with the classic Western esoteric tradition. (‚ÄúGod is everywhere, in all things, is all-knowing, all-loving.‚Äù)\n\n‚ÄúBesides the use of subtle allusions to non-biblical themes, John Milton also marked his work with a number of grammatical oddities, some which were, no doubt, peculiar to17th Century English usage. However, where spelling was not yet standardized, or the use of capitalization or punctuation, by reviewing his work for it‚Äôs own layered structure and consistency, it can be suggested that, we should pay very close attention to the simple use and non-use of capitalization for words usually understood to be proper nouns, as well as other consistent patterns of his work.\n\nMilton Jailed Politically\n‚ÄúEven though his work succeeded in avoiding the critical eye of the Church authorities, through his admitted ‚Äúartfulness,‚Äù Milton did not escape political danger altogether. While writing Paradise Lost, he was actually best known during his lifetime for his many pamphlets denouncing the repression of various liberties, and elucidating on the right to dissent and the freedom of the press, the right to hold different personal religious beliefs, as well as the attributes of divorce, free love and the ideal of Platonic love with the opposite gender other than a spouse. In June 1660, when he was 52 years old, the English Parliament ordered Milton‚Äôs arrest and his political publications burned. After being in hiding for several months, he was indeed arrested and held for nearly six months. . .‚Äù (Questions on the Esoteric Content of Paradise Lost)\n\nMilton received angelic dictation for his works.\n\n‚ÄúMilton states very plainly and directly in Paradise Lost, Book IX, that he has a specific muse, or mediumistic resource, a spiritual being who communicated to him while he slept. So it was also in dream, that he was given the information from which to also create a dream story line, complete with ‚Äòfantasy‚Äô and, therefore, an acceptable ‚Äòreality‚Äô for Church authorities....\n\n20. ‚ÄúIf answerable style I can obtain\n21.

Only the King and the three who stood to sponsor for him will know what is coming...‚Äô\n\n‚Äú. . .Both Radclyffe‚Äôs Masonry and the Masonry (Jean-Luc) Chaumeil describes would have been acceptable, despite papal condemnation, to devout Catholics; they also seem, on the basis of available evidence, to have received a major and exhilarating transfusion of faith--a transfusion that enabled them to see themselves as, if anything, more truly Christian than the papacy.\n\n‚ÄúThe institution in question was called the Hieron du Val d‚ÄôOr which. . .proved relevant by virtue of its formulation of. . .an esoteric geo-political and an ethnarchichal world order. Translated into more mundane terms this entailed, in effect, the establishment of a new Holy Roman Empire in nineteenth-century Europe---a revitalized and reconstituted Holy Roman Empire, a secular state that unified all peoples and rested ultimately on spiritual, rather than social, political, or economic foundations. Unlike its predecessor, this new Holy Roman Empire would have been genuinely ‚Äòholy‚Äô, genuinely ‚ÄòRoman,‚Äô and genuinely ‚Äòimperial‚Äô---although the specific meaning of these terms would have differed crucially from the meaning accepted by tradition and convention. Such a state would have realized the centuries-old dream of a ‚Äòheavenly kingdom‚Äô on earth, a terrestrial replica or mirror image of the order, harmony, and hierarchy of the cosmos. It would have actualized the ancient Hermetic premise, ‚ÄòAs above, so below.‚Äô . .\n\n‚ÄúDuring the nineteenth century the Prieure de Sion, working through Freemasonry and the Hieron du Val d‚ÄôOr, attempted to establish a revived and ‚Äòupdated‚Äô Holy Roman Empire---a kind of theocratic United States of Europe, ruled simultaneously by the Hapsburgs and by a radically reformed Church. This enterprise was thwarted by the First World War and the fall of Europe‚Äôs reigning dynasties. But it is not unreasonable to suppose that Sion‚Äôs present objectives are basically similar--at least in their general outlines--to those of the Hieron de Val d‚ÄôOr.‚Äù (Holy Blood, Holy Grail) 31:193,197-98,410-11\n\nSee: Death of the Phoenix: New Reformation\n\nThe New Reformation will destroy the Roman Catholic Church, and with it the doctrines of the deity of Jesus Christ and the Trinity.\n\n‚ÄúThe collapse of centuries of laborious theological work within less than half a century of the outbreak of the Reformation is alarming to those of us who believe that the Reformation was a necessary corrective to the doctrinal as well as moral failings of medieval Christianity. It gives substance to the traditional Catholic charge that the Reformation principles of Scripture alone and private interpretation open the floodgates to theological chaos. ...perhaps we can see in the Reformation era the end of trinitarianism as the unquestioned conviction of Christians.‚Äù (Heresies: Heresy and Orthodoxy in the History of the Early Church, p. 333)\n\n‚ÄúThe greatest part of these predictions were contained in a book entitled, The Everlasting Gospel, and which was also called, The Book of Joachim; which...foretold the destruction of the church of Rome...and the promulgation of a new and more perfect gospel in the age of the Holy Ghost.‚Äù - 456:46\n\n‚ÄúWhen the time comes, finally, to destroy the papal court the finger of an invisible hand will point the nations towards this court. When, however, the nations fling themselves upon it, we shall come forward in the guise of its defenders as if to save excessive bloodshed. By this diversion we shall penetrate to its very bowels and be sure we shall never come out again until we have gnawed through the entire strength of this place. The King of the Jews will be the real Pope of the Universe, the patriarch of an international church.‚Äù (Protocols of the Learned Elders of Sion , #15)\n\n‚ÄúAnd the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.‚Äù (Rev. 17:16-17)\n\n‚ÄúAnd he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.‚Äù (Rev. 18:2-3)\n\nSee: Heeding Bible Prophecy: New Laws: Mystery Babylon Judged\n\nWAS THE ROSICRUCIAN MANIFESTO ‚ÄúCHRISTIAN ROSENCREUTZ‚Äù\n\nAN ALLEGORY OF THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION?\n\n1209-1244\n\nAlbigensian Crusade\n\n‚ÄúAlso is the record of a boy born to a Cathar couple of the nobel house of Germel in western Germany, who later journeyed to Arabia for formal tutorship in the esoteric tradition.

Some are which comes from sheer ignorance, others come from cherrypicking, or as Wikipedia calls it, Cafeteria Christianity. Although Wikipedia is a prime center of disinformation, its most useful feature is the \"See also\" section that draws more dots to connect from. The main three \"See also\" articles the \"Jesuism\" article recommends that is worth noting is Christian deism, Christian atheism, and Jewish Christian.\n\nFrom Christian deism's \"See also\", you would find Cafeteria Christianity, Christian atheism, Cultural Christian, Jesuism, Moralistic therapeutic deism, Natural religion, Nominal Christian, and Theistic rationalism suggested.\n\nFrom Christian atheism's \"See also\", you would find Asimov's Guide to the Bible, Christian communism, Christ myth theory, Cultural Christian, Death of God theology, Demythologization, Don Cupitt, Jefferson Bible, Jesuism, Lloyd Geering, Lubo≈° Motl, Nontheist Friends, Nontheistic religions, Postchristianity, Robert Jensen, Robert M. Price, Sea of Faith, and Thorkild Grosb√∏ll suggested.\n\nFrom Jewish Christian's \"See also\", you would find Christianity and Judaism, Christian‚ÄìJewish reconciliation, Christian Torah-submission, Church's Ministry Among Jewish People, Conversion of the Jews, Dispensationalism, Hebrew Catholics, Jesus in the Talmud, Jesuism, Jews For Jesus, Judeo-Christian, Olive Tree Theology, and Relations between early Christianity and Judaism suggested.\n\nIf it isn't obvious by now, Jesuism/Jesusism/Jesuanism leads people away into crackpot theories asserted as viable reasons to reject what Jesus said about being the \"I AM\" that appeared before Abraham as the angel/messenger of God in the likeliness/image of God, many of which are also promoted by the unbelieving Jews who are really gentiles by blood, Babylonian mystics by faith.\n\nEisegesis means the interpreter make the bible say what they want it to say while exegesis means the interpreter makes the bible say what God want it to say. Many people use the old esotericism vs exotericism argument to prove their stance, but really that is not enough, while the whole appeal to authority is also not enough. They trick people into eisegesis most often through so called evidence, but to remove the epistemological nature of the truth for relativistic ontological interpretations, substituting retroduction for abduction/abductive reasoning which retroduction speak in absolutes while abduction doesn't, can only make general intuitive claims bypassing intellectual scrutiny. Although it seems like little to nobody knows what the Greeks meant by retroduction and how it differs from abduction, it's mostly understood by Christian apologists as presuppositional apologetics and its frequent use of Reductio ad absurdum to not give up any ground of the epistemological source of truth to being from the Christian God alone that created nature, logic, et cetera, that through His revealed word as the Holy Bible as the Creator do people can come to know what is the nature of this reality that we're in and also know by what He says to be true is reality, which then gives ground to talking about the gospel message and so on.\n\nAn application of believing in the bible is done in the following, Psalm 14:1 (1599 Geneva Bible) says : \"The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God: they have corrupted, and done an abominable work: there is none that doeth good.\" Christians believe in what the bible says which all scripture is God breathed. Therefore, Christians can claim atheists are fools to God because the bible says so. 2 Timothy 2:24-26 says: \"24 But the servant of the Lord must not strive, but must be gentle toward all men, apt to teach, suffering the evil, 25 Instructing them with meekness that are contrary minded, proving if God at any time will give them repentance, that they may acknowledge the truth, 26 And come to amendment out of that snare of the devil, of whom they are taken prisoners, to do his will.\" Christians believe in what the bible says which all scripture is God breathed as in, it's true because God had revealed those words to be revealed to mankind to know something. Therefore, Christians can claim that God gives people the ability to repent and that if they do repent, they can then start to acknowledge the truth, while the process of instruction to the contrary minded is done in meekness so that they can change and get out of Satan's will that they were formally imprisoned by to serve him. The most infuriating truth to the unrepentive sinners under Satan's will is that only God's will can pardon them of their sins, not by their own power. Just as dead people can't willingly resurrect themselves to take hold of a resurrection potion to revive their dead bones, so can't people will themselves to be saved without being under Satan's will that promotes a doctrine contrary to what the scriptures speaks for itself in exegesis.\n\nRomans 1:18-21 says: \"18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, which withhold the truth in unrighteousness. 19 Forasmuch as that, which may be known of God, is manifest in them, for God hath showed it unto them. 20 For the invisible things of him, that is, his eternal power and Godhead, are seen by the creation of the world, being considered in his works, to the intent that they should be without excuse: 21 Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was full of darkness.\" BELIEVE IT. Yes, everyone HAS NO EXCUSE, those that say they knew not God are lying. Everyone sins against the God that they know. The foolish \"Jesuists\" (reminds me of Jesuits) might try to say that this isn't true at all because it came from Paul, but to me, it seems like Psalms 14:1 is also their enemy, so they would reject the Old Testament altogether of what there is to be redeemed and understood through the Holy Spirit and also through New Testament interpretation of the Old Testament.\n\nThose that adhere to Jesuism also believes that Jesus made a mistake in picking his disciples. That's apparently fine by them since these \"Jesuists\" don't think that he's God, they reject the Trinity which is hinted through and through in the Old Testament, and they think that Jesus' disciples were stupid enough to make up their claims of seeing Jesus being resurrected from the grave just because Paul came around and supposedly made up stuff. Although Jesus spoke about the Synagogue of Satan to being Rabbinism, many Jews hate Paul for his anti Jewish affirmations of what Jesus had spoken, while they abuse eisegesis to imply that the Synagogue of Satan is not them but something else like Roman Catholicism, shifting the blame away from them when for the most part, it was the Jews (and the Venetians) that had corrupted Roman Catholicism's many false doctrines stemming from the Cabala/Kabbalah. Evidence is only useful to Christians that believes that abolute truth exists, that they can know something to be true, that logic exists, logic is universal, does not change, is not made of matter, that without God, you can't prove anything, and believes that God (all other \"gods\" are idols) is the God described in the bible.\n\n\"Jesuists\" reject John 1:1-5 and 2 Timothy 3:16-17. Technically, Jesus' first miracle was Genesis 1:1. This is where their cherrypicking and their endless lies comes in and say that Paul had influenced the Apostles before they had written the gospel to the point of making the gospels \"Pauline\". In one hand they favor the authors that appeals to the Jews like say Matthew, James, and Peter, but in another, they cop out and say that Jesus didn't say this or that because they were \"Pauline\" whenever if it by the slightest bit defies what Christian deism, atheism, and (British propaganda of British Israelism) Zionism has to say. Jesus is alive, the New Testament is clear about that. However, the \"Jesuists\" reject whatever words that Jesus said after his resurrection to be real as they cop out with the whole \"Pauline\" argument. They don't trust the very authors that they rely in their testimony.\n\nConcerning their other cop out, here's what Matt Slick has to say about the Talpiot tomb that has the pagan seed of life symbols etched into it: <a href=\"https://carm.org/has-tomb-jesus-been-found\" target=\"_blank\">Has the tomb of Jesus been found?</a> The other location that James Tabor talks about the one in Safed is based on Rabbinical sources and tradition (see: <a href=\"http://selfhelpeducationarena.com/the-second-coming-what-if-jesus-is-buried-in-the-galilee/\" target=\"_blank\">THE SECOND COMING: What if Jesus Is Buried in the Galilee?</a>), which I'm inclined to believe that they had made a grave supposedly for Jesus and threw in someone's body in it because they just hate Jesus so much, they sometimes refer to Jesus as Baalim and many blasphemous nonsense and curses in the Talmud and the Zohar. It is the RESURRECTED Jesus that Paul met. The Judahites seek miracles, the gentiles seek wisdom. Doubting Thomas didn't believe until he touched Jesus' wounds. It took nothing short of a miracle to change a Benjamite Judean Pharisee that murdered Christians about everything that he ever knew to be completely wrong through the presence of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Jesus had seemed to stop giving out any more revelations after Apostle John had written the Book of Revelation, while some spiritual gifts of the Holy Spirit had stopped happening often which its false demonic replacement for the gift of tongues, healing, and prophecy took over Calvinistic Evangelical Christianity through the guidance of the British of course, see: <a href=\"http://www.larouchepub.com/other/1997/ahc.html\" target=\"_blank\">British Subversion of the United States: The militias and Pentecostalism</a>.\n\nHealing as a gift occasionally happens, as well as the occasional speaking of foreign human languages without studying said language, though it's very rare and nobody is \"annointed\" to have them all the time. Paul tried to heal himself of his pain in the side, but God said that His grace is enough: being saved from imprisonment of Satan's will and sin is more important than healing people, which Paul and the Apostles did heal people through the Holy Spirit, so such miracles were geared towards the Judahites to be saved, and the saved need not to be healed from physical and even mental ailments when it would only prolong their suffering in their time on earth, which was one reason why God didn't want Adam and Eve take the fruit of life because they would had to be separated from God forever as their death won't come to end the spiritual separation caused by the sinful flesh. \"Jesuists\" might say that since Jesus Christ had sent the Holy Spirit to come in his place, everyone should be able to do miracles, that it won't go away unlike what Paul implied that there's only three gifts left, faith, hope, and love. Read the <a href=\"http://www.padfield.com/acrobat/debates/bogard.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">McPherson-Bogard debate</a> for a proper understanding of what the bible says compared to what the witch Aimee McPherson babbles on about in demonic eisegesis. Xenoglossy is not glossolalia of which the latter was done in the post apostolic church (most likely not structured as an ecclesia but as a kuriakos) under Justin Martyr. Xenoglossy is the real tongues spoken, speaking forth the gospel message. Angels biblicly spoke in the tongue of men. When actual xenoglossy and actual healing instead of cheap parlor tricks and hypnotism (see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuP5uOI7Xwc\" target=\"_blank\">Derren Brown - Miracles for Sale (Full)</a>) occur, as much as Christians want to attribute it to God, in doing so, we might think that God didn't fulfill prophecy through the Apostles. This form of evangelical Jesuism isn't identified as such but they do exist.\n\nIf one tried to learn about exegesis of the red letter words of Jesus Christ, they would have to include context of the whole bible. Likewise, the \"Jesuists\" would have to take James' words in the context of Paul concerning works. Taken from <a href=\"https://carm.org/are-we-justified-faith-romans-or-works-james\" target=\"_blank\">Are We Justified by Faith (Romans) or by Works (James)?</a>:<blockquote>What is James Saying?\n\nJames is simply saying that if you ‚Äòsay' you are a Christian, then there had better be some appropriate works manifested, or your faith is false. This sentiment is echoed in 1 John 2:4 which says, \"If you say you have come to know Him, yet you do not keep His commandments, then the truth is not in you and you are a liar.\"\n\nApparently, there were people who were saying they were Christians but were not manifesting any of the fruit of Christianity. Can this faith justify? Can the dead ‚Äòfaith' that someone has which produces no change in a person and no good works before men and God be a faith that justifies? Absolutely not. It is not merely enough to say you believe in Jesus. You must actually believe and trust in Him. If you actually do, then you will demonstrate that faith by a changed and godly life. If not, then your profession is of no more value than the same profession of demons: \"We believe Jesus lived.\"\n\nNotice that James actually quotes the same verse that Paul uses to support the teaching of justification by faith in Rom. 4:3. James 2:23 says, \"and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, ‚Äòand Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.'\" If James was trying to teach a contradictory doctrine of faith and works than the other New Testament writers, then he would not have used Abraham as an example.\n\nTherefore, we are justified by faith. That is, we are made righteous in the eyes of God by faith as is amply demonstrated by Romans. However, that faith, if it is true, will result in deeds appropriate to salvation. After all, didn't God say in Eph. 2:8-10, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe Messianic \"Christians\" and the more obscure neo Ebionites really hate Paul, they at times are guilty of believing in Arianism, Arminianism, Open theism, Process theology, Liberal naturalism, Naturalism, Empiricism, Rationalism, Jesuism, Zionism, the Talmud, the Zohar, Pentecostalism, even Christian deism and Christian atheism along with its various hidden ties. The level of corruption they have varies from group to group. They are drinking down the Kool-Aid of British propaganda the most while insisting that they're the most \"set-apart\" from the world, they are actually far from understanding the bible. They try to diminish the name of Jesus Christ (see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/name-of-god/\" target=\"_blank\">Name of God</a>), they try to pretend that all Judahites are Rabbinic Jews (see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-two-biggest-lies-concerning-the-jews-and-other-myths/\" target=\"_blank\">The two biggest lies about the \"Jews\" and other myths</a>), they never properly explain <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/partial-preterism/\" target=\"_blank\">Partial Preterism</a>, they have infiltrated Christianity (see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/one-aspect-prieure-de-sion-knights-templar-rosicrucians-jesuits-de-medici-jews-took-protestant-reformation/\" target=\"_blank\">One aspect of how the Prieur√© de Sion, Knights Templar, Rosicrucians, Jesuits, de Medici, and the Jews took over the Protestant Reformation</a>), and they reject proper epistemology for ontological relativism (see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/rudimentary-constituence-satans-cults/\" target=\"_blank\">The rudimentary constituence of Satan's cults</a>). There's more to their deception which I haven't covered yet. People seem to have cognitive dissonance when they confront Jesuism because in one aspect, they don't want to call Jesus a liar, yet the implications that they get from \"Jesuists\" are heretical to say the least that comes not from exegesis but from eisegesis. Jesus talks about how to deal with these dumbasses. Matthew 18:15-17: \"15 Moreover, if thy brother trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast won thy brother. 16 But if he hear thee not, take yet with thee one or two, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be confirmed. 17 And if he refuse to hear them, tell it unto the Church: and if he refuse to hear the Church also, let him be unto thee as an heathen man, and a Publican.\"\n\nUnfortunately, many are in a top down system of lordship as kuriakos/church that keeps people away from knowing that people can be each other's ministers in an ecclesia/community so that everyone can be a minister that keeps each other accountable as a tribunal with redundant moderation, checks and balances. A top down pyramid scheme authoritative system is bound to be destructive, keeping people away from God through their absolute power. There's too little people around that are aware of this to make such a Christian Utopian Community to form, but it's a separatist answer to the problems of a corrupt nation. As I've said before, the fire baptism from Heaven needs to occur to purge all the spiritual goats that try to destroy the spiritual Jerusalem in the allegorical 1000 year reign of Jesus Christ as the Holy Spirit and the invisible Body of Christ that is \"The Church\"/God's ecclesia/Godly community. Many of those who seek to build a utopian community tend to do it with the wrong mindset, and are very exclusive, they're \"inclusive\" to high class or upper middle class people as their \"salvation\" is of a materialistic salvation from the breakdown of society. To such people, I have no heartfelt communion with. Every Christian is called to be of the \"royal priesthood\", but most people don't know how it would look like. When a minister mediates between you and God, that's not a minister. A minister serves the people so that they won't be in the way of God. If you have to help someone in your church through the minister because you can't directly minister to others, that is a corruptible system with too much power only in the hands of the minister. If everyone is a minister and of the congregation, we can help each other DIRECTLY, none of this proxy crap. It was not God who failed me, it was mankind. It was my fault in placing too much trust in mankind. Some things, you need to do for yourself, not through the hands of a minister that does not act accordingly in proper orderly conduct. I've seen corruption in churches that I was dragged into its drama. Because of that however, I think God meant it for good to seek more of Him and I've learned a valuable lesson: goats never before and never will turn into sheep. I only hope to awaken the asleep sheep and let the goats know why they are goats.\n\nüí´<strong>\"Biblical\" Jun 16, 2016 @ 09:28</strong>\n\nTo be an effective minister of the New Testament, one first need to KNOW what it talks about or else your DEEDS are foolish in-deed being workers of iniquity. As explained in my <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/eisegesis-of-jesusism/\" target=\"_blank\">Eisegesis of Jesusism</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/rudimentary-constituence-satans-cults/\" target=\"_blank\">The rudimentary constituence of Satan's cults</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-ride-never-ends/\" target=\"_blank\">The ride never ends!</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/what-isnt-predestination/\" target=\"_blank\">What isn't Predestination?</a> articles along with information from presuppositional apologists like Cornelius Van Til and Sye Ten Bruggencate of <a href=\"http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/</a>, even Romans 3:21,22 as this video explains <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLwCipxPhPA\" target=\"_blank\">What is Biblical Faith?</a>, the very foundation of Christianity is being attacked by liars concerning what is faith to begin with. I would even argue that belief itself is an action stemming from faith received through the Holy Spirit's conviction to have you seek repentance through and in God's will that had chosen you from before the beginning, which that wholehearted, justified true belief with every part of your body, mind, spirit, heart, is accounted for righteousness which is not just \"faith\" in something to be true, but the trust to believe in God with everything is to believe, a verb, an action that comes from God, not by your own will which is the will imprisoned by Satan that's also called self will, placing your self over God. If the weight of your trust in God is on any scale where you place even a little of your weight apart from God, your actions will show how you don't fully believe in trusting faithfulness that is to believe while faith is a noun that is head knowledge but not your heart as well. In the standpoint of God, He knows who is saved and who is not, and people can't know 100% if they are saved even if they do works that shows that they believe with the same faith that is required from God, and people sin from time to time because of their flesh that God made to make people sin to begin with, while man's own works might deceive others, even themselves in thinking that they are saved when their faith in what they believed in is false. The truth supercedes all action. Many Calvinists believe that they are saved, but really only God knows 100%, all we can do is to check if their actions from belief as well as their faith is biblical. That is prime reason I've made this website, to help people come to an understanding of what that is.\n\nThe Old Testament laws occasionally display what we would think as human rights violations like say Deuteronomy 22:28-29 (paying a rapist for raping your daughter as dowry for a forced marriage of what could be in an abusive relationship), Deuteronomy 23:20 (usury to gentiles), while some laws are CLEARLY done away with like Genesis 17:10-14 (circumcision) because Acts 15, Colossians 2 and Romans 4 as an example, we have much much looser restrictions concerning diet because Acts 15:29 and Romans 14, even the strict observance of the sabbath is done away with because of Colossians 2:17 which many don't quote that after Colossians 2:16.\n\nColossians 2 (GNV):<blockquote>16 Let no man therefore condemn you in meat and drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days,\n17 Which are but a shadow of things to come: but the body is in Christ.</blockquote>\n\nThose who are in Christ therefore, are not condemned. \"Resurrection Sunday\" and the remembrance of the naitivity during the winter time although the dates are historically off, is not the same as celebrating Easter and Christmas. Celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ that saved us or remembering when he was crucified, that isn't celebrating a pagan fertility idol that lay eggs. Reenactment of biblical stories is not a sin. Not knowing the proper historical dates is not a sin. Not celebrating on those proper historical dates is not a sin. Celebrating Mother's day is a sin, so is Valentines day, President's day (call no man your Father), Veteran's day, Black Friday, Halloween or as the Festival of the Reformation yet setting up the same junk the secular people do to celebrate Halloween, any blatantly pagan, worship of man, worship of idols, worship of false religions, it's a sin when you worship God through ways that is designated to things not of God. No one is going to hell for not going to church every week or for many decades, but all Christians should seek to not forsake the gathering of the saints whenever they COULD gather. Godspeed in finding a good Christian community, for I haven't found one yet.\n\nHere's a good chapter, 2 Corinthians 3 (GNV):<blockquote>1 Do we begin to praise ourselves again? or need we as some others, Epistles of recommendation unto you, or letters of recommendation from you?\n2 Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is understood and read of all men,\n3 In that ye are manifest, to be the Epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart.\n4 And such trust have we through Christ to God:\n5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to think anything, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is of God,\n6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.\n7 If then the ministration of death written with letters and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance (which glory is gone away.)\n8 How shall not the ministration of the Spirit be more glorious?\n9 For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.\n10 For even that which was glorified, was not glorified in this point, that is, as touching the exceeding glory.\n11 For if that they should be abolished, was glorious, much more shall that which remaineth be glorious.\n12 Seeing then that we have such trust, we use great boldness of speech.\n13 And we are not as Moses, which put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look unto the end of that which should be abolished.\n14 Therefore their minds are hardened: for until this day remaineth the same covering untaken away in the reading of the old Testament, which veil in Christ is put away.\n15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is laid over their hearts.\n16 Nevertheless when their heart shall be turned to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.\n17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\n18 But we all behold as in a mirror the glory of the Lord with open face, and are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</blockquote>\n\nPeople tend to forget that the 613 mitzvot of the Talmud derived from the Pentateuch. You can read it yourself in the perspective of a Seventh Day Baptist: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2iRvmrA_WFmcm9HcHE2VHZLd3c/view?pref=2&amp;pli=1\" target=\"_blank\">How Many of the 613 Commandments Apply to Christians?</a>. Some of the commandments in the \"Written Torah\"/Pentateuch/(Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy) are to abstain from pagan rituals like literally cooking a calf with its mother's milk in say a cauldron, shaving off your hair in mourning, giving up phallic animal parts as an offering to God (he's not the pagan idols of fertility), etc. Others are a symbolic representation of what Jesus supposed to do as a Royal High Priest of the Order of Melchizedek/Shem(the son of Noah), some are sacrificial laws that have potential hidden meanings (see:<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160608075045/http://www.hisholychurch.org/sermon/sacrifice.php\" target=\"_blank\">The Adventures of Artifice in Languageland</a>), though that does not mean that they absolutely didn't do literal physical sacrifices, neither does it mean Jesus Christ didn't have to be crucified either as the \"Jesuists\" claim (see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/eisegesis-of-jesusism/\" target=\"_blank\">Eisegesis of Jesusism</a>). Of course the Talmud has more than just the 613 mitzvot, there's also the 50 private laws and 3 secret oaths that makes up the \"Mosaic Law\", see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/venetians-infiltrate-jews/\" target=\"_blank\">How did the Venetians infiltrate the Jews?</a>. The 66 books of the Christian bible unfortunately contains a book written by the Sanhedrin that should had been a part of the Apocrypha (false) called the book of Esther (see: <a href=\"http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/PseudoBibicalEsther_reprint112013.html\" target=\"_blank\">NPN Article: The Pseudo-Biblical Book of Esther - Mainspring of Zionism</a>), which is one of the most misunderstood books of the bible because IT SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE TO BEGIN WITH. The Reformation bible that is, the 1560/99 Geneva bible, has footnotes that comes from Sedevacantists throughout the ages concerning the book of Revelation, but it pushes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5yh-LB7sAQ\" target=\"_blank\">Premillennialism</a>/Futurism over Amillenialism which can only make sense through <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/partial-preterism/\" target=\"_blank\">Partial Preterism</a>/Historicism as also explained here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9MYoZEwuQQ\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9MYoZEwuQQ</a>.\n\nJesus is the Passover lamb, Jesus was born in Yom Teruah/Feast of the Trumpets of the night of 8/31-9/1 2BC or 4138 Anno Mundi (<a href=\"http://torahtimes.org/the_torah_calendar/4138_0002BC/4138_07_0002BC.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://torahtimes.org/the_torah_calendar/4138_0002BC/4138_07_0002BC.png</a>), Jesus had a four year ministry, Luke 13:6-9 talks a bit about it as he started his ministry in passover when he was over 30 (see: Luke 3:23 and John 2:13), had three passovers, then had one more which that \"this year also\" was about his crucifixion. Jesus was 34 years old when he died on Wednesday, resurrected on Saturday (<a href=\"http://torahtimes.org/images/sabbath_resurrection_02.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://torahtimes.org/images/sabbath_resurrection_02.png</a>). Paul and the apostolic church did indeed obey the Sabbath, but it doesn't mean that people are not saved for not obeying the Sabbath when it is in Christ Jesus do we rest in through the Holy Spirit our comforter. There are symbolic prophecies and meaning behind the Judahite holy days and the sabbaths and the jubilees that's also tied in with Jesus' ministry. The ultimate Sabbath comes after judgement day in the New Heaven, New Earth, New Jerusalem where Jerusalem comes down from Heaven on the Earth that was cleansed by fire as the light is God only. Many biblical prophecies were fulfilled through Jesus while Jesus simplified the Ten commandments as a new commandment(s) that's even more simplified as one commandment as the \"Royal Law\" which 2 Corinthians 3:6 could be an explanation to the New Testament that is received by the Holy Spirit written in the heart of the flesh by preaching the gospel to the sheep that needed to be awoken from their spiritual slumber that keeps them deaf and blind while the goats are only offended by it because they can't will themselves to be saved, because God had rejected them. The goats are of any race, as so is the sheep, but the serpent tribe is full of goats and wolves that want to kill off sheep. Why I've mentioned these things is so that people realize that Christmas and Easter are not even on the correct dates, and all but Daniel Gregg's calendar is correct in its chronology and based on verifiable astronomical observations and historic accounts, but that doesn't mean everything Daniel Gregg shares on his website: <a href=\"http://torahtimes.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://torahtimes.org</a> I agree with since he interprets trusting faithfulness to be supporting the Jesuitical doctrine of Arminianism. He had also failed to get the <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/name-of-god/\" target=\"_blank\">Name of God</a> correct. Real Christians shouldn't try to adhere to the Judahite holy days if it affects their work schedule to pay off their rent and real Christians won't even trust <a href=\"http://torahtimes.org/writings/rabbinic-deception/article.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Anti-Messiah Nature of the Rabbinic Calendar</a> and their Jewish (Babylonian) traditions <a href=\"http://torahtimes.org/writings/rabbinic-deception/missing_years.png\" target=\"_blank\">missing years</a>. Again, that doesn't mean that real Christians go to hell for worshiping God in the wrong calendar dates.\n\nI have talked about <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-error-of-solo-scriptura/\" target=\"_blank\">The Error of Solo Scriptura</a> where I differentiate Sola Scriptura from the heretical Solo Scriptura. It is through the proper definition of Sola Scriptura can one claim the Nicene Creed and the Athanasius Creed. All creeds, systematic theology, and doctrines however, needs to be epistemologically sound, self correcting instead of self contradictory, not necessarily set in stone as the bible, but to build on top of it without destroying its foundation. You guys need some examples of what I mean. Taken from: <a href=\"http://nathanielclaiborne.com/cornelius-van-tils-introduction-to-systematic-theology/\" target=\"_blank\">Quotes From Intro to Systematic Theology by Cornelius Van Til</a><blockquote>On the different branches of study:\n\nExegesis takes the Scriptures and analyzes each part of it in detail. Biblical theology takes the fruits of the exegesis and organizes them into various units and traces the revelation of God in Scripture in its historical development. It brings out the theology of each part of God‚Äôs Word as it has been brought to us at different stages, by means of various authors. Systematic theology then uses the fruits of the labors of exegetical and biblical theology and brings them together into a concatenated system. Apologetics seeks to defend this system of biblical truth against false philosophy and false science. Practical theology seeks to show how to preach and teach this system of biblical truth, while church history traces the reception of this system of truth in the course of the centuries.\n\nOn creeds:\n\nThe creeds of the Church are, as far as their content is concerned, no more than a systematic statement of the truth of Scripture. They are distinguished from the systematic statement of Scripture given by systematic theology (a) by their brevity, limiting themselves as they do to the most essential matters; and (b) by their authoritative character, since they have been officially accepted as standards by the councils of the Church.\n\nCreeds must be revised and supplemented from time to time. But it is not until systematic theology has progressed beyond the creeds that the creeds themselves can be revised.\n\nWhat the church needs is a more exact formulation of its doctrines against heresies as they appear in every new and changing form, and a fuller statement of biblical truth.\n\nOn the purpose of systematic theology:\n\nThe question of value is not the first question we should ask. The question of truth and of duty is primary. It is a God-given duty that we should take the content of Scripture and bring it together into a systematic whole. It is plain that we are required to know the revelation that God has given us.\n\nOn systematic theology‚Äôs ability to balance us:\n\nThe unity and organic character of our personality demands that we have unified knowledge as the basis of our action. If we do not pay attention to the whole of biblical truth as a system, we become doctrinally one-sided, and doctrinal one-sidedness is bound to issue in spiritual one-sidedness. As human beings we are naturally inclined to be one-sided. One tends to be intellectualistic, another tends to be emotional, and still another tends to be activistic. One tends to be only prophetic, another only priest, and a third only king. We should be all these at once and in harmony. A study of systematic theology will help us to keep and develop our spiritual balance. It enables us to avoid paying attention only to that which, by virtue of our temperament, appeals to us.\n\nOn the importance of systematic theology for preachers:\n\nThere are many ‚Äúorthodox‚Äù preachers today whose study of Scripture has been so limited to what it says about soteriology that they could not protect the fold of God against heresies on the person of Christ. Ofttimes they themselves even entertain definitely heretical notions on the person of Christ, though perfectly unaware of the fact.\nIf we carry this idea one step further, we note that a study of systematic theology will help men to preach theologically. It will help to make men proclaim the whole counsel of God. Many ministers never touch the greater part of the wealth of the revelation of God to man contained in Scripture. But systematics helps ministers to preach the whole counsel of God, and thus to make God central in their work.\nThe history of the church bears out the claim that God-centered preaching is most valuable to the church of Christ. When the ministry has most truly proclaimed the whole counsel of God, the church has flourished spiritually.\n\nOn the importance of a Christian method:\n\nThe question of method is not a neutral something. Our presupposition of God as the absolute, self-conscious Being, who is the source of all finite being and knowledge, makes it imperative that we distinguish the Christian theistic method from all non-Christian methods.\n\nOn the importance of a two-level understanding of knowledge:\n\nFor this reason, Christians must also believe in two levels of knowledge, the level of God‚Äôs knowledge which is absolutely comprehensive and self-contained, and the level of man‚Äôs knowledge which is not comprehensive but is derivative and re-interpretative. Hence we say that as Christians we believe that man‚Äôs knowledge is analogical of God‚Äôs knowledge.\n\nOn God‚Äôs incomprehensibility:\n\nAt the same time, God is incomprehensible to us because he is ultimately rational. It is not because God is irrational that we cannot comprehend him; it is because God is rational, and in the nature of the case, ultimately rational, that we cannot comprehend him. It is not because God is darkness that he is incomprehensible to us, but it is because he is light, and, in the nature of the case, absolute light. God dwelleth in a light that no man can approach unto. We are not blind because of the light of God; it is only in God‚Äôs light that we see light.\n\nOn distinguishing rationalism from irrationalism:\n\nIn other words, modern thought believes in an ultimate irrationalism, while Christianity believes in an ultimate rationality. It is difficult to think of two types of thought that are more radically opposed to one another. It is the most fundamental antithesis conceivable in the field of knowledge. It is nothing short of astounding that orthodox theologians should fail to make this basic distinction between Christian and non-Christian thought. The very foundation of all Christian theology is removed if the concept of the ultimate rationality of God be given up. It is upon it alone that we hope to build anything like a systematic interpretation.\n\nOn the nature of all human knowledge:\n\nAll analogical knowledge may be called theological knowledge. We can even, if we wish, identify the concept of analogical knowledge with the concept of theological knowledge. We cannot do without God any more when we wish to know about physics or psychology than when we wish to know about our soul‚Äôs salvation. Not one single fact in this universe can be known truly by man without the existence of God. Even if man will not recognize God‚Äôs existence, the fact of God‚Äôs existence none the less accounts for whatever measure of knowledge man has about God. We can readily see that this must be so. The idea of creation is implied in the idea of the self-sufficient God. Now if every fact in this universe is created by God, and if the mind of man and whatever the mind of man knows is created by God, it goes without saying that the whole fabric of human knowledge would dash to pieces if God did not exist and if all finite existence were not revelational of God.</blockquote>\n\nI had made an article about why <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/there-is-no-perfect-bible/\" target=\"_blank\">There is no perfect bible</a> which simply because a translation is not the original copied texts, there is no perfect source text contrary to the claims of KJVO crowd's claim, the Textus Receptus and the Masoretic Text are in some forms tainted by the scribes of errors not found in the Septuagint but that doesn't mean the Septuagint has no grammatical errors either. My God is not a translation. He had used the proselyte Rabbinic Jews to preserve but not 100% of what God wants to convey through the fallible language of man. It is a myth that the Hebrew language is a holy language. There could be a formulation to get the best translation from both TR and Septuagint. The Aramaic bible came from the Greek so it's not better than the Greek. There are many stories and lessons to be learned from the Old and New Testament books, so it's unwise to throw out all of the Old Testament books. There's much evidence for a true believer that proves the bible is true, and that God had made the world to be in His design. It's important to remember that evidence is subject to interpretation and presuppositions, but because God made the world, what He says is true, not what the things that we proclaim to be true. I could show you how male circumcision is biologically, spiritually, psychologically wrong but if you don't believe what the Apostles say about circumcision, I'm not helping you have biblical faith.\n\nThose that condemn Christians for not being physically circumcised, for saying \"God\", for not calling God through the name of a Ugaritic moon god or a Samaritan guess name for God that's actually Ba'al, for saying \"Jesus Christ\", for having the empty cross within their presence, for having nativity scenes instead of Satan's workshop are dangerous people that hypocritically put up the Talmudic Hanukkah lamp, sprinkle strangled chicken blood, bite and suck off the foreskins of male infants, use a pagan HEXagram that is the mark of the beast, push Arminianism, reject Calvinism, push Zionism, reject any criticism then cop out by saying anti semite when they're not even semetic, mock Christians for practicing pagan rituals, reject any claims of being pagans themselves, use an unbiblical calendar yet claim to be legitimate, call in the name of 72 demons instead of God which they don't have because they serve a pantheon, pushes Queen of Heaven worship through the \"Shekinah Glory\" nonsense, esoterically serves Saturn the 6th planet as Satan which their clothes matches their sinfulness, reject Jesus, reject the Holy Spirit, push the Holohoax lie yet ignore how more than 66 million Christians died in the gulags of their invention, had funded many wars, used Islam in their favor, corrupted Roman Catholicism further than its already corrupted form since the post apostolic church era and onwards, destroys their host nations, been kicked out of many host nations, controls the banks and nations through international organizations created to usurp the authority of the people, had edited both Catholic and Protestant bibles to change Judahite/Judean into \"Jew\", is behind the Venetians, the Jesuits, the Papal Nobility, the Black Nobility, the Freemasons, in many ranks of power in all levels from the top to the bottom wherever they are allowed to control, demoralize people through pornography, the media, Modern British Liberalism in schools (the Prussian education system is only one small facet of the multi faceted existing mind control program of the British Empire, see Anton Chaitkin's speech of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BImExxKpBYM\" target=\"_blank\">HOW THE BRITISH EMPIRE BRAINWASHED THE WORLD</a>), and many more countless acts of evil from their hardened hearts.\n\nIt was a hard journey for me to come to terms with the things that I'm sharing with you about, and you will probably have to have the process of the Beautitudes happen in your life before you can realize how God is working in your life, and if He leads you towards Him, it's not wise to ignore the Holy Spirit's calling or else you would be like the prodigal son again until you reached that point to be able to \"come back home\" again. In the perspective of God, He knows who's saved and who's not, who's going to be saved, who's never going to be saved. If you hate God for being God, you are not a Christian, for you seek to limit God's power over you so that you can be like \"gods\" yet become demon possessed. Though Satan is in the abyss, his minions still run about. I can only do so much in trying to restore basic Christian doctrine. What little do I know yet I know more about reality through God than the liars that say otherwise. May God burn all of you goats before sending you to the lake of fire in Judgement day. That is not a curse, just prophecy of the things to come in His perfect timing.\n\nüí´<strong>Slippery Slope of Futurism Jun 22, 2016 @ 17:14</strong>\n\nAs some would know, I've done an article about <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/partial-preterism/\" target=\"_blank\">Partial Preterism</a> and elaborated on it in the <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/biblical/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Biblical\"</a> article. I seek to be a \"Historicist\" first and foremost and I'm currently in favor of a Partial Preterist form of Amillennialism. It can't be literally 1000 years for it's a feminine gender plural number for \"thousand\" in the Greek which they don't count off with 1 for starting from 2 and more. Can you count from 1 to 1? You can't, that's not counting. Some Amillennialists think of Partial Preterism as a heresy that's \"Anti-Semitic\" and misinterprets much of scripture and history. The difference is how some answers are not fulfilled in Partial Preterism while Amillenialism on the other hand, ignores or misinterprets certain things to be associated with the unbiblical State of Israel when it should be applied to the body of Christ being born through the destruction of the Judahites. I am not a \"Historicist\" in a different definition which is about prophecy being fulfilled continually. Partial Preterists think that it's just been postponed until the figurative thousand years had passed while in another sense, we think that we're being historically accurate. Psalms 50 (GNV):<blockquote>10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine, and the beasts on a thousand mountains.</blockquote>\n\nPremillennialists (dispensational, pre-trib, mid-trib, pre-wrath, post-trib) and Postmillenialists both tend to believe in a literal 1000 year reign. There's a weird group of people that are post-trib amillenialists for a lack of a better word, believes that the seventh trumpet is the start of the eternal PHYSICAL reign of Christ. They are terribly wrong if they think that is so, for they would have to do some time warping to skip the seven vials of wrath that comes after the seventh trumpet, and they insist that there is no death in the 1000 year reign of Christ which they merge with the New Heaven, New Earth, New Jerusalem by having the second coming happen to change the body of the Christians into incorruptible bodies. These post-trib amillenialists do think that the desctruction of Jerusalem was biblical, but they don't associate it with Matthew 24 and Luke 21. They reject the notion that Christians escaped the destruction of Jerusalem by fleeing into the mountain, that it happened as Luke 21 states.\n\nPartial Preterists have two different kinds of raptures: one is escaping from the destruction of Jerusalem, and the other is the rapture of the living and the \"asleep\" (dead saved Christians), fulfilling Matthew 25, 1 Thessalonians 4. This mix up is the reason why some people can't grasp Partial Preterism. The other mix up is the identity of the false prophet. Partial Preterists groups the Mother Harlot to Rabbinical Judaism of the Synagogue of Satan. Nero is the Antichrist but he dies as Vespasian replaces him. From the first Judahite revolt to the destruction of King Herod's Temple of Jerusalem, it's just assumed that is 3 and a half years, 1260 days or 42 months in the Judahite calendar. Some Partial Preterists are anti Zionists that wholeheartedly believe that the \"Jew\" which became synonymous with Rabbinism, that salvation is not of the Jew but is from Judah as in, the lineage that Jesus comes from since Jesus/\"Jehoshea\" means \"God is our salvation\" in Hebrew, therefore, that verse is a twofold meaning that salvation comes from someone of the tribe of Judah that God had sent. Wikipedia has a somewhat similar take concerning Partial Preterism but with a more politically correct outlook: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_%28Revelation%29#Preterism\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_%28Revelation%29#Preterism</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_eschatology#Comparison_of_Futurist.2C_Preterist_and_Historicist_beliefs\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_eschatology#Comparison_of_Futurist.2C_Preterist_and_Historicist_beliefs</a>. The most crucial point that the Partial Preterist makes is his defiance to Zionism and his allegiance to the New Testament teachings over the Old Testament. Partial Preterism is the only politically incorrect stance that can religiously and historically justify and promote that the Judahites no longer have the birthright to rule any more except Jesus Christ alone. Look at <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-two-biggest-lies-concerning-the-jews-and-other-myths/\" target=\"_blank\">The two biggest lies concerning the \"Jews\" and other myths</a> and the two articles: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/partial-preterism/\" target=\"_blank\">Partial Preterism</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/biblical/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Biblical\"</a> already linked to in the top of this article because it's required reading now for this article.\n\nSome would say that Jesus was done dealing with the Judahites, ending the 69th sabbatical year when he was 33 years old, but having in my possession The Scroll of Biblical Chronology by Daniel Gregg a scholar and futurist, with an unbroken timeline, he proves that Jesus was 34 when he was crucified, that he had a four year ministry with five passovers, and the 69th sabbatical year was when he was 33 in his third year in his ministry of his four year ministry. They also quote Luke 19:41,42 but stop at that point when 43 and 44 makes it obvious that God didn't finish dealing with the Judahites, just classic eisegesis created by not reading a little more to bring forth context. A rejection of how God had rejected Israel by blood for the Israel of God that is the Christian, rejects fundamental Christianity at its core. A rejection of how God had made the Judahites DESOLATE as in nothing, no survivors as a race is a rejection of the truth that Jews (synonymous with Rabbinism, Pharisaism) replaced the dead Judahites through faith but not by blood. Replace all instances of the word Jew with Judahite or Judah in your bible, for until you make a conscious effort to differentiate the two, you are using the wrong definitions that would confuse Jews and Zionists. Just as gay actually means happy instead of homosexual, Judahite actually means of the tribe of Judah instead of someone of the Rabbinic faith that pretends to be from the tribe of Judah but is from the Synagogue of Satan. Magog is Khazaria and Gog is their leader. Khazarians became proselyte Jews. All Jews are proselytes by definition because God had divorced Judah for all of humanity. They are also called gypsies, Northern Barbarians, Babylonians, genetically predominately Germanic. They have no DNA of their own that they can claim to be truly theirs as a race. Since they are generally Germanic, they are not Semitic, yet they treat Arabians and Asians in general as cattle like they treat all gentiles.\n\nSome would say that Luis de Alcasar SJ created the myth of Partial Preterism, that it helped the Papacy and such, but Futurism was \"created\" by Francisco Ribera SJ yet they give a blind eye towards that and how there's Catholics that believe in Sede Vacante (besides SSPX but in the Roman Catholic Church's history) existed before the Jesuit Order itself had pushed a mix of Futurism and Historicism in identifying popes as Anti-Popes or just not legitimate popes therefore the seat is vacant, and also how this blaming of the RCC served to help the Venetians and the Jews to divert the blame away from them, utilizing genuine movements to adhere to some of their bidding which the Protestant Reformation is guilty of such compromises. The Roman Empire was the Beast and Rabbinism was the Harlot, but now the Jews run the nations/beasts in the world and Roman Catholicism is one of their many victims of their degenerative cancer furthering the destruction of the patriarchy. The Reformation was controlled in the first place through the Lollards. It was only until later when Martin Luther and some others became anti Rabbinism which was a part of biblical Christianity. John Calvin, Martin Luther, John Wyclif, C. H. Spurgeon, Arthur Pink, Noah Webster, the writers of the Geneva Bible, and many more were \"Historical Preterists\" (closer to what I call biblical Partial Preterism): <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/c/calvin-john.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/c/calvin-john.html</a> <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/l/luther-martin.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/l/luther-martin.html</a> <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/w/wyclif-john.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/w/wyclif-john.html</a> <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/s/spurgeon_c-h.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/s/spurgeon_c-h.html</a> <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/p/pink-arthur.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/p/pink-arthur.html</a> <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/w/webster-noah.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/w/webster-noah.html</a> <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/g/geneva-bible-notes.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/g/geneva-bible-notes.html</a>. Partial Preterism isn't wrong just because a Jesuit wrote about it. Athanasius Kircher SJ for example, had drawn up a map of Atlantis which turned out to be a small submerged island which Danny Wilten had discovered: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY30rU1_ZIQ\" target=\"_blank\">Athanasius Kircher's Atlantis - Updated Map &amp; Plato's Dimensions - Danny Wilten</a>. Anti Zionism is a part of biblical Christianity, yet it just so happened to be that scholars and Messianics relying on Jewish (Talmudic, Kabbalistic) interpretations of the Christian bible that they corrupted with their tradition, pushing a false name of God over the real <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/name-of-god/\" target=\"_blank\">Name of God</a>. All the things mentioned in <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/biblical/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Biblical\"</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/rudimentary-constituence-satans-cults/\" target=\"_blank\">The rudimentary constituence of Satan's cults</a> articles applies to this.\n\nTed Pike's The Other Israel and Steven Anderson's (and Texe Marrs') Marching to Zion therefore, in some forms, had fallen for Jewish propaganda that they had yet to tackle directly. Texe Marrs might be a closet Partial Preterist for promoting the Matrix of Gog book, but on the other hand, he could be just open to interpretation concerning escatology, though focused on exposing the Jews. Texe Marrs is right that America is Babylon, spiritually speaking, submissive the the cult of Rabbinic Judaism that came from Babylon, AKA: the \"Jews\". Since I don't think that the Jews are Judahites, I don't think that they would ever repent and accept the Christian God like the Judahite Christians that had escaped the 3 and half year war. Ted Pike doesn't believe in Replacement Theology and also believes in Futurism. Steven Anderson knows the futility of endless genealogies, but he believes in Premillennial Mid-trib/Pre-wrath Futurism. I don't know if Ted Pike knows that the Holocaust was a Holohoax, but Steven Anderson sure does. Getting eschatology right is not enough to stay clear off of all lies from the Jews, but it is a huge step forward into accepting that the Judahites all died out. If that step isn't made, there leaves much room for fear, uncertainty, and doubt to seep in. Covenant Theology is the politically correct form of Replacement Theology which the difference between them concerns whether or not all Jews are Judahites, which they are not, and whether or not all Judahites are Jews, which they are not but they had also either merged with Christianity or had died out and spread through their Pharisaism making gentiles \"Jews\" by faith. That is why Covenant Theology is wrong and I now stand firm in that. That does not mean \"Jews\" can't be saved, they just need to let go completely of that RELIGION. Just as you might call yourself a Luciferian Christian, or an Atheistic Christian, or a Humanistic Christian, or a \"Messianic\" Christian, or a Christian that only listens to the red letters and reject everything else in the bible, doesn't mean that you really are a Christian. Why? It should be obvious why, that's a stupid question a fool that's separated from God through sin would ask. Authentic Judahites by blood are harder to scientifically prove that they exist, not to say that they don't exist within the gentiles, but there is no reference to authentic Judahite stock, it's all speculations or lies. Don't deal with endless geneaologies.\n\nüí´<strong>What every Christian Separatist hates to admit Jun 25, 2016 @ 02:47</strong>\n\nAlthough the \"majority\" is not defined by a mythical set amount of people that accepts a community as its own government separate from the nation that it's within, it can only thrive within a host nation that is accepting of them. Therefore, all Christian Separatists secretly hope that the host nation would be better instead of worse, they would favor Donald Trump over Hilary Clinton even though they won't participate in voting and have nothing to do with that government. The nations of the world are like animals: territory is determined by force. If the host nation ever feels like destroying Amish communities and other kinds of off the grid communities even in the legal sense separated from the nation that they came from, it will do as it wants and assert dominance over the \"Utopian\" communities that seeks liberty and power of God outside of their host nation that they feel rejects the Divine Royal Law of Jesus Christ. These people would favor relative good over relative evil, even though they're never going to change because of its system is inherently evil. They hate people that seeks to do good within a corrupt system in one hand, but in another, hopes that the host nation would respect their own borders. A free nation would allow mini nations to be formed, which in America, it is slowly changing to seeking the destruction of such communities: it already happened in Oregon and Amish children are slowly being dependent on the US government's regulations and resources which an Amish girl had to flee from America to seek proper medical treatment that isn't under the hands of useless and toxic US petrochemical synthetic Aztec medicine. Such communities at times could be hypocritically parasitic just as the nation that they seek freedom from. Though it is a noble cause to seek \"freedom\" outside of the lawgiver of a nation that they were bound to, mankind never had a consistent record of making sound judgement. Until said communities reach critical mass and arm themselves and make weaponry to defend themselves from the armies of the world, they are forever in danger. The dilemma of the separatist and the communalists is that if they ever become a nation, will they still maintain the same liberty that they had before? Historically, the answer is a big fat no. The Apostolic Church was corrupted after the Apostles all died out and eventually became a part of the Roman Empire. The Puritans made communities but were later forced to merge with other colonies. Even Marxist Communism claimed to not be a state yet they functioned as a state.\n\nA real Christian Separatist seeks to be in a Christian community but they don't necessarily stop believing in Historical Partial Preteristv Amillennialism and the second coming of Christ of the rapture of the living as well as the fire from Heaven that burns up the goats and the world to prepare for the New Heaven, New Earth, New Jerusalem. Before that comes, Satan would already be released, controling Gog and Magog (the Khazarian Jews and their leader) to seek the destruction of the spiritual Jerusalem (the Christians with the Holy Spirit), not the physical Jerusalem that was already destroyed and made desolate in 70 AD. The only way to \"be prepared\" is to make disciples all over the world, guard your heart from the lies of Satan, and flee from persecution when possible or accept the martyr's blood baptism, dying for your faith physically or spiritually throughout your life dedicated to God, dead to your friends and family that had rejected you for they had rejected Jesus first. Though nobody knows when Satan would be released if he already isn't, demons are already in the world sharing the lies that came from Satan of the false gospel(s) that replaces the true gospel and mimics and is parallel to the truth but will never be.\n\nüí´<strong>The Current Metagame of Online Censorship Jun 26, 2016 @ 13:02</strong>\n\nFrom <a href=\"http://82.221.129.208/ifyouareinamericayouprobablycantseethisaf6.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://82.221.129.208/ifyouareinamericayouprobablycantseethisaf6.html</a>:<blockquote>June 25 2016\n\nIt has finally been admitted on Yahoo that Google and Youtube <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-google-facebook-quietly-move-toward-automatic-blocking-002529206--finance.html\" target=\"_blank\">automatically censor videos.</a>\n\nIt is a puff piece that goes 3 percent of the way towards the truth. Here is reality: For years, if I put a video on Youtube, most of the time anyone who clicked a link to it would receive a message that I removed it. After I pointed this out, it would then just say something malfunctioned and give the static screen. This is very common with truth sites, and Mike Rivero was the first one who noticed and pointed it out. With this method, the IP of the computer that posted the video will work if whoever posted it clicks on it. So it looks like everything is normal. But if anyone else tries to hit it, it is censored. Youtube will also play a secondary trick of inserting obscene videos to discredit a web site, rather than what was really linked.\n\nAnother common form of censorship is the ghost ban, where when someone posts a comment, they can see their comment and no one else can. This is to silence people who continuously point out new topics more than it is for average people who are still stuck on \"911 was an inside job\". Additionally, there is a system which tracks everyone according to their level of knowledge, and will selectively show comments to people based upon what their knowledge level is, so they can still get feedback on comments, but no overall progress for the truth is made.\n\nThere is also a central database which operates cross platform, so if you post something to let's say REDDIT that tripped a censor, you will become registered in a central database, and the same censor will automatically happen on Youtube, Facebook, and practically every other site. They don't have to shadow ban you on an individual basis anymore.\n\nHERE IS A BIG ONE: Let's say you run your own forum and you like a poster's comments, and would never ban them. If the individual posting has materials that someone totally unrelated to your forum dislikes, your forum has a back door they can get into it with, be it the operating system, CPU, or forum software itself, and they will sit on your server and moderate your forum for you. This is happening at Rumormill news, and the people running the site do not even know it. This is also proven to be happening to Kerry Cassidy, and it has hurt the quality of her web site enormously. This is probably also happening with most other truth sites, but I sat down and intensively proved it with those two. The owners are completely oblivious to what is going on and I cannot get a message through to tell them.\nIf you use forum software, Wordpress, or any other publicly available software that runs outside of your control, you are DOOMED. Forget it and pack up. All you will be able to do is scratch the surface of a sensitive topic and you are GONE.\n\nGOOGLE ANALYTICS CENSORSHIP: Google plays a really dirty trick. If you put their analytics scripts on your web site, they will be used to make it run like crap or not work at all if you post anything sensitive. Once you put someone elses script on your site, they can use that script to destroy you, and I have personally seen that Google script wipe out Uncensored Publications (an ad that was once on my site) and they would not believe it and just sat there spinning until they were rendered irrelevant. Their sales dropped to absolute zero. The Google analytics script was used to block their web site from loading, and was programmed to send back a message that the web site did not exist. You had to hit it 3 or 4 times before it would finally be permitted by Google analytics to come in. No one is going to keep trying a dead link, if it does not work on the first click, off they go. It killed Uncensored completely. That is why I do not use Google analytics on this web site, if you post the type of stuff I post, they are an automatic death sentence. Obviously Google is powerful enough to know who is hitting an analytics script, so when the site owner checks the site, everything works fine.\n\nAD SERVER BASED CENSORSHIP: This happened to this web site. I got advertising through Zedo. That lasted less than a week. They propositioned me for ads right around the time of the Philip Wood bust, and never credited a single ad load, and never paid a dime all the while they, instead of sending ads, used the ad script to send viruses to anyone who hit this site. I caught it quickly, and it was BYE BYE zedo. Of course they also send out real ads to alternative news sites that sort of flounder around the truth, but if you are anyone who truly strikes bedrock, Zedo will kill you.\nAnd I am not worried about getting sued for posting these things about Google and others, because I have it documented as proven truth, and they will not want to see this get broader publicity than what is here. A lawsuit might even get published on Drudge.\n\nDNS censorship: Look at what the address bar says when you access this site. Need I say more? If you do not have a dedicated IP for your web site, and you speak the truth, you are DOOMED. This web site did not stay visible by chance!\n\nThere are lots of truth sites that post lots of \"damning\" stuff, all the while it is all linked through to MSM sources that are part of the control matrix. If all a web site does is assemble a collection of stuff that appeared within that control matrix, they are useless and will never be punished (like Drudge). You won't have to worry about getting censored for collecting all of the \"worst\" sounding stuff that is nothing but entertainment value, and even Google will give you ads and be your friend. This includes Assange, Snowden, and others who sparked a lot of interest, and accomplished NOTHING. If you have a message, and the MSM will print your name, you are NOTHING BUT A TOOL. That is why I stopped paying attention to Snowden, if he got a spot on HBO, he's fake or useless or a tool and that is all there is to it.\n\nA renegade truth site that does not follow any \"rules\" will:\n1. Not have any Google ads.\n2. Not run Google analytics.\n3. Not ever be mentioned by the MSM.\n4. Not run on anything someone else owns (for long) - for example, Aangirfan is real, and has had to jump around 50 times. There are others also that have to keep changing names. But any real truth site that is going to be stable will have to have it's own dedicated web presence, and not be able to post anything for free.\n5. Not have any outsourced ads from any other provider that require scripts to run\n6. Not run any outsourced processes such as fonts, or Bitly link builder (which is a totally proven censorship tool, it seems to me that clandestine censorship is the only reason Bitly exists)\nA real truth site that plays it cautious to avoid trouble (these still count as real) will:\n1. Still have dedicated hardware to avoid problems with censors\n2. Might have ads from ad servers other than Google or other mainstream sources,\n3. Might be able to run google analytics (but it will still be risky)\n4. Will not turn up in search engines without the use of direct quotes from the web site or the site address. (also true of renegade truth sites)\n\nMSM parrot \"truth\" sites that break no ground at all will:\n1. Be profitable and highly ranked.\n2. Have Google ads and Google analytics\n3. Can run anywhere without problems.\n4. Be mentioned frequently in the same MSM they call the \"enemy\"\n\nI guess I typed all of this up today after seeing that worthless Yahoo puff piece about how some video serving sites were going to \"start censoring terror\". Gee, with how far down the sewer hole everything has already fallen, one could only wish.</blockquote>\n\nNote: MSM means mainstream media. I have now going to keep this website to disable Google fonts, so bear with the ugly calendar widget because of the font that doesn't work with this free theme I picked up to use for my website. I am using hardened WordPress configurations but ideally I would be going Web 1.0 tier html websites. My website doesn't get much people, and it seems like only Google ironically have my website show up but only if you specifically look up the url to here. The Unhived Mind had uploaded his copy of a couple of my articles that would show up in lesser known search engines like Ixquick and Searx by the title name of my article, but it won't show this website's article but instead, The Unhived Mind's backup. This website is hosted in Norway but I'm using a .xyz instead of .is which .is is very expensive to have. I would be using something like <a href=\"http://1984.is\" target=\"_blank\">1984.is</a> for a VPS with a static IP but I don't think that specific website does that. Paying for a static IP address as a website isn't cheap. I'm paying this website out of my wallet. I had been banned from forums and social networking sites, dealt with censorship, but in the end, I'm not sharing nothing much that isn't already out there. My robots.txt doesn't allow spiderbots except for Google apparently due to Yoast SEO configurations. The probability of those that share the contents of my articles on social networks to be shadowbanned are high. Use a disposable email address like <a href=\"https://www.guerrillamail.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.guerrillamail.com</a> or <a href=\"https://10minutemail.net/\" target=\"_blank\">https://10minutemail.net/</a> and use the Tor Browser or a reliable VPN to make and access your social network accounts. Perhaps I've already said too much about my website.\n\nüí´<strong>Collection of The Unhived Mind interviews Jun 28, 2016 @ 09:36</strong>\n\n<strong>Conspiracy research interview #1 October 2013 with The Unhived Mind\n\nInterview by Poseidon Media\n\nWho is the Superior General of the Jesuits?</strong>\n\nThe current General is Adolfo Nicholas S.J who took over from Peter Hans Kolvenbach S.J. We have reason to believe that Kolvenbach still plays a major role in the Jesuits and may be a hidden second General working out of Lebanon in a time known as ‚ÄòThe Era of the Two Generals.‚Äô\n\n<strong>Is the Superior General the leader of the Jesuits?</strong>\n\nThe Jesuits do not have a leader if you look at the power structure in more detail. Yes the Superior General is the supposed head of the military order but the General is monitored closely and has to give confession to another Jesuit. Now ask yourself how powerful that Jesuit taking the confession of the superior general can be. The Jesuits exploited royal houses using the confession and catholic religion.\n\n<strong>What other Jesuits have great power?</strong>\n\nThe Jesuits within the Assistancy and Councilors to the Superior General. A Jesuit from the United States known as James Grummer S.J is the most powerful in the Assistancy. Jesuit Grummer works closely with the Superior General. Any Cardinal Jesuits are important due to the direct implantation within the Vatican in the College of Cardinals level. Spanish Jesuits have a lot of power and say within the order. Most Orders and powers are run by members who are unknown or not mentioned often. A Monsignor Jesuit also holds a lot of power and can usually be found in the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, Italy. A Jesuit Pope like Francis I is important within the ranks of the Jesuit Order.\n\n<strong>What is the location of Superior General and his Assistancy?</strong>\n\nA small sovereign region next to the Vatican called Borgo Santo Spirito. The Jesuit headquarters is known as the Curia Generaliza. Superior Generals have been known to boast, ‚Äúfrom here we rule the world.‚Äù\n\n<strong>What is the known most powerful office in the world</strong>\n\nThe Office of the Holy See is the most powerful office in the world. Behind the scenes the Jesuit Order have taken power of this office since the 19th Century. The Infallible Pope of Rome is overtly the most powerful man on Earth. The Pope of Rome is the Osiris of Egypt, the Sun God and his Cardinals are hinges to the Sun door. The final Pope of Rome will end up becoming the risen Horus!\n\n<strong>Why do the Jesuits use Jesus in their name when they detest Jesus Christ</strong>\n\nThe same reason the Vatican uses Jesus Christ, to infiltrate and manipulate true-Christianity. In the Jesuits mind they use Jesus Christ to also infiltrate and manipulate Catholicism. Jesuits also use Jesus Christ in the name of the Order so when addressed within the Catholic Church the addressers have to show subordination to the Jesuit Order. Any mention of Jesus should be received by a removal of headgear and a bow. The Jesuits love have Cardinals and the Vatican bowing but many within the Vatican get angered by having to do this. Vatican officials desired the name of the Jesuits to be changed to stop this overt subordination.\n\n<strong>What do the initials IHS mean?</strong>\n\nWe have a couple of definitions but the first is the Egyptian Isis, Horus and Set. Another is the Latin wording, ‚ÄòIn Hoc Signo‚Äô meaning ‚Äòin this sign‚Äô. The full Latin wording is, ‚ÄòIn Hoc Signo Vinces‚Äô meaning in this sign conquer but the Jesuits and Knights Templars miss off the V so as to try remove the image of military orders. The Jesuits claim they are no longer a military order, of course this is a complete lie. If you look at the ‚Äòh‚Äô in the Jesuit logo, this is the ancient symbolism of the Saturn God. Saturn being the reaper of souls, the god of judgement and time. Saturn is the astrotheological symbolism of Satan. Saturn has a powerful force which works with the base chakra or sexual chakra and therefore is connected with creation and the Generative Principle in Freemasonry. Saturn is the God Kronos who‚Äôs son is Zeus or the planet Jupiter. The Vatican is based on the the worship of Apollyon/Zeus. The name Peter comes from the planet Jupiter and Egyptian God representation known as Ptah Rekh. Many Irish Catholics masculines are named Patrick, this comes from the Ptah Rekh. The Catholic feminines are usually called Mary and this is the worship of the Moon Goddess Isis who breeds with Jupiter to produce Venus known as Aphrodite the hermaphrodite.\n\n<strong>How far back can we trace the origins of the Jesuits?</strong>\n\nJesuit origins can be traced back to the beginning of the Knights Templar. The Jesuit Order are the original Knights Templar revived all but in a different name. Other Templars survived and fled from the suppression of the Templars in the 14th Century. Many former-Templars and Morets fled to Portugal, Scotland and Switzerland. The only true continuum of the Templars originated in the Kingdom of Aragon. The Pope of Rome allowed a small amount of Templars to survive and moved them to the Kingdom of Aragon. These Templars were not allowed to use the Knights Templar name and order but they could create a different order with a different name. This leads us to the later Order of Calatrava and the Order of the Montessa. Some people are aware of the Los Alumbrados origins of the Jesuits and how this was the Spanish Illuminati a long time before the Jesuits formed the Order of the Bavarian Illuminati in the late 18th Century. Royals and Nobles claim the Jesuits have stolen lands and properties throughout history. Royals and Nobles forget how they suppressed and stole from the Jesuit Order and Knights Templar in times of old. In many ways the Jesuits have just desired revenge for these original thefts by the Nobles and Royalty. The Jesuits made sure this time that no-one could attempt to destroy them. This time no-one would emulate the suppression of the Templars or the Jesuits. Everyone speaks about Ignatius Loyola but as I have highlighted in the past the Borgia family played a role bigger than what is being mentioned. Loyola was the head of the Los Alumbrados and had a run in with the Pope for practising witchcraft. How in the hell do people think Loyola managed to worm his way out of the charges and get an audience with the Pope? Loyola had powerful connections and backers including the Doge of Venice who was Andrea Gritti and Venetian Cardinal, Gasparo Contarini not to mention Alexander VI Borgia who was behind the Los Alumbrados order the for-runner to the Jesuit Order both creations by the Cult of San Rocco (Venice). These two in combination with the Farnese family bought about the creation of the Jesuit Order. Many in Church detested the ideal of the Jesuits and knew they were trouble from the beginning. Some who opposed the Jesuits were removed prior to the orders acceptance. It is this Cult of San Rocco who created Opus Dei!\n\n<strong>What is the true definition of the word Jesuit?</strong>\n\nThe old and true definition from old dictionaries and encyclopaedias is ‚Äòa clever person who deceives the people‚Äò. Today‚Äôs suppressed education system removes such truths. Now ask yourself why Jesuits are seen as persons and not beings? You will have to look into the Uniform Commercial Code of 1933 and further into Admiralty Law to understand the difference.\n\n<strong>Are the Jesuits followers of Catholicism?</strong>\n\nHigh-end Jesuits can tell you more about Catholicism than anyone on the planet but this does not mean the Order at the highest levels follows Catholicism. The Jesuit Order is a witchcraft occult based order and any research on the Knights Templars and Los Alumbrados will highlight this fact. The Jesuit Order command the Mystery School teachings for the high elite families. The Superior General is the highest authority in Freemasonry. The Vatican has a covert Freemasonic Lodge inside Vatican City borders called the Grand Lodge Ekklesia. The Vatican has a close connection with Grandmaster Giuliano De Bernado. This Grandmaster of the Academy of the Illuminati is behind the movies Da Vinci Code and the Angels &amp; Demons. Some could think of Giuliano as the modern day Hiram Abiff due to his leadership in the rebuilding of King Solomon‚Äôs Temple.\n\n<strong>Have the Jesuits always mastered Freemasonry?</strong>\n\nNo the Jesuits had to infiltrate and take over all forms of Freemasonry. The Jesuits achieved this with the creation of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. The Jesuits had to take over the Grand Orient of France and the Sinclair Freemasonry. Freemasonry is the continuation of the findings and true-religion of the Knights Templar. The Jesuits believing themselves to be the only Knights Templar continuum, ended up taking over all other freemasonic powers. Whilst the York Rite of Freemasonry loses more status by the day, the Scottish Rite continues to grow. The overt headquarters of the Scottish Rite is located in Washington D.C. and called the House of the Temple. The true headquarters of the Scottish Rite is located in Dallas, Texas. John F. Kennedy was assassinated near the true power of the Scottish Rite. Dallas is an important region of the United States for hidden hand control. Dallas is far higher above the sea level compared to Washington D.C. and this is one of the important clues. You do not put all the power in the path of possible flooding. Both the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Princess Diana were symbolic ritual killings. The thirty-second degree of the Scottish Rite has a covert dedication to the Jesuit Order.\n\n<strong>Who‚Äôs research would you recommend for understanding some of the symbolism behind both the Jesuits and the Vatican?</strong>\n\nI would tell you to research the excellent work of two Seventh Day Aventists called Jim Arrabito and Professor Walter Veith. Both of these researchers will make it easy for anyone to start seeing this hidden power for what it is.\n\n<strong>Do you have a good example of a Jesuit connection to Israel?</strong>\n\nYes, Shimon Peres was trained by the Jesuits in Poland this fact was presented in the autobiography of Rabin. Shimon Peres is a loyal hofjuden to the Pope and Superior General. No one can doubt the power Shimon Peres has within Israel. If Peres does not like you then expect either the cup of borja, slug, dagger or strangulation cord. This is what happened to Rabin when Peres and his handlers desired it. Shimon Peres played an important part of the Vatican taking over East Jerusalem in 1993 with the signing of the Oslo Accords.\n\n<strong>What is important to the Vatican about East Jerusalem</strong>\n\nThis is the old city of Jerusalem known in the Vatican as the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. From Jerusalem the leader of the world will rule from within the King Solomon‚Äôs Temple III. I will not call this leader the Pope or Superior General because by that time I do not believe Catholicism will be in existence. The new world religion will be in place but the original powers of the Vatican will head this new religion wearing new garments and with new titles. Non of the current religions will survive the end of the old age of Pisces.\n\n<strong>Who else could be put on the throne as the front man for this new religion?</strong>\n\nJesuit-trained King Juan Carlos of Spain is the Protector of the Holy Sites of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. I believe he may be made visible in East Jerusalem if he is still alive by the time this event occurs, otherwise it will be Prince Felipe. King Juan Carlos is a member of most of the most powerful orders on Earth like the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, Order of Malta, Sacred Military Constantinian Order of St George and the Order of the Garter. King Juan Carlos of Spain holds the powerful title of ‚ÄòKing of Jerusalem‚Äô which originated with the Knights Templar and the Sepulchre. This powerful Templar title grants the King with full power over Jerusalem as well as most of the entire Middle East and North Africa. King Juan Carlos uses his organizations such as the Union for the Mediterranean to exercise his power and desires for these regions. Nothing happens in the Middle East without the say so of the Bourbon king or his aides like the Spanish Foreign Minister. Watch as hofjudens like Shimon Peres come over to Europe to visit the Vatican and Spain. King Juan Carlos has a strong influence with the Piazza di Spagna located next to the Congregatio pro Gentium Evangelizatione which holds immense power within the Vatican. King Juan Carlos stays in Piazza di Spagna whilst in Rome and he stays at the Villa Borghese. The Jesuits installed King Juan Carlos as head of Spain in 1975. From this time onwards King Juan Carlos took over the power of the Temple Bar and masters the physical bodies of the slaves as well as the Commonwealth Crown. The Jesuits and King Juan Carlos of Spain control the ancient city of Londinium (City of London).\n\n<strong>Who in your opinion controls the financial system</strong>\n\nThe Jesuits, Vatican through the Canon Law created Admiralty Law and later Uniform Commercial Code of 1933. I believe the highest Papal Orders control the financial system with Venetian merchant expertise. The Order of Malta, Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem and Opus Dei all have massive control over the wealth and monopoly illusion of the world. Some speak of the power of the Catholic Legatus organization when dealing with finance. Take a look at the origins of this organization and you will notice it is linked with both Opus Dei and the Order of Malta. The founder of Legatus is an Order of Malta member called Tom Monaghan. The City of London is the power over the financial world aided by New York City, Frankfurt and soon Dubai. Eventually the financial system will be ruled from Dubai.\n\n<strong>Can you name a powerful merchant bloodline connected with Venice</strong>\n\nYes you can start to research on the powerful Pallavicini family. Note how both Yayha and Felice Pallivicini play a big role in the control over the Arab world through inter-religious dialogue. Felice Pallavicini is a member of the Order of Malta and has direct connection to the Sanhedrin of the Jews.\n\n<strong>Who controls the trade in the Middle East?</strong>\n\nI would suggest you start to focus on the Middle East Association\n\n<strong>Who controls the trade of the world</strong>\n\nI would suggest you start to focus on TheCityUK and masonic lodges like The Worshipful Company of Mercers and newer The Worshipful Company of International Bankers.\n\n<strong>Who created controls the education system?</strong>\n\nThe education system we have was created by Venice and Britain through The Worshipful Company of Mercers, Gresham College and the Royal Society. Sir Isaac Newton was a member of the Venetian Party of the North! Queen Elizabeth II is a descendant of Venice if you study far enough into her bloodline you will soon see she is a Guelph. Venetian powers call Britain the New Venice! The First Cestui Que Vie Act from 1540 was mastered by the Venetians!\n\n<strong>Who gained the powers of the Templars when the order was suppressed?</strong>\n\nThe Sovereign Military Order of Malta took control from the Knights Templar in 1312 when the Pope signed the Ad Providam Papal Bull. The SMOM are known today as simply the Order of Malta.\n\n<strong>Who heads the Order of Malta?</strong>\n\nThe overt leadership is the Grandmaster based at the Magistral Palace. The Grand Master is backed up by the Grand Chancellor. Someone behind the scenes will take care of the day to day running of the Order and I believe this to be the Prelate of the Order of Malta. The same happens in the British version of the Most Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem which is front headed by Prince Richard the Grand Prior of the Order. Prince Richard is also a Liveryman of The Worshipful Company of Masons and a Patron of The Worshipful Company of Pattern Makers. Prince Richard is a Freemason. The current Grandmaster of the Order of Malta, Matthew Festing comes from the Grand Priory of England. Matthew Festing replaced Andrew Willoughby Ninian Bertie who was also a cousin of the Queen like Prince Richard. From the looks of it you would presume Grand Chancellor Jean-Pierre Mazery has a lot of power over the Order of Malta but you would be misled. Mazery is only a Knight of Obedience and not a Knight of Justice.\n\n<strong>Who do the Zionists answer to?</strong>\n\nQuite simply the Order of Malta and the Most Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem.\n\n<strong>Who subordinates the Order of Malta?</strong>\n\nThe Order of Malta has been a slave of the Vatican for hundreds of years. The Jesuits subordinated the Order of Malta by the end of the 18th Century.\n\n<strong>What other titles do the Grandmaster of the Order of Malta hold?</strong>\n\nAll Grandmasters carry the title of Cardinal\n\n<strong>What is Queen Elizabeth to do with these Knights?</strong>\n\nQueen Elizabeth II is a Dame of Malta and a Patron of the Most Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem. Queen Elizabeth II holds a lot of power over the British-Israel World Federation system. All the hofjuden Zionists answer to the Knights of Malta. The Sanhedrin once said the ‚ÄúJews have no King but Caesar.‚Äù The Pope of Rome is the Caesar and his College of Cardinals is his Senate.\n\n<strong>How do the Order of Malta and the Most Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem work together?</strong>\n\nBoth work together through the 1961 creation of the Alliance of the Orders of St John of Jerusalem. The Order of Malta control all other recognized Maltese Orders since the Order of Malta is the original order. This is why the Order of Malta have British Grandmasters today.\n\n<strong>So you say all these ancient powers never dissolved but have in fact gained strength</strong>\n\nYes, the ancient Roman Empire and Vatican has increased power like we would have expected. Papal Orders command and create everything. The Knights Templars and Morets created the modern world we live within today. The Knights Templar created international banking and what you use today.\n\n<strong>If the Knights Templar created all we have today then its creator must be the real source of this knowledge?</strong>\n\nIncorrect! The Normans play a large role in the founding of the Knights Templar but it is not the Normans who built the great cathedrals and gave us the knowledge we have today.\n\n<strong>If not the Normans then who did give us the knowledge</strong>\n\nIt all stems from the Middle East, everything comes from this region with Mesopotamia being important. Mesopotamia is what most know today as modern day Iraq. Go back and look at the Sumerian tablets but beware of Freemasonic Zacharia Sitchin‚Äôs disinformation. The Templars came across peoples in Palestine who had great wisdom and knowledge like no others of that time. These people known as the Morets were made up of doctors, architects, mathematicians and all sorts of wisdom. The Templars bought the Morets into Europe and used the great knowledge they possessed to do everything which was credited solely to the Knights Templars. During the suppression of the Order in 1312 many of the Morets went to Switzerland. I believe the Sturgeon teachers of wisdom within the Knights Templar angered the Pope often by teaching wisdoms that the Vatican did not like being made known. So this higher-level within the Knights Templar had often angered Vatican authorities let alone the debts the Vatican and other nations clocked-up to the order. Jealousy reared its ugly head and it is known what eventually happened to the order. No matter who tries to claim they are the original Templars, the only original Templars are the Jesuit origins because they was allowed by the Pope to survive in Aragon. No other Templars was allowed to continue even though they did in orders such as the Knights of Christ.\n\n<strong>Do you know a powerful financial bloodline connected to the Knights Templars?</strong>\n\nIf I was you I would look at the powerful Doria family who still exist today and control the Swiss Canton of Geneva with the powerful Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV. No one can deny the powers of the House of Savoy controlling a lot of the world. Take a look at the World Society and the connection to the Savoy. Prince Emanuele IV has a grievance with King Juan Carlos over the ownership of the King of Jerusalem title. Both these people hold extraordinary powers in this conspiracy web and both are members in the most powerful orders on Earth.\n\n<strong>Is there a Roman Empire today</strong>\n\nYes the Roman Empire never died, it somewhat just split and this gave illusions of the Spanish, Portuguese, British and American Empires. The American Empire does not exist and never did because this has always had the strings pulled by the City of London and Westminster in Britain. The New Holy Roman Empire existed before the 19th Century changes. It was the Congress of Vienna in 1814 that kick-started the New Holy Roman Empire that became more visible as the Little Horn from the Bible. A further aid to this Empire was the Treaty of Verona in 1822! Jesuit handled King George III used to sign his name Prince Elector of the New Holy Roman Empire. Queen Elizabeth II is today a Princess of the New Holy Roman Empire. King Juan Carlos is a Prince of the New Holy Roman Empire. The head of the New Holy Roman Empire is the Supreme Primate (Pope of Rome) currently a Jesuit named Pope Francis I.\n\n<strong>Where do the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion originate?</strong>\n\nZionism is a modern creation by the Jesuit Order. The Jesuits created and handled both Sabbatai Zevi and Jacob Frank. Both Zevi and Frank aided the splitting of the Jews and to bring over loyal hofjuden to the court of the Pope. Yet again division of divisions of the Jews always to keep the Jews from the original teachings of God. This goes all the back to Judea and Babylon and has continued to this day. The Protocols mentioned are simply renamed after the original orders of the Order of the Bavarian Illuminati. Those protocols are the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Sion not Zion. All of these protocols go back to documents which originated in Rome back in 1482 before the Jesuits even existed. The Jesuits just used those instructions in order to create the Illuminati and also destroy the Jansenists with another version of this same system.\n\n<strong>What organizations control Israel</strong>\n\nThe Council on Foreign Relations head-quartered in New York City. This Council works on behalf of the Pilgrims Society in Britain. The Organization the Institute for Jewish Policy Research also have a hold over Israel. Foundations like the Ford Foundation play a big role in the social engineering of Israel.\n\n<strong>Which is more important, the United States or Israel</strong>\n\nIsrael is not important in the slightest. What is important is the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Vatican and the Jesuits do not care about Israel as a nation, they merely use it for now to create social engineering in the Middle East. When all is achieved by the Jesuits in the Middle East, the nation of Israel and Zionism will be no more in existence. The Middle East will end up become one big trading block modelled on the European Union. The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem will be the Capitol City of the New Middle East not to mention the spiritual head of the world. Dubai will be the financial head of the world and Iraq will be the political head of the world. A lot of what sits in the West today will end up being located in the Middle East as the West is turned into a third world slave plantation. The Vatican will be destroyed by either a giant planned disaster or terrorist event resulting in a massive holocaust burning of souls as a ritual prior to the Roman powers moving to the Latin Kingdom.\n\n<strong>Is Tel Aviv more powerful than Washington?</strong>\n\nNot in the slightest! The Tel Aviv gang do have a big influence at times in the States aided by the likes of AIPAC but overall they are insignificant compared to the US Government. You have seen recently how Obama can give Netanyahu a hard time so do not believe Israeli powers command the United States.\n\n<strong>But Israel attacked the United States on 9/11 did they not?</strong>\n\nNo! The attacks on September 11th 2001 were planned by military powers under the City of London such as the Ministry of Defence, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Royal Canadian Air Force, Bombardier Master Trust and rogue intelligence units of Israeli origin. I have informed you that the Zionists are mastered by the Knights of Malta. Israel would not dare interfere with the world economy and system of power unless it had orders to do so by the New Holy Roman Empire. Any attempt to go against this structure of power would result in what happened to President John F. Kennedy but on a larger scale but veiled as some other event to cover-up the third truth reality.\n\n<strong>Do you think an airliner hit the Pentagon on 9/11?</strong>\n\nI do not believe that for one minute. I believe elements of French and Israel intelligence units under The Worshipful Company of Ship Wrights used an adapted vessel in the Atlantic to fire a Russian Granite missile targeting the Pentagon and the Office of Naval Intelligence. This allowed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to take control of the Operation Looking Glass server system and remove power out of Washington and into Chicago before finally placing control of the United States in the hand of the British Ministry of Defence under Geoff Hoon. So was it Israel, France or NATO? No the operation goes back to the head of the illusionary American Empire and that is the British Empire and the City of London. Always follow the trail and also the funding not to mention the economic reasons. The City of London Patent Pool took control of a covert $73 trillion a year business away from the U.S. Navy and connected software contractors like Cantor Fitzgerald based in the North Tower of the World Trade Center.\n\n<strong>Were the air attacks planned in Canada?</strong>\n\nNo! The Royal Canadian Air Force and Bombardier Master Trust executed the attacks. Of course some training and planning occurred in Canada but the master plan was drawn up in the inner sovereign area of New Jerusalem within the outer sovereign City of London aka ancient Londinium. All the planning was mastered by a high-level former-Royal Air Force Baron who‚Äôs partner has been a Worshipful Master of the World Traders Livery Lodge of Freemasons and Imperialists. The Order of the Bath and the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators planned the 9/11 air attacks. In some location somewhere will be legal documents with powerful signatories who signed off on this staged event. The 9/11 event aids the ushering in of the post-democratic and paranoia society all for draconian control under what is called the New World Order.\n\n<strong>What is special about Canada?</strong>\n\nCanada is ruled by the Jesuits and Queen Elizabeth II. The Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company controls the Americas region and the United States is subordinated to this power based in the Rupert Land. Study the ancient history of The Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company along with the Virginia Company of London and Plymouth. The same ancient powers still hold power over these regions. The Worshipful Company of Skinners took over a large amount of the former controls once owned by the Virginia Company. The Worshipful Company of Skinners called in the settling debt of the Virginia which forced Abraham Lincoln to dissolve the nation and incorporate the region as a business vessel on the high seas. This was supposed to just be a temporary measure but the Jesuits and Mercers already angry they did not get the lands were also angered the nation could not be put further in debt. Instead the Greenback came forth and could make the nation wealthy as well as pay off the pirates of the Skinner Liverymen. The Mercers decided they liked the idea of an incorporated United States better than the American Republic known as the united States of America (lower case ‚Äòu‚Äô) which once gave the people many rights never seen in before in history. The Jesuits decided to keep the corporation and so they assassinated Lincoln with the ancestor of Cherie Blair known as John Wilkes Booth and John Surratt. Now the corporation would stay a corporation forever and soon enough the Greenback could be destroyed and replaced with a fraudulent debt instrument IOU. This is how the Mercers have enslaved the United States and the US Citizens since 1868 and 1913. Today the US debt is increase by the removal of the Glass Steagall Act and the increase in unlawful derivative trading. The Federal Reserve erodes the value of the Federal Reserve notes by Quantitative Easing and printing up billions a month. The funding for the assassinations of Lincoln and Kennedy originated with the Bank of Montreal in Canada. John Wilkes Booth was paid ¬£50 for his part in the slaughter of Lincoln.\n\n<strong>What do you think of Stephen Harper</strong>\n\nYet another treasonous terrorist hindering the people of Canada on behalf of the Jesuits and Queen Elizabeth II. Stephen Harper and his party are an illegitimate supposed Government.\n\n<strong>Can you name some Knights of Malta connected with the intelligence community?</strong>\n\nInstead of giving you a long list of members some already are aware of, I will simply give you Leon Panetta the former-head of the Central Intelligence Agency. He serves Knight of Malta, George H.W Bush another member of the Order of the Bath like the Baron behind 9/11 (you connecting the dots yet?)\n\n<strong>Who in your opinion controls the majority of the alternative media?</strong>\n\nThe majority of the alternative media originates in the United States. Take a look at the main hub of this conspiracy information and it comes from Austin, Texas. That State of Texas sure holds a lot of significance in the conspiracy-exposure agenda does it not? Knight of Malta, George H.W Bush controls the majority of the alternative media. This controlled-opposition media tries to install self-helplessness and paranoia amongst intelligent people. This controlled side of the alternative media never highlights the true powers of the Vatican and ancient orders. A lot of this media does not even mention the Zionists although recently more of this talk has started to occur. The only reason they allow some Zionist talk is because at some point the masters will destroy Zionism. The Jesuit talk was hushed up and hardly ever heard until I helped raise awareness on the subject based on a lot of information I processed from Eric Jon Phelps. Mention Jesuits on any of these main conspiracy shows and you will be verbally abused, deleted or banned. How can anyone be ignorant of a power going back hundreds of years and who still exist today? Mention the Order of Malta and you will be abused and made out to be a fool by counter-intelligence programs. To me the foolish being goes around bragging about the ancient power of the Templars as they explain the modern conspiracy to a herd of sheople. This same being later denies the power of the Order of Malta whilst knowing the Maltese existed before the Templars whilst also taking all the Templar power and wealth with the Ad Providam Papal Bull. The Order of Malta exist today and have the same intense powers they always had all be it veiled to the herd who live in an illusion handed to them. How can anyone deny such a powerful force? The problem lies with the Jesuit controlled education system now classing anything over thirty years as ancient history. How can you teach anyone about hundreds of years if they think thirty years is ancient? The herd have been socially engineered to crave fiction and live in a fantasy. They do not mind hearing about powerful ancient orders like the Templars but only in the past, this way it stays a fantasy to be played around with in the minds of the gullible. Anything in the now will spoil this mindset and illusion. Today you have people craving to find out that aliens rule the world. If you explain to the herd that the power is held by a bunch of old men in frocks, this will burst the illusion bubble and security blankets fail.\n\n<strong>Do you have a good predictive programming movie that could help us understand what you just was trying to highlight with social engineering?</strong>\n\nI could use many examples from Hollywood but I choose a more modern movie called ‚ÄòThe Island‚Äò by Michael Bay. In the near-future the global population on Earth will eventually become the underground population in this movie.\n\n<strong>Who was behind the slaughter of Princess Diana?</strong>\n\nThe Most Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem, The Worshipful Company of Fuellers, Prince Philip, Secret Intelligence Service, GCHQ and quite possibly the hit was executed by the Special Air Service.\n\n<strong>Is there more to the assassination than just a slaughter?</strong>\n\nYes all these events have more happening than just what is seen on the surface. This was a planned out blood ritual like all these big assassinations such as John F. Kennedy in Dealy Plazza. The intelligence services do not just decide on a simple day of a particular month for the event to occur for no reason. The dates and location are chosen in accordance with occult principles. They will chose old ritual sites of ancient Gods and they will want certain monuments present like Cleopatra‚Äôs needle phallic etc. Princess Diana was murdered in an ancient place of worship of the old Goddess Diana the huntress within Paris the city of Isis. The planning for such events is deep and of course compartmentalized so the uninitiated profane do not understand the greater wisdoms towards the Great Work. Only those doing the bidding of Lucifer may handle in white gloves since they believe they do the bidding of God.\n\n<strong>Can you give us a Catholic connection to the Bush family since we believe they are Protestant</strong>\n\nEasiest one would be John Bush (Jeb) being a fourth-degree Knight of Columbus who kneels down to the Pope of Rome. Plenty of pictures exist on the web highlighting this action of John Bush. Hows about George W. Bush coming out of Red Mass, George W. Bush takes a liking to the communal wafer (Sun symbolism). The Nazi Bush family take orders from King Juan Carlos of Spain and his house of Bourbon. King Juan Carlos and the Bush Family have been regular visitors to the Cherlieu Palace of the Desmarais family up in Canada! Do you think King Juan Carlos would bother to waste his time going anywhere unless it had importance? Connect the dots!\n\n<strong>What do you think of the Bible?</strong>\n\nIt is a book of spells for witches which has been used by followers to attack supposed witches. I will say that these spells have had some positive effects on mankind but some of the spells have also had a negative. If I wanted to use a book of spells then I would choose the Geneva Bible 1560/99. I would not touch the King James Bible with a barge pole since it was mastered by an occultist named Sir John Dee (007) of The Worshipful Company of Mercers. How can a book of spells telling you to stay clear of the occult gain acceptance by anyone knowing it was mastered by an occultist? Take a long hard look at the history of the Bible and the suppression of the Geneva Bible and ask yourself which one you would choose. Do not be put off the Geneva Bible by those pushing the King James claiming it was a perfected Geneva, use common sense. Do you think the Puritans would have used inferior texts that needed radical improvements? It is all lies. Has not man speaking words and writing not caused most of the troubles we have today? Has it not been mans‚Äô writing and spelling which has created the pseudo-science and education systems of today which imprison us all. If man was left to his natural self he would be far better off and so would the biosphere and life on this planet. The Bible has a lot of good sides which must be understood and practised but it is not the final authority of perfection. Do not follow any other Bibles as they are inferior and pushed by the Jesuits to help destroy so-called true-Christianity. This interview is a form of witchcraft, made up of a series of spells via words creating a thought-form (magic). I hope you can understand the points I express.\n\n<strong>Do you know of any special organizations in Switzerland connected to the financial power?</strong>\n\nYou might want to research the Universal Postal Union based in Berne, funny enough it is just around the corner from the Vatican Embassy. You might want to look at the connection of the KPMG International Cooperative to the Livery system of the City of London.\n\n<strong>Why are we suffering strange weather and new environmental disease like Ash die-off?</strong>\n\nThis has all been created by the U.S. Air Force controlled Stratospheric Aerosol Geo-engineering program conducted through the international Treaty of Open Skies. When nano-particles of metals like aluminium and titanium get sprayed into the stratosphere, they act as a shield stopping the light of the Sun hitting Earth in the quantities needed for life. Today NASA admit the Sunlight hitting Earth has dimmed in recent years. Without this sunlight we will have problems with pollutions as fungus, bacteria and virus can breed. UV rays kill bacteria and cleanse areas. Bacteria, Fungus and Viruses are the biospheres natural cleansers to remove filth from the planet. If filth cannot be cleansed then pollutions build up creating more fungus‚Äôs and so forth. Pollution causes trees and plants to die under supposed strange circumstances and with certain diseases like ash die-off. You could quite possible reverse a lot of the ash tree disease by pouring a litre of homoeopathic silicea around the base of the trunk in the soil of each tree suffering. Is homoeopathy the answer? No! The answer is to release the light onto Earth as god intended. Interesting is it not that whilst they block sunlight with SAG they still get you to load your body with titanium particles in soaps etc as well as sun block? I believe the sun block may be in part for when they place the SAG at a lower level which acts like a turkey in tin foil aiding the cooking of the below surface? Could they be trying to turn you into a giant antenna somehow increasing your aura signature so satellites can pick you up easier on their surveillance system? We know the technology is out there now to track individuals from their own unique aura signatures. I cannot prove if a mobius coil wrapped around a quartz crystal then powered by a positive square-wave generator can stop your signature being read but its quite possible. I think you will find the odd hint at why they may be using SAG in that predictive programming movie, ‚ÄòThe Island‚Äò I mentioned earlier. It is all about generating excuses and fear in order to control. The U.S. Air Force wants to control the weather by 2025. A lot of the weather system is manipulated by lasers from space based weapons platforms and satellites connected with the Department of Defense. People often speak of the Space Preservation Act and claim Dennish Kucinich was the master mind. No it was Alfred Webre who masterminded that act! Alfred Webre is a controlled-opposition disinformation agent. Alfred Webre‚Äôs agenda will be to discourage people from viewing those who team up with him. Guilt by mere association shall I say! If you look at the background of Alfred Webre you will note the connections to the mind bending Stanford Research Institute (SRI International or shall we say Tavistock West) and Yale University the home of Chapter 322 (Skull &amp; Bones) with the Russell Trust. Do you want to trust someone with these connections? It is like trusting Paul Craig Roberts after he has been trained at Georgetown ‚ÄòJesuit military fortress‚Äô University.\n\n<strong>Do you believe the world we live in is real or some kind of illusion?</strong>\n\nI believe the world is holographic! The minds and thought-forms help to create what we believe something is real to touch. How can anything be solid when an atom has no mass? It is impossible so what created the solid form like a table? The collective thought-form of the people and possibly some kind of software system by the creator making sure no glitches can occur in case the thought-form has some kind of breakdown and is not constant. We live in a dimension shall we say or a wavelength within a particular frequency range. If we could alter that frequency range we might be able to do or see something different. I believe some of these real Buddhist monks at the highest level can alter this frequency range which may account for some of the strange actions they can perform. There is a lot to all this knowledge of things like the Chakra system. The planets are seen as the Gods due in part to their influence on our chakras. Chakras are not wheels of light in the way they show you. No hole opens up inside the body or spiritual system. The chakra creates a tubing around the body which then forms into one big giant aura type system which some try to film using kirilian photography and videoing. This is the type of wisdom the Jesuits use against us on a daily basis. The Jesuits can use an event based of an emotion to coincide with a particular chakra affecting energy affecting a similar emotion building process. The Jesuits can also attack your chakra system with various chemicals, pollutions and space-based weapons platforms. Disease and thought are manifested in the spirit before the physical.\n\n<strong>Have you always believed in the holographic theory you just explained?</strong>\n\nNot always, when I was part of the herd I did not have a clue about this kind of information and thought. Luckily I came across the knowledge early on in my awakening period! I did start to have some doubts based on some information that seemed quite credible at the time. I now follow the holographic data again after finding out the amazing power of Samuel Hahnemann‚Äôs homoeopathy form of medicine. I have witnessed the power of this healing system and it has been a great help to re-enforce my old views again and cement them in place.\n\n<strong>Thank you for such an intense interview and hopefully we can continue this discussion soon‚Ä¶\n\nConspiracy research interview #2 February 2014 with The Unhived Mind\n\nInterview by Poseidon Media\n\nWas Ignatius Loyola the true founder of The Company of Jesus?</strong>\n\nNo, I have said many times that the forces behind Inigo de Loyola used him as a front. The powerful figures of Francis Borja and Alessandro Farnese and it was these beings who controlled behind Loyola. Why do you think the Jesuits still to this day worship Francis Borja as Lucifer? Without Francis Borja and his wealth the Company of Jesus would not have existed. Never believe anyone who claims that Francis Borja was second to Inigo Loyola! The Jesuit world headquarters known as the Curia Generalizia is even located in an area named after the Borja family known as Borgo Santo Spirito. Look into the history of Francis Borja and his connection to Charles V the Holy Roman Emperor. The Papacy has been controlled by Spain since 1527 onwards since Charles V and his sack of Rome.\n\nIf you look at the front of the mother church of the Jesuits known as the Chiesa del Ges√π you will read Alessandro Farnese‚Äôs name above the pillars. Alessandro Farnese funded the building of the Chiesa del Gesu. Alessandro‚Äôs name is also over the tomb of Inigo de Loyola. The hidden power of the throne is never made visible but instead fronts are put into public view to divert attention away from the hidden power players. For instance who else handled Inigo Loyola? You have to look to Venice and the Venetian Doge Andrea Gritti along with Gasparo Contarini. The others involved in the creating of The Company came from the Catholic nations of Portugal, France and Spain. These included Simao Rodrigues, Peter Faber, Diego Lainez, Francis Xavier (hidden creator of inoculation for poisoning), Nicolas Bobadilla and Alfonso Salmeron.\n\n<strong>When exactly did the Jesuit Order first exist?</strong>\n\nIt is claimed The Company formed in 1541 but this is not true. The Company was formed in Paris, France in 1534 within the crypt at the Church of Saint Peter of Montmartre. It would be wise for researchers to study the history of this Cathedral whilst remembering that Peter Faber was a Frenchman who helped create The Company. In the same year that Jesuit soldier, Jorge Mario Bergoglio become Pope Francis I, he canonized Peter Faber. Peter Faber was the third most powerful player within The Company behind Francis Borja and Inigo Loyola. With what I have told you so far, do you still believe this Jesuit Pope named himself after Francis of Assisi or Francis Borja? The secretive intelligence division of the Jesuits known as The Entity was created in 1541.\n\n<strong>Is the known head of the Jesuits still as powerful as he was when he was known as the Black Pope?</strong>\n\nYes the position of Black Pope still holds the powers granted to it by Francis Borja in 1565. The Black Pope is the second most powerful position in the Catholic Church behind the Pope. So when the current Black Pope, Adolfo Nicolas SJ claims he is not a Black Pope you had better not believe him. As I have said before the word Jesuit means ‚Äòa clever person who deceives the people.‚Äô What this means is that both Inigo Loyola and Diego Laynez never had the power that Francis Borja and the Black Pope‚Äôs have had. Is it not any wonder why the Jesuits worship Francis Borja so much? Francis funded, founded and even created such a powerful position as the Black Pope within the Catholic Church under the powerful Papal Bull system.\n\nWithin the Jesuit Order and the Order of the Malta high level members run these organizations and do all the hard day to day work. I informed you to look at the Prelate position of the Order of Malta over the Grandmaster of the Order. The Curia Generalizia has to do little work and could not exist without the rectors and provincials. I‚Äôd suggest people look more towards Jesuit soldiers like Timothy P. Kesicki, Francois-Xavier Dumortier SJ, John J. DeGioia, Michael J. Garanzini, S.J and Joseph M. McShane, S.J. The Superior General does not choose his successor, this choice goes to the General Congregation made up of numerous Jesuits. During the term of a Superior General a number of Jesuit Congregations are decided and deal with what has to happen within The Company. This type of congregation will be held every three years! I informed you last time that even the Black Pope is spied upon by his own order and has to take a confession. I believe his confessions will be taken by American Jesuit James Grummer SJ.\n\n<strong>Why was there no Black Pope from the end of 1942 until late into 1946?</strong>\n\nThe last Black Pope in 1942 was Wlodimir Led√≥chowski SJ the mastermind of World War II and continuer of Franz Xavier Wernz SJ‚Äôs World War I. The Black Pope in 1946 was Jean-Baptiste Janssens but you will notice another gap after Janssens death. This gap lasted for two-thirds of a year in length until Pedro Aruppe SJ was named as Black Pope in September of 1965.\n\nThis is a sore point for the Jesuits and Old Europe! The death of Wlodimir Led√≥chowski was not a natural death. Led√≥chowski was assassinated on the 13th of December 1942 by assassins commanded by Jesuit soldier, Heinrich Himmler SJ. The leader of the Schutzstaffel got betrayed by his leader Led√≥chowski using Ioseb Jugashvili another Jesuit trained soldier. A large schism occurred within the Jesuits just as we saw in Freemasonry in the 19th Century. The two opposing sides of the Jesuits were made up of the New World Jesuits being from Britain, Canada, United States and Australia. The opposing side was made up of Germany, Italy, France, Switzerland Jesuit soldiers. Heinrich Himmler SJ became the unofficial Black Pope for Old Europe and ruled until his death in 1945. The Jesuits of the Venetian New World became lead by Edmund Walsh SJ connected with Georgetown University which rules over the United States aided by the Senior Executive Service and other branches of the Crown Corporation.\n\nEven though Black Popes continued to be elected by a General Congregation this is did not mean the schism had ended. The provincial Conferences became used as a medium from 1972 to help bring about a truce between the Jesuits which occurred in 1983. Is it any wonder Pedro Arruppe had to prepare the Jesuits for a New World Order? If you look at the World today and all the changes it becomes most obvious that the Venetians control the show behind the scenes using New Venice (Britain) and the United States instead of Europe. Do you think the Venetians could be split like this? Heinrich Himmler‚Äôs legacy is not all lost as the Nazi‚Äôs continue on to this day through the Deutsche Geozentrale (German Geopolitical Centre) and the Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst headed in Dacahu, Bavaria. This Nazi powerhouse has branches known as Odessa, Liebwache, Scharnhorst, Edelweiss, Lustiger Bruder and Sechsestirn. The Nazis have infiltrated into many areas including Britain which should not be a shock when we understand that the Cliveden Set wanted to side with Hitler.\n\n<strong>What is the connection of the Jesuits to finance?</strong>\n\nSince 1572 the Jesuits have been dealing in finance like the order‚Äôs original Knights Templar origins that was taken from them by the Pope in 1312 and his Order of Malta. The Jesuits created and controlled the United East Indies Company which was the first ever mega-corporation. The company only went bankrupt because the Jesuits had been suppressed by the Pope since 1773. In the United States just for starters you can look at Bank of America, JP Morgan and Chase along with BNY Mellon. In Switzerland you can look at the Lombard Odier &amp; Cie. The Jesuits moved a lot of gold bullion out of France and into both Swiss and United States banking houses back in the 18th Century. The Jesuits are the secret controllers of the Vatican Treasury which they have guarded by the Rothschild family, the official Guardians of the Vatican Treasury. You‚Äôll find the Jesuits, Vatican, Queen Elizabeth II and worldwide syndicate families are involved in banking. The financial system is run by the Order of Malta and The Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem. The Order of Malta having taken the power via Papal Bull Ad Providam in 1312 away from the Knights Templar. The Jesuits subordinated the Order of Malta in 1794 aided by Napoleon Bonaparte. The Jesuits and Rothschild alliance used the Bonaparte scam in order to take control of the Bank of England.\n\n<strong>Where do the Jesuits keep their Vatican wealth?</strong>\n\nIn the ancient land of Turicum which you will know as Zurich, a canton of Switzerland. Shall we say yet another example of Jesuits with Protestants.\n\n<strong>Why was Pope Benedict XVI dethroned?</strong>\n\nYes most definitely but do not believe he was a Pope because he was an anti-Pope since he had not managed to remove the Second Vatican Council of the Jesuit renewal of the counter-Reformation. In the alternative media it is claimed he was dethroned over the paedophilia troubles and because he has a homosexual lover. This of course will be the smokescreen put out by Vatican intelligence sources. It has to be something of importance because Ratzinger was well schooled and respected by many and why not? After all Ratzinger did create the Oslo Accords which once again bought back Jerusalem as the Latin Kingdom back in 1993. Joseph Ratzinger was punted and demoted to Pope Emeritus! Since September of 2008 the financial crisis has been a rebellion by various banking dynasties and the Pope (Benedict XVI). This banking system has been in place now for two centuries.\n\nThe elite power structure is not as rock solid as it should be and now is the time for attempts to take over before it is too late. Has Ratzinger failed in his attempt to dethrone the Jesuits? Well we now have a Jesuit as the Pope replacing Benedict XVI. Will the Pope Emeritus still be working with banking houses against the Jesuits from behind a less visible arena or has his attempt been squashed? We still have the banking system for now without a complete meltdown. So I guess we will have to see if a meltdown comes or if a new system or current system improves or morphs into something else for the next eighty or more years. I believe a lot of the cravings for a gold-backed currency is connected with the Ratzinger faction. Is this rebellion connected with the arrest of Monsignor Scarano? Why is Scarano under the impression that the Jesuit banking Nattino family are going to poison him? You have to admit it is likely this is the true cause of Pope Benedict XVI‚Äôs removal and replacement with a Jesuit. The first overt Jesuit Pope in History! Why only now has a Jesuit decided to be throned? All challengers be warned that the Jesuits dominate!\n\n<strong>Was the Bank of England created by the Jesuits?</strong>\n\nVenetian merchants created the Bank of England, helped along by the passing of the Usuary Act of 1571 and the ramblings of John Locke.. The 1st Earl of Halifax, Charles Montagu a Privy Councillor and member of the Order of the Garter helped to create the Bank of England. Charles Montagu was the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the Banks existence. He later rose in power in the 18th Century when he became the First Lord of the Treasury. William Paterson fronted for the founding of the Bank of England. The first meeting of the Bank of England was held at The Worshipful Company of Mercers Hall in the City of London. The Venetians adore usury which means the charging of credit forbidden by God. In fact the Venetians make loan sharks interest look cheap in comparison. Some Venetian usury rates ended up into the triple figure range. The Venetian greed can cripple nations and even themselves. To a Venetian oligarch the God of this world is gold which is named after the creator with an added ‚Äòl‚Äô for good measure. The military-industrial-complex is the Venetian mind set of endless wars, finance and depressions.\n\n<strong>Was Frederick the Great a Freemason and did he have a connection with the Jesuits?</strong>\n\nFrederick the Great was part of the House of Hohenzollern and a powerful figure in Freemasonry. Frederick was a homosexual handled by homosexual lovers connected with the Venetians. Is it any wonder he gave shelter to the Jesuits? Is it any wonder the Jesuits showed a more open alliance with New Venice (Britain)? Where would the Jesuit reductions wealth go if it could not be put in Catholic banks?\n\n<strong>Did the Jesuits create the Illuminati?</strong>\n\nNo the Jesuits did not even in exist when the original Gnostic Illuminati was created by Pythagoras of Samos. There have been numerous forms of the Illuminati with the Jesuit Order itself being one of them. The Los Alumbrados was the name of Loyola‚Äôs prior organization. Los Alumbrados in Spanish means the Illuminati.. The Venetian-Jesuits created the Bavarian Order of the Illuminati. The Venetians used another front to claim the founding of this Order called Adam Weishaupt a supposed former-Jesuit but in truth simply a sheep-dipped Jesuit solder continuing the cause. The founder of the Illuminati for the Venetians was an occultist and member of the Order of Malta known as Giuseppe Balsamo. The same man who screwed over France.\n\n<strong>What is the power structure of the Illuminati?</strong>\n\nThe Illuminati has it‚Äôs own Druidic internal power structure made up of various councils all subservient to the Jesuits including the Grand Druid Council. The Illuminati is made up of various powerful bloodlines such as the Pallavicini and Agnelli. In truth these are more powerful than the Pope as they are closer to the action the same as the Provincials of the Jesuits are the real power players of The Company. Lets face it would the Pope on his own defeat the military might of the United States? So whoever funds the military-industrial-Complex has some serious power and basically it is all the corporations like NASA, General Electric and so forth including the covert drugs trades through the Exchange Stabilization Fund subordinate to Georgetown University and the Knights of Malta. Below the Illuminati families you have the United Nations. The Black Pope sits under his Provincial powers and above the Illuminati power and Papal power. Quite how the Jesuits manage to be so dominate is a mystery but it is a fact for now. A power exists above the Jesuit Order and that will have some form of Genoa/Venetian roots going back into Phoenicia. The Jesuits were on good terms with the continuum of the Hashashins. Loyola meet with the famous Hashashins of the Middle East. This system is a lot more complex than people would let you believe and it is not all clear cut or at least not just yet.\n\n<strong>Who controls the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry?</strong>\n\nThis is commanded by the Jesuits and Venetians through the Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem which answers to the Order of Malta through the Alliance of the Orders of St John of Jerusalem. This Rite is connected to the Norman continuum powers such as the Clan Bruce of Scotland. It is from the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry we have the New Age Movement and Zionism. The Rite‚Äôs headquarters is in Dallas, Texas not the front known as the House of Temple in Washington D.C.\n\n<strong>Who was behind the Reformation?</strong>\n\nVenetians commanded Henry VIII using Francesco Zorzi under orders of Gasparo Contarini who mastered the whole farce of the Reformation and the counter-Reformation. The end goal was to hinder Europe and put a stop to any attacks against Venice. Instead Europe and Christianity would be in a battle wasting time and energy of those suckered into the illusion. Yes people were killed during the Reformation but these were the herd who fell for the illusions. The hidden leaders of the illusion sat back and worked it all to their own gains. To them it did not matter who was in the Giovani or the Vecchi, both sides were puppets to the puppeteer Venetians. Francesco Zorzi was the hidden creator of Rosicrucian order not Christian Rosenkreuz.\n\n<strong>Is the Roman Catholic Church still Catholic?</strong>\n\nNo the false-Church has not been Catholic since 1962 when Pope John XXIII bought about the start of the Second Vatican Council. Since this time all supposed Popes have been anti-Popes. So when you hear the sarcastic term ‚Äúis the Pope a Catholic?‚Äù You can now explain why the Pope is no longer a Catholic. If you want to understand this subject more then I suggest you study the Vatican Second Council along with the work of traditional Catholics who have separated from the Vatican. The Second Vatican Council is the Jesuit renewal of the Council of Trent and the counter-Reformation. The Jesuits have destroyed the Catholic Church as it was once known. Many of the old hierarchy of the Vatican knew from day one that the Jesuits were mavericks and dangerous to the Church. Those who knew what the Jesuit agenda was all about made sure they opposed the Jesuits at all costs. I think their warnings were well vindicated don‚Äôt you? Why were the Jesuits formed? The Jesuits were formed as a military order to counter the Reformation created by the Venetians. The Venetians controlled both sides of the coin until they could manipulate everything over the centuries to the results we see today. It is said that the Order of Malta are the greatest merchants on Earth. This is not true because the Venetians and Genoa are the greatest merchants on Earth. The Venetians had the best intelligence network centuries before they bought forth the Jesuits. Look at the system we live in today. Can you deny it is not a Venetian masterpiece?\n\n<strong>Is there a female version of the Jesuits?</strong>\n\nYes although it is not a division of the Jesuit Order there is a powerful feminine order known as the Order of the Most Holy Savior. The head of this order is a close aid of the Pope called Madre Tekla Famiglietti known as the Abbess General. This Order‚Äôs headquarters is based in the Piazza del Gesu in Rome where the Mother Church of the Jesuit Order is located. In the same location where you have the Bank Finnat run by the powerful Nattino family who have a connection with the London Stock Exchange and the Pallavicini family of Genoa.\n\n<strong>When did the modern Holy Roman Empire start and where is its capital based?</strong>\n\nThe Roman Empire never truly ceased, it just fragmented somewhat as I have told you before in the previous interview. I mentioned the Congress of Vienna and the Treaty of Verona. This Roman Empire of today started to form from 1850 onwards and it was aided by the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs known as the 3rd Viscount Palmerston, Henry John Temple who was also a Privy Councillor and a member of the Order of the Bath and the Order of the Garter. Temple was aided by the head of the Illuminati known as Giuseppe Mazzini from Genoa along with David Urquhart, Louis Bonaparte, Privy councillor James Stansfelt, Anthony Cooper the Earl of Shaftesbury, John Stuart Mill, William Henry Ashurst of the Inns of Court and John Bowring. People will be aware of the connection of Albert Pike and Mazzini. Albert Pike was handled by Jesuit soldier, Pierre-Jean de Smet SJ. You could say this was the time when Freemasonry started to take over bit by bit. The capital of this Roman Empire today is the powerful City of London which is the ancient Londinium of the Romans. All based within Britain which is New Venice, favoured by the Venetians for being an island similar to their old city of Venice. The Venetians believe they are the chosen people. All of the Livery companies are Masonic lodges with a Worshipful Master. The Superior General and hundreds of other Vatican officials are Freemasons.\n\n<strong>Why is the information on the Jesuits getting out after all these years?</strong>\n\nLike I said before it is part of a power struggle within the Catholic Church. Cardinals and Orders within the Church structure dislike the Jesuits having a noose around their necks. The Jesuits rule with an iron rod and control everything in the Church. If you have funds then the Jesuits take them. If you have land then the Jesuits will take them, if you are lucky they might let you keep infertile lands. Sometimes being too strict on your slaves is not in your best interest as they will start to rebel at some point. This was the difference between Catholic and Protestant slave masters. The Catholics were evil to their slaves whilst the Protestants were far more considerate to theirs. Who would you hate the most and want to rebel against out the two? I should remind you that the Venetians are the biggest slave traders and built their wealth based on slavery. So we have insiders within the Catholic Church and orders like Opus Dei drip feeding information out in order to cause complications to the Jesuit Order as part of this attempt to reverse the Jesuit stranglehold.\n\n<strong>Why are Jews put in positions of power at banking houses?</strong>\n\nIrish Roman Catholics sit in banking house positions of power at well! Whilst you are to be fooled that all races on Earth are equal and the same, the establishment know different. Each race is unique and have there own positive qualities over another. With the black race they have the superior human body and this is why they are excellent at sports. Have you noticed how you do not see any black racing drivers? Lewis Hamilton is a mulatto not a full black race so he cannot be included. Blacks are susceptible to detached retinas. The Turkish-Edomites take up positions of power simply because they have a mind capable of excelling in accounts and bookkeeping. If you wanted to run a perfect system would you put a black in charge of accounts or a Turkish-Edomite? I think we have seen what happens when the wrong races are put in positions they cannot fulfil, the cities of the United States are full of the results Like bankrupt Detroit.\n\n<strong>How powerful are the B‚Äônai B‚ÄôRith?</strong>\n\nThe B‚ÄôNai B‚Äôrith was created to aid the creation of the modern Holy Roman Empire by Privy Councillor, Henry Temple. Henry Temple was the Grandmaster of The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry and to this day this Rite controls the B‚ÄôNai B‚Äôrith organization. You will notice how Albert Pike controlled the second version of the Ku Klux Klan. The Ku Klux Klan is nothing more than the Scottish Rite‚Äôs one of many systems in order for the Venetian-Jesuit Britain to master the United States under its Holy Roman Empire started by Henry Temple.\n\n<strong>Who created Zionism?</strong>\n\nThe Venetian-Jesuits created Zionism using Sir Francis Bacon, Robert Cecil and Anthony Ashley Cooper. They pushed Zionism from within the Jesuit controlled Baltimore in Maryland. I would suggest a study on the evil Jesuit intelligence network known as The Leopold foundation. The Jesuit assassination plot against Abraham Lincoln has origins in Baltimore. This would then aid with creating an anti-Catholic hatred in the region when it was realized that the supposed Church murdered Lincoln. This resulted in a dropping of diplomatic ties with the Vatican until 1984 under Ronald Reagan. Reagan was a Honorary Knight of Malta and pawn of the Jesuits and whom they had groomed to become President from as early as 1940 when he played George Gipp in the film ‚ÄòKnute Rockne, All American.‚Äô You will find a big connection of B‚ÄôNai B‚ÄôRith to this Jesuit intelligence network down in Baltimore.\n\n<strong>Thank you for another great interview and hopefully we can continue this regularly‚Ä¶\n\nBREXIT RESULT INTERVIEW WITH THE UNHIVED MIND\n\nJune 26 2016\n\nInterview by Poseidon Media\n\nBritain has just voted to leave the E.U, what are your initial thoughts on this historical event?</strong>\n\nAbsolutely fantastic! The leave vote is a great stepping stone towards further erosion of the Zeusian power and conspiracy. Even though we‚Äôve defeated the European Project we still have a very long way to go before we can announce that Britain is anywhere near a truly sovereign nation. Britons and the People around the world are greatly mistaken if they believe that Britain (Blessed Isles of Albion) is a sovereign nation because of the ‚ÄòIndependence Day‚Äô illusion of June the 23rd 2016! The only way to gain true sovereignty is to remove the Talmudic Templar banking debt slavery and so far we‚Äôre no where near this stage. To initiate the mass public into the next phase to real sovereignty you‚Äôll need the Templar banking to punish Britons using economic and interdependence thumbscrew methods which could trigger the needed wake up call forcing Britons to look for the old and simple solutions. Until the Talmudic Templars make such moves then I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôve got no chance of seeing true sovereignty as the people hardly understand the meaning and idea of democracy let alone the deeper problems of this wretched system. Thanks to Bertrand Russell the people across most of the world have now become degenerate, dumbed down and so far removed from their survival instincts that the concept of having to look after yourself is unimaginable. If the Jewish Templar banking completely pulled out then the populaces of the world would crumble and this would be a good way for the Talmudic ones to remove their target enemies without the need for war, homosexuality or chemical/biological warfare. The Jews own virtually everything and they sell their products cheaper than anyone else in order to put the competition out of business. Imagine you‚Äôve got a small business selling televisions and you‚Äôve paid ¬£400 for your sets and need to sell at ¬£500 or more to break even let alone make a profit. What are you going to do against PC World selling the same television for ¬£300? You can‚Äôt do anything other than either keep your televisions to yourself or sell them at a loss and this is exactly how the Jews work and especially against us all who they term the goyim. You might like to look up the work of Ayn Rand and her Atlas Shrugged book whilst thinking about who owns every large corporation and what they could potentially achieve.\n\n<strong>Who should take the credit for both the British Referendum and the final outcome?</strong>\n\nBoth the referendum and its outcome really stem from the work of the various alternative media outlets including my own website. We wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near where we are right now if it wasn‚Äôt for all the hard work by the truth movement in exposing many of the darknesses by bringing them into the light. There‚Äôs one being in particular who really deserves to be praised and that‚Äôs Nigel Farage the leader of the UK Independence Party. Nigel Farage is the politician that truly kick-started the referendum call and he should take all the credit for Britain‚Äôs ‚ÄòDay of Independence‚Äô which will be celebrated annually on June the 23rd as a national bank holiday.\n\n<strong>Didn‚Äôt David Cameron and Boris Johnson play the main role in the referendum and its outcome?</strong>\n\nPlease don‚Äôt fall for the Jewish deceptions! Both David Cameron and Boris Johnson are from the same political party being the Conservative Party tied to the Conservative Friends of Israel. Jewish Cameron, Johnson and psychopath cocaine snorting George Osborne all come from the two-hundred year old Bullingdon Club of the University of Oxford. The Bullingdon Club is a British basket-case similar to that of the Chapter 322 Skull and Bones hosted at the Yale University. Since the assassination attempts against Farage ended in failure, the Jews used Cameron to take all the limelight away from Nigel after UKIP were doing so well and his fame starting spreading across the world. The UKIP threat to the main political establishment in Britain was so powerful that the Jews had to squash it with their typical unoriginal methods. How many times do we see Jews taking over debates and arguments? The Jews always do this and then leave out the true original arguing parties (the threat to the Jew) and all in order to control the flow of the original argument and maintain a more positive outcome in favor of the Jew. Now lately the role of Boris Johnson has been to set him up for the role of the British Prime Minister after a disappointing David Cameron. In the case of Britons voting to leave the European Union, the Jews made sure their front-man Boris Johnson gained all the publicity and of course this was yet again the method to keep Nigel Farage and UKIP out of the limelight and thus continue the Empire‚Äôs political farce. New Venice played a most obvious Hegelian dialectic move with the choosing and actions of both David Cameron (Crooked Nose Clan) and Boris Johnson.\n\n<strong>You spoke earlier of real sovereignty still needing to be found, can you elaborate on what you mean by that comment?</strong>\n\nSure! It‚Äôs very simply! Briton‚Äôs don‚Äôt have any sovereignty right now, when Article 50 is enacted or even two years from now when Britain is proclaimed as fully removed from the European Union. Why? British sovereignty was eroded from 1873 onwards but the final nails in the coffin hit the region and most of the world by 1933 onwards. This was the time when the Talmudic Templar banking merchant powers took full control of the nation and subordinated it to debt slavery no different to what they did with Germany under the Treaty of Versailles. The only way to regain sovereignty is to remove these merchant powers who‚Äôs roots go back into Venice and out into ancient Samaria, in other words the Jews. Britain needs a national credit system or a currency system that has backing and which is issued by the UK Treasury outside of a central ‚Äòwar‚Äô bank such as the Venetian created Bank of England. All current central ‚Äòwar‚Äô banks serve the Rothschild family (guardian of the Vatican treasury) and the New Venice Empire. A current central bank could easily be converted to a bank which works for the nation and its people but in the current form these banks are instead designed to work against the nation and its people in order to become their slave-master through the use of debt and debt instruments which end up replacing money and true value with a complete farce. You might like to watch the movie called ‚ÄòThe International‚Äô directed by Tom Tykwer as it‚Äôll give you a clearer idea of what these banks are truly about and how they work.\n\n<strong>Is there a way in order to keep sovereignty once it has been regained?</strong>\n\nYes but its not an easy task because in order to do so you‚Äôll have to make sure the true roots of the problems of this world are removed. How? This means the removal of a body of people of psychosis known as the Jews and then the implementation of a Promethean new model of development and co-operation should be put in place as a win-win situation for each and every one of the nation states and citizenry. Just the idea alone of the nation state rattles these Jews as they‚Äôve battled against it since Nicolaus Cusanus‚Äôs Renaissance which gave a mighty Promethean blow to evils of Venice. It must be said that although Venice took a major hit from the Renaissance, some of the actions of this event also aided the Jews due to the implementation of Kabbalah practices into Europe. We must always expect the Jews and now New Venice to always have a ‚Äòplan B‚Äô or to gain a positive from a negative outcome. These cretins are the masters of manipulation and have been for thousands of years. The problem you‚Äôve got is that these people of psychosis aka the Synagogue of Satan never give in or give up and they‚Äôll always seek revenge after rare defeats. We‚Äôve also witnessed this mindset within the Jesuit Order! Why? The Jesuits were created by the Venetian Jewish merchant powers with the founder of the Jesuits, Ignatius Loyola being handled by a Venetian power known as Gasparo Contarini. Many of the important high-ranking Jesuit soldiers (worshipers of Kronos) were of Jewish decent so is it any wonder they use the Saturnalian symbolism of the reaper‚Äôs sickle within their logo? The Jesuits were designed as a method of infiltration of the Christian Church in order to destroy the European Goyim after the defeat by the Renaissance. The only way to secure victory is to completely remove the Synagogue of Satan by any means necessary or have them placed in their own land with strict no-immigration or communication with the outside world. I‚Äôm sorry but as history has always proven, these tribal small hats are just too damn dangerous and untrustworthy to ever trust within our societies. There are no true Jews roaming this planet today as they‚Äôre all a fraud including these so-called orthodox Jews who also get their inspiration from the Babylonian Talmud of the Pharisee deception. What we have here is the Babylonian Brotherhood who‚Äôre nothing more than a bunch of frauds twisting or replacing original religious texts and claiming to be the original peoples in order to gain some sort of godly power over the slave populace. These people are of psychosis and claim to be gods after putting the Kabbalah teachings into practice. These cretins are far from what they claim and this even includes the Sephardi immigrants of land of Judea who ended up killing off the their Tribe of Judah hosts.\n\n<strong>What should happen to all those British officials who were in favor of the EU?</strong>\n\nI believe each and everyone of those officials should be tried in English Common Law courtrooms working under the British Constitution. Each of these traitorous officials should be looking at a minimum of a life-sentence in jail whilst the likes of the New Doge (Queen Elizabeth II) and her Prime Ministers should be looking at the death penalty. Briton must not use the legalese changes to the treason laws which occurred in the 1990s as these were tainted by both the House of Windsor and Tony Blair making sure the death penalty would be avoided.\n\n<strong>What do you think of the London Mayor, Sadiq Khan calling for London to be accepted in the EU?</strong>\n\nSadiq Khan is an open traitor to Britain and should be removed from office and replaced with George Galloway utilizing Max Keiser as his financial adviser. Sadiq Khan should be immediately placed within a jail cell awaiting the death penalty for his outright treason upon Britain. If Khan likes Europe that much then he can go and become a Greek mayor and enjoy what the Jewish George Soros and the European project (under orders from the New Doge of New Venice via the German Chancellor) has done to poor Greece by turning it from the first world and now into an almost third world nation in status that‚Äôs now riddled with poverty, drug addiction and disease. Greece is the poster child for the Zero Growth Post-Industrial Plan of the Club of Rome. If these cretins and the European Union aren‚Äôt stopped then expect all other nations to follow suit and end up in the same nightmare that Greece is going through. Britain doesn‚Äôt want or need traitors like Sadiq Khan the sabbos goy and that‚Äôs why I call on the true laws of Britain to be used to their fullest in order to permanently remove these types of problematic beings. Britain needs a leadership that knows how Britain should really function as a truly sovereign state and thus we should be looking towards prominent members of the British Constitutional Group such as Roger Hayes and Brian Gerrish. It‚Äôs time to remove infiltration organizations such as Common Purpose from Britain.\n\n<strong>What are your thoughts on the Scottish?</strong>\n\nBarbarians like of old stuck in a backward mentality riddled with a mindset of doublethink, doublespeak and utter stupidity. Ask yourself how this Nicola Sturgeon can be a leader of any party let alone the Scottish Nationalist Party? How can Sturgeon say that Scotland‚Äôs wishes not counting is an undemocratic act and then at the same time she wishes to be part of a totally undemocratic and communist dictatorship super-state which is even nicknamed the EUSSR after the Soviet Union Frankenstein‚Äôs monster by the Jewish Red Revolution? Why would anyone want to be ruled from Brussels rather than Westminster as the United Kingdom agreed to by members of your own nations? The Scottish know who‚Äôs in charge of Westminster and they also know that those in power can be removed at any time or by the end of a full political term of office. The UK Government can be removed by the people and if need be even the Queen regardless of any veils claiming the opposite! Can the Scottish even tell you the name of a single president of the European Union‚Äôs numerous presidents? No! Can the Scottish tell you who elected those EU bureaucrats? No! Could the Scottish remove these EU overlords? The answer like every other time is a big fat no! All this nonsense talk coming out of Scotland is based on an old hatred of the English and economics rather than being about a sovereign Scotland. Do the Scottish Nationalist Party think the EU will let them have manufacturing or something similar back in Scotland? Scotland‚Äôs only hope was its oil supply and with the lack of demand and glut in the oil energy sector that won‚Äôt be improving anytime shortly and Scotland had better watch its back. Scotland will also have no voice of reasoning within the EU if it‚Äôs stupid enough to rejoin as it has nothing to leverage power with. If Scotland had become independent at their last referendum then soon enough they would have been broke just like Venezuela through relying on oil. The Scottish don‚Äôt truly want to be independent as deep down they always want to rely on someone else whether that has been the British or Europe. Alex Salmond and now Nicola Sturgeon couldn‚Äôt wait to sign Scotland back into Europe as its illusionary safety net. It‚Äôs okay wanting to be with the EU for finance if you‚Äôre insane and cannot accept the inevitable. The inevitable is that the EU will be destroyed as it‚Äôs already collapsed and it‚Äôs irreversibly bankrupt as is the entire Trans-Atlantic monetary system. People who‚Äôre belly aching about capital losses, stocks and other financial problems have their heads up their backsides whilst standing on a train track as the train is bulleting towards them. What they want, and claim to miss actually doesn‚Äôt even exist and has zero value except to the Jews who utilize it in order to enslave and dictate to the goyim slave masses.\n\n<strong>Did you watch the live-coverage of the event as it unfolded and if so how did you do achieve this?</strong>\n\nI watched most of the coverage via Russia Today aka RT which did an excellent job with the results coverage as well as some good programming on the subject utilizing guests such as George Galloway. I did take a peak at the BBC coverage but only briefly and then just to make sure I could watch on time both the Dawn Raid (Cameron) and Bank of England (Mark Carney) speeches. Whilst being unfortunate in having to watch the Bias Broadcasting Corporation you could see how the network was verbally attacking ‚Äòleave‚Äô voters by making out they‚Äôre tied to racism and a lack of education. These BBC tricks are exactly the same techniques that are currently being used in the New Venice plantation known as the United States to target Donald Trump in the hope of throning a fifth degree Witch, felon, murderer and war criminal known as Zionist Hillary Clinton who has Jewish roots and always puts Israel first. Even now after the British referendum you‚Äôll notice the mainstream media especially the BBC continuing to make out leave supporters are backward and don‚Äôt deserve the vote. In fact the BBC and other British Ziopress outlets are now trying to plant a seed that another referendum should take place. As usual New Venice is manipulating the two sides. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the Jews start a color revolution in Britain by manipulating the defeated side and I have no doubt the BBC will be there with guns blazing against the patriots of Britain. If you really need to use television to get your news then my advice would be to stick with RT or PressTV or at a push Al-Jazzera but let me remind you that the latter programming is controlled by MI6, MOSSAD and the CIA.\n\n<strong>Will Europe attempt any dirty tricks in an attempt to keep control of the bloc?</strong>\n\nThe European Union has always been mastered by New Venice! What the people are led to believe in is a big deception especially since David Cameron‚Äôs useless EU reforms which further aids the veil of who‚Äôs the real boss. New Venice will attempt to pull out all the stops in order to keep the European project going as long as it can or they‚Äôll be ready for it to be morphed into a newer more democratic project. One of the ways they‚Äôll most likely do this will be by utilizing the Ziopress and pushing further anti-Russia propaganda using a new and latest false-threat supposed coming out of Russia. The people once again will end up being fooled into accepting further demonization of Promethean Vladimir Putin the Russian President and greatest man walking the Earth at this moment in time. How will they achieve this? Simply by provoking or staging an outright false event that gets trumped up in the mainstream media aka Ziopress. The effect of these anti-Russia actions will be the EU calling for more NATO and U.S. actions whilst the populace victims will accept and rally around the false cry instead of rejecting the Western terrorism of Europeans by the Trans-Atlantic Jewish powers. As New Venice is now out of the EU it‚Äôll end up being able to sit upon the fence and utilize different parts of its spiders web. If New Venice‚Äôs Zeusian system completely fails then it can easily jump on-board the Promethean tail-feathers until the next time it desires to plot and dominate the world by infiltrating and taking over the new system. I have to keep highlighting the fact that New Venice never looses out and in fact they always end up making some form of a positive out of a negative. New Venice recently made a big connection to China and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank whilst giving the veil they were going against the US President‚Äôs wishes (keeping the American Empire illusion afloat). New Venice‚Äôs deals with China are just as a life boat so if their Trans-Atlantic Templar nightmare sinks then they can still stay afloat on the Chinese ocean so to speak and all whilst other New Venice plantations crumble. New Venice always edges it bets! So please keep an eye out for a new event based on a downed passenger airliner or some other false flag that‚Äôs coming real soon. My bets for this event would be that it‚Äôll be a provoked attack in the skies of a fighter jet or jets or to really pull on the heart strings a staged attack under Russian colors of a passenger airliner to be blamed on Russia jets (similar to Operation Northwoods). This scenario is the only way to rally Europeans under the US and its NATO terrorism. The event will be mastered and executed with NATO false-flag terrorism techniques (ordo-ab-chao) as well as further events utilizing John McCain‚Äôs latest fear-porn group known as ISIS (Israeli Secret Intelligence Service). We might see something happen over in Eastern Europe or watch for Barry Soetoro (Obama) or fifth degree witch, Hillary Clinton kick something off over in Georgia especially if Mikheil Saakashvili is back in town after his troublemaker actions over in Odessa, Ukraine.\n\n<strong>People are blaming the Leave campaign for the economic troubles in the markets is this fair?</strong>\n\nNo this assumption isn‚Äôt fair and it‚Äôs a preprogrammed trigger placed in their minds by the likes of the psychopathic George Osborne and fear-porn crowd who were against any chance of a BREXIT. The BREXIT never triggered an economic downturn! It was the economic collapse and the irreversible bankruptcy of the entire Trans-Atlantic system which caused the BREXIT and any other economic problems that happen all stem from the start of the collapse going back to 2000-2001 just prior to 9/11 then of course the financial crisis of 2008 and the continual economic depression since 2009. The core of all the problems is the fact that the Trans-Atlantic monetary system is irreversibly bankrupt and has already collapsed. People need to stop denying the fact and stop utilizing a system that has no value and is already dead and broken. It‚Äôs no good coming out of the EU and keeping the current economic system as it‚Äôs dead and buried. Even if the BREXIT was to be blamed for a future economic downturn (inevitable collapse which I‚Äôve always predicted would fully blow out between May-Oct of the year 2017) a hit is always worth it in order to start over again as we‚Äôve seen in Iceland. Lets not forget how the New Doge set her guard dog Inter-Alpha Group of Banks after those in Iceland with the same economic fear-porn threats of doom and gloom and now look how well that nation is performing since ignoring the propaganda spew from New Venice Jews. If you have ¬£1000 of savings isn‚Äôt it worth losing ¬£100 in currency (toilet paper worthless IOUS) value in order to get rid of various slave-masters or would you rather hold onto your ¬£1000 for a few months (before the final collapse) but still be governed by the slave-master? You have all these people believing the EU is a financial God whilst at the same time ignoring the facts that it‚Äôs the worst basket-case economy of all in the Trans-Atlantic arena. The EU has nothing and it‚Äôll give you nothing! The EU is nothing more than dead carcass of zero worth playing in a game that has already been unplayable and should be thrown away.\n\n<strong>What is the future for Britain or what should the future be?</strong>\n\nWell the BREXIT was the first stepping stone towards freedom, prosperity and a progression in mankind but it‚Äôs a long journey with many struggles to achieve the positive end goal. Britain needs to have a true government that is truly independent away from the Jewish Talmudic Templar banking influence. Britain then needs to start nationalized credit with a look towards joining the BRICS and maybe replacing Brazil as the ‚ÄòB‚Äô right at the front of the title next to Russia. As it stands right now New Venice and Prince Philip are doing everything in their power to destroy both Brazil and South Africa by use of hybrid war. If Britain doesn‚Äôt do as I‚Äôve suggested then it‚Äôs destined to fail. If one moves away from the Zeusian New World Order and over into the Promethean New World Economic Order then there‚Äôs absolutely no need to worry about a Jewish pull out or lack of investment. If one stays in the Zeusian system and upsets the Jews then if they desert the land you‚Äôll end up suffering more because they control all the wealth and corporations that make up the slave economy of most nations of the world. Once the New World Economic Order is in place then we have a viable alternative this time built on co-operation and a win-win for all utilizing development and the increasing of the energy flux density. Why do you think the Jews bought about the 2008 collapse? It was to help consolidate their banking and corporate power by bankrupting small businesses and even some larger companies then the Jews bought them all up for pennies in the pound using their private equity firms like Warburg Pincus. Who owns Warburg Pincus? The Venetian Del Banco family known to most as the Jewish Warburg family who also part own along with the Rothschild family the private bank known as the Federal Reserve over in the United States. Please don‚Äôt be fooled that The Fed has been sold on to other players because it hasn‚Äôt. The Federal Reserve was set up in a way where the original Jewish players could never be bought out or removed and thus they still to this very day control this private bank. The Warburg family have also taken control of much of the Internet whilst ruining the service as they‚Äôve taken it over. You‚Äôll find it very hard to find a U.S. Internet service provider who‚Äôs not owned by the Warburg family utilizing the Endurance International Group. The control over the Internet allows for easy access to shutting down anti-Zionist information and the truth on the Jewish serpent people of psychosis aka the Synagogue of Satan. The Warburg family also like to pimp out DWP workfare slavery in their stores such as Poundland owned by Warburg Pincus all of which were bought for pennies on the pound.\n\n<strong>Why has the alternative media used the term New World Order so much?</strong>\n\nMuch of the alternative media is controlled by the New Venice Jewish Empire utilizing various agencies such as Mossad, CIA and MI6. The idea behind the alternative media is for the Jew to combat gentile dissent and thus threats to the plans of the Jews and their sabbos goy aka the traitors to humankind. In truth they‚Äôve had to frighten people about the New World Order because there is a New World Order as proven time and time again. What has also been occurring because of this is that people are now fixed in the mind that the New World Order is a bad thing and rightfully so. The problem is that there is a New World Economic Order and this isn‚Äôt a bad thing and now because of past programming and trigger/buzz words it allows these same agencies to have their victims also demonize the good order and Promethean side of the elite. This is why you‚Äôll regularly see people demonize Putin as one of the elite working together and calling for a New World Order. What you‚Äôre seeing is classic diversion, spin and propaganda whilst removing you from any chance of having a deeper understanding of the divide. Many of the big names in the conspiracy arena will make sure they drum it into the victims earlier on and regularly that all these elite are one with no arguments etc. Sorry but there are a lot of divisions within the elite even those who‚Äôre on the same side. Please ask yourself why you have people like McKinley, Lincoln and Kennedy assassinated along with Franklin Roosevelt being neutralized. Lets not forget how George H.W Scherff (Bushfraud) had an associate attempt to assassinate Ronald Reagan. If all was one then rest assured you wouldn‚Äôt see these kinds of people and Indira Gandhi being murdered whilst others have been made political prisoners. The main battle has always been between two sets of the Olympians, the Zeusian Aristotelian arrested development cretins and the Promethean Plato progression who try to lift mankind. This battle goes back even further to the differences between the Neanderthal vs Cro-Magnon man genetics and even then I believe the ultimate battle is between the Djinn and the two I previously mentioned and right now the Djinn is winning whilst the fools with the white gloves serve up their own demise as well their enemies.\n\n<strong>Will New Venice openly rule the world if the New World Order side are successful</strong>\n\nNo I believe both New Venice and its plantation known as the U.S will both be sacrificed once the world government structure is ready and all nations are totally subordinated. This will not happen until the Middle East is totally under the thumb of New Venice and they‚Äôve achieved their Bernard Lewis Plan of a Greater Israel. The world will be politically, financially and spiritually headed from the Middle East. The spiritual head and main power will be based in the international city of Jerusalem where this power will be within the third King Solomon‚Äôs Temple. This Temple is already patented and being organized by an Illuminist known as Grandmaster Giuliano Di Bernardo. Some political power will be housed in former Iraq whilst financial power will move over to Dubai. The Jews are parasites they find hosts then feed and use them before leaving the carcass to continue elsewhere which in this case will be the Middle East whilst the carcasses will be both Wall St and The City.\n\n<strong>Is the European Union the New Holy Roman Empire?</strong>\n\nThe Jews would love you to think in the old ways and old wishes under old Christian powers because when you do this then you divert attention right from the clear and present danger which is the Jews. There isn‚Äôt a Catholic Church or a Church of England they‚Äôve all been subordinated to the Jew including the Catholic Church starting as far back as 1823-6 and the final nail in its coffin in 1962. The game is to make Europeans and others who awaken move attention away from the Jew and so they bring up old Christian thoughts, desires and conflicts hoping you don‚Äôt see the bigger picture that I help to expose and explain. The enemy isn‚Äôt Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism or most of the other isms. Protestantism has been a great tool and aid to the Jews especially since Oliver Cromwell (who‚Äôs family incidentally formed a scion with the Genoa originated Pallavicini family of wealthy merchants). The enemy is Judaism and its following of the Talmud, Zohar and the effects of the Jewish Kabbalah which has its true origins from the Middle East. The New Holy Roman Empire is a farce, it‚Äôs a cover for the Jewish Empire and it‚Äôs pushed by many of the Zionist Christians including the Seventh Day Adventists who‚Äôs religion is based on Freemasonry and the Jewish Old Testament. Just remember that all religion has been infiltrated by the Jews utilizing the likes of the Jesuits and others in order to take over and aid the ushering in of the Luciferian Doctrine as the new one-world religion made up of the occult revival. This is why you now see church teachings all twisted and spun in order to sucker in the uneducated flocks like lambs to the slaughter. A good example of infiltration is the Charismatic Movement and Pentecostalism the latter of which plays a big role in the false-flag shock events that are happening across the U.S and it‚Äôs all conducted by New Venice and the Church of England along with the FBI Division Five over in Colorado!\n\n<strong>Is Germany the big power player as is claimed and don‚Äôt they control the European Union?</strong>\n\nGermany has no power, it‚Äôs only recently been allowed by New Venice and the U.S to have its own military back for combat duties etc. Both Russia and Germany have been enemies of the Jews since the Czar and Bismarck attempted to accept the American system and Hamiltonian principle. For this competition, the Jews murdered the Russian Czar and his family and bought about the Red Revolution using the Bolsheviks all funded by Jacob Schiff through Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Company and Wall Street the satellite financial arm of the City of London aka the New Venice Empire and Rothschild. With Germany the same Jews started World War I and then subordinated the Nation until Hitler came along and then these same Jews manipulated both sides (the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha connected Ernst Hanfstaengl with Germany and Allen Dulles from the US plantation) to suit their own needs and started another World War which totally subordinated both Germany and Japan! Germany cannot scratch its own backside without permission from New Venice aka Britain. Go back to the last near overt collapse of the Eurozone and the Greek problem (Jun 2015) when the New Doge (Queen Elizabeth II) personally went over to Germany and gave her orders directly and by verbal threat and force to Wolfgang Sch√§uble. As usual the subordinate officials immediately jumped to attention just like George H.W Scherff (Bushfraud) when Margaret Thatcher was dispatched by The City to Aspen, Colorado to order the war drums beating against Iraq in the 1990s. Germany is just a satellite for consumerism and nothing more, people who think Germany has any power are highly mistaken. As I said earlier the final decision on Greece wasn‚Äôt made by Germany as people think but in fact was ordered by New Venice and in truth to further intensify divisions between Germany and Russia. Angela Merkel is a puppet for Obama and both of these serve the New Doge of New Venice (Queen Elizabeth II). If Merkel didn‚Äôt serve New Venice then there wouldn‚Äôt be any economic sanctions against Russia and at the same time Germany would have the new energy pipelines from Russia. Instead Merkel is hindering progression with Russia and thus keeping Germany dependent on New Venice where as it could be independent if it becomes close to Russia and has its energy needs served. Germany is in a unique position as it still has a vast manufacturing base unlike the rest of Europe so it could become truly independent in a much quicker time frame from the rest of the victims of the Jews.\n\n<strong>Do you think immigration is the main reason for BREXIT?</strong>\n\nNo! We have to get away from this Jewish scam designed to label patriotism as something bad in society. As usual the Jews manipulated the mass herd mind into thinking the core of this referendum was over immigration. Why? Well one they could demonize patriots as racists but two the idea was to remove the thought and understanding of democracy. The BREXIT was all about democracy then economics and it was bought about by the hatred of being dictated to by a communist regime who openly admit their system was post-democratic. The economic problems have also added to the anger and helped to highlight how devastating the collapsed Eurozone and European Project really are. You‚Äôll notice it‚Äôs mostly the brainwashed younger generation who‚Äôre belly aching about the leave winning and of course they‚Äôll quote the immigration as they‚Äôre too uneducated to even understand the concept of democracy as they‚Äôve never lived within a true-democracy. To watch and listen to these young treasonous traitors you get the sense their cell phone has been removed and now they just don‚Äôt know what to do or how to live. Bertrand Russell highlighted the kind of society he and his cretins planned and today we now have it in the form of the brainwashed young and youth. It‚Äôs a good job that we achieved a referendum this time around because if the Eurozone dark age continued (unlikely as it‚Äôs bankrupt) then over decades we‚Äôd be stuck with an outright remain vote due to the brainwashed degenerates, you know the ones who think they‚Äôre more enlightened than the truly enlightened ones before them. Bertrand Russell has done so much damage to the world‚Äôs populace by creating such a degenerate society. The degeneracy is so bad now that most of the front leaders and their political parties are most obviously backward and inadequate and thus the reason why clowns like Cameron, Osborne and Johnson can now sit in seats of illusionary power. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this degeneracy has started to hit the higher elite powers as over the years they too usually fall for their own lies and propaganda. One thing is for certain and that‚Äôs the Jews know exactly what is happening, why and they‚Äôll always be in full control of the sabbos goy. It‚Äôs interesting how the Jew uses the immigration buzzwords in their Ziopress hinting at racism but forget that Britain is still willing to accept immigrants but in line with the standards of Australia. Britain would be accepting more commonwealth members such as from India so tell me how this is racism? Britain wants a sensibly controlled immigration policy that only brings people of worth into the nation based on income possibilities and needs. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to bring in people of no worth unless you just want to do it like George Soros in order to help collapse the target nation which is exactly what the Jews are doing. In fact the whole idea of Government is to protect the DNA of the people of a land so ask yourself why any Government would rather import peoples of different DNA unless they wish to destroy the host nations people and culture? The exact plans of the Jew that were highlighted in 1925 by ‚ÄòPractical Idealism‚Äô written by Jewish Venetian Count, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi.\n\n<strong>Do you think Goldman Sachs, HSBC and others will leave Britain and move to Europe?</strong>\n\nI highly doubt it and if they do then they‚Äôll be right back with their tale between their legs when the European Project is abandoned or very shortly outright collapsed. Please understand that the system is irreversibly bankrupt, it‚Äôs dead and it‚Äôs gone and therefore still dabbling with a corpse isn‚Äôt going to make it alive. The economic breakdown is the cause of this problem and the Eurozone is the biggest basket-case of all when it comes to the economy. Take for instance how Deutsche Bank almost fully collapsed and other recent economic problems in the Eurozone and now you can realize it has already folded. Britain moving out of the EU is the best thing it can do to further ring-fence itself away from the inevitable destruction of the Eurozone and all the victims trapped within its citizenry. The only way forward is Eurasia and the BRICS system and until people understand this then they‚Äôll just have to continue suffering in a deepening dark age which suits the Club of Rome zero-growth model and their population reduction demands. There is no wealth in Europe, in truth there‚Äôs hardly any precious metals as it has all been bought up by the likes of China, Russia and India. If you want real wealth you have to look towards Eurasia and that‚Äôs exactly what the Jews were doing as highlighted by the vicious Zbigniew Brzezinski in his ‚ÄòThe Grand Chessboard‚Äô book. When it comes to Eurasia, Zbigniew Brzezinski and friends haven‚Äôt had their plans come to fruition and it‚Äôs all because of their arrogance in thinking they‚Äôre so exceptional that they can openly brag of their agendas and get away with no counter to those agendas. Well bad luck Zbigniew Brzezinski because Vladimir Putin and Xi know your evil agenda and they won‚Äôt allow mankind to go further into the dark age and instead they both want mankind in a time of intense light.\n\n<strong>What‚Äôs the future for Europe?</strong>\n\nThere is no future for the current European Project it‚Äôs dead! The peoples of Europe must start to organize their national economies making sure they gain their own currencies back so therefore Germans must have Deutschemarks ready for the removal and/or collapse of the Euro and European Project. It‚Äôs time for the Nation state to thrive within a New World Economic Order where nations work together in a win-win development model. The New World Order from New Venice based on a borderless unipolar World Government doesn‚Äôt work and isn‚Äôt wanted. Its time for Britain to shut down The City of London and remove all its debt by bankrupting and moving over to a nationalized credit aiding development and prosperity whilst looking to joining the BRICS system. There is no need for Britons to fear Jews moving out and economic collapses etc and it‚Äôs the same for Americans with Wall Street. Both Wall St and The City are irreversibly bankrupt and both can be shut down and removed very easily, calmly and safely without any major problems to the public and finances once you understand how a nation can create its own money and nationalized credit. Stop all the uneducated belly aching about 401Ks and pension pots and understand we can make our own wealth and credit which could make us thrive very quickly. All those who worry about pensions should realize they soon won‚Äôt have a pension pot in the current dark age. Even if all was good most people will end up on a Basic Income as the idea of work is removed from society due to robosourcing and artificial intelligence algorithms. All citizens will have enough of their needs catered for by Basic Income or similar and that‚Äôs somewhat the idea of pensions. The world is changing and we have to understand these changes and the fact that we need not panic because there‚Äôs always a simple solution to almost all the so-called problems. Europe needs to simply restructure itself back into a democracy and republic status and as a simple economic trade bloc as was the original intention of the Common Market. After a restructuring then the new Europe bloc can team up or even morph with the Eurasian Economic Union as well as join the BRICS New Development Bank. I‚Äôve just blown away the panic of economic collapse so why are you worrying? The only time to worry is if you continue to let the Jews keep control of their system over you because then you‚Äôll never enact the solutions but those solutions are available to those who wish them. I have no doubt western nations will become the status of the current developing nations or even third world if people let the Jews dictate their dark age. If you don‚Äôt want to end up like Greece or worse then you must completely remove the Jewish influence once and for all. The Jews are the enemy of all mankind whether you‚Äôre white, black, Arab or oriental.\n\n<strong>Any final words?</strong>\n\nLet me remind people that when I use the term New Venice I‚Äôm referring to Britain since the Venetians took control from the 16th Century. Who are the Venetians? We‚Äôre talking about the merchant powers who‚Äôs true roots stem from Samaria in the Middle East and these are the Satanic so-called Jews. Over the years the world has been mastered by Jews using many fronts and all to divert attention onto others such as Italians/Europeans and a host of other separated peoples with different divisional ideologies and religious beliefs handed to them by the Jews in order to divide and conquer. The enemy of mankind is the Jews and the system they work under which I term the Djinn. Most peoples of the world in ancient times and even in recent history were fully aware of the Synagogue of Satan and expelled these troublemakers so many times including their Jesuit Order. The peoples of the world must learn the truth again and make sure freedom of speech is upheld whilst removing the blinkering political correctness censorship designed by Jews and enforced by their Anti-Defamation League to ultimately shut down knowledge of their Satanic ways. I suggest everyone study historical facts exposing the Jews and their wicked ways so we never repeat what‚Äôs happened back then and again of late. This Synagogue of Satan murder children and claim paedophilia is acceptable in their own unholy books like the Talmud. Do you really want to continue living in a dark age with a degenerate society which in truth worships the dead? Look at the entertainment industry it‚Äôs all based around death and destruction, it‚Äôs demonic and as I said it‚Äôs connected to the dark side of the Djinn. Who controls the entire entertainment industry? The Jews after they sneakily hindered the original film players by using dirty tricks including abusing patents and worse. The entertainment industry is riddled with paedophilia as highlighted by Elijah Wood, Corey Feldman and others. Do you really want to stay in this evil dead or do you want to bring forth a good alive? One of the first steps to doing so will be to remove that vile Cestui Que Vie Act of 1666 remembering the first Cestui Que Vie Act goes back to 1540 and once again was created by a Venetian from hell. Remove this act and release all the fake dead souls and get rid of that Bar Association reaper once and for all. Is it any wonder Hollywood loves Zombie movies when it openly takes the mickey out of its slave populaces who‚Äôve they titled as dead souls lost at sea not to mention its society being based around the dead. What do we have here? The Brotherhood of Death aka the Saturnalian Brotherhood also known as the Brotherhood of the Dragon it‚Äôs all the same thing and ultimately evil. The Chapter 322 society known to most as Skull and Bones is again a branch of this Brotherhood of Death as is the Jesuit Order. It‚Äôs time for the worship of Zeus to be punted out the way by Promethean teachings and light.\n\n<strong>Thank you once again for being most informative as ever.\n\nLEADSOM &amp; CLINTON WILL BRING WORLD WAR 3\n\n8 July 2016\n\nPoseidon Media interviews THE UNHIVED MIND\n\nWho do you think the powers-at-be want as their Prime Minister of Great Britain and President of the U.S.?</strong>\n\nWell first of all, right now and most obviously the Jews (spiritual elite) and their sabbos goy want two feminines to lead the way giving an illusion of change. In the United States they‚Äôve chosen to throne a pro-Israel Jewess who‚Äôs a fifth-degree witch, war criminal, felon, psychopath, traitor, drug trafficker, blackmailer and murderer by proxy going under the name of Hillary Clinton. The Clinton‚Äôs both serve under former Nazi SS agent, George H.W Scherff along with his wife Barbara Scherff and their backward son Jeb Scherff (known to most as the Bushfrauds aka the Kennebunk Hillbillies). All of these characters are mastered by the minds and funds of the Jews such as Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban. Why is Hillary so special? Well Hillary has served her fellow Jews well in the past and she‚Äôs also a warmonger who‚Äôll do the bidding of AIPAC and the Neoconservatives thus aiding Israel. Hillary also has a lot of sway because she has the goods on many people and thus she can easily blackmail individuals. Hillary believes her own delusions of grandeur where she thinks she can match up or even better Vladimir Putin the President of the Russian Federation. It‚Äôs things like these I‚Äôve just mentioned which will always be the clues as to who‚Äôre the chosen ones as puppets for the Jew power.\n\nWho else have we seen today who has already started mouthing off against Vladimir Putin whilst spewing the same old backward propaganda? Why it‚Äôs this Andrea Leadsom who‚Äôs now become one of two women who will become the next Prime Minister of Great Britain. If these candidates were of any worth and/or part of the Promethean side then they would be attempting to build bridges with the Russia President rather than break them down even further based on lies, deceit and jealousy of old. How dare Andrea Leadsom try to make out that Vladimir Putin goes against International Law when in fact he‚Äôs one of the only few true leaders in the world that follows International Law to the fullest as proven numerous times. Once you hear propaganda spew like this from the likes of Leadsom, Clinton and others then you‚Äôll know which side of the fence they‚Äôre working for and it‚Äôs most definitely the Zeusian Aristotelian network. Who controls U.S. politics? AIPAC! Who controls U.K. politics? Lets just call them Friends of Israel! Both nations (now corporations) are dominated by the Jewish spiritual elite through the Jewish lobbies in their region. Right now the choice of words from Leadsom just proves what I said in my last BREXIT interview where I warned you to listen for any anti-Russian stance as a guide to seeing if Britain was truly changing for the better. Right on queue we now see see further proof that you‚Äôre miles off becoming a truly sovereign nation guided by sane leadership. How can one have sane leadership when the puppet masters are a people of psychosis? Now make note of how Obama sent an olive branch out to Putin over Syria only to have it undermined within just twenty-four hours. Where did the undermining take place? New Venice when a warmongering Zeusian U.S. Army General decided to say ‚Äúto deter and if necessary defeat Russia in a war‚Äù. Britain hasn‚Äôt changed its spots in the slightest.\n\n<strong>What should happen next in the U.K. and U.S.</strong>\n\nLeadsom‚Äôs actions today should be more proof of what I said where we need a new UK Government made up of people who know how to run a real sovereign nation such as people like Roger Hayes and Brain Gerrish of the British Constitutional Group. You cannot have a part revolution and then still play the Jewish games otherwise the Jews will always win as they‚Äôve got the majority power from an economical, business and energy angle. The Jews have infiltrated and set up this system for centuries and it has to be completely undone and rebuilt in order for a nation to survive. So for example it‚Äôs no good using a currency and economic system the Jews can manipulate. Why do you think Putin and Xi have now made an entirely new system which even utilizes its own software and electronic payment transactions (China International Payments System) outside of a system like SWIFT? Russia and China also clamp down on the Internet not through fear of the general population as such but in order to block out foreign interference which brings about hybrid warfare and color revolution as seen with social media. In order for true sovereignty you have to completely remove all the Jew media and Internet services (Jewish bait and traps). Just look at how the Jews utilize Facebook against their enemies in order to aid color revolutions, riots and fake-argument protests. Now go and look at the Chairman of Facebook and make sure you realize that Mark Zuckerberg is a Jew.\n\nWhilst the goy children are indoctrinated into being free-love, soma-happy, dumbed downed slaves, you have the Jews training their children to run the corporations and be part of the spiritual elite just like the Aristocracy has always achieved. Your child‚Äôs education will be dominated by these Jews and even hindered by their poisons (MMR vaccine) designed to purposely stunt the goy child‚Äôs mind development. If anybody wants to argue my last fact then please read Bertrand Russell‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Impact of Science on Society‚Äô and correct yourself from the horses mouth. Both the U.S. and U.K. corporations must become real nations again and in order to do so they must remove all traces of the Kabbalah-led spiritual elite infiltration and takeover system. In truth we need a world-wide event where multiple nations all at the same time take back their resources and economics etc from the Jews. The Jew should be banished from all nations as in times of old but making sure this time they can never again infiltrate and destroy our nations and cultures.\n\n<strong>What would need to be the plan of action to remove the Jews?</strong>\n\nWell if we‚Äôre expelling all the Jews then they‚Äôll need a piece of land to do with what they want and no I wouldn‚Äôt let them keep Palestine. Instead the Jews would be punished and another piece of land would be found outside of the Middle East. The people of Palestine would be freed once and for all from the evils of the Jewish occupation. On top of being freed the Palestinians would receive yearly reparations from the Jews for all the hardship and suffering in the region. The Jews would no longer be given reparations from Germany for the so-called Holocaust! The idea of Pre-traumatic Stress Disorder would be wiped out of the Jews or at least not given any credibility. Many of the Jewish elite would be placed in jail prior to sentencing for crimes against humanity and treason with many being executed by death penalties under various laws set by nations. Older Treason laws must be upheld in order to prevent any Jewish changes hindering true justice. So for example Britain should utilize laws prior to the 1990s due to Jew puppet Tony Blair and the New Doge (QEII) removing the death penalty for treason.\n\nThe Jews in their new land will no longer be able to communicate with the outside world and will have to fend for themselves. We can never ever trust that they‚Äôll change their ways because this will never be so and they‚Äôll always be the hidden ones who continue with this ‚Äòchosen‚Äô nonsense also known as exceptionalism. So we could never believe a Jew even it they claim they‚Äôve given up their Jewishness aka ‚Äòchosen‚Äô nonsense. We‚Äôre dealing with a people of psychosis who‚Äôll never change their paws for fingers and instead they‚Äôll be sharpening their claws behind veils. Just go back throughout history and it‚Äôs all in plain sight for everyone to see. Look back at how the Marranos Jews pretended to be Catholic but still practiced their Satanic cult known as Judaism. You just cannot trust these types of depraved and psychotic people. The Jews and their unholy books need to be shunned by the people‚Äôs of the worth after a mass exposure of their sickness and psychosis. Why is it okay for the Jew media to regularly attack passages of the Christian Bible and Islamic Qu‚Äôran but you‚Äôre not allowed to hear or expose the evils of the Talmud, Zohar or the Torat Hamelech?\n\n<strong>Who would you choose to lead Britain out of the candidates so far?</strong>\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt choose any candidate and right now I certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose Andrea Leadsom. I believe someone like Roger Hayes would be perfect to lead a truly sovereign Great Britain. It‚Äôll be interesting to see where Andrea Leadsom goes with the HS2 rail project because right now it‚Äôs looking rather bleak. I doubt Leadsom will show any promise when it comes to high-speed infrastructure whether it‚Äôs the HS2 prject or something else. The Zeusians detest progression and thus development and infrastructure projects are canceled out. Britain doesn‚Äôt need HS2 and instead we should be utilizing a more modern system from China who now have some of the most superior high-speed trains in the world. We don‚Äôt need HS2 but we do need high-speed rail to compete and work with the development based BRICS nations which we should be joining not shunning. The way these Zeusians try to worm their way out of development is by using the excuse of the environment. I have no doubt Andrea Leadsom will soon start the environment deception games and we all know that the end-goal of that deceit is mass global genocide. Isn‚Äôt it interesting how it‚Äôll be so bad to lay a train track across a patch of land that will progress mankind for centuries to come but on the other hand dangerous and polluting use of fracking is totally acceptable?\n\nFor a nation to succeed and be prosperous then it needs to be part of a mass development and infrastructure project like the BRICS whilst utilizing its own space program or being part of someone else‚Äôs. To really strengthen the nation you‚Äôll also need to develop a strong culture that uplifts mankind not lowers it. If I had to really choose between Theresa May and Leadsom then right now I‚Äôd have to say its best to go with Theresa May. Why? Well you know what you‚Äôre getting with Theresa May and let me remind you she‚Äôs a Daughter of Light aka Freemason being part of the Lodge known as the Worshipful Company of Marketors. This Andrea Leadsom plays the big ‚Äòchange‚Äô game and makes out she‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs friend but I suspect she‚Äôs worse than the lot of them before her. If Leadsom isn‚Äôt fully under the thumb of the Labour Friends of Israel then she soon will be when she becomes Prime Minister and yes she attends their meetings. Who do you think was the front man used to back Andrea Leadsom? The same front man called Boris Johnson who the Jews used along with Jewish David Cameron (Crooked Nose Clan) to take the limelight away from Nigel Farage of UKIP. Anyone who insults Vladimir Putin and Russia in the way Leadsom attempted to do and so early in the game can only mean one thing and that‚Äôs they‚Äôre insane &amp; psychopathic and thus not worthy to govern for the people of the nation. May I ask who selected her for the position of running for Prime Minister? It certainly wasn‚Äôt the people of the Blessed Isles of Albion! You can bet your bottom pound that she was selected by the Jewish lobby known as the Conservative Friends of Israel who with its other branches all dominate British Politics. This is why I cannot stress enough how important it is to remove the Jewish threat from the nation states. Britons should be demanding a General Election rather than allowing the continuation of Zionist psychotic policies via an unelected Conservative leadership change.\n\n<strong>Who would you choose to lead United States out of the candidates so far?</strong>\n\nThe United States serves the Jews under AIPAC and until those Jews are removed then once again no candidate is worth bothering with. If I had to choose out of Jewess Clinton and Donald Trump then I‚Äôd have to at force call for Donald Trump. What the U.S. needs is the same as Britain, it needs true patriotic leaders who will act as a proper government that works for the people‚Äôs interests. A true government is meant to protect the DNA and culture of its people so you want somebody that brings back nations of a singular race and culture. Donald Trump has shown that he may work with Vladimir Putin so I will give him a thumbs up in that area. We see how so many have turned against Trump which could be a good sign but I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôs also part of the problem. I believe the Jews may be once again playing the old two-sides of the same coin trick.\n\nYou have to understand that New Venice really went to town on the United States after Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs presidency. The biggest problem in the United States then came from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (Nazi pink triangle boys continuum) who‚Äôs roots go back to the Bonaparte family of the World Revolutionary Movement. You need to understand that the roots of the FBI are firmly underneath the Trump plant and then the one side of the coin becomes clear. We‚Äôve seen over the years that the Jewish entertainment has often predictively programmed the goyim into the mind frame that Donald Trump would run and even become President. We‚Äôve also seen the Jewish entertainment do exactly the same with Hillary but more so from a feminine subliminal point of view. Both the daughters of Trump and Clinton are married to Jews. Only recently we‚Äôve seen Donald Trump playing golf with a Jew known as Rupert Murdoch (a Marrano style Jew masquerading as a fake catholic).\n\nAt the beginning of this political farce in the U.S. I‚Äôve always said the only man for the job at the time was Martin O‚ÄôMalley. Why? He was the only candidate who was properly calling for the ending of Wall Street and bringing forth the Glass Steagall Act. No other candidate was doing such a thing and Wall Street was most definitely not impressed. Now you can see why Martin O‚ÄôMalley got no where in the running of this rigged farce. So why has Trump? Trump has never spoken about how he‚Äôd tackle Wall Street and he‚Äôs never spoke about the Glass Steagall Act or anything on those lines. Under Donald Trump it will almost be business as usual on Wall Street. How do the Jews control the United States? They achieve this through Wall Street which is mastered by the king of the thieves The City of London over in New Venice! What did we witness happen with the Glass Steagall Act talk? Well as usual a Jew marginally took it on baord in his campaign and that Jew was none other than Bernie Sanders. Bernie was used in exactly the same way David Cameron was against the limelight and competition of Nigel Farage except this time it was done against Martin O‚ÄôMalley. I‚Äôve highlighted before how the Jews will always take on the debate amongst their own people and then ignore the real people and cause. The Jew has to have all the limelight and control.\n\nIt would be hard to find anyone of worth in the U.S. to lead the nation because all the patriotic groups have been infiltrated by the Jews utilizing the FBI and especially Division Five headed over in Denver, Colorado. Do I have to remind you of how FBID5 dominates much of the alternative media? Haven‚Äôt you even noticed how many of the biggest names in the conspiracy arena are actually Jewish? You have outright Jews fronting so-called truth-telling radio and websites. As I‚Äôve said before it‚Äôs all simply the Jews controlling both sides of the coin but in this case it‚Äôs not only to divert but also to cause self-helplessness and a lack of solutions. Look at how this same FBI Director James Comey has now let Hillary Clinton off the hook for her email crimes during her time in the State Department. Pink triangle James Comey won‚Äôt dare cross Jewess Clinton because he‚Äôs also both controlled and blackmailed by the same Jews of New Venice. If Comey makes a stand then he knows they may let slip about some of the drug money laundering deals for the Los Zeta and Sinoloas cartels of Mexico whilst he was on the board of directors of New Venice‚Äôs own HongKong Shanghai Banking Corporation.\n\n<strong>What do you think will be the ultimate outcome of a Clinton and Leadsom leadership of the Trans-Atlantic power?</strong>\n\nThere is no Trans-Atlantic power! The TA is irreversibly bankrupt and has been collapsed for seven years now. If all the U.S. weapons were destroyed then it wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford to make new ones as its struggling right now in a full blown economic depression. Whilst we can see more signs of the economic depression than before, there are still veils helping hide the true extent of the damage and one of these veils is the EBT food stamp welfare program. The U.S military is around a decade or more behind Russia in weapons technology etc and a lot of this is because of the lack of innovation due to suppression of mankind‚Äôs progression in West thanks to Aristotelian Bertrand Russell. It doesn‚Äôt even matter about having wealth if one doesn‚Äôt have knowledge and this is why technology is grinding to a halt and others are taking over. This is what happens when you create a dysfunctional culture, stagnate innovation and a people who believe they‚Äôre exceptional. Nations need high-levels of education as well as Classical music played in the Verdi tuning to help raise culture and mankind. Go and watch a bunch of cows listening to real musical instruments and then watch what those same cows do when the negative tuning and modern instruments get used (they run for their lives).\n\nBy stunting innovation a nation and Empire can only fail as we‚Äôve now seen with the New Venice Empire of the Jews. Take a look at the differences between the nations of China and the United States. Please don‚Äôt listen to the negative anti-China propaganda. If you do the comparison between China and the U.S. then you‚Äôll soon see what I‚Äôm saying as China dramatically raises its game and now becomes the leadership that the whole world is in desperate need of utilizing with immediate effect. China was sailing the oceans of the world and visiting the Americas a long time before the Knights Templar and the Europeans. We have a lot to learn from the Chinese!\n\nIf Clinton and Leadsom get their insane way then we‚Äôll very soon be in a World War for the third time and which will result in the destruction of Europe within less than three days of any such war breaking out. The rest of the world will be destroyed not long after Europe and you can bet your bottom pound that very quickly this global event from hell will end up nuclear and non-conventional. Please don‚Äôt expect hundreds of nuclear weapons to fly off and land on their targets like something out of the Jewish Hollywood programming such as ‚ÄòWargames‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe Day After‚Äô. I believe it‚Äôs impossible for that scenario to take place due to the harmonics of Solar orb. Instead what you‚Äôll get will be specific events in single regions at specific times based on these harmonics of sun in the chosen target regions. In truth nuclear weapons are redundant as the covert exotic scalar interferometer weapons make nukes look like a child‚Äôs toy. Whilst it‚Äôs true that nuclear weapons can destroy all the top surface of the Earth, you have to understand that these exotic covert weapons of today can actually split the Earth into two or more pieces. This technology is based on the work of the back-engineering genius known as Nikola Tesla. The reason Americans have been plagued by the Scherff‚Äôs (Bushfraud, Kennebunk hillbillies) is because the Nazi Schutzstaffel used George H.W Scherff (Bushfraud 41) to spy on Tesla in the United States. Let me remind you that the Scherff‚Äôs are part of the leadership makeup of the Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst. Let me also remind you that Jewish Heinz Kissinger was the American leader of the DVD prior to George H.W Scherff.\n\nSo if the two whores of Babylon the Great (Clinton and Leadsom) get placed onto the thrones of the Kikedom then rest assured we‚Äôre quickly heading for World War III. Understand that the New Venice Empire has collapsed and the only thing left that New Venice can do in order to attempt to keep control over its slave planet is to go to war. The problem is that this war won‚Äôt be like any other conventional war and it could even lead to the extinction of mankind. Rest assured the people of psychosis known as the Jews will go to these insane lengths even though it‚Äôs not winnable! I should point out that the Jews love large scale blood ritual genocide through war and they would love their population reduction quotas to be filled up by mass war. You do have some of the Aristocracy who prefer the quotas were mostly made up from slow-kill genocides like vaccines, sustainable development (UN Agenda 21) etc. At this moment in time you can witness the insanity of the UK Ministry of Defence as it sends UK Plc (British) troops over to Poland in an attempt to rattle the Russian Bear. Let‚Äôs face facts, what will British troops do against Russian forces in its own backyard or anywhere else for that matter? The whole idea of a major World War being land based is a complete and utter farce. It reminds me of the U.S and U.K. still spending debt instruments on all these aircraft carriers when they‚Äôve been made redundant since the capabilities of the French Exocet missile let alone the most advanced weapons from Russia like the Granit (Shipwreck) missile. If World War III occurs it‚Äôll be won by missiles and covert technology. Russia proved that the U.S. isn‚Äôt a match for its military power when it completely shut down the U.S. and NATO military forces over in Syria using its advanced Iranian originated KRET Richag-AV electronic jamming systems creating a complete A2/AD bubble over a large distance. These systems are also being using over the Baltic Sea as well as the Crimea and they scare the hell out of war criminal/terrorist NATO commander Philip Breedlove. Russia has shown that it‚Äôs the true world‚Äôs superpower especially since the Jewish coup on Ukraine.\n\n<strong>Why do the Jews hide this psychopathic mind-set from the majority of the Goyim?</strong>\n\nWell wouldn‚Äôt you? If everyone understood the mind of the Jew then it would be ever so easy for the gentiles to see through what is happening and realize who‚Äôs exactly to blame. Right now some of the gentiles may think to themselves about how crazy and insane some of these world affairs have been lately. Without the knowledge of the psychosis of the Jew these gentiles cannot put together all the pieces of the conspiracy puzzle. The Jew will also put up diversions in order to steer you away from their actions. For example many gentiles will be fooled into thinking the attack on the Russian Czar and the Red Revolution on Russia were all about the Russian Orthodox Church vs Catholicism issue. On top of the religion diversion they‚Äôll also hide their actions to suppress progression. So Russia was a great power and the Russian Czar was looking at using the American model just like Bizmarck of Germany. The Jews attacked their economic and power competitors whilst also attacking both Christian based nations. It wasn‚Äôt the Catholics who attacked Russia, it was the Jews! Please don‚Äôt fall for the Jewish trickery any longer and come away from their games of diversion no matter how convincing they may at first seem.\n\n<strong>Does Tony Blair work for the Pope or the Jews?</strong>\n\nFirst of all there is no pope only anti-popes ever since 1962 and the Jesuit renewal aka Second Vatican Council (Jew trap). All these anti-popes serve the Jewish power! So obviously Tony Blair serves the Jews not the Vatican! Tony Blair wears his Yarmulke skull cap just like the rest of them but he masquerades as a Catholic (a bit like the Maranno) which suits his wife Cherie Booth. Who else do we know who was a Booth? Why it‚Äôs none other than John Wilkes Booth the front man for John Surrat‚Äôs execution of President Lincoln paid for by Privy Councilor Edward John Stanley via the Bank of Montreal who also funded the executioners (Permanent Industrial Expositions) of Promethean John F. Kennedy. The Booth family have always played a large role in the Illuminati Jewish conspiracy. Tony Blair is a fraud, liar and a murderer by proxy! Tony Blair‚Äôs rise to power came by way of the Labour Friends of Israel just like the rest of this British Jewry led UK Government. It‚Äôs the Blairites in the Labour Party who‚Äôre out to remove Jeremy Corbyn simply because Corbyn wants to put Blair on trial for his crimes over the Iraq War. Now that the Chilcot report has been released you can expect a high level of desperate attacks against the Corbyn camp in order to make sure he has very little say in the future. Jeremy Corbyn was always a Jewish front and I said so from the start but only now are some people starting to see what I was saying all along.\n\n<strong>What should happen to Tony Blair?</strong>\n\nWell he could be immediately sentenced to jail without the help of the Chilcot Inquiry. How? Well he‚Äôs committed treason on Britain like Privy Councilor John Major and Gordon Brown by all signing a European Union treaty co-signed by their master the New Doge of New Venice aka Queen Elizabeth II. We don‚Äôt need the Chilcot Inquiry to remove Tony Blair so even if the filth still claim he hasn‚Äôt committed any war crimes then we shouldn‚Äôt care because we can still bring him to justice via his treason on the nation of Great Britain. If the Royal prerogative continues to protect Blair over the Iraq war then we can get around this by bringing Treason charges up against the New Doge herself and thus voiding her Royal prerogative by going back to her very first treaty signing date.\n\n<strong>Didn‚Äôt George W. Bush force Blair into the Iraq War?</strong>\n\nI‚Äôve said this before and I‚Äôll say it again, don‚Äôt fall for Jewish and New Venice diversion trickery. The U.S Government utilized which intelligence services for its so-called data on Iraq? It was the British Intelligence network as usual fronted by the Hill &amp; Knowlton con men commanded by the British controlled Wire and Plastic Products. New Venice was the heart of Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL) which later was renamed Operation Iraqi Freedom. George W. Scherff (Bushfraud) told Blair there was no need for mass British forces participation in the Iraq war as the United States could manage it all by themselves. Tony Blair decided to be the big shot and add British forces ignoring the Pentagon. Tony Blair wanted himself to go down in history as the man who helped remove Saddam Hussein and bring about the Zeusian New World Order. Tony Blair and Geoff Hoon both played a major role in the attacks on 9/11 aided by the North Atlantic Treaty Union with the U.K Ministry of Defence grabbing complete control over the U.S. Continuity of Government and Public Key Infrastructure programs.\n\n<strong>Don‚Äôt you believe that Tony Blair was the puppet of George W. Bush?</strong>\n\nNo! Yet again you‚Äôre repeating Jewish diversions! Tony Blair was always more powerful than George W. Scherff (Bushfraud 43) whilst Blair was working directly for the New Doge and the City of London. No U.S. President is above the British Prime Minister regardless of what nonsense the Zionist media may portray. Do you think George H.W Scherff (Bushfraud 41) controlled Margaret Thatcher? Why don‚Äôt you ask him how Margaret Thatcher seriously pissballed him for not following previous orders from New Venice via the normal command chain protocols. Things got so bad with the delays from Scherff that Thatcher was ordered by her New Venice masters to meet with him in Aspen, Colorado and give him his orders direct. After that meeting Scherff realized he was in serious trouble and the Iraq War (Operation Desertstorm) drums started beating. So please don‚Äôt talk about Prime Ministers being poodles of Presidents because that is a total farce. The United States is a plantation of New Venice that was decided upon to be the proxy front-man for the New Venice Empire whilst the real powers are based in Britain (New Venice) and Israel. The U.S. is used by the Jew just as a cash-cow via frauds such as the Federal Reserve majority run by the Rothschild family (Guardians of the Vatican Treasury since the 1820s) as well as the evils of the Dope Inc empire through the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Ask the Great Master of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath, Prince Charles about his cash-cow called the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and its ties to his concubine, Camilla Parker Bowles.\n\n<strong>Once again thank you for your contribution in helping the truth get out to the masses.</strong>\n\nüí´<strong>Can a Christian be a Platonist? Jun 30, 2016 @ 11:13</strong>\n\nTo answer that question, I would need to explain what did Plato believed in contrary to what Aristotle the amoral foolish coward was against. Luckily, the bulk of that explanation is explained in English in a video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zMgsR23RFk\" target=\"_blank\">Plato Versus Aristotle - Economy and Philosophy</a> (seriously, sit through that lecture). Retroductive reasoning, not to be confused with abductive reasoning, is the process of finding truth within the mind the invisible nature of things that is behind all things, which when done properly, it all comes from one source. That's not a proper definition, but it'll do for now. This is metaphysics as defined by Plato, not by Aristotle which redefined all the words that he twisted from Plato. People confuse Neoplatonism with Platonism which is Platonism with \"Mysticism\" which in itself is a broad term with many definitions and holds much baggage to trying to know which definition I'm specifying due to the stigma of others who've used that word to describe other things while technically falling under the generic definition of \"Mysticism\" which is not adequate in itself as an explanation without context. Mysticism can be described as faith in a supreme God, esoteric teachings revealed through a relationship or a different type of union with God in spirit and in truth through say the Holy Spirit, paganism, etc. Neoplatonists can be Christians or Gnostics or Pagans and/or anything else that allows any form of mysticism of \"secret doctrines\". Christian Neoplatonists for this specific definition that I'm describing to you, is those Christians that adhere to the Athanasius Creed (the Nicene creed's too lenient towards Mithraism and paganism) that incorporates Platonism into Christianity, not the other way round. Some \"Neoplatonists\" are pushing dualistic Manichaeism, which is Gnosticism. Plato was not a \"Gnostic\", and was not a \"dualist\". Many would say that the Apostle Paul was a dualistic Manichaeist Gnostic Rabbi, but that's just wrong. One definiton of Gnosticism is essentially a corruption of Christianity, which makes pre-Christian Gnosticism not Gnosticism at all.\n\nGod made evil but for His good. Open Theism reduces God's power to a lesser god of the likes of say of a \"Demiurge\". The Orphians and Sethians, as well as the more commonly known mythos concerning the Demiurge had corrupted and distorted the context of what the philosophers sought to explain in metaphysical context, but that doesn't mean that Plato's completely \"wrong\", neither is Plotinus completely \"wrong\" for using the same words that means different things in different context with different \"baggages\", stigmatized, demonized words in popular culture. Eat the meat, spit out the bones. Open Theism (AKA: Openness Theology, Free Will Theism) leads to Process Theology and metaphysical Libertarianism as well as Arminianism that in some forms is pro Open Theism. To me, the dualistic Gnostic here is the Arminianist and its many different forms that reduces God as the mystical \"Demiurge\" instead of the \"Nous\" which means spirit which is made in the image of the One, for the Arminianist denies that God as \"Ialdabaoth/Demiurge\" has no power over the will of others, being in equal footing to Satan which is \"Sophia\". Monistic Gnostics that doesn't mysticize Monism are not the same as the false mystic dualistic Gnostics of Zoroastrianism, Zurvanism, Mithraism, Manichaeism, Nesotorianism, Peleganism (influenced by Manichaeism), which Arminianism is \"Semi-Peleganism\". John Calvin's concept of Calvinism seems to give an inadequate explanation to bible verses, but through Presuppositional Apologetics (primarily \"Presbyterian\" though it could be its own completely separate branch of Christianity altogether), Prima Scriptura (the actual meaning of Sola Scriptura understood by Eastern Orthodox Christians, not to be confused with Solo Scriptura, see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-error-of-solo-scriptura/\" target=\"_blank\">The Error of Solo Scriptura</a>) can be defended while explaining that Genesis 50:20 shows how man's will that is Satan's will is still in God's will that God meant it (Joseph's many tribulations starting from being abandoned in the well) for good, even though his brothers sinned against him. God predestines bad things for His good, for His future plans for mankind. You see, \"free will\" exists in the sense that you don't know all the time whether you are in God's will or in Satan's will, but obeying God's will is done through the Holy Spirit can there be a type of \"free will\" to conform to God's will which is to let go of \"self will\" that is Satan's will which you will be punished for obeying, yet in another sense, God will use \"the good and the bad\" for His good, just that reason is not always knowable by man. You have the liberty to make decisions, but what concerns Calvinism is in what jurisdiction you are under, which is to God, a predetermined result of Him choosing whom He loves. People can't believe in Jesus Christ if God have not chosen them first. God punishes many in the Book of Revelation, yet because of their hardened hearts, they can't repent and they are filled with hatred against God which is ever kindled through His wrath. Aristotle is the one who coined the \"lesser of two evils\" thing, his ethics simply put, is about whatever outcome that is rewarding relative to the person instead of doing the right thing that is not within the given choices.\n\nPlatonists might say that I'm not a real Platonist because I believe that to God, there is no such thing as free will: that everything is predetermined, just that you don't know what that destiny is, that nobody can will themselves to be saved. Concerning that, sure, I'm not a Platonist in that specific regard, but it's a misunderstanding in some sense of what the bible says for itself. Calvin was blamed to be a dualist, but he is not. I am not a Nestorian, not a Gnostic, not a Manichaeist. Darkness is an attribute of light, but light is not an attribute of darkness. God is light, the \"one\"/the Absolute, the Form of the Good it is \"what gives truth to the things known and the power to know to the knower\". It is not only the \"cause of knowledge and truth, it is also an object of knowledge\". This is similar to the invisible God concept Paul was explaining in some sense, but not completely identical to what Plato was explaining. To Aristotle, knowing the Absolute Truth is a waste of time because people with different professions have no purpose in learning about it. I've met many stupid people like that which doesn't care about the truth but only what they could do, and made it their religion.\n\nSome idiots claim that Paul got his triparte being thing from Plato's tripartite theory of the soul. If anything Plato's concept is a dichotomy of body and soul which the soul is the true self so there is no dualism contrary to the Aristotelian bastardization of Monism of claiming the body is the soul, but Plato's and Monism in general has no \"spirit\" besides the Monad/One while the soul has three parts: one being logical and the other being \"spirited\" which is more emotional while the last part being appetitive, carnal desires. The spirit is dead in everyone until they are saved. The \"gut instinct\" of Christians comes from the Holy Spirit which there is another \"gut instinct\" that comes from the flesh/body, but to Plato, the real gut instinct is from the logical part of one's soul, not from the body, not from the Holy Spirit. In the Christian concept, the life giving spirit that is \"you\" is not the same as the Holy Spirit. In other words, your spirit is the fuel behind your soul which in turn manifests as the body. To Christians, the spirit of a saved Christian is connected to the Holy Spirit while non Christians, their spirit is connected to anything else but the Holy Spirit. Everyone is assumed to be connected to the Monad in Plato's concept, but in the Christian concept, everyone has the initial breath of life through Adam to be alive physically and have a soul, but Christians require the second Adam, Jesus Christ, to receive the Holy Spirit that connects you to God. The Old Testament viewpoint is in fact, very similar to Plato's concepts, except the complete annihilation of the soul after death yet many \"Messianics\" don't want to admit the Monistic \"Gnostic\" nature of the Old Testament at face value, but back then, if it came from the writ of the Judahites, the Kabbalah was shared in equal footing as the Old Testament generally grouped together when shared of its contents. Aristotle and his deceived followers reject the \"existence\" of the soul when the body is a projection of the soul so the body exists outside of the soul. There is no \"antenna\" detectable in the body connecting to a soul, but the body is a posterior attribute of the soul. To a Christian, the soul can temporarily be inactive yet exist without a physical body, but not \"dead\" because Christians will be reborn in new incorruptible physical bodies in the New Heaven, New Earth, New Jerusalem. A spirit that is not of God's will is fueled by evil which the soul becomes corrupted. A Christian might be rotting away physically, but not in their soul and spirit. If a demonic spirit seeks to destroy a Christian, if they can't do a top down corruption of their spirit by separating them from the Holy Spirit somehow, they would have to result to destroying the body and hope to corrupt the soul from the bottom up through external, physical means.\n\nPlato and many religions for that matter think that animals have souls. I do think that all things with brains have the potential of having a mind, but they're usually lower level lifeforms. What has nerves can feel stuff, but until they have a \"reptillian\" brain, they probably don't have any primal desires. I do think that the triune brain model has some level of truth in it concerning measures of sentience. The bible shows signs that a donkey, if it is allowed to speak in man's tongue supernaturally by God, has a mind of its own capable of some form of internal dialogue. Koko the Gorilla could talk in sign language with an IQ of a 5 year old human. That doesn't mean gorillas are made in the image of God, neither has the breath of life. That's exclusive to humanity, as well as being able to have the knowledge of good and evil. Animals might know fear, but they don't know \"sin\". God only promised mankind salvation. Whether or not there would be animals in the New Heaven, New Earth, I don't know, but God didn't say anything about resurrecting animal souls. Be happy that God didn't choose the animal with the highest IQ as \"people\", for dolphins are the \"smartest\", yet they can't \"sin\" though they can cause havoc and rape people. Koko's IQ at times was 95. IQ is not the same as \"knowledge\". Having a relationship with God isn't exclusive to people if you read what God said to Job concerning animals, but God doesn't love them the same way as He loves us. Animals don't have \"free will\", just as angels and demons and nature itself don't, although concerning angels and demons, they had already chosen their fate and they can't turn back from their decision. Animals don't choose God or Satan, no animal had \"gone to hell\" from earth. They live in the now, with little to no regard concerning the future. Some animals have enough sentience to have a form of a will, a mind of its own. Satan and his army seeks to destroy people first. They can inhabit animals, but usually they don't. The last time they did, it was against their will as they had to physically die by drowning in the water by the command of Jesus. Perhaps they could feel the pain of their host during a possession. Animals can't receive the Holy Spirit. Sentience is not the same as being alive. Bacteria and amoebas are \"alive\", but they have no sentience while there is a noticeable higher complexity in the amoeba than the bacteria. Animus means mind, soul, life force, courage, will, breath. If you believe in the myth of evolution, since all things came from rocks, you're also a rock (and dumb as a rock). The bible doesn't say that animal souls are immortal.\n\nPlatonists believe in the immortality of the soul, that the soul is the true self while the body is the projection of the soul, which the body exists \"outside\" of the soul metaphysically, as the soul came from the Monad. Aristotle thinks that the soul can't exist without the body while claiming that the soul does not exist, only the body as the body is the soul in a physical sense that have characteristics of a soul without having the metaphysical soul. Whether or not you believe in the soul sleep doctrine doesn't change how the lake of fire is eternal and that how Heaven is eternal. The destruction of souls is not a termination of activity in souls, that's \"soul sleep\" or physical death when the soul is temporarily asleep before God gathers the wheat to resurrect and rapture His people who are alive in Him before he burns the tares in burning up the world, purifying it before the day of judgement which everyone who were raptured that had the first resurrection which is to be a Christian become the judges that would judge the demons as Paul says, it is believed that people would be judged by God first in the day of judgement, reviewing your life and checking to see if you are written in the book of life, before the Christians become judges and judge the demons. I've shared more about eschatology in <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/christian-eschatology-verses-zionist-misinterpretation/\" target=\"_blank\">Christian Eschatology verses Zionist Misinterpretation</a> and in <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/biblical/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Biblical\"</a> though really it's all over the place, I haven't shared \"everything\". Basically, if you get raptured (second rapture, the first rapture was the Christians leaving Jerusalem when the Roman soldiers surrounded Jerusalem as they fled to Pella <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/p/pella-flight.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/p/pella-flight.html</a>) before the world is purified, you are already saved through the \"first resurrection\" in becoming a Christian, and even though you would go up to the throne of God in judgement day, that outcome would be predetermined, predestined to be in the book of life. It is implied that human souls are immortal, but not explicitly stated. The Old Testament people really sought to be buried in a family cemetery, have a sense of home after death. Since Aristotle thinks that there is no soul, so there is no immortality or an afterlife, no Heaven, no Hell.\n\nAugustine was accused of mixing Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, which is true, but he is essentially a Platonist. Aristotle was an atheist. Although Socrates was accused of impiety, it doesn't mean that he was anti God or monad but just their cultural gods and their authority in mandating the worship of such gods. Platonists believe that through retroductive logic instead of abductive, inductive and deductive reasoning which are all inherently empirical reasoning that comes from Aristotle's mathematical rationalization in rejection to the natural physics that have invisible qualities that can be understood, truth can be known not from the senses. The beauty of nature is not separated and compartmentalized by professions studying separate things concerning observable nature. Through retroductive reasoning, Ken Wheeler (AKA: Theoria Apophasis) had found the beauty of nature in how things operate in the study of field mechanics: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2SEnO1Dcl4\" target=\"_blank\">Secrets &amp; Metaphysics of a FIELD: Genuine Cosmic Mechanics ala Mother-Nature &amp; Tesla</a> He also explains soul quite well: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCfzL9ncbKo\" target=\"_blank\">Two Selves &amp; the Soul: Lost teachings of ancient Greek &amp; Monistic metaphysics</a> and how beliefs are not who you are: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPPGNvth03Y\" target=\"_blank\">Wisdom of the Ancient Greeks (you should have been taught in school but weren't)</a>, but unfortunately, not everyone would change to the \"right path\" to the Absolute Truth. The \"Atma\" in a metaphysical sense all comes from God, but what differs the teachings of Plato from Christianity is about Jesus, the mystery of the Trinity, salvation through Jesus Christ alone (AKA: Solus Christus, not to be confused with \"Jesusists\" and their Jesuism/Jesusism), the exclusive Christian worldview and history and science (like the biblical spherical earth, Geocentricity, Creationism). Many philosophers couldn't speak against the empire, so they are very careful in their words. It is not from the teachings of Aristotle that brought forth the Renaissance, rather, the mentioning of what Plato had said through others. Protestantism through Paolo Sarpi's Modern British Liberalism pushed Baconian inductive reasoning and they allowed innovation but not creativity, so that nobody can come to know how scientific theorem can be understood by hiding Plato's works and only share about Plato in history through the eyes of Aristotle.\n\nJohn Calvin was a \"humanist\" so he probably got his hands on what Plato had said. Martin Luther was a known anti-Aristotelian Platonist. The Anglicans, the Shakers (AKA: Quakers), and some Catholics through the Counter Reformation that also diverted attention away from the Renaissance, had pushed Arminianism and also in doing so, had diverted the attention of the humanist Christians away from any redeemable concepts from the Renaissance (which unfortunately was mostly pagan) and into battling a \"spiritual warfare\" which was a political one that had ramped up and worsened through Oliver Cromwell and through the invitation of the Jews into the Isles of Albion, but it actually started through Queen Elizabeth I and even before her reign. She was not perfect, nor great, but she was better than Bloody Mary and she didn't persecute the Presbyterians, the Puritans, the Lutherans, the Baptists, although in turn (but under the reign of Edward Henry VIII in the \"Dissolution of the Monasteries\"), the Catholics were persecuted and the Cestui que vie Act 1540 took the land and the monasteries as Crown property and given it to Lutherans, Anglicans, Protestants. The Usufruct of Roman Civil Law was reintroduced, and more Cestui que vie Acts came about, the more infamous one being in 1666. The Venetians and their Talmudic-Islamic Templars used the Protestants in revenge to that the Catholic Church had done to them by utilizing a pre-existing schism to their advantage as they had transplanted into the City of London in the 1800's as the British East India Company. The Renaissance wasn't exclusively Protestant, it's mostly from Catholics and humanists. Only a few had fled from the Aristotelian garbage that moved to the New World which for a time, the Puritans was against British brainwashing. \n\nTo Aristotle, the purpose of life is to share his brainwashing to others for some gain and also to flee from persecution to abandon his faith in his philosophy like Socrates had. He rationalized it with his \"lesser of two evils\" and decided to not die for his beliefs of being accused of impiety so he fled to his mother like a coward but died shortly a couple of years after. He even believes that people are just too stupid and forgetful, yet he tries to make them even more stupid, while he's the inspiration that had pushed tyranny over others through a lack of real knowledge for his cheating \"logic\" is about mastering excuses against everything and anything to get away with responsibilities done in an appearance of being better than them sort of like how stuck up high class British people talk in. Aristotelian Academia is in essence, for people to have a piece of paper to be certified in not knowing anything about what they were certified for, sort of like all those Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity fools that uses mathematics to explain physics when physics is not mathematics while field physics is the purest form of almost all things concerning physics (except for QM and GR based garbage).\n\nPlato according to Justin Martyr, learned from his time in Egypt picked up the Hebrew Torah and read the Book of Genesis, see: <a href=\"http://carm.org/justin-martyr-hortatory-greeks\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Martyr's Hortatory address to the Greeks</a>. Plato according to David Livingstone's <a href=\"http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/NewAge/Plato_Kabbalist.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Plato the Kabbalist</a> article basically talks about how the Babylonian Magis were also the exiled Judahites that influended the Greek Magi: Orpheus of the rites of Dionysus whom Orpheus learned about Moses (as Musaeus) whom Pythagoras learned from Orpheus, whom Plato derived much influence from Pythagoras. This means an ancient form of Kabbalism or Hebraic Mysticism became one of the most influential source of Greek religion and \"philosophy\" and Gnosticism. That doesn't mean Platonists are Gnostics, neither are they Kabbalists. There is similarities, but the differences to me at least, is much clearer. The evil Bertrand Russell says it this way:<blockquote>The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought was that of \"enthusiasm,\" of union with the god. They believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato, and from Plato into most later philosophy that was in any degree religious.</blockquote>\n\nThe Austrian School of Economics is based upon Aristotle's philosophy pushed by the Venetians and the British to push privatized feudalism, see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CvahhXOpQY\" target=\"_blank\">Austrian Economics and the Collapse Of California</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DLiM2O5Lp4\" target=\"_blank\">Austrian Economics: The Idiology of Serfdom.</a>.

I don't believe in \"evolution\", but that doesn't mean I believe in the lie of Austrian and Keynesian Economics, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the British lie of cyclical rise and fall of civilizations. The noetic soul of humanity is anti-entropic and is creative. Christian Humanists that fail to grasp Plato and the Renaissance, are not real Humanists, and rather, push British green policies pushed by Prince Philip. Sustainable living? Hogwash!\n\nHumanists like Lyndon LaRouche are at times, hypocritical in not mentioning how some of their humanist leaders in the past that they look up to as continuing the tradition of Plato which Kepler was a Rosicrucian, as well as Leibniz. F. C. S. Schiller which their Schiller Institute was named after was in the English Eugenics Society. They also don't mention how Pierre Teilhard de Chardin SJ corrupted Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky's concept of the noosphere for the Jesuit Order's propaganda to push Darwinism and Malthusian principles. Many Platonists believe in evolution, but not the insane concepts of population reduction (genocide). They know that nature is in a constant state of change but the only unchanging thing is the absolute invisible principles behind nature. Humanists that utilize Plato's ideals and study at least 2,600 years of history have a general grasp of cancer behind humanity. For that, see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzyq4BXTkhQ\" target=\"_blank\">Oligarchy: The Cancer in Human History</a>. Many so called truthers have a selective memory concerning history, many of which is British propaganda, see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BImExxKpBYM\" target=\"_blank\">HOW THE BRITISH EMPIRE BRAINWASHED THE WORLD</a>.\n\nTo add to <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/every-christian-separatist-hates-admit/\" target=\"_blank\">What every Christian Separatist hates to admit</a>, many, and I mean many of them have no answers against the Oligarchal Aristocracy's Zeusian tyranny. Their ideas of society can only work with \"righteous\" people which can be overturned within a generation just as those in the Book of Judges. The bible's only answer to this is the rapture of which the end of a figurative 1000 year reign, nobody knows, but it is suspected that the \"second resurrection\" would happen for a little season after Satan's released before Satan controls the unsaved to revolt against the spiritual New Jerusalem before God burns them all up. In the mean time, you have two options: leave or stay. Leave to be separate from the world completely, or stay to attempt to prevent another dark age created through the Saturnalian Death cult that is the Olympian Venetians/Jews. I'd say, do neither and do both and do something else, an option that is outside of such options, but nobody can survive thermonuclear warfare. Besides promoting Promethean solutions to beat the Zeusians at their own broken game, fleeing to a neutral country that isn't a full blown New World Order country or a BRICS New International Economic Order nation, prepping to avoid the destruction of WW3 and the fall of your nation until it hopefully stabilize and not be bombed yet deal with nuclear fallout and high levels of nuclear radiation, if that's what going to go down, they are going to terraform the earth and round up all survivors as slaves and resume their empire. Remember that they have their deep underground millitary bases, as well as submarines.\n\nMany people are seeking to restore true sovereignty as right wing reactionary movements, but if they not know the solutions that Lyndon LaRouche are saying, all other solutions are more or less a dog eat dog temporal solutions of feudalism while \"utopian communities\" that are against serfdom yet in other forms, are suseptible in being destroyed by surrounding warlords that pillage the people, which the most efficient ones create kingdoms and eventually, empires come forth. That does not however, shoo away any technology, knowledge and inventions we have. The creative spirit of humanity won't suddenly vanish. It will find its way back into society by stealing from the Olympians the gift of fire for long as God is not seeking to end this world, He will only seek to restore liberty that Satan's minions took from His people through a lack of knowledge. A Christian Platonist won't think for too long of the pessimistic, seemingly Aristotelian aspects of the bible like say Ecclesiastes which gives mankind no hope. Many of the things written in the bible concerning creation is verifiable. The bible gives a basic outline of how to have a community, but it doesn't answer everything about anything. It can help people get rid of certain mindsets, learn how to have discernment, know how to farm, know what kinds of animals are to be generally avoided for consumption that generally build up in toxins like carnivores, can even be used to seek understanding of invisible properties of nature that is made knowable by God of whom He had made us in His image, so are our minds, our soul can understand His thought that He shares to us, drops hints to the nature of nature that is inherently full of intelligent design with an Absolute purpose placed there for a divine reason that's self suffient to God's perfect will like say gravity (incoherent magnetism) for example. It is inertia and acceleration that draws magnets together and force and motion to go against it. Falling because of \"gravity\" is not a force that keeps you down, neither is it the atmosphere or the ocean \"weighing you down\" if you're in the water. Here's Ken Wheeler talking about gravity: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IcxHxGZ4OI\" target=\"_blank\">VIDEO 103 UNCOVERING SECRETS OF MAGNETISM. Gravity does NOT exist. F+M vs. I+A. What!?</a>. Aristotle thought that the heavier something was, the faster it fell. Descartes had also made crude observational explanations which was debunked by Leibniz: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF_jzE0ZNDY\" target=\"_blank\">Leibniz's Dynamics and Vis Viva: An Introduction</a>.\n\nMonism believes that there is no Absolute God, but they believe in Absolutes. Their god is nothing. That does not mean they believe that there is no soul. Some might claim that Aristotle might in fact do believe in the existence of the soul, just not in the physical, only in the metaphysical. The Christian God is not the Absolute, \"The One\" of Monism because they believe that God couldn't exist before nothing itself, they imagine the Christian God as a material thing that creates matter like the Demiurge. To them, there can't be nothing and \"God\", for that would be a duality, that the existence of the Christian God is the complete opposite of God. Well I'd say this: nothing is an attribute from God who is everything. It is becase God exists that \"nothing\" can exist as well. It is God that gives \"nothing\" to be God's attribute but not have God be an attribute of nothing. Nothing can only exist in relation to something else or else nothing won't be nothing. Somebody got to observe nothing. That's the most blasphemous thing that I could say to a Monistic believer, a hardcore Platonist. They don't believe in the \"first cause\", they hate the stuff Saint Augustine had came up with. In one hand they believe in the soul but in another, reject the Christian God. They reject the attributes of God to be logical because of their presuppositions in Monism. To the believers of the Monad (not the Mithraic, Zoroastrian bastardization of \"Gnosticism\"), they have a problem with Christian Theodicy. The LaRouche people are not hardcore Platonists, they are humanists, but they do know Gottfried Leibniz and Johannes Kepler believed in God and defended Him. Some concepts of Monism are applied to the Christian God, but some are not. Depending on how \"strict\" of a Platonist one is, the answer to the question varies. A hardcore Platonist will not mix Christianity with Monism, and a hardcore Christian will not mix Monism with Christianity. I am a Christian Platonist in the sense that I'm also a Calvinist but I don't take away from Christianity nor add to Christianity, rather, being aware of its (Plato's philosophy) similarities to Christianity. Isaiah 45:7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things. The fool who seeks to merge philosophy with Christianity will corrupt both sides and have neither.\n\nHere's Ken L. Wheeler's free article about Monism: <a href=\"http://nikonfocus.com/indefinite.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Indefinite Dyad in Plotinus‚Äô Metaphysics &amp; Mysticism: Uncovering the Meaning of the Attribute of the One in Greek &amp; Indian Monism</a>.\n\nüí´<strong>Prima Scriptura, Sola Scriptura and Sola Ecclesia Jul 1, 2016 @ 04:46</strong>\n\nHere's an article I've found that might help explain some things that I've somewhat failed in explaining: <a href=\"http://designofprovidence.blogspot.com/2011/07/prima-scriptura-sola-scriptura-and-sola.html\" target=\"_blank\">Prima Scriptura, Sola Scriptura and Sola Ecclesia</a><blockquote>Does the belief in prima scriptura inevitably lead one to believe either in sola scriptura or sola ecclesia?</blockquote>\n\nFirst, let's define some terms:\n\nPrima Scriptura is the name given by many as a counter for sola scriptura. The idea is that while scripture is not the sole rule of faith in the church, it is the primary authority. It refers to the primacy of scripture, or that scripture is primary among traditions and ecclesiastical decisions, although those also carry some authority alongside scripture. This teaching stems from the idea that when the apostles founded the church, they left a conglomerate of teachings, both written and unwritten, and the written portion became scripture. Therefore, while there are traditions and extra-biblical beliefs, scripture is still held the highest among them. However, because it is believed that scripture, traditions and church authority all come from the same source (that is, Christ and the apostles), they all carry varying degrees of importance.\n\nOne perspective on this, from the Eastern Orthodox church, writes:<blockquote>The Church recognizes one and only one source of authority for Her faith and practice: the apostolic tradition. The Divine Scriptures are part - albeit the most important part - of that tradition. To set Scriptures up as something over and apart from tradition is to have the tail wagging the dog. [pg. 135-136. Carlton, Clark. The Way: What Every Protestant Should Know About the Orthodox Church. Salisbury: Regina Orthodox Press, 1997.]</blockquote>\n\nSola Ecclesia is a nickname roughly translated as \"church alone.\" It refers to a doctrine that teaches the church is the sole authority and rule of faith, and all is decided through the ecclesiastical body. One can see the more extreme and blatant versions of it in cults such as Mormonism or the Jehovah's Witnesses, where the teachings of the group itself trump whatever scripture might have to say. So much so, in fact, that in some situations new scripture is added (as in Mormonism) or the very words of scripture are changed to suit the group's theology (as in the Jehovah's Witnesses and their New World Translation).\n\nSola Scriptura is the Reformation-era name for the doctrine of \"scripture alone.\" We must immediately point out here that the most common straw man presented of sola scriptura is of an Evangelical pastor beating his Bible and saying, \"This is all you need!\" This is not the case, however. Scripture alone does not mean scripture isolated or scripture by itself, which some scholars (such as Keith Mathison in his work The Spirit of Sola Scriptura) have referred to jestingly as \"solo scriptura.\" Sola scriptura acknowledges the presence and permits the use of history, language, contextual study, patristics and scholars. However, what it does teach is that all of this is held to the standard of scripture and scripture alone. The writings of godly theologians, the decisions of councils, and traditions claimed to have been passed down through the ages - while not necessarily useless in and of themselves - do not get to trump the writings of scripture. God's word has the final say.\n\nNow that we have established these terms, we return to our question: does prima scriptura inevitably lead one to follow sola scriptura or sola ecclesia? Long ago I made this chart to try to explain this further:<img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3r26exnc81w/ThvMTBe2lOI/AAAAAAAABeY/wyUq1nKY7qs/s1600/Prima+Scriptura+Train.jpg\" alt=\"\" />The line of thinking is this: you start out with the presupposition of Prima Scriptura. So far so good. Now let's say you bring in a tradition, doctrine or belief. Do we have a question regarding its validity? If no, there is nothing to worry about. Some things, such as the existence of a historical Christ or how many disciples there were, may not have any need to be questioned.\n\nLet us say, however, that we have something worth asking a question about. We'll take, as an example, the teaching of the repose and later bodily assumption of the Virgin Mary (which I've touched on in greater detail <a href=\"http://designofprovidence.blogspot.com/2011/03/assumption-of-mary-reviewed.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). The next question we must ask: is it able to be proven by scripture? In the case of the bodily assumption of Mary, the quick answer is no, it cannot be. The next question must be: is this an issue? If one answers No, for the church has spoken and thus it is so, then they are followers of sola ecclesia, for they are following church authority over scriptural authority. If they answer Yes, and so it cannot be part of our infallible rule of worship or faith, then they are following sola scriptura, for they are appealing to the authority of scripture.\n\nMany might protest this example, because scripture is only silent about the bodily assumption of Mary and not exactly (though somewhat) contrary to it. Therefore, I will move on to another example: the celibacy of the clergy. In Roman Catholicism, priests and bishops are celibate in toto, whereas in Eastern Orthodoxy (and some other forms of Eastern Christianity) priests may be married provided they were married before ordination (after which they must be celibate) while all bishops must be celibate.\n\nNow let us apply this same flow of thinking as before: is this mode of clerical celibacy affirmed by scripture? The answer, again, is no: Paul writes in Titus 1:5-6 that elders (or priests) can be married and have children; Paul likewise writes in 1 Timothy 3:2 that overseers (or bishops) can be married, and even says in verses 4-5 that one sign they are fit for their post is that their family household is in good order. He even records in 1 Corinthians 9:5 that James, Peter and other apostles, most of them considered to be bishops in \"apostolic\" churches, had wives. Now we must ask how we respond to this in light of the church tradition. If we say This is of no concern, the church has chosen in her prudence to instill this form of celibacy, then we are falling into sola ecclesia. If, however, we say This is of concern, for it contradicts the words of Paul, therefore this tradition must be thrown out, then we are following sola scriptura.\n\nIn both these situations, the tradition, belief or doctrine actually overrides the authority of scripture. Though many might protest this and assure us that the church is merely \"interpreting\" scripture, or that they are just enacting something in the prudence of time, the fact remains that the authority to change this is coming only from the church, and is bypassing the word of God. Even if one were to argue that the church is sourced to God as well, this only invites the problem of God contradicting Himself - first through the infallible words of scripture, then through the infallible council of the church. Infallible sources cannot be contradictory to one another.\n\nThis is why when one argues that elevating church authority or the authority of tradition does not negate the primary authority of scripture, they are merely not following this doctrine through to its logical conclusion. If in the end church authority has the final say, even in contradiction to the teachings of scripture, then who has the true authority? I write this not only with Roman Catholics or Eastern Orthodox in mind, but likewise Protestants and even groups such as Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses. If your church believes something, and yet you can find nothing in scripture to verify it - in fact it contradicts scripture - and yet you defend it with The church declares it to be, therefore it must be so, how much weight are you then placing upon the scriptures? At this point it is revealed that your church's authority has the true power, and scripture is simply given a ceremonial nod. Note that I am not arguing for a kind of \"ecclesiastical anarchy\" here - church authority in and of itself is not bad. However, if we place authority upon the church that supersedes scripture and permits it to contradict scripture, then we have usurped the authority of God's word. It would be no different than permitting Congress the ability to contradict the Constitution for some superficial reason similar to \"both Congress and the Constitution are sourced to the Founding Fathers.\"\n\nI exhort any one reading this post to understand the importance of the authority of God's word. Christ Himself responded to all exhortations from the Pharisees, scribes, lawyers - even the devil himself - by going to the word of God. Evil was met every time with \"it is written.\" As God said through the prophet Isaiah: \"If they do not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn\" (Isa 8:20). If you encounter anyone or any group which works against the word of God - whether intentional or unintentional - seek to correct them, or, if this proves impossible, depart from them, just as the apostle Paul warned the Roman Christians to turn away from those teaching doctrines contrary to the Gospel (cf. Rom 16:17). Paul was so adamant about preserving the word of God, in fact, that he stated even an apostle or angel of God could be considered anathema for preaching a contrary gospel (Gal 1:8-9). Scripture is our highest authority because it comes from God, and with God we can find no other higher authority.\n\nI write this post not as an immediate call for repentance, but as a chance to ponder on these things. God bless.\n\nüí´<strong>Take your daily bread pills Jul 3, 2016 @ 09:00</strong>\n\nSome things are caused by sheer stupidity. I had been a victim of my own stupidity, but it's not good to see many people, people who call themselves Christians, fall for <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-error-of-solo-scriptura/\" target=\"_blank\">The Error of Solo Scriptura</a> and/or the <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/unscientific-method/\" target=\"_blank\">Unscientific Method</a>, which one is \"red pilled\" while the other is \"blue pilled\", and some take both which in between red and blue, another primary color of green comes out which is the \"green pill\" that thinks that they're above the deceptions of religious and government propaganda and knows the true interpretations of both extremes of seemingly different fields of mindsets yet having a common denominator, yet they find themselves usually stuck in the many layered controlled alternative media web of lies of various mindsets. Those three pills are the most basic of mindsets which a truth seeker deals with. Many things, including math and science, are full of dogmas. Besides the articles in the category of \"Therapeuo\", they're in the \"Dogma\" category. Doctrines are not necessarily bad, but many things concering what is the truth is so very hard to discern. It took me awhile to find retroductive reasoning (the methodology Plato uses, AKA: Socratic Method, not to be confused with abductive reasoning though it's similar to it) which I feel is the basis behind Presuppositional Apologetics and the reductio ad absurdum argumentation that it utilizes although that is generally using deductive rather than retroductive reasoning. I've come to really understand exegesis and eisegesis instead of trying to define and describe a concept that I though didn't exist as a word in previous articles. Words that describes something specific is what is useful to the truther, for in less, they can share more. I know slightly less now, but what I know is a more refined, purified concentration of knowledge. Knowing what are the lies does not mean you know the truth, and I know lots of lies. I call them my personal logical fallacies. Knowing what is the truth would in turn push a top down, retroductive perspective which you can then discern lower emanations of truths mixed with lies the the closer you are to the Absolute.\n\n\"Red pilled\" so called Christian truthers pick and choose literalism and allegorical interpretations of the bible in which they get some things more right, but some other things are terribly wrong eisegesis. Some example are about the flat earth + dome theory, Solo Scriptura, Nephilim/Ancient Aliens theory, etc. \"Blue pilled\" so called Christians (usually not truthers) put an overemphasis in Aristotelian academic appeal for approved authority like pushing GMOs, being theistic evolutionists, rejecting evidence for Geocentricity, rejecting evidence for TCM and Homeopathy, rejecting evidence for Young Earth Creation, rejecting the Electric Universe theory, rejecting evidence against Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, rejecting evidence of the benefits of Patriarchy over Matriarchy, rejecting evidence of networking to achieve crimes against humanity (the essense of conspiracy theories), parroting what they were told to parrot as the truth regardless of what others tell them. Red pilled and blue pilled Chrisitans had both been guilty of parroting, both of them are guilty for being Aristotelian, both are guilty for being manipulated by Jews, both are guilty for being duped. Green pilled Christians generally fall for the same Aristotelian garbage of relative truths, but they seek after occulted truths which they might get some, but still are very ignorant for they don't know much about Plato in contrast to Aristotle. They also go to spiritual churches that's more blasphemous than Oneness Pentecostals like the \"New Apostolic Reformation\". Such churches are really covert white witch covens indoctrinated in a dangerous cult. If they continue outside of the green pill, they go down to the black pill of nihilism and the fringe of the fringe, things that red, blue, and green pills avoid admitting concerning Christianity. Remember, this analogy concerns with Christianity first and foremost.\n\nBlack pilled Christians just don't know anything, they only know what they think are lies through their senses and experiments. They search and search with no breakthrough. They go in and out of cults, they seek to merit salvation because they think Calvinism is an \"easy path\" yet they can't believe that to believe in Jesus Christ with everything they got is something that God chooses people to be able to truly believe to begin with. They realize that they never were Christians to begin with which no matter what works that they had done, it didn't mean anything in the end because its base structure is built on lies. One of their all time favorite conspiracies is the Saturnalian theory that everything's \"Saturn\"/Satan, including Christianity. In one sense, they are close, but not really. It's a rehashed version of the Babylonian cult theory but with more Saturn, more fringe science, more fringe evolution theories which this video sums up the \"scientific\" side of it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vHpUs6_-zI\" target=\"_blank\">Human Origin, Purple Dawn &amp; Saturn Theory. All Parts.</a> They believe in the Electric Universe theory AND Quantum Mechanics, both diametrically opposed to each other. All the while, they believe in the Mandela effect and reality warping to be done by high level demons even though there's a perfectly logical explanation to the changing of words which is mostly explained as a trick from those that control the media (even the search engines) to removing certain things from being mentioned while saying them in slightly different ways. The Star Wars francise does this often, but it's also done in many things from books, diapers, movies, TV shows, even the bible (even the King James Bibles based on the Cambridge version). It wouldn't surprise me if there's tampering of source texts (which is done in the Septuagint, Masoretic Text, Majority Text, Dead Sea Scrolls). The changes within different KJV bibles are its spelling of the words. I suspect American English has its premise in the KJB-PCE which removes English spellings and some \"archaic\" spellings like colour to color, musick to music. Though most blue pilled and green pilled Christians know of the Mandela effect, red pilled Christians deny the explanations given by psychologists yet they don't address such things to begin with, usually oblivious to what's really going on. They do the same trick with news articles as well. To what benefit that this serves? If people can't trust their own memories, they can't trust anything while the media reports fake news while burying real news by real people. A black pilled Christian has an open mind and a void in his heart: nothing stays within his mind nor his heart, it all falls out too quickly by others.\n\nIf God willing, He might change the heart of the black pilled Chrisitan to be able to truly believe in Jesus for once in his life, and also be able to disern in a higher level he never been able to do before. IQ has little to do with having a better mindset in your path, for there's many deep thinkers, yet are stuck in bad mindsets. You would be able to actually understand that it's okay to not understand something about the bible because of cultural differences or of its mystical allegorical nature. it's okay to not know what it means all the time, and it's okay to be on the safe side by not claiming to know what it means by slapping a concrete definition. Some mindsets can be wrong, some things the bible says in an scientific outlook can be wrong like the myth that longer hair equals to fertility which they had believed in but you didn't know because of a lack of historical, cultural context. I'm only a geocentrist because of evidence weighing towards geocentricity more than \"heliocentricity\" while modern scientists no longer are \"heliocentric\" since stars are in a moving galaxy which are in a super cluster which there are many of them, which that initial release of energy into existence from the \"center of the universe\" is still flowing in the universe. Nothing is completely \"at rest\", for it means the complete decay of atoms (there's no \"subatomic\" particles maybe besides protons and neutrons, not completely sure yet) into pure kinetic energy being released from all that energy that it took to create matter from creation itself. If a falling apple were to have a full energetic rest once it hit the ground, it would be a nuclear explosion to say the least. Light is not matter, but it's either coherent or incoherent. Gravity is incorerent magnetism and is dielectric acceleration due to inertia.\n\nAnyways, for now, I'm a geocentrist but that doesn't mean that I don't believe that the sun is the cause of elliptical orbits as Kepler preferred over using circles within circles which Brahe preferred. The bible had literal interpretations that are scientifically proven like the currents of the oceans, unicorns (extinct single horned rhino species), dragons (used before the word: \"dinosaurs\" were used), historical proof of God stopping the motion of the heavens, the great deluge, Noah's ark, Sodom and Gommorah, the real location of Mount Sinai, how there were giant people before and after the flood genetically (not spiritually demons), the hydroplate theory, how there's water beneath the mantle, and many more. I don't think that there are any physical membranes or a covering surrounding the earth above the sky which I allegorically accept and I assume that it may had existed pre flood but not post flood but King David and many more still had that old world view about windows of heaven and such to be literal. Many Christian creationists over did it concerning what is above the sky but below heaven, pushed literalism into the territory of eisegesis. I do think that some subspecies of humans (people give birth to people, rabbits give birth to rabbits, there's no transistory common ancestors) had remnant DNA of the pre flood people that was generally between two races, one being of Seth, another being of Cain. I would be cautious to attribute them with say Cro-Magnon to be of Seth and Neanderthal to be of Cain. It's a bit foolish to attempt to unite history with genetics since human populations move here and there, take out natives or intermarries between them. In recent memory, do we attribute race into three major categories being caucasoid, mongoloid, negroid and attributed to Japheth, Shem, and Ham. We don't know what the skeletons were, but we do know that there is no common denominator link between different \"kinds\" of anything, rather, it is assumed to exist by faith in evolutionists. Global warming or cooling has nothing to do with the book of Revelation, but a lack of understanding in the Electric Universe theory, how the sun is actually hollow, how hot and cool spots in the galaxy can affect the luminosity of the sun, how the sun affects the planets electrically, how the earth heats up whenever the sun gets colder in cycles of \"mini\" ice ages.\n\nWhat is then the \"bread pill\"? It is not how to become a Christian, it is not how to be saved, it is not how to find purpose, it is not how to discern \"as\" a Christian, it is not just to be in a relationship with God (everybody is, but most people are in a bad relationship), it is not just to negate being separated from God by sin which is by definition, separation, it is not to be right or wrong, it is not about reading the bible daily, it has nothing to do with Platonism and Aristotelianism, it is not being dipped under water, it is not the traditions nor its doctrines, it is not about life or death, it is not presuppositional. It is to become a Christian, it is to be save, it is to find purpose, it is to discern being Christian, it is to be in a good relationship with God, it is to negate being separated from God through Jesus Christ, it is to try to be right but not wrong also, it is a principle found in reading and understanding the bible, it is not about the ancient religion of monism, it is to die for God who is the Absolute Truth, it is more than traditions and doctrines, it is above life and death, it is Theosis. Oh boy, not another Orthodox Christian word, am I a Orthodox Christian now? Of course not. Though I like Prima Scriptura, I like Sola Scriptura more while I dislike Sola Ecclesia. Theosis is another \"middle ground\" word that's neither explicitly Catholic nor Protestant. Also, greek words for some reason, feel more specific than say \"Sanctification\". Theosis makes more sense than saying \"Sanctification\". Theosis is not Henosis, neither is it Theurgy nor Hypostases, you don't become like gods. From \"Theology and Mysticism in the Tradition of the Eastern Church\", in The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, pages 8‚Äì9, 39, 126, 133, 154, 196. (and Wikipedia):<blockquote>Theosis has three stages: first, the purgative way, purification, or katharsis; second, illumination, the illuminative way, the vision of God, or theoria; and third, sainthood, the unitive way, or theosis. Thus the term \"theosis\" describes the whole process and its objective. By means of purification a person comes to theoria and then to theosis. Theosis is the participation of the person in the life of God. According to this doctrine, the holy life of God, given in Jesus Christ to the believer through the Holy Spirit, is expressed through the three stages of theosis, beginning in the struggles of this life, increasing in the experience of knowledge of God, and consummated in the resurrection of the believer, when the victory of God over fear, sin, and death, accomplished in the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, is made manifest in the believer forever.</blockquote>\n\nSome people would then think that I'm for the monastic life, which monasticism was banned by Martin Luther, a former Augustinian monk. Vows are not done to attain salvation, therefore, it's not a sin to end vows when it's done with a false premise. Many people don't know what is the purpose of vows but that is for another article. I really think that if Eastern Orthodoxy got rid of traditions that violates Sola Scriptura, many of its clear greek wording could be salvaged. The way Protestants describe things are usually done in descriptive languages that likes to describe things but not give denotative explanations for as a prime directive to seek crystal clear understanding. English is perfect for avoiding plainess of speech, parresia. \"Difficult\" specific words are not the words that we use by default as elementary words which is \"dumbed down\". In the end, this verty article is \"Dogma\", and I might change my mind or make another attempt to describe my ramblings. \"Sanctification\" defined by Presbyterians, Calvinists, and Reformed Christians is Theosis, just without the baggage that comes with Eastern Orthodoxy. However, Presbyterians and Calvinists for some stupid reason, do infant baptism, that stupid reason is tradition, purely Sola Ecclesia, because John Calvin doesn't speak against it for it became a sort of replacement of the deprecated, unredemptive barbaric practice of circumcision.\n\nI know enough to have \"discernment\". Why? I know enough to know that I need to learn more, but the truth is so simple. Acts 16:31, yet another verse many Christians dislike because they don't know what it really means to \"believe\" since they had casually forgotten Romans 3.

Some ancient religions worth mentioning had some monistic qualities, whether it was Egyptian, Indian, or Greek, they had held a common denominator. At a certain point, they come to the conclusion that there is a body and there is a soul which comes from \"The One\". The body is not the soul, the body exists outside of the soul but the soul \"exists\" not within the body.

The Sanchi and Bharut inscriptions (aka the Pillar edicts) unquestionably dated to the middle of the second century B.C.E. push the composition of the 5 Nikayas back to a earlier date by mentioning the word \"pa√±canekayika\" (Five Nikyas), thereby placing the Nikayas as put together (NO LATER THAN) at a period about half way between the death of the Buddha and the accession of Asoka (before 265 B.C.), as such the 5 Nikayas, the earliest existing texts of Buddhism, must have been well known and well established far earlier than generally perceived. Finally proving the majority of the five Nikayas could not have been composed any later than the very earliest portion of the third century B.C.E., and most likely prior to this date as well.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOMgzn2Vrc0\" target=\"_blank\">Anatta / Anatman Part 3 Section 1 Main contents. Original Buddhism's doctrine.</a>\nUploaded on Feb 9, 2012\nWhat has Buddhism to say of the Self? \"That's not my Self\" (na me so atta); and the term \"non Self-ishness\" (anatta) are predicated of the world and all \"things\" (sabbe dhamma anatta); identical with the Brahmanical \"of those who are mortal, there is no Self/Soul\", (anatma hi martyah), [SB., II. 2. 2. 3]). [KN J-1441] \"The Soul is the refuge that I have gone unto\". For anatta is not said of the Self/Soul but what it is not. There is never a 'doctrine of no-Soul', but a doctrine of what the Soul (The Self) is not (form is anatta, feelings are anatta, etc.). It cannot be denied that what is anatta is indeed the mere and petty self for [SN 3.196], and countless other passages, the mere self of psycho-physicality is = anatta = khandhas; that same self which the disciple is instructed to have his will/mind/spirit (ctta) reject in the face of illumination and insight.\n\nThe 'reflexive position' fallacy taken by illogical modern 'Buddhism' proclaims the Pali term Attan (Skt. Atman, Self) to be merely a reflexive term meaning \"oneself, himself, herself\", however the reflexive and empirical mere self is, regardless of translation, \"anatta\" i.e. \"na me so atta\" (not my Soul), or also \"eso khandhassa na me so atta\" (these aggregates [forms, feelings, perceptions, experiences, consciousness =mere self] are no the Self, the Soul). As pertains the reflexive self, of who proclaim \"myself, himself, herself\" we are referring to \"that person so-and-so (Larry, Sue, etc.)\", the empirical and psycho-physical (namo-rupa) self of blood and sinew which is \"doomed to fall into the grave at long last\", the very same self the poetic dead are said to cry out to the living \"what you are, we (the dead) once were,. what we are you shall be!\". Even more illogical is the double standard of commentarialist and sectarian 'Buddhists' who desire anatta to mean 'no-Soul' as well as atta to mean simply 'myself, himself, herself'; wherein illogically atta in the adjective anatta is, to their ignorant minds = Soul ('no-soul'), but atta in standalone = 'myself'. As illogical an end result, modern Buddhism has proclaimed atta (atman/soul) = anatta (not-atman)! Its quite hard to fathom any position more senseless than this, however this is one of the countless reasons modern 'Buddhism' is illogical without end. However doctrinally and logically so, what IS anatta (the five psycho-physical aggregates of the mere empirical, corporeal self) are indeed 'myself', in so meaning the mortal (mata) self composed of the bodily humors which is fated to death. That mere self is never implied nor meant when Buddhism speaks of immortality and the path leading to same (amatagamimagga) [SN 5.9], of which \"the body cannot pass that gate to fare beyond,..only the Soul (The Self)\" -Udana\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPZLSrfgimc\" target=\"_blank\">Original Buddhism in Gotama's own words. Or, there is no Pali term for buddhism, monk etc.</a>\nUploaded on Feb 9, 2012\n\"my teachings are (to be called) Brahmayana (path to the Absolute/Brahman)\" SN 5.5\n\nThis video is an introduction to what 'buddhism' was in the eyes and words of Gotama; namely that there is NO Pali term for \"buddhism\" , nor for \"monk/nun\", and that Gotama called his followers Brahmins and himself a Vedagu (expert/sage in the Vedas).\n\n\"I have NOT taught a new path followers, only discovered a long lost path (and reclaimed it)\"- Udana\n\n\"It is a heresy to say (of myself, Gotama) that I have taught a new teaching, a new path, something novel\" - Digha1\n\nThe single most philosophically important passage in all buddhist doctrine [MN 1.436]:-\n\"Whatever form, feelings, perceptions, experiences, or consciousness there is (the five aggregates), these he sees to be without permanence, as suffering, as ill, as a plague, a boil, a sting, a pain, an affliction, as foreign, as otherness, as empty (su√±√±ato), as Selfless (anattato). So he turns his mind/will/spirit (citta, Non-aggregate) away from these; therein he gathers his citta (nous/spirit/mind) within the realm of Immortality (amataya dhatuya). This is tranquility; this is that which is the most excellent!\" [MN 1.436]\n\nIt is of course true that the Buddha denied the existence of the mere empirical \"self\" in the very meaning of \"my-self\" (this person so-and-so, namo-rupa, an-atta), one might say in accordance with the command 'denegat seipsum, [Mark VII.34]; but this is not what our writers (above) mean to say, or are understood by their readers to say; what they mean to say is that the Buddha denied the immortal (amata), the unborn (ajata) and Supreme-Self (mahatta') of the Upanishads. And that is palpably false, for he frequently speaks of this Self, or Spirit (mahapurisha), and nowhere more clearly than in the too often repeated formula 'na me so atta', \"This/these are not my Soul\" (na me so atta'= anatta/anatman), excluding body (rupa) and the components of empirical consciousness (vinnana/ nama), a statement to which the words of Sankhara are perculiary apposite, \"Whenever we deny something unreal, is it in reference to something real\"[Br. Sutra III.2.22]. It was not for the Buddha but for the nihilist (natthika) to deny the Soul! \"Nihilists (natthiko) [those who deny the Soul] go to terrible hell\"[SN 1.96].\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZedR37QRcMA\" target=\"_blank\">Tathagata, its genuine meaning/translation. Original Buddhism disected for the truth-seeker</a>\nUploaded on Feb 9, 2012\nThe term Tathagata is composed of two parts, Tat, and agata. Tat has been since time immemorial in India, meant Brahman, the Absolute, as in the famous Upanishadic dictum: \"That (Brahman) thou art\" (tat tvam asi). \"That\" is here, of course Brahman, the Godhead, the Subject of Selfhood which the muni, or sage, has reached at the pinnacle of his having fulfilled wisdom's perfection. Agata is the past tense denotation of gata (going, traveling, trekking), here being meant \"arrival, gone-unto, attainment of, arrival-at\". As such, Tathagata in the ancient Prakrit Pali, is meant literally \"(The sage who has) arrived at the Absolute\", or in Sramanic context of Vedanta and Buddhism, \"(He-thou) is (arrived at) That\". The very term Tathagata, which has of yet never been discovered by anyone until now, is none other than a personal appellation of that very rare someone who has realized by wisdom \"tat tvam asi\". The Tathagata, therefore, is equally as well meant \"The 'tat tvam asi' comprehensor/sage\". It is unfathomable that modern so-called Buddhism's position is that the spiritual appellation of the Buddha's attainment, \"attained/arrived at Brahman\" (Tathagata) is merely an honorary designation for a popular sage. As [It 57] and other passages clearly show, \"become-Brahman\" is the meaning of the term Tathagata, or he who has arrived (agata), again being meant the transfiguration and assimilation of the mind (citta) in upon itself (bhava), and thereby achieving the Absolute, i.e. Brahman, as such (brahmabhutam tathagata) is said. To say that Tathagata, is meant by nonsensical \"Buddhism\", to the effect: that Tathagata denotes the \"thus-come one\", or \"thus-gone one\" has no contextual validity, is utterly illogical to read Pali as such, and carries no meaning whatsoever, which is all the more so magnified given that the very term Tathagata carries, regardless of translation, a very weighty importance and denotation; thereby secular 'Buddhism' intends to castrate the meaning of the term Tathagata, is yet another resection of original Buddhism by modern sects to turn Buddhism into a moralistic movement devoid of metaphysics.\n\nScriptural collaboration of same: (Tathagatassa hetam, adhivacanam brahmabhuto itipi)-\"The Tathagata means 'the body of Brahman', 'become Brahman'\" [DN 3.84].\n(brahmabhutam tathagata)-\"Become-Brahman is the meaning of Tathagata\" [It 57]. Many more such passages are preset in suttana.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqTXx7m9j4\" target=\"_blank\">Citta / Mind / Spirit in earliest Original Buddhism.

Citta is the only thing which is differentiated from the five aggregates (rupa/vedana/sanna/sankhara/vinnana): \"Whatever form, feelings, perceptions, experiences, or consciousness there is (the five aggregates), these he sees to be without permanence, as suffering, as ill, as a plague, a boil, a sting, a pain, an affliction, as foreign, as otherness, as empty (su√±√±ato), as Selfless (anattato).

It is to the Spirit (Skt.

I don't know if there's more hybrid languages out there than Hebrew itself that had mixed the languages of their host, and be everywhere in the extent of the Jews. This isn't quite the same as \"dialect\", since the Jews never had a permanent place to call home for a very long time for it is in their very nature, similar to gypsies, to roam in the desert, but they had made self victimization their religion as Zionism and Jewish Secular Identity which is not based on a Jew's personal religous preference, but in forcing \"Jew\" in the same level as a biological race despite DNA tests disproving otherwise. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Jewish_languages\" target=\"_blank\">Template:Jewish languages</a> <a href=\"http://www.jewish-languages.org/languages.html\" target=\"_blank\">Languages - Jewish Language Research Website</a>\n\nFrom <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jewish_diaspora_languages\" target=\"_blank\">List of Jewish diaspora languages</a> reformatted:<blockquote>Afro-Asiatic languages:\n1.

I wouldn't want to call the Jewish languages as mere dialects since it's much more than just mere pronunciation. English based creole and English based pidgin languages are aplenty. That being said, the various Jewish languages are not creole nor pidgin which I think the reason that being is that it is not the host nation's language, but the parasitic people's language that just took on a different form, while there wasn't a global council to decide what would be the standard, so it's not a deviation from the biblical Hebrew, rather, it's the nature of the parasitic culture's parasitic language to be ever changing. Since there is an illegal, unbiblical State of Israel and \"standard\" modern Hebrew, then why isn't the other Hebrew hybrid languages become lowered to creole or pidgin status? I assume that it is because they don't want to call their brothers \"wrong\" that these parasitic hybrid languages are treated as a legitimate language since Hebrew itself was a borrowed language by the Israelites and the Judahites before proselytes took over the Judahites' place as a religion without biblical authority even by Old Testament standards to be deemed cursed by God which was reaffirmed by Jesus via \"Synagogue of Satan\" of those who call themselves Judahites yet they are not, while God \"replaced\" flesh and blood Israel for spiritual Israel of God through Abraham's Seed (singular) that is Jesus who is the savior that came from the royal line of Judah. No other Judahites can claim to be king, for Jesus is alive, and the Roman government legally declared him the King of the Judahites while King Herod's dynasty is rejected since they were Edomites anyways. All languages come from somewhere, that's a given. However, what I'm trying to convey is the differences between an empire that spreads their languages in nations that they control which those peoples had adopted as creole or pidgin languages and a parasitic group of people that go to many nations which they had adopted the host nation's languages to be a part of their own language, exclusive to their own kind but not to their host nations' peoples. I haven't seen much people explain the nature of a parasitic language, nor explain that the Jews have a parasitic language either as I have just done, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong places, or I'm completely right about this.\n\nüí´<strong>Just a reminder 7 Jul 7, 2016 @ 00:00</strong>\n\nPractically all of Eastern Philosophy has its ties to Abraham, the Israelites, the Judahites, and the Synagogue of Satan that had adopted the sins of the Judahites' false demonic religion perfected in Neo Babylon of the culmination of all of their idol worship behind the veil throughout history recorded in the Old Testament and expressed through the Apocryphal fable books created by the Rabbinic Sanhedrin. Boycott Whole Foods, don't trust USDA certification, 50% GMOs are considered \"organic\", seek to grow your own food if you can. Before there was nothing, God had existed forever. The majority of antibiotic drugs that a scribe prescribes to you are made from a substance created by fungus which has its many variants called penicillin which fungi always beats bacteria. Antibiotics are not antiviral. Antibiotics destroys your gut bacteria so replenish your guts with good bacteria after using antibiotics. Most antibiotics are useless and weak these days, something might be wrong with the newer batches or they might be dilluting it or some other unexplained reason. Strong petrolchemical synthetic antibiotic prescription medications are useful in specific situations, but natural antibiotics and antiviral cures are trending because of the failure of modern medicine being rotten at its core due to too big to fall private foreign corporations seeking to kill off most of humanity. As long as there's private bankers that controls the sovereign banks of the nations through their central banks, it doesn't matter if you use silver or gold or even bitcoins, the stocks can be manipulated to make those that have lots of gold to pay in a metal that they have the least amount in whether it be copper, platinum, silver, it doesn't matter. The BRICS system is against such forms of monetarism from the cult of Apollo which the Rothschilds took up the mantle of where the Venetians had left off. Unless a nation controls their own money while funding infrastructure, higher forms of energy, and innovations like the Hamilton credit system or what Kennedy had done in backing up NASA which in turn the inventions created made spin off companies and products that benefits American ecomony, it won't function properly through Austrian Economics which will be the end of America that seeks its own destruction into feudalism that values lesser, simpler things that keeps the people into a new dark age that doesn't know the things that real humanists had taught. This website called: <a href=\"http://48laws-of-power.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The 48 Laws of Power</a> is a very evil website, yet I think it's helpful for some people who need some ideas or some exposure to how successful power hungry people think.\n\nüí´<strong>Conclusions 1 Jul 9, 2016 @ 19:22</strong>\n\nI will try to summarize everything on my website. This is just the first attempt. Maybe 6 to 18 months from now I would make another attempt.\n\nThe Absolutes concerning the beauty of everything can be known retroductively. Retroductive reasoning as described by Plato is superior to abductive reasoning, deductive reasoning, and inductive reasoning in finding Absolutes. There is only two religions that uses retroductive reasoning completely: the ancient Monism that existed in Egypt, India, and Greece, and Presuppositionalism (the purest form of Christianity), based off of Presuppositional Apologetics but affecting the Reformed Christian Systematic Theology to be able to have an epistemological, retroductive (via principle of non-contradiction) explanation of everything and be able to correct canons and doctrines that are formulated by traditions without epistemological interpretations of ontological evidence, traditional ontological \"evidence\" that isn't compatible to justified true belief (knowledge) from biblical exegesis. Monism gives an ontological retroductive explanation of reality while Presuppositionalism gives an epistemological retroductive explanation of reality, although they use deductive reasoning more often than retroductive reasoning. Mysticism had corrupted Monism and Christianity into something unrecognizable prior to their corruption. To a Presuppositionalist, Monism is probably the most deceptive non Christian religion out there, so close, yet corrupt from its \"source\" of there belief that there's no need for a \"first cause\", nothing creates nothing, counterspace creates space which is a loss of inertia, while Presuppositionalists refute that nothing can't exist without God that is everything which from God. The religion of real Humanists is inspired by the writings of Monists but they don't necessarily know what is Monism.\n\nMysticism, materialism, the no soul doctrine, Empiricism, Atomism (AKA: Quantum Physics and General Relativity), and anything else that comes out of the worshipers of Zeus (the Olympians/Venetians) and Kronos (the Jews/Phoenicians[white Israelite-Canaanite sea faring people and white Canaanite sea faring people]) holds the purest form of the cancer of evil that merely moved to another place after the great deluge and had spread throughout the whole world. Many nations are made and destroyed under the same cult from Babylon which had infected many with great delusions that both true Christians and Monists/Humanists are against. It had infected the Aztec Empire in the Americas, the Picts in the Albion Isles, but its greatest manifestation was revitalized by the very Jews that destroyed the Neo-Babylonian/Chaldean Empire and had destroyed Persian, the Greeks, and the Romans through Mithraism which in its esoteric form (though already being an esoteric mystery religion) had destroyed original Buddhism of its Monistic beliefs into what is now called esoteric Buddhism. The cult of Dionysus/Isis, Mithraism, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Cabalism, dualistic Gnosticism, Rabbinism, Zurvanism all spawned from the \"East\" but only two forms of this cancer against humanity is perpertuated by Jews and Venetians through its many proxies. Some of their inspiration unfortunately comes from the Old Testament outside of the context of the New Testament, not knowing the hardened, uncircumcised hearts of the Israelites and the Judahites. Christianity was corrupted immediately after the death of the apostles in the Post Apostolic Church, while the corrupted Roman Empire merged with the corrupted form of Christianity into the Roman Catholic Church, infiltrated by the Jews and the Venetians, as well as the Byzantine Empire. The Jews controling the Vatican made the religion of Islam, revitalizing Selene and Aphrodite worship which existed prior to Abram leaving India, and Misraim/Egypt before settling in the land of Canaan. The B'nai B'rith recreated Islam to be a tool of the British Empire. The Venetians took over the Byzantine Empire and had their own empire before transfering into the City of London as the British East India Company through the help of their Jewish friends which the Venetians were partially mixed with Jewish blood since Venice used to be a Jewish state.\n\nThe British Empire is a union of the Jews, the Normans, the Druidic Picts and Phoenicians that came to Albion Isles before the Roman Empire had, Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, Knights Templar, SMOM knights/Knights Hospitallers, Jesuits, the Black Nobility/Venetian-Genoese royal bloodlines, the Rothschilds, and last but not least, the Anglo-Saxons that used to rule England. The Papal powers were removed through the controlled opposition Protestant Reformation but it is an insult to call Espicolicans/Anglicans and the Shakers/Quakers \"Christian\" since they were used much more than Lutherans, Calvinists, Presbyterians, and Baptists as they were persecuted under Catholic Bloody Mary Stuart, Anglican King James Stuart VI/I, and Shaking Quaker Oliver Cromwell which brought in much more Jews into England and he militarized the Quakers. The bible of the Reformation cannot be the Douai-Rheims bible, neither the King James Bible, not even the Bishop's bible nor the \"Great bible\", it goes to the Geneva bible. Shortly after the creation of the word Jew in 1776 to replace Judahite for Rabbinic/Pharisaic Judaist/Judaism, all bibles of all translations from there on were corrupted from knowing the difference between a Jew and a Judahite, etymologically speaking. Jesus Christ is a Judahite but he is not a Jew. Although the Septuagint as well as the Masoretic Text are corrupted while the Aramaic bible came from translating from the greek, it could be possible to use them together along with the Byzantine type to undo all the grammatical errors if one has a proper understanding of Biblical Hebrew grammar and pronunciation which they used Paleo-Hebrew and used Phoenician pronunciations initially before the Jews forgotten and dropped some vowel letters and rapidly picking up Aramaic as well as spreading out to various nations after the destruction of Jerusalem which is when God made the Judahites desolate as a race, but their false religion continued through their proselyte believers.\n\nAlthough Islam was a part of the problem of the dark ages, the real source of the dark ages came first from Diocletian's tyrannical policies of taxation which the management of such became the origins of European Feudalism to deal with taxation and later, the Roman Catholic Church's teaching Aristotle's conclusions about his perceptions based on the senses of what he thinks the world works without teaching anything else about what Aristotle promoted like say the Oligarchal Aristocracy that the Roman Catholic Church was controlled by. Aristotelian Philosophers detest Plato and say that the \"Philosopher Kings\" of his republic was the model of the Roman Empire. They are ignorant concerning the context and they tend to be pro democracy which was a step worse than oligarchy which Aristocracy is oligarchal (power of few) and controls democracy (power of many) via synarchy uniting Aristocracy and democracy usually in secrecy until they can use full blown tyranny and boldy proclaim their power over others. Aristocracy means rule of the best, has nothing to do with Aristotle, but the bad form of \"Aristocracy\" is everything bad that came from Aristotle's teachings like say the dark ages, the no soul doctrine, that nobody can know the whole truth without being able to do every profession, the compartmentalizations of various subjects into unnecessarily compartmentalized professions, the use of logic in rejection of the truth, relative ethics for short term benefits in picking lesser of two evils rejecting long term benefits (basis of politics and modern consumerism), all that is the bad form of Aristocracy which is not the same as the Aristocracy that has Philosopher Kings in Plato's Republic.\n\nThe solution to the damage that Aristotle's doctrines had done to humanity is the doctrines of Pythagoras, Plato, and followers of Plato that didn't sought to corrupt it with other religions and with Aristotle's philosophy. Aristotle's writings are very good for the purposes of promoting tyranny, Zeusian policies like the Olympian Zeus are known for bullying people. The Promethean policies promoted by Plato and Neo Platonist Humanists before and after the Renaissance that came from Nicolas of Cusanus was behind, is best understood through Lyndon LaRouche's writings explaining how the Renaissance came to be. Although some of the Humanists were indeed a part of dangerous cults and organizations, they were generally shunned by their Aristotelian peers because it went against their plans. Christian Humanism can exist if they are not hardcore Platonists and Monists while understanding why it's important to have Promethean solutions to Aristotelian problems. In some corrupt forms, humanism is materialistic and \"worldy\", but Christianity in some corrupt forms is also guilty of pushing Marxist Communism ideals and a rejection of the New Heaven, New Earth. Communalism is borderline pro Lordship/Feudalism (pro dark ages/\"S.H.T.F.\"/WWIII), pro Anarchism, pro Timocracy, and pro British Environmentalism (Agenda 21, Club of Rome Depopulation Agenda/Malthusian Agenda/Kalergi Plan/Greater Yinon Plan/Tikkun Olam). Christian and/or Patriotic Separatist are falling for the Jewish-Venetian-Jesuit-Freemasonic controlled alternative media, ignorant concerning the real Holocaust being the firebombing of Dresden, the Holohoax of the 6 million, how Adolf Hitler although being under the Skull and Bones' Thule Society, funded by Jewish bankers, and a Round Table member, had brought Germany 13 years of paradise nearly free of Jewish influences and Freemasonry meddling in politics of an hyperinflated economy of a formerly degenerate nation which Berlin was the sex capitol of Europe. Hitler also sought to free German people in Communist countries through means of pre-emptive strikes of what is essentially a rescue mission of the German folk, persecuted for being German. National Socialism however, is not the real answer to the problems we face, rather, the underlying Promethean principle that made Libya a wonderful place to live under Muammar Gaddafi, that made Russia a powerful nation under Vladimir Putin, that made the BRICS system, that was the American Credit System under Alexander Hamilton.\n\nAnti Monetarism/Crony Capitalism/Corporationism/Plutocracy/Wall Street/City of London, pro growth, pro science, pro space program, pro nuclear energy research, anti Aristotelian, pro Platonism, pro retroductive reasoning, pro Christianity, pro family, pro Patriarchy, anti feminism, anti abortion, pro liberty, pro infrastructure, pro sovereignty, anti oligarchy, anti Jew, anti Mysticism, anti empire, anti Marxist Communism, pro freedom of speech/press, pro gun, pro health. Will it happen on a global scale? I don't know.\n\nConcerning health, go to a Chiropractor, a TCM doctor, a Homeopathic doctor (Naturopaths don't count), and a Chi kung/Qi Gong master. Start a high fat low carb diet that includes organic animal meats and fats as the main source of your diet. Look into organic honey, bee pollen, colloidal silver, ozone generators, castile soap, crystal body deoderant, grounding mats, Klamath blue-green algae, lavendar oil, Alpha Linolenic Acid, liposomal vitamin C, adaptogenic herbs, PEMFs, Zappers, Pink Himalayan Salt, F.ermented C.odfish L.iver O.il, Wheatgerm oil, butter from grass fed cows, Lugol's iodine, probiotics, artichoke leaf extract, boneset aerial parts, goji berries, chinese red dates/dried jujube fruits, lemon water, tumeric with unpasterized grass fed cow milk, cinnamon with organic honey, Nrf2 activators, pinhole glasses, ionic air purifiers, garlic, black walnut extract, etc.\n\nüí´<strong>My \"criticism\" of an Identitarian Christian's commentary on Genesis, Exodus, Mark, and Acts Jul 10, 2016 @ 15:18</strong>\n\nAs an Identitarian Christian myself (not to be confused with Christian Identity, see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/what-is-race/\" target=\"_blank\">What is race?</a> <a href=\"http://www.christianityandrace.org/2016/05/identitarian-christianity-vs-christian.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.christianityandrace.org/2016/05/identitarian-christianity-vs-christian.html</a>), seeing other Identitarian Christian writing is very uplifting to know that I'm not the only one. Though I'm of Northeast Asian Ethnos, I've been living in a multicultural kettle for all my life and where I live, the white elephant of racial tension persists for it ironically spawns more homogeneous societies within a heterogeneous backdrop despite there being multiple generations of race mixing going on, though in lesser amounts than say in Brazil. Perhaps it have not reached critical melting point, but I don't want that day to come. Anyways, for the most part, Christian Talour, the man behind <a href=\"http://www.christianityandrace.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.christianityandrace.org</a> had made much effort in proving his stance and it is much more well polished and with more citations that what I come up with. However, there's some marginal errors that shows up which I was lead to make this article about to correct him on.\n\nStarting with Genesis: <a href=\"http://www.christianityandrace.org/p/identitarian-commentary-on-genesis.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.christianityandrace.org/p/identitarian-commentary-on-genesis.html</a>, Chrisitan Talour has some doubts concerning the Sethite theory because it does not explain concerning the genetics of black people's lack of a \"bottleneck\" in their DNA, and none of the children of Ham were negroids but were caucasoids. He had made a synthesis of the Sethite theory and the Nephilim theory to explain the origins of black people to be those that listened to Noah and went on board the Ark with Noah's family. The problem with this is that Nephilim is not Nopholim or Nephulim which means fallen ones, in the Septuagint, \"Gigantes\" was used. The Aramaic Targums used their word for giants. Nephilim does not mean fallen ones, rather, giants. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqeE_Wzl360\" target=\"_blank\">Etymology of Nephilim - Michael Heiser</a> Although Heiser is a proponent of the Aramaic myth that an Aramaic bible preceded the Greek bible despite the proofs that shows that it heavily is based on the Greek bible, nevertheless, concerning this topic, he is correct. Heiser does not believe that the sons of God were of the line of Seth or bene ha elohim since in the book of Job, that was used to describe fallen angels, but he doesn't make the irrational leap in believing that people are genetically predetermined to not believe in God. As a Presuppositionalist, I do believe in predestination, but not in genetic predestination. The whole Nephilim disinfo is reminiscient of the Talmudic lies concerning gentiles and black people, which the Hamitic myth comes from them which Islam has also adopted as well. The Serpent Seed doctrine is also an occult doctrine that seeks to elevate themselves to the status of angels and demons. There is much anomolies that the bible can't directly explain like the conehead skulls, but what is clear is that even if there are \"Nephilim hybrids\", that does not mean that they can't come to Christ, though the great deluge happened to purge all the daughters of men or of the line of Cain. There is no proof that Cain screwed a female angel neither being a demonic offspring from Eve's relations with a fallen angel. I am not denying that God had genetically instill inequality among the races. The argument that I'm making is that every human has a soul, but a few have a relationship with the Holy Spirit, that there are no demonic-human hybrid souls. For more concerning this, I recommend looking into <a href=\"http://www.nephilimhybrids.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.nephilimhybrids.com</a>, though I don't have the same eschatological view as Paradox Brown.\n\nI was extremely disappointed in the fact that Melchizedek was not talked about, for Melchizedek, King of Salem was Shem and he had personally chosen his successor to be Abram. Jesus Christ was a type of Melchizedek which is a title, not a name. Levitical laws were abolished for a reformed priesthood similar to Melchizedek's but to be applied to Abraham's Seed (singular) that is Jesus Christ alone which through Jesus Christ are everyone be able to be a part of the Ecclesia as ministers which is not passed down by blood but by spirit. The Universal priesthood is a doctrine that should not be forgotten. This doctrine was dilluted and corrupted by the world. I am not against a patriarchal government, but I am against the notion that any family bloodline can continue for many generations from a line of pastors to be \"biblical\", for that would mean those that they're all \"saved\" and that those don't come from a historical lineage have no right to be ministers while the \"call\" to become a minister had downgraded to be restricted to a clan which promotes a type of religious form of European Feudalism spawned from Diocletian the Croatian. Not to say that Christian Talour believes in a patriarchal bloodline of ministers to be biblical, though it could happen, I don't believe that any family lineage is predestined to be ministers the same way the Rabbinic Jews had done despite having no Levitical blood in them.\n\nOnwards to Exodus: <a href=\"http://www.christianityandrace.org/p/and-all-souls-that-came-out-of-loins-of.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.christianityandrace.org/p/and-all-souls-that-came-out-of-loins-of.html</a>, immediately, he talks about the low fertility myth. Let's totally ignore the Baby Boomer generation, Planned Parenthood's genocide and harvest of human stem cells, the highly xenoestrogenic environment, and the \"modernization\" of society failing to promote the family unit as an attractive, fulfilling lifestyle while they push depopulation agendas through softkill programs and through seeking to promote \"diversity\" by either moving white people in colored neighborhoods (many cheap residential houses shown in HGTV are made within black neighborhoods as noted by Professor Griff) or the more destructive method being sending colored people and illegal immigrants into white neighborhoods. There's many videos concerning this like the \"With Open Gates\" documentary pushing the Kalergi Plan. Though Talour have not explicitly stated why there is low birth rates while on the contrary, he promotes his people to procreate but my point being that it's a politically motivated population control that determines that procreation is good or bad which all good nations promotes it like in Putin's Russia and even China had dropped the one child limitation since it seems like it had been stabilized in recent years. If I recall correctly, white people counts for 1 out of 6 people in the whole world. It should had been 1 out of 3. I'm not white, but the destruction of the white race I fear, is the beginning of the end as the Jews who are not Judahites destroys their long time foe that is European Christianity. I am not sure if Asian Christians would be willing to destroy Islam and the Jews with the same fervor held by some white Christians, for they are much more open to abandoning their Ethnos, well, at least in America, Asians are more open to miscegenation with other races.\n\nConcerning Moses' Israel, yes it was a top down system, but that doesn't mean that the Ecclesia has to be as such anymore because we (Christians) are all in the royal priesthood. A proper model of how the Ecclesia should function I believe is expressed in the free pdf provided in this website: <a href=\"http://www.kingdomgov.net\" target=\"_blank\">www.kingdomgov.net</a>.\n\nNow for Mark: <a href=\"http://www.christianityandrace.org/p/identitarian-commentary-on-marks-gospel.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.christianityandrace.org/p/identitarian-commentary-on-marks-gospel.html</a>, it seems like to me that Talour is implying that he is for medieval hierarchal feudalism because Jesus is Lord, though I hope I'm misinterpreting this. I think he, like many, many people don't know what is the dark ages. It is not the Roman Catholic Church in itself that was the cause, rather, the Roman Empire's Aristotelian teachings which inspired imperialist propaganda that ends up failing. Empires are inherently dysfunctional, they are not natural nations, and they are destined to crumble. I know that Liberals uses this claim to make white people look bad but the cancer that is empires had destroyed the Americas as the Aztec Empire which only stole the technology of their neighbors. Nobody can name one empire that suceeded in ruling the world, however, I will say that there is a small group of people that had been behind Babylonia, Persia, Greece, Roma, Byzantine, Veneto, Albion (British Isles), and (State of) Israel which had spread globally through their many proxy organizations and nations. The Crusades did little to nothing in preventing the already predominant dark ages, rather, it was a financial crusade for the Venetians to gain cities and the pillaged wealth given to them which the Knights Templar was a part of the Venetian banking system. It was not the Vatican who financed the crusades. It is true however, that when white people rule over black people, many times it is the black people that benefits from their presense while white people get burdened by their presence. I do think that there is an ethical form of slavery and an unethical form of slavery, the latter being done by Jews, Arabians, and Catholics though Catholics stopped slavery, Muslims continue the slave trade while the Jews does it by proxy and through money until they can openly do it via Tikkun Olam when every Jew gets a thousand slaves.\n\nI like how Christian Talour might be pro predestination. That is a sign of a real Christian. Many refuse to believe that reality. However, I don't think that people in Saudi Arabia go to hell for not hearing the gospel, rather, they sin against the God that they know which is exclusively the Christian God, not Allah. A basic lesson in Presuppositional Apologetics will make this much more apparent.\n\nAnd last but not least, Acts: <a href=\"http://www.christianityandrace.org/p/identitarian-commentary-on-acts.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.christianityandrace.org/p/identitarian-commentary-on-acts.html</a>, he had created a summary which I will quote:<blockquote>There are twelve major Identitarian themes I have sought to explore in this commentary on Acts: (1) inequality through God‚Äôs uneven granting of miraculous power, ecclesial authority, and opportunity, (2) the universality of the gospel message never erased distinctive ethnic identity, (3) God‚Äôs kingdom was ruled through a hierarchical rather than egalitarian structure, (4) early Christians were not concerned with strict language control (i.e. being ‚Äúkind,‚Äù precise, or inoffensive), (5) God honored inherited privilege in the individual and the ethnos, (6) there is more continuity between the Old and New Testaments than moderns usually admit; there was no great worldview change between them, (7) diversity breeds social problems, (8) the early Christian gospel was internally focused rather than external; it would reject modern social justice reinterpretations, (9) the Kingdom of God is exclusive rather than inclusive, (10) the book of Acts does not support pacifism, (11) the concept of the ‚Äúethnos‚Äù (ethnic group/nation) is affirmed in Acts, and (12) the New Testament is Eurocentric.</blockquote>\n\nTalour seems to not grasp the difference between a Jew and a Judahite, neither knows that the Christians held a Preterist (but not Hyper Preterism) stance. In many forms, he have some cognitive dissonance concerning the Zionist Jews. Some people like Nehemia Gordon had noted that there was a form of Zionism before the Crusades sought to take over Jerusalem which those Jews were Karaites that sought be be like another nation as in, not thinking that they should rule over other nations. The imperialist mindset came from the Babylonian Talmud which was somewhat foreign to the Jews in Palestine in the 9th century. Christian Communalism does have an hierarchy, but America has a very long history of \"Utopian Communities\" which many had fallen out of the background of history. The traditional concept of how a church should function had been proven to be corruptible time after time if one looks at church history carefully. Sometimes people just don't know why that is so until they had repeatedly dealt with an abusive judicial system with no due process in such churches in petty matters that shouldn't matter. Just because the Ecclesia has an hierarchy, doesn't mean that it is above the people like the Pope is to his deceived sheople. There is no intermediary between man and God, therefore, all ministers in the Ecclesia are servants that has no power over the family that is the real kingdom of God. The family rule of monarchies are not biblically promoted. Samuel spoken against the formation of the King of Israel. There can be \"leaders\" like in the Book of Judges, but they are most definitely are not kings, more like Benevolent Dictators, Philosopher Kings that's done right.\n\nIn essense, Christian Talour makes a good, well polished argument for the Eurocentric nature of the bible as well as destroying Liberation Theology and Cultural Christian Marxism. However, he seems to be ignorant of various topics that I really don't expect most Christians to understand since it takes much time and research to come to many of the conclusions that I've come to terms with. Many people don't know the difference between a Conservative and a Neo-Conservative either. Times had changed for the worse, and the delusion only grows stronger until it either completely consumes itself into an oblivion, or when the truth reigns triumphant over the lies once and for all.\n\nUpdate: He appears to be a traditional Catholic and is ignorant of the Jews behind Communism and the destruction of the Roman Catholic Church. He doesn't know that the Marrano Crypto-Jews had used the Jesuit order against the Vatican, neither the Holohoax, and the writings of Maurice Pinay. He also doesn't know how Catholics are pro-miscegenation while it was the Protestants that pushed for anti-miscegenation laws in the USA. The only thing common that I have with him is the concept of \"Identitarian Christian\". There's only been \"Anti-Popes\" after the Second Vatican Council while hardcore traditional Catholics became Sedevacantists. There can't be any proper form of \"dialogue\" between Protestantism and Catholicism until we kick out all the Jews and Judaizers.\n\nüí´<strong>Re: The Error of Solo Scriptura Jul 11, 2016 @ 17:06</strong>\n\nIn regard to my article made last year: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-error-of-solo-scriptura/\" target=\"_blank\">The Error of Solo Scriptura</a>, I have exposed some people to terminology that they have never heard about before, especially \"Sola Regnum\", which honestly, I've made that up to explain the nature of the \"Divine Rights of the King\" as an ecclesiastical doctrinal sounding name, but if you knew what the Anglicans and the Quakers were to the \"King\", they were subservient to the \"King\", had to do everything the \"King\" tells them to do. The union of church and state in this context was the state dominating the Church of England, which that state being under the King is a kingdom, hence, \"Regnum\", which there was only one King's kingdom that the Church of England served in rejection to the King of the Judahites' kingdom, hence, \"Sola\", therefore, Only + Kingdom = Sola Regnum. Prior to the Israelites choosing a king, they were split in 12 states (10 tribes + 2 half tribes of Joseph as Ephraim and Manasseh) but united through the Levitical Priesthood. There was a judicial system of a fractal network of iterations of tens until it end up with 70 Elders that worked with the Levitical Priesthood which complaints that weren't dealt with among the lower courts moved up to the Sanhedrin and the High Priest. Rabbinism is the Sanhedrin without the Levitical Priesthood while the Sanhedrin became the \"Jewish Illuminati\", picking up the religions surrounding them in their Babylonian Exile and made themselves a new Aristotelian, oligarchal priesthood of a different religion.\n\nAnyways, the Old Testament system was scrapped for the New Testament system that was much more simplified as the fractal judicial system was thrown in the gutter, as well as abolishing the need of a Priest because Jesus Christ is the High Priest and King of the Order of Melchizedek/Shem which he has the direct blessing that Abraham received from Shem through the royal Davidic line which survived. All Christians are of the royal priesthood through adoption, and everyone has a shot to being a minister/pastor which is not a priest. The Apostolic see and its Apostolic succession is an unbiblical doctrine, there is no continuation of apostles being made, neither was there any need for it after the cessation of some of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Only materialistic, hardened fools like the Jews and the Atheist seek after signs to see it to believe it when their faith lies from within their eyes whose presuppositions defines their perceptions of what they see. There is generally only the threefold (no prophets and apostles) ministry concerning sharing the gospel to others, but that is not to say that there isn't any other ministries Christian ministers can do. It is a misunderstanding to say that Jesus Christ reintroduced the Sanhedrin just because he used 70 people to share the gospel in Luke 10 right after Luke 9:1-6 talked about how Jesus sent the disciples to share the gospel. It is therefore, mere tradition to believe that the fractal judicial system was reintroduced as a part of the Ecclesial system and the body of Christ.\n\nThe Ecclesia is made to be able to function on its own whether or not there was a \"law of the land\". That means, in places that there is no government, the Ecclesia functioned as a government which religion is a form of government. It is wrong when a foreign goverment like say the USA tries to take away a religious government as a part of their government. The problem is, it is also wrong when the Ecclesia rule over others, over foreign governments. The Ecclesia can be a government that uplifts the body of Christ, being minsiters to them. If they needed to, they can be separate from the people and be within the body in Christ. Those that say that Christians are not in the body of Christ because they are not taking vows to be separate from the world in order to function within the Ecclesia doing Ecclesiastic duties are simply foolish. Yes there are two types of ministers. The Ecclesia has a treasury which requires people like Stephen. They cannot be a part of a foreign government while dealing with the treasury of the Ecclesia. Things that does not deal with such things, there are \"family\" minister, which if there were say four people, two or three of them can choose each other so that they all can be \"family\" ministers. There is no doctrine that forces people to have a minister for every ten or more people when they all can be each other's ministers. Continuing the ministry is done among the people, not from a top down system of kuriakos or \"Lordship\" which is not ekklesia or \"community\". Among the family ministers, those that can be set apart from the host nation (if any) can be ecclesial minister(s) chosen among the family ministers which if everyone can go \"Off the Grid\", they can elect each other, and if there's already ecclesial ministers, they can also find disciples that would be beneath them but within the set apart body in Christ, but disciples are only made in the ecclesial level, not the family level. Some cults push that on the family level as well as in their initiation, therefore, a continual line of disciple and master of a top down system like the mystery schools, Kabbalah, Masonry, witchcraft, etc.\n\nThere's two kinds of \"Sola/Solo Ecclesia\", the system, and the doctrine. The system is like the Papacy or a pagan priesthood system that rules over kingdoms, so closet Catholic Sodomite Anglican King James VI of Scotland/I of England was subservient to the Papacy, which his kingdom was a part of the Vatican's (which was already infiltrated by Jews and the Venetians to push the law of the high sea). The doctrine is how the church/kuriakos asserts traditional doctrines to be obeyed despite it not being in the bible, it is pushed over Sola/Solo Scriptura. The \"middle ground\" is Prima Scriptura when there is no question concerning if it's biblical or traditional, see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/prima-scriptura-sola-scriptura-sola-ecclesia/\" target=\"_blank\">Prima Scriptura, Sola Scriptura, and Sola Ecclesia</a> although at face value, the description that Eastern Orthodoxy gives to Prima Scriptura is similar to the more traditional understanding of the Sola Scriptura stance taught by Martin Luther, not the modern understanding of Sola Scriptura that is in essence, Solo Scriptura, but in closer inspection, Prima Scriptura is not Sola Scriptura for it keeps traditions that contradicts the bible while Sola Scriptura keeps traditions that does not contradict the bible. What I have been describing on how the Ecclesia should function is called \"Ecclesiology\". There is one holy Christian church, which the Protestants are not a denomination or a schism, of which Lutherans explain this in their Augsburg Confession article VII: Of The Church: Lutherans believe that there is one holy Christian church, and it is found wherever the gospel is preached in its truth and purity and the sacraments are administered according to the gospel. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Lutheran, I'm iconoclastic to them, and I don't do the \"Eucharist\"/Passover which only served to remind the Israelites not only about what Moses had done, but also things to come that is the body of Christ, the Passover Lamb that covered our sins, so I don't do any transubstantiation nonsense in partaking of the \"Monstrance\" of a wafer, cracker, or bread with a \"literal\" blood of Jesus to continually receive forgiveness of what had already been finished. I am defending the good side of Protestantism, not the bad corrupted political side of the Venetian-Jewish propaganda tool that Protestantism was, see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/everything-wrong-with-protestantism/\" target=\"_blank\">Everything wrong with \"Protestantism\"</a>. For more concerning how the Ecclesia should function, I recommend for the time being, the skeletal model presented in <a href=\"http://www.kingdomgov.net\" target=\"_blank\">www.kingdomgov.net</a>, not necessarily advocating their personal religious doctrines that they might hold that has nothing to do with the model like say their \"Messianic\" outlook (though all such claims are denied by said owner of the website) and blaspheming God with the name of a moon god or using names directly from the Kabbalah like \"AHAYAH\", Shekinah (NOT IN THE BIBLE!), Yah, etc., see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/name-of-god/\" target=\"_blank\">Name of God</a>.\n\nI hope I've made this crystal clear as to the definitions used in <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/the-error-of-solo-scriptura/\" target=\"_blank\">The Error of Solo Scriptura</a>. Everything else is mostly explained in the links provided within that article like Sola/Solo Spiritus.\n\nüí´<strong>Biblical Patriarchal Identitarian Christian Masculinism Jul 16, 2016 @ 00:19</strong>\n\nWhat is Biblical Patriarchal Identitarian Christian Masculinism? Biblical as in doctrines formed through exegesis, Biblical + Patriarchal as in understanding the biblical roles of the family (and extended family, Ethnos) to be Patriarchal in its hierarchy, Identitarian Christian in seeking the exclusive biblical Christian way (not according to other religions like say Cultural Marxist Liberation Chrisitanity) to belong to one's own Ethnos (see: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/what-is-race/\" target=\"_blank\">What is race?</a>), and Masculinism in the defense and advocacy of the rights or needs of men and boys. Unfortunate that I have to spell it all out of what should had been a major part of Political Christianity and synonymous with \"Christian\". The arguments being used against Biblical Patriarchal Identitarian Christian Masculinism deals with its foundations, formulated through eisegesis misinterpretation. The most important doctrine that they attack is in fact, the concept of the biblical Trinity. The rejection of the Trinity is to reject the One True God in favor for all the other idol worship they seek, but they attack Biblical Patriarchal Identitarian Christian Masculinism in many levels and layers with so many junk doctrines that people don't know what is the truth because they had never heard the real gospel which was generally understood within Reformed Protestant congregations. Many so called KJVO Christians don't know a single thing about the Reformed faith, being closet Anglicans which Anglicans/Espicolicans are closet Catholics controlled by the royal family of England that pushed Semi-Peleganism and Arminianism through its surrogate, Methodism which the Methodist church gave forth Pentecostalism, see: <a href=\"http://www.larouchepub.com/other/1997/ahc.html\" target=\"_blank\">British Subversion of the United States: The militias and Pentecostalism</a>. Then Pentecostalism and its various denominations was used as a front for Zionism and Communism, both mastered by the Venetians and the Jews in New Venice that is the City of London, Ancient Londonium. Black Liberation Theology merged with the American culture as Cultural Christianity. MLK Jr. was a Marxist Sodomite deviant while Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali was under the \"Nation of Islam\" group made by Elijah Muhammad who was under the Moorish Science Temple, a pseudo-Islamic and Masonic-themed organization whose founder, Noble Drew Ali, whose parents was initiated by Jamal ud Din al Afghani during his time in the United States in 1882-1883, which his handlers were Wilfred Scawen Blunt and his wife Lady Anne, a grand-daughter of poet Lord Byron which Afghani was part of a British project of using Scottish Rite Freemasonry to gather recruits in the Middle East (see: <a href=\"http://www.conspiracyschool.com/blog/religious-factor-how-cia-fostered-rise-muslim-brotherhood-tool-western-imperialism-middle-east\" target=\"_blank\">The Religious Factor: How the CIA fostered the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood as tool of Western imperialism in the Middle East</a>).\n\nWhat is the bible's stance on women? From <a href=\"https://carm.org/email-churches-women-pastors\" target=\"_blank\">Email this to churches that affirm women pastors and elders</a>:<blockquote>Email this to churches that affirm women pastors and elders\n\nby Matt Slick\n\nHere's something you can do to promote biblical fidelity. If you find a church on the web that affirms women pastors and elders, perhaps you might want to copy the text below the line and send it to them in an email. Check it out and see if it is something you'd like to do. Just copy the text and paste it in an email at carmstuff@yahoo.com. If you want, let us know you've done this. \n\nMaybe we'll post some replies from churches on CARM, too. It should be interesting.\n\n_________ For Churches that affirm women pastors and elders _________\n\nWe believe that you want to honor the word of God and teach His Word in truth which is why we are contacting you. We notice that you permit women pastors and/or elders. 1 Pet. 3:15 says to give an answer to everyone for the faith that lies within you. So, we are asking you to give an answer as to why you allow women pastors and elders in light of what the Bible says:\n\n 1 Tim. 2:12-13, ‚ÄúBut I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but remain quiet. 13 For it was Adam who was first created, and then Eve.‚Äù\n Titus 1:5-6, ‚ÄúFor this reason I left you in Crete, that you might set in order what remains, and appoint elders in every city as I directed you, 6 namely, if any man be above reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of dissipation or rebellion.‚Äù\n 1 Tim. 5:17, ‚ÄúLet the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.‚Äù\n\n1 Tim. 2:12-14 is where Paul explicitly states that he does not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man but to remain quiet (\"quiet\" is hesuchia, not complete silence but respectful quiet)--because Adam was created first. In 1 Tim. 3:15 we are told this is how we are to conduct ourselves in the household of God. When a woman is a pastor and/or elder, she is in a place of authority over men. Paul clearly tells us this authority in the church structure is not the place for a woman because Adam was made first. This is not a cultural issue. Remember, Eve sinned first; but sin entered the world through Adam and not Eve (Rom. 5:12) because Adam was in the position of authority. This is why husbands are the head of the wife even as Christ is head of the church (Eph. 5:23). The place of authority in the church and family is not the place of the woman.\n\nIn Titus 1:5-6 it says that the elder must be ‚Äúthe husband of one wife.‚Äù The Greek is literally ‚Äúman of one woman.\" This same phrase is used of the Bishop in 1 Tim. 3:2 and the Deacon in 1 Tim. 3:12. Remember, Paul is speaking of church officers--not servants (diakonos) in homes (Rom. 16:1, 27). So, the pastor/elder is to be a man of one woman.\n\n1 Tim. 5:17 tells us that the elders are to receive honor--especially those who preach and teach. Therefore, the pastor is an elder by definition, and the elder is to be a ‚Äúman of one woman.‚Äù The word ‚Äúelders‚Äù here is masculine in the Greek. So, Paul is telling us how the church is to operate (1 Tim. 3:15), and that the place of ecclesiastical authority is based on male eldership because Adam was created first (1 Tim. 2:12-13). This is doctrine--not culture.\n\nSome say that women pastors and elders are not an essential issue, so we should not worry about it. If that is the case, then why did God tell us women are not to teach or exercise authority over men (1 Tim. 2:12-13) in the church (1 Tim. 3:15)? Why did he tell us that an elder is to be a ‚Äúman of one woman‚Äù (Titus 1:5-6) if we are not to worry about it? \n\nWhat about equality and verses with women in leadership?\n\nGal. 3:28, ‚ÄúThere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.‚Äù This verse is not about women pastors and elders. It is about salvation--in Christ, not church eldership, so it doesn‚Äôt apply.\n\nDeborah (Judges 4, 5) was an Old Testament Judge--not a New Testament elder. Prophesying women (Acts 21:8, 9) are not elders/pastors. Priscilla (Rom. 16:3, 4), a fellow worker in Christ, is not said to be an elder/pastor. Phoebe (Rom. 16:1) is a servant (diakonos) of the church--not an elder/pastor. Note that Jesus came not to be served but to serve (diakonos) (Mark 10:45). The government is called a minister (diakonos) of God (Rom. 13:4). Junia (Rom. 16:7 (see www.carm.org/junia) may have been a female apostle (not one of the 12) though this is debated. Still, even if she were, apostles are not for today; and an apostle is not a pastor/elder. The Chosen Lady of 2 John 1 is an honored woman--not a pastor/elder. Basically, the standard verses cited by people to support women being pastors and elders do no such thing.\n\nWhat about a woman who is called by God to minister as pastors and elders? Essentially, this is making doctrine based on a woman‚Äôs experience. Just because a woman ‚Äúsays‚Äù she is called by God or feels she is doesn‚Äôt mean she is because it isn't biblical. God‚Äôs word is the standard--not our feelings and experiences.\n\nWhy is this important? This is important because compromise in one area often leads to compromise in other areas. Even if the biblical position is not popular or politically correct, it is biblically correct. As Christians, we must never let compromise seep into the Christian church and weaken it. If Christians refuse to submit to the teaching of God‚Äôs word in this matter, can they be trusted to rightly deliver God‚Äôs word to us in other matters? \n\nWe hope for a response and kindly urge you to seriously consider this brief article. If you are interested in more in-depth material on this topic, please go to http://www.carm.org/women-in-ministry. \n\nDo you disagree? If so, then please answer two questions. 1) How can an elder/pastor who is a woman be ‚Äúthe husband of one wife,\" lit. ‚Äúa man of one woman,\" (Titus 1:6)? 2) How can a woman be in a place of authority as a pastor/elder and not violate 1 Tim. 2:12-13 where Paul clearly says he does ‚Äúnot allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man?\" This is what it says, and there aren't any qualifications to it. What do you do with it?\n\nPlease understand that we believe women are under-appreciated and under-utilized in the Church; but we also believe that God‚Äôs word is supreme, that it is above our desires, above culture, and that we need to adhere to what God tells us and not substitute it with a feeling or even an experience. The health of God‚Äôs church is linked to its dependence on God‚Äôs word, and pastors and elders will be held responsible before God for what they teach.\n\nFinally, research shows that the majority of churches and denominations that affirm women pastors and elders often then adopt pro-homosexual and pro-abortion positions. We are not suggesting you are doing this; but it is important to note that when compromise occurs in one area of scripture, it is easier to compromise in another. See http://www.carm.org/denominations-women-ordination-and-other-errors for documentation on what tends to happen. \n\nSo, where do you stand? Do you care? Are you seriously dedicated to God‚Äôs word? We hope for your response, www.carm.org/contact-carm.</blockquote>\n\nI have heard many call \"diakonos\" the same level as \"elder\", but it's just wrong to group them together. ALL REAL CHRISTIANS ARE \"diakonos\", but only men that doesn't practice polygamy can be \"elders\". I'm insulted to hear people compare Quakers AS Reformed Christianity, they are far from knowing the truth. Oliver Cromwell militarized the Quakers back when they were called Shakers or Shaking Quakers. Baptists, Calvinists, Presbyterians, Puritans, they were all persecuted by Catholics and Anglicans while under Oliver Cromwell, the Shakers enslaved the Irish people that had lasted for two centuries under \"Free Trade\" (see: <a href=\"http://www.schillerinstitute.org/economy/nbw/pot_famine95.html\" target=\"_blank\">How British Free Trade Starved Millions During Ireland's Potato Famine</a>), so historically, the Quakers are bad at exegesis and are mere tools when coerced. They don't believe in the trinity, they push celibacy, they push the kabbalistic \"bisexuality\" of God, they speak in glossolalia which is not genuine xenoglossy, they are aesthetics, they do not believe in biblical defense of property and other lives, they keep men and women separated, the parental bonds are severed as early as age 3, they are all in all, heretics that despise Individualism and the real family structure that God ordained in the bible, observable in reality.\n\nTaken from <a href=\"https://carm.org/elder-church\" target=\"_blank\">The elder in the church</a> (slightly edited the format):<blockquote>The elder in the church\n\nby Matt Slick\n\nThe elder is a leader in the Christian church. It is a divinely-appointed office that is held by men who are able to teach sound doctrine, refute error, be of good reputation, having believing children, who manage their households well, etc. The elder should not be in office if he is unable to fulfill the requirements of the office, and he should not be chosen because he is a popular figure in the local church.\n\nBeing an elder is a high calling, and there are thousands of very godly men in many churches and who seek God and serve Him as best as they can. But, it is also true that many should not be elders who are in that position. Women should not be elders. Men with unbelieving children living with them should not be elders. And, elders should be able to teach correct doctrine and refute error. Sadly, many elders cannot do this.\n\nBelow is an outline dealing with the subject of \"elder.\" Pastors, elders, and congregation members should all be careful whom they pick and recommend as elders. They should not let emotions influence their decisions, so that they choose men who are not qualified. The church needs to take the office of elder very seriously, and it needs to put the elder to the test according to the guidelines of scripture. If he is not qualified, he should not be an elder.\n\n1. The Term \"Elder\"\n1.1 PRESBUTEROS--elder, an old man, a leader in the church. The term is used\n1.1.1 of the elder of two persons (Luke 15:25, or more, John 8:9).\n1.1.2 of a person advanced in age (Acts 2:17; in Heb. 11:2).\n1.1.3 of the forefathers in Israel (Matt. 15:2; Mark 7:3, 5).\n1.1.4 of members of the Sanhedrin (Matt. 16:21; 26:47).\n1.1.5 of those who managed public affairs in the various cities (Luke 7:3).\n1.1.6 of those who were the heads or leaders of the tribes and families, as of the seventy who helped Moses (Num. 11:16; Deut. 27:1). This included:\n1.1.6.1 acting as judges in apprehending murderers (Deut. 19:12).\n1.1.6.2 conducting inquests (Deut. 21:2).\n1.1.6.3 settling matrimonial disputes (Deut. 22:15; 25:7).\n1.1.6.4 If theirs was a city of refuge, they also heard pleas for asylum (Joshua 20:4).\n1.1.7 of those qualified by the Holy Spirit who exercised spiritual care and oversight of the local congregation.\n1.2 EPISKOPOI--overseers, bishops\n1.2.1 Titus equates bishop and elder in Titus 1:5-9.\n2. Regarding the Office:\n2.1 The office of Elder is a divinely-appointed office as defined in the Pastoral Epistles.\n2.2 Elders are apparently appointed by the laying on of hands (1 Tim. 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6).\n2.3 Should receive double honor in the church (1 Tim. 5:17).\n2.4 The pastor is an elder who preaches and/or teaches (1 Tim. 5:17).\n2.4 The pastor (elder) is to equip the body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-13).\n2.5 Must be a man (Titus 1:5-6).\n2.5.1 All uses of \"elder\" are in the masculine except for 1 Tim. 5:2 where it means older women.\n2.6 The pastor is an elder (1 Tim. 5:17), and the elder is to be male (Titus 1:5-6).\n2.7 Based on authority structure which was signified in the order of creation, Adam first, Eve second (1 Tim. 2:12-13).\n3.

Many also separate episkopoi from presbuteros, though if there ever is an episkopoi, it would be a minister (or a group of family ministers that elected each other to become ecclesial ministers) concerning the Ecclesia that has to take certain vows to maintain certain ecclesial duties that requires them to be set apart from the grid, dropping their binding ties to the nations. I have yet to find a ecclesia that knows these difference that isn't a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization, though I hope that will change, it is unlikely for cults like \"His Holy Church\" to let go of their eisegesis doctrines so easily.\n\nTaken from <a href=\"https://carm.org/ontological-and-economic-trinity\" target=\"_blank\">The Ontological and Economic Trinity</a>:<blockquote>The Ontological and Economic Trinity\n\nby Matt Slick\n\nThe Trinity is the Christian teaching that God consists of three simultaneous, eternal persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Each of the three persons are equal in their attributes and nature but differ in how they relate to the world and to each other. When we say they are equal in nature and attributes, we are speaking of what is called the Ontological Trinity (ontology--study of being and essence). Each of the three persons in the Godhead are divine--have equal attributes (omniscience, omnipresence, holiness, etc.).\n\nWhen we speak of how they relate to each other and the world, we are speaking of the Economic Trinity (economic--from the Greek oikonomikos, which means relating to arrangement of activities). To be overly simplistic, we could say that the Ontological Trinity deals with what God is, and the Economic Trinity deals with what God does.\n\nWithin Christianity there is no debate on the Ontological Trinity. It is universally accepted as true that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are each divine, holy, unchanging, etc.\nThe Economic Trinity\n\nAs stated above, the Economic Trinity deals with how the three persons in the Godhead relate to each other and the world. Each has different roles within the Godhead, and each has different roles in relationship to the world (some roles overlap). The Father-and-Son is an inter-Trinitarian relationship since it is eternal (more on this below). The Father sent the Son (1 John 4:10), the Son came down from heaven not to do his own will but the will of the Father (John 6:38). For a single verse that shows differences in roles, see 1 Pet. 1:2, \"According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood.\" You can see that the Father foreknows. The Son became man and sacrificed himself. The Holy Spirit sanctifies the church. That is simple enough. But before we discuss this further, let's look at some of the verses that support the difference of roles among the three persons of the Trinity:\n\n1. The Father sent the Son. The Son did not send the Father. (John 6:44; 8:18; 10:36; 1 John 4:14).\n1.1 John 5:37, ‚ÄúAnd the Father who sent Me, He has borne witness of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.\"\n2. Jesus came down from heaven, not to do his own will, but the will of the Father.\n2.1 John 6:38, \"For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.\"\n3. Jesus performed the redemptive work. The Father did not.\n3.1 2 Cor. 5:21, \"He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.\"\n3.2 1 Pet. 2:24, \"and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed.\"\n4. Jesus is the only begotten. The Father is not.\n4.1 John 3:16, ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.\"\n5. The Father gave the Son. The Son did not give the Father or the Holy Spirit.\n5.1 John 3:16, ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.\"\n6. The Father and the Son send the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit does not send the Father and the Son.\n6.1 John 14:26, \"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things . . . \"\n6.2 John 15:26, \"When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, that is the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father . . . \"\n7. The Father has given the elect to the Son. Scripture does not say that the Father gave the elect to the Holy Spirit.\n7.1 John 6:39, ‚ÄúAnd this is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all that He has given Me I lose nothing, but raise it up on the last day.\"\n8. The Father chose us before the foundation of the world--no indication that the Son or the Holy Spirit chose us.\n8.1 Eph. 1:4, \"just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him . . . \"\n9. The Father predestined us to adoption according to the intention of his will. This is not said of the Son or the Holy Spirit.\n9.1 Eph. 1:5, \"He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.\"\n10. We have redemption through Jesus' blood--not the blood of the Father or the Holy Spirit.\n10.1 Eph. 1:7, \"In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace.\"\n\nLet's summarize. We can see that the Father sent the Son (John 6:44; 8:18). The Son came down from heaven not to do his own will (John 6:38). The Father gave the Son (John 3:16), who is the only begotten (John 3:16), to perform the redemptive work (2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Pet. 2:24). The Father and Son sent the Holy Spirit. The Father, who chose us before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4), predestined us (Eph. 1:5; Rom. 8:29) and gave the elect to the Son (John 6:39).\n\nIt was not the Son who sent the Father. The Father was not sent to do the will of the Son. The Son did not give the Father, nor was the Father called the only begotten. The Father did not perform the redemptive work. The Holy Spirit did not send the Father and Son. It is not said that the Son or the Holy Spirit chose us, predestined us, and gave us to the Father.\n\nFurthermore, the Father calls Jesus the Son (John 9:35) and not the other way around. Jesus is called the Son of Man (Matt. 24:27); the Father is not. Jesus is called the Son of God (Mark 1:1; Luke 1:35); the Father is not called the Son of God. Jesus will sit at the right hand of God (Mark 14:62; Acts 7:56); the Father does not sit at the right hand of the Son. The Father appointed the Son as heir of all things (Heb. 1:1-2) and not the other way around. The Father has fixed the time of the restoring of the kingdom of Israel (Acts 1:7)--the Son didn't. The Holy Spirit gives gifts to the Church (1 Cor. 12:8-11) and produces fruit (Gal. 5:22-23). These are not said of the Father and Son.\n\nSo, clearly we see differences in function and roles. The Father sends, directs, and predestines. The Son does the will of the Father, becomes flesh, and accomplishes redemption. The Holy Spirit indwells and sanctifies the Church.\n\nWithout these distinctions there can't be any distinctions between the persons of the Trinity; and if there are no distinctions, there is no Trinity.\nGod does not change\n\nGod says, \"For I, the Lord, do not change;\" (Mal. 3:6). This means that the nature of God is the same for all eternity. Since God is a Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), then God has been a Trinity forever. The Father has always been the Father. The Son has always been the Son. The Holy Spirit has always been the Holy Spirit. This means that the roles expressed by the Father, but not the Son, have always been roles of the Father and not the Son. Likewise, the roles of the Son have always belonged to him and not the Father. And, of course, the roles of the Holy Spirit are not the same roles of the Father or the Son. Remember, we are speaking of roles and function (Economic Trinity) and not nature and attributes (Ontological Trinity). Since they have different roles, then the way they relate to each other is also eternal and unchangeable.\n\nAgain, without a distinction in rolls in persons within the Trinity, there would be no Trinity.\nEconomic Subordination\n\nDefinitions are incredibly important when discussing theology. This is no exception. Throughout the Christian church there has been an error called subordinationism; and, unfortunately, some have confused it with the Economic Trinity. Subordinationism is a heresy concerning the Father and Son--though sometimes the Holy Spirit is included in the discussion. The error has different forms; but it is primarily the teaching that the Son is not eternal and divine (Arian Subordinationism) and is, therefore, not equal to the Father in being and attributes. This is, of course, wrong; and it is in contrast to the Economic Trinity which does not deny the equality of nature and attributes.\n\nThe misunderstanding often arises from failing to realize that having different roles does not mean a difference in nature. A husband and a wife have different roles in the family (she bears children, he does not, she is the mother, he is the father, etc.), but the fact that they have different roles does not mean they are different in nature. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit have different roles but are all equal in nature and attributes.\n\nSince we see different roles within the Trinity, does this signify a subordination among the three persons? The clear answer seems to be yes. But remember, affirming this is not the same as advocating the heresy of subordinationism. We can say that there is a subordination of the Son to the Father in role (as a father-son relationship would naturally have), but we also say that subordinationism (difference in nature) is wrong. Again, John 6:38, \"For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.\" From this verse we can conclude, at least, that the Son voluntarily subjected himself to the will of the Father and is doing the Father's will.\n\nStill, some do not like the idea of any type of subjection among the persons in the Trinity. But, as is said above, if there is no difference in roles among them, there can be no distinction between them. It is only by recognizing and accepting the difference of roles that we can acknowledge the Trinity at all.\nJesus is subjected to the Father.\n\n\"For He has put all things in subjection under His feet. But when He says, 'All things are put in subjection,' it is evident that He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him. 28 And when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, that God may be all in all.\" (1 Cor. 15:27-28).\n\nThe word for \"subjection\" and \"subjected\" in these two verses comes from the Greek hupotasso, which occurs 43 times in the New Testament and is rendered as put (5 times), subject (16 times), subjected (7) times, subjecting (1 time), subjection (9 times), submissive (3 times), and submit (2 times).1 For a complete list of each occurrence of the word 'hupotasso'--so you can see the different senses in which it is used--see All New Testament Verses Listed using the word \"Hupotasso,\" \"subject\".\n\nSo, we see that 1 Cor. 15:27 speaks of creation being in subjection to Jesus and then in verse 28, Jesus will be subjected to the Father. The Greek word-form for \"will be subjected\" is 'hupotagasetai,' which is the future, passive, indicative. This means that it is a future event where Jesus will be subjected to the Father.\n\n\"When this is finally accomplished, Christ will bow the knee to God the Father so that God may be all in all. In so short a passage Paul has traced paradise lost and regained, and the recovery of the submission of all things to God as in the beginning of creation. And it is Christ‚Äôs resurrection that guarantees this.\"2\n\n\"Son . . . himself . . . subject--not as the creatures are, but as a Son voluntarily subordinate to, though co-equal with, the Father. In the mediatorial kingdom, the Son had been, in a manner, distinct from the Father. Now, His kingdom shall merge in the Father‚Äôs, with whom He is one; not that there is thus any derogation from His honor; for the Father Himself wills ‚Äúthat all should honor the Son, as they honor the Father‚Äù (Jn 5:22-23; Heb 1:6). God . . . all in all--as Christ is all in all (Col 3:11; compare Zec 14:9). Then, and not until then, ‚Äúall things,‚Äù without the least infringement of the divine prerogative, shall be subject to the Son, and the Son subordinate to the Father, while co-equally sharing His glory.\"3\n\n\"In an article in the Westminster Theological Journal, Michael Bauman discusses the different kinds of subordinationism during the Arian controversy. He draws a distinction between what he calls emphatic and economic subordination. The Arian heresy taught emphatic subordination which entails inequality of nature and being. Arians asserted that \"a natural inequality existed between the Persons of the Trinity by virtue of their essential differentiation and the temporal derivative character of the Second and Third.\" This is heretical because it is a subordination of essence or nature. Economic subordination, adopted by the Council of Nicea, means that while all three divine Persons are identical in essence, the Son is economically subordinate to the Father with respect to his eternal mission and function. The Son is no less than the Father, but has voluntarily submitted himself to the will of the Father.\"4\n\nObjections Answered\n\n1. There is only one will with God. If the Father sent the Son and the Son did not come to do his own will, then is the Son subordinate in that role to the Father? If so, isn't this a resurrection of the heresy of subordinationism?\n1.1 This objection fails to recognize the difference between the heresy of subordinationism which teaches a difference in nature among the persons of the Trinity and subordination which teaches a subordination or roles within the Trinity.\n2. Doesn't the difference of role mean that the Father commands and the Son obeys? But if this is so, how can the Trinity be of one will?\n2.1 By definition, each person of the Trinity must have his own will; otherwise, they are not persons. The question would then be how does each will relate to the other within the Trinity? The Scriptures don't tell us that the Son obeyed the Father. We are told that Jesus came down from heaven not to do his own will, but the will of the Father who sent him (John 6:38). It would seem that we could conclude that the Father and the Son either did not have the same will, and/or that the Son voluntarily subjected himself to accomplish the will of the Father. Either way, the members of the Trinity work in perfect harmony in spite of there being three persons.\n3. If the Trinity is of one will, how can there be a distinction of wills between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n3.1 The question may not be valid. God is a Trinity of three persons and by necessity, each person must have his own will. The Bible does not explain how this inter-Trinitarian relationship of three persons works in order to accomplish the will of the single God. But we see no logical necessity that says the distinction of wills means that the Trinity cannot act with one will.\n4. If the Son came down to do the Father's will and not his own (John 6:38), then does that not imply there are different wills? But, how can that be since God can only have one will?\n4.1 It would seem that John 6:38 does imply that the father and the son had different wills. We would expect this to be so since the father is not the same person as the son and each person, by definition, must have his own will.\n4.2 Since God is a Trinity of persons, where does it say in Scripture that God (implying a single person) can only have one will?\n<hr>1.

Partiarchy have two different meanings, one being a generic top down hierarchal government body that has a ruler and works as a \"family\" in defiance to the natural family order. The \"Pator\" of a \"Patriot\" is the country whose leaders function as the parents while its citizens are the children, the \"minority\" until they become the parents by being a representative, senator, congressman, parliament member, prime minister, president, dictator, king, owner, judge, etc. An ecclesia has its own \"family\" in the body in Christ that's set apart from the world, but it has family ministers that are not a part of the body in Christ but in the body of Christ that serves the congregation. The Levitical system was its own family serving beneath ten tribes and two half tribes. The Melchizedek system is similar but it through Jesus Christ, every \"family\" could become a part of the ministerial family of the body in Christ (although only Jesus is in the Order of Melchizedek, we inherit the blessings of Jesus just as Abram did), but if they can't, they can at least be the family (last name) minister of the body of Christ, but if there is no need to have multiple family ministers, the rest are servants of God that are also within the body of Christ if they are Christians. None of the ministers are in between God and the Christian believer. The other meaning of Patriarchy deals with the roles of men and women. If the traditional family structure is a foreign concept to you, here's a hint: <a href=\"http://henrymakow.com/000691.html\" target=\"_blank\">Politically Incorrect Advice for Young Men</a>. I have talked a little bit about Ecclesiology here: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/re-error-solo-scriptura/\" target=\"_blank\">Re: The Error of Solo Scriptura</a> if you are interested in that.\n\nThe Identitarian stance is in favor of family bonds and extended family bonds of one's race. I am not refering to the European Identitarianism as a neo right political ideology, rather, the promotion of racial pride, not racial hate. White pride is not hate. Why can black people, asian people, even Jewish people have \"pride\" yet white people can't? Love your own extended family, it's a part of your identity, your genes. To hate your own race is to hate yourself. You don't however, need to adopt your race's traditional national culture. White people are going through some huge psy ops in the destruction of their race, while asians are next in line. Many religions has no clear answer to the protection of one's blood identity. It is not hate to seek to protect your extended family from those of other extended families and their foreign culture. The Hamitic myth came from the Talmud, which was the means of the Jews to justify slavery of black as well as white people, which they were a part of the slave trade along with Islam selling white Christians. White people are not the cancer of the world, the system of empire is, which is a global problem that metastacize and evolves which every single corner of the world had an empire run by any race. The Chrisitan Identity movement has nothing to do with the Identitarian Christian movement. It's not a sin to have miscegenation, but it does produce unwanted, unrighteous consequences of the couple and the offspring that would have an identity crisis. I have discussed this in <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/what-is-race/\" target=\"_blank\">What is race?</a> and in <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/modern-immigration/\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Immigration</a> as to why this is important. This isn't the same as say, the ethnocracy modeled after Lord Palmerston and his cronies, see <a href=\"https://www.schillerinstitute.org/conf-iclc/1990s/conf_feb94_intr_nbs.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Palmerston Zoo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBqKgnTx1h8\" target=\"_blank\">The Palmerston's Zoo (full lecture)</a>.\n\nAny nation with a predominant ethnos should treat their sojourners well, but this does not mean that you need to give anyone any privileges based on their blood but instead by their skill level and dedication in whatever they pursuit. You can have lots of dedication yet have no skills, which gives you nothing. No privileges, no special treatment given to any specific ethnos. Treating people fairly which isn't what we call \"equal\", for everyone isn't equals in everything. Prefering to be with your own ethnos and to seek to preserve it is to value one's own God given bloodline. Creating a more aggressive yet fair environment would statistically favor higher IQ ethnos over lower IQ ethnos naturally, and since people seeks to be in an environment that they can survive in, if they are of a lower IQ ethnos statistically yet have a higher IQ, they can work among the higher IQ ethnos while seeking to help their lower IQ ethnos brethren, empower them with the fostering environment to promote future geniuses to be sought after and favored which in consecutive generations, the lower IQ ethnos might be more genetically predisposed to be smarter than their ancestors when this is done right. However, \"self domestication\" isn't what is going on among lower IQ ethnos often enough which is why redneck white trailer trash people still marry each other not favoring intelligence or seeking to deal with their rather restrictive gene pool predisposed to retarded offspring to consider marrying another ethnos while still being \"white\" which is the only kind of \"miscegenation\" that I'm for as long as the identity crisis that would come from it is relatively minor like being an Scottish-English person in America, your parents being Americans as well. A second generation Japanese-Korean in an multicultural environment among both Japanese and/or Korean people where your parents are from their respective countries is a tough one, for they seek to be more with the side that they can relate more to themselves but in doing so, they need to make the hard decision to either reject a part of their blood in favor of another part of their blood, or to conform to the social experiment which would inevitably make the people of one race like the Brazilians, deprived of their genetic identity for their national one while when done in a global scale in forcing everyone to marry someone that isn't of their kin, race and skin is a part of the goal of the Kalergi Plan. To reject the history of your people for a different identity like say accepting a global barcode (666) identity under the New World Order that would make having racial preferences illegal is to reject who you are.\n\nThe \"Masculinists\" are at times grouped with the MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) people which I believe, are a controlled opposition group that promotes homosexuality, see: <a href=\"http://henrymakow.com/playboy-and-the-homosexual_re.html\" target=\"_blank\">Playboy and the (Homo) Sexual Revolution</a>. Feminists wants to completely switch the roles of men and women while they lie to people that they want true equality of roles. MGTOW and other people wants to have both male and female regardless of sexual preferences to be treated equally, abolishment of all \"privileges\". God made the biology between a man and woman very disctinct and different, and so is the spirit of a man and a woman is different though they are \"equals\" concerning salvation since it is God who chooses those who he wants to save, to make alive their spirit within which people can't repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ by their own power without the Holy Spirit reviving them before they believe with all their heart and mind. The MGTOW people have gay people among them, which some think that the \"battle of the sexes\" is actually a proxy battle between gays and lesbians while the lesbians have the upper hand within feminist groups and gays are not respected because they're men and/or white. They want to gain back any \"privilege\" that the feminists stole from them. The dynamic between the BLM movement, Islam, gays, and feminists is incompatible with each other, yet it's pushed by the Zionist media to imply that all of them should get along while it becomes the means to initiate martial law. It is the Jews that is behind them all, the master of \"privileges\", not even the \"divine right of the king\" privilege is as worse as the Jewish privilege that transcends all \"privileges\", even mocking God's right of telling mankind what to do. Egalitarianism isn't biblical while Complementarianism is loosely based on Plato's ramblings concerning how he defines love but there's some grey areas in trying to use Plato to explain the Christian bible and Plato isn't necessarily against homosexuality/sodomy. That isn't to say that I'm against biblical Complementarianism which leads to biblical Masculinism that is opposed to both Feminism and groups like MGTOW that is against Holy Matrimony, but if women abuse \"Complementarianism\" to push Egalitarianism/Feminism, in the end, it's just a useless label that is deceptive in its premise that rejects genuine Masculinism. Communalists and closet anarchists rejects the masculine nature of the biblical family structure and God and many of these people call themselves \"Christian\".\n\nWomen can own and control land, businesses, teach others (but not other children), scold their own children, ask questions to their pastor, but some of that would ideally change if they get married to a man. Women can't teach others concerning the bible with authority to other Christians in the gathering of the saints, women that are married should ask their husband about doctrines which if he can't answer or resolve, should go ask his pastor in private with his wife about some questions. Women should avoid speaking authoratively concerning religion and how a society should function, though they can ask questions but not in interrupting others while they're talking. When women get married, they should take care of their house, their children, abandon their jobs if they can, do jobs that doesn't take away from their primary jobs as moms and wives. Women should seek to get married just as men should, but men should seek power, women should seek to uphold the family. Unmarried women can do much things, but that \"liberty\" is only maintained within a Patriarchal setting. There's many jobs that women avoid working in because they don't want to. Likewise, there's many jobs that men avoid working in because they don't want to. Gender roles never will vanish for as long as humans are not genetically modified to a third gender or absence of, but that is unnatural \"evolution\" if that were to happen and should be disdained and condemned. There is biblical means to divorce which both men and women should know about, especially the pastors. If they were to divorce, a bill of divorce is necessary to rightly divide property and stuff, so that the woman and the man would still have something. Liberal courtrooms strip men of anything they got. Brendan Fraiser got the unequal side of the unfair bargain of \"alimony\" that pays for the rent of his ex wife for as long as she lives. It is unrighteous and unbiblical to use divorce as a means to leech off of your ex-spouse. Robbing of another's own hard earned money after dividing up the property and goods like getting taxed. I don't know why Biblical Patriarchal Identitarian Christian Masculinism is such a hard concept to grasp for many men and women out there. Being a woman in a patriarchal society is better than being a woman in a matriarchal society, but all human matriarchal governments (let's not compare ourselves to elephants and animals) never last that long, see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxpVwBzFAkw\" target=\"_blank\">Why Women DESTROY NATIONS * / CIVILIZATIONS - and other UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOMkl3ApTK0\" target=\"_blank\">How Women DESTROY NATIONS * / &amp; other UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS (PART II)</a> * UNINTENTIONALLY and/or INADVERTENTLY. Listen to Karen Straughan explain what is going on: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlvMAS_20K4\" target=\"_blank\">Men not marrying? How deep does \"the problem\" go?</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymkwdf7XPKc\" target=\"_blank\">Feminist Shaming Tactics</a>.\n\nThe only way a matriarchy would ever last long is through the Jewish World Order that is the New World Order. You can't escape from the Jews in being behind everything bad for the past 3000 years of history and perhaps even further back which the Old Testament, even the Torah shows their hardened uncircumcised heart which they had adopted through Rabbinic Judaism that is against biblical Christianity and Judaism which ended with and through Jesus Christ. Remember, Jews are not Judahites, some Judahites were Jews, but there are no pure Judahites alive anymore that has the right to rule which only Jesus Christ is Abraham's seed. All Christians are Judahites inwardly, but all Jews are not Christians if they still maintain or hold onto their \"Jewish Identity\", and being a Jew means that you do not believe in Jesus Christ, just as there can't be a Satanist that also believes in Jesus Christ. Jews are those of the religion of Zionism role playing as the Judahites, religious or secular, it doesn't matter. They are worse than the Jesuits, the masons, even the Venetians, for they're all three, the originator and creator of those three and through them, every secret society through their deceptions and through their doctrines that the fools pick up and mimic these Babylonians.\n\nTeach women and men about the uncomfortable truth, the real nature of biblical political Christianity. These xenophilic women are out of order, as well as the feminist men that are just tools of the feminist women and their handlers.\n\nüí´<strong>What does the voices say? Jul 21, 2016 @ 11:12</strong>\n\nOur voices reveal much of who we are and what we think. Every voice is unique and has its own voice signature. That is well known, well studied topic in modern science, but there's much more to this that is yet to be discovered. I will be presenting to you a general blueprint of what I think is going on concerning the nature of voices.\n\nVibration occurs in everything, whether that is sounds or light. Light is not matter, we forget that light bulbs are in a vacuum chamber, there is no matter leaking. Light is a field. In destroying matter, it causes field pertubations but it's not emiting light, a charge is being released as light. There is no physicality to light, but light exists. Sounds is also field pertubation. Sound waves are real, but not a physical matter in itself. It doesn't come from matter, but it could affect matter. Anything that can resonate has energy. A concentrated form of sound waves in water in all directions to a central point creates light via sonoluminiscense. There is no such thing as wave-particle duality for a field can't ever be quantified. Electrons and photons are not physical, there's no physical electron matter flowing through a vacuum from the induction coil to the electric toothbrush. Light is an coaxial, electrical, magnetic, dielectric circuit, a transverse vibration, a longitudinal disturbance as a sound wave in the aether. A candle light's velocity is as fast as the sun's light. The velocity of light is constant, irrespective of the power of the source, not explained through \"Newtonian physics\" (actually Leibniz, Kepler, and other scientists' collaboration which Newton claimed for the Royal Society, see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSk3OIrhDfA\" target=\"_blank\">The Harvard Yard: Fraud of Modern Education</a>). The so called speed of light is the rate of induction. Light de-excelerates through a physical medium but re-excelerates when it leaves it. Light is not going through a physical medium like sounds are. Light is an attribute of the field as field perturbations with compressions and rarefractions. Field pressure is also electric current, but you don't see locomotives go through the physical line. Magnets also makes field pressure compressions and rarefractions which is why it can affect the screen of a Cathode Ray Tube TV.\n\nWhat creates matter? The emanation from counterspace (inertia and acceleration/aether) is space (loss of inertia), nihil ex nihilo, those who believe in any deity or a lack thereof that seeks \"if A, equals B\", to a Monist, they are illogical. Though some Christians want to claim that counterspace is an attribute of God, such thinking is epistemological and presuppositional while true Monism is ontological and seeks no contradictions and presuppositions. They can't believe that God can exist in and of itself. As light and illumination is inseparatable for illumination is an attribute of light, so is nothing (space) an attribute of nothing (counterspace) but vice versa its own principle and attribute. Where did \"counterspace\" come from is something that we can't answer scientifically, only religiously. Monism claims that everything always was, that time is not a quantity, for an eternity, nothing was, nothing is. When it all came to being is what Monism doesn't bother with. To them, nothing always was and exists regardless of there being any hyperdimensional to make it into being.\n\nCymatics or \"wave\" beyond the level of a subset of modal vibrational phenomena using sound waves on a physical medium would deal with the natural patterns created by light which is field pertubations. Light is not created as a byproduct of the field, it is the field. Electric field, magnetic field, dielectric field, they're all one and the same in different modality and emanation from counterspace. Looking at interesting shapes formed on top of oscillating plates at certain frequencies doesn't \"prove\" anything except that how sounds can be visually represented on a 2D plane appearing 3D in its movements that looks alive, when it's really subject to the same laws of nature that is subject to the golden ratio/angle. Everything is interconnected in this reality. There is no such thing as straight lines. Nature draws lines away from the center point, radiating from it outwardly in opposition to the other lines that come from the center point, but it all returns to the center, creating a reciprocating precessional hypotrochoidal field that creates space as well as destroying it although space has no properties and time is only a measuring stick, not a part of the field. If God spoke light into being, he would had vaused field pertubations somehow through his spirit voice which in his omnipotence, is strong enough to sustain the electric field of the universe in its own. The Sun gets its energy from its location in the galaxy, but where did all of its energy come from and was it formed immediately? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKI23Az9YKs\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy in a light bulb</a> <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cosmic-induction-generator#/\" target=\"_blank\">Cosmic Induction Generator</a> If Eric Dollard had made a galaxy in a lightbulb, then the question comes in mind, is our universe created in a \"lightbulb\" or did it always exist in and of itself?\n\nLet's move on to more \"spiritual\" things. There's two ways God audibly speaks: loudly, or with a \"still small voice\". Many Christians think that since the spirit of Elias is the Holy Spirit, everyone has the \"still small voice\" of God telling them what to do, a voice that isn't of the demons nor of yourself. The problem with this theory is that it is reliant on experience which when said experience contradicts scripture, they would make God a liar. That isn't to say that we are not lead by any sort of \"gut feeling\", and I am not talking about gut flora affecting the mind, rather, our very unconscious expressed through reverse speech. What was revealed in reversing rock in roll lyrics is not that demons control them, rather, the true meaning of the lyrics is expressed through the reverse speech that of which is only unconsciously picked up by others through their gut feeling as to what it might mean to them which isn't revealed at face value. David John Oates discovered this phenomena with an explanation while Christians only attributed it to Satan although negative reverse speech unconsciously affects the listener negatively. David Oates believe that it can be used to verify testimonies and should be used in a court of law to know one's unconscious intent which their own soul that learned the human language in reverse hints at when reversing the speech which generally 15 to 30 seconds of someone speaking what's on their minds, a reverse speech phrase or sentence comes out that in the same language the speaker was speaking in in the proper grammatical structure of the language. This means that liars can't get away with saying certain things. You can't just learn how to talk backwards in hopes to change what you speak in reverse, for the way that you pronounce those words will vary while you can't sound like you're purposely speaking in reverse. Though I wouldn't use reserve speece in a court of law, it is useful in intelligence agencies in forming a psychological profile, as well as to be used in therapy which David Oates does indeed uses it for such purposes. It shouldn't be underestimated.\n\nWhether or not there are demons literally speaking is a mystery, but it is plausible for me. All those ghost voice EVP recordings are done in places of demonic activity or a history of such, like grave sights and abandoned hospitals, churches, mansions, etc. Since Christians believe that human souls are either go directly to heaven or hell, or that the soul sleeps temporarily, it is not dead humans that make those sounds, and those \"ghosts\" are disembodied demons. Trying to \"contact\" spirits is a sin, so perhaps demons give them what they are looking for in exchange of them committing sins that then gives them the grounds to enter into the sinner or cause havoc around them, which demons are daimon/daimonos, they distribute fortunes whether relative good or bad, it's all done to divert your attention from the gospel, from knowing God. Demons do talk to those with Multiple Personality Disorder/Dissociative Identity Disorder, tricking the host soul into thinking that it is its own voice. Some unconventional psychologists and Kabbalistic-Freemasonic Swedenborgians had found out in their experimentations that these voices when they possess the user, they also possess their body which to them, physical pain hurts them in multiple magnitudes than it hurts the host being, so demons could be sensitive to bodily senses, but that doesn't mean that demons always possess people while they trick people to do bad things. It would then follow that they would leave the body of the host temporarily when they had convinced the human in harming them. When Jesus commanded Legion to go inside the pigs and die, they had to physically die. Demons have some laws concerning when they can physically manifest themselves in physical plane, for if it is against the will of God, they can't do so. Many rituals are really invalid and have no power in itself, rather, through contract, through sin, they enter into the lives of others. Anyways, what I never forget is that demons are convincing liars, so perhaps demons don't feel pain when they control their host and are only faking it.\n\nSharry Edwards had discovered something interesting. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldcYxHA2lqg\" target=\"_blank\">The Potential of Sound</a> BioAcoustics‚Ñ¢ the idea is that the voice is a biometric representation of health and wellness. By understanding the connection of the recurrent laryngeal and direct vagus nerve with the brain, vocal assessment has the potential to provide significant biological information. When we speak, the vibrations of the vocal cords create resonances that reverberate throughout the body. These resonance frequencies, are what we in BioAcoustics‚Ñ¢ refer to in our assessments as Frequency Equivalents‚Ñ¢, have an entrainment influence on the brain and the nervous system. The technique of Human BioAcoustics as put forth from the Institute of BioAcoustic Biology &amp; Sound Health uses voice spectral analysis as a tool to identify the constant and complicated frequency interactions within the body. This is a bunch of copypasted info from a website. In other words, only by how your voice sounds, a computer software program can analyze and identify your body's own physical problems almost perfectly, while with a different program, one can listen to sounds that is made personally for your voice to counteract and balance the sounds that you are weak or strong in. Sounds therefore, can heal and damage you, depending on what sounds your body needs and doesn't need.\n\nHere's where my speculations come in. If MPD/DID causes different voices if they had spoken through the host body just as the eye conditions change as noted by some eye doctors, perhaps through reverse speech, they might be able to be exposed as to what they're really thinking, as well as through human bioacoustic biometrics, take note of any differences in the body's physical state under specific personalities, and on top of all that, creating frequency equivalent sounds immediately for every time they speak in hopes to neutralize the negative effects of the body by them. Believe it or not, Homeopathy can, and had been used for psychiatric purposes. Homeopathy is also vibrational. It gets picked up in spectrometers despite being practically the medium containing the unseen amplified vibrational signature. Can frequency equivalents be used against stuff like radiowaves, Wi-Fi, and other near microwave radiation? I sure hope our technology can be improved to that measure so that we can purify the mechanical, artificial, digital manmade noise out of the cosmic background noise within our currently toxic environment, nullifying all the negative vibrations, restoring the positive vibrations. There could be good healing high level frequencies that we haven't discovered yet although Royal Raymond Rife had discovered some, though it's not used in an ambient level over wide open spaces to cancel out bad waves and amplify good waves, partially because it doesn't work like that. If multiple homeopathic remedies can be released wirelessly, taking Radionics to the next level, that would be amazing, though without the outdated knobs that Radionic boxes used to have. It would be the most nonevasive method in combating the dangers of the wireless fog we live in. There was in fact, some experimentations with Radionics and Homeopathy Apparently, someone had been able to transmit homeopathy to the hair of the person which form some reason, is tied to the person, and RADAR is used, see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ienjZfv8wRU\" target=\"_blank\">How To Transmit a Homoeopathic Medicine through Hair Dr.Ravi Singh</a>, <a href=\"http://homeoenergy.com/book/\" target=\"_blank\">http://homeoenergy.com/book/</a>.\n\nThe more negative usage of reverse speech is to implant good reverse speech phrases in rather bad overt speech so that the gut instinct would accept the bad implications overtly because they unconsciously accept the good reverse speech that the soul understands but doesn't comprehend in detail as to why they have a good vibe to what they're saying. Some Rife frequencies also targets various types of cells of the human body when not careful. Human bioacoustic profiling can show what someone has \"too much of\" which then they can wirelessly transmit certain sounds made specifically to amplify the prevalent illnesses in the body. Demons might be aware of all these things and influence Satanic people to make more specific, more powerful, perfected targeted weaponry at a distance, insert audible voices within people's minds with deceptive reverse speech, frequencies that promote illness or termination of your own cells, and so on. Chemtrails/Statospheric Aerosol Geoengineering sometimes contains created XNA nanotech lifeforms which when attached to the host body, it forms a crystal. Therefore, wireless transmission and such can cause piezo-electricity, which means that if there were a significant amount of it on people, Rife frequencies transmitted at a distance could directly affect you. If they've improved their tech, they can make it big enough to cause serious side effects besides the parasitic ones, always at the will of what is transmitted from a tower, the Transhumanist-Globalist goal of creating perfect slaves. However, it seems like their immediate goals are instead to reduce the population to 500 million first.\n\nüí´<strong>Sugar Baby Love Jul 23, 2016 @ 10:42</strong>\n\nSugar, sugar, sugar! One of the most notorious, misunderstood word in health is sugar. Not everything sweet is sugar, not everything called sugar is good sugar. Good sugars are vital for energy, while bad \"sugars\" are creating toxins from within the body in trying to process it. Even good sugars are to be avoided in some cases, but even so, without \"sweets\", your body is incomplete.\n\nGod had made good things in nature sweet as proof that something is good to eat. Just as cooking meat gives off a good, savory aroma that naturally produces a biological response to salivate in some people, so is sweet foods bear signs of nutrition that the body craves for. Instinctively, sour and bitter foods at times gives a negative response, but if it was supposed to be sweet, it is spit out. However, in experience, if it provides the body nutrition and promotes well being, you learn to eat it. What I am saying is that it is a learned behavior to think of sour, bitter, pungent foods to be healthy for one's health, while it is not learned behavior to seek after sweet food. Many sweet foods are naturally full of fiber, proteins, enzymes, and such. However, not all naturally sweet foods are naturally safe to eat, that should be a given by now.\n\nAll carbohydrates are \"sugar\", but there is qualitative differences in its structure. What we call sugar is usually the very sweet form that is processed for its sweetness. All \"sugar substitutes\" are things that substitutes sweetness and does not have to be a carbohydrate, although there are some exceptions. There are four types of carbohydrates: monosaccharide, disaccharide, oligosaccharide, polysaccharide. Saccharide comes from the Greek word œÉŒ¨Œ∫œáŒ±œÅŒøŒΩ (s√°kkharon). Monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polyols are subgroups of what is commonly called \"sugar\". Polyols are \"sugar alcohol\". Oligosaccharides are in its own class which its subgroups are malto-oligosaccharides (maltodextrins), and other oligosaccharides that isn't maltodextrins. Polysaccharides are in its own class which it's subgroups are starch and non starch polysaccharides. Starch is a polysaccharide, a polymeric carbohydrate composed of glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds. Starch therefore is also \"sugar\" since it is comprised of a bunch of glucose, a simple sugar/monosaccharide. However, since there is a qualitative difference between starches and simple sugars, they can admit to say that there is little to no \"sugar\" in grains and potatoes because starch is not a monosaccharide, a disaccharide, nor a polyol. Calories are written down in two forms: cal, Cal. The capital C stands for kcal or kilocalories. Calories spelled out is in units of 1, not in 1000. Just because something has no calories doesn't mean that it's good for you. If you live in a bad country, the use of k is dropped for capital C. What if you were reading the labels wrong into thinking that there is no \"sugar\" and that there is a low amount of calories that isn't in the thousands? This is the most simplistic, yet deceptive method into tricking people in consuming more than what they had sought to.\n\nThe most common forms of monosaccharides in a diet are glucose, galactose, and fructose. The most common forms of disaccharides are maltose, lactose, and sucrose. Disaccharides contain two monosaccharides, oligosaccharides contain 3 to 19 monosaccharides in a chain, and polysaccharides contains 20 or more monosaccharides. Polysaccharides are also called glycans. Polysaccharides can be divided into two subcategories: homopolysaccharides/homoglycans, and heteropolysaccharides/heteroglycans where homopolysaccharides have one type of monosaccharides while heteropolysaccharides have two or more types of monosaccharides. There's two types of homopolysaccharides that occur in nature to store monosaccharides: starch, which comes from plants, and glycogen, which comes from animals. Your body stores glucose as glycogen in the liver. There are other homopolysaccharides like dextran and cellulose. Glucans are polysaccharides that contains many glucose molecules. Dextran is the structural component of bacteria and yeast. Dextrans are made up of glucans and is commonly found in dental plaque, synthesized from sucrose by certain lactic acid bacteria. Sucrose is a disaccharide of glucose and fructose. Avoid sucrose as well as fructose, I'll get to that later. Your body cannot digest cellulose by itself. Heteroglycans rarely have three or more different monosaccharides/simple sugars. The major hetero(polysaccharides/glycans) include the connective-tissue polysaccharides, the blood-group substances, glycoproteins (combinations of carbohydrates and proteins) such as gamma globulin, and glycolipids (combinations of carbohydrates and lipids), particularly those found in the central nervous system of animals and in a wide variety of plant gums.\n\nThere's different types of starch and stuff made from starch like food additives, starch sugars and modified starch. Common starch sugars include maltodextrin, various glucose syrups, dextrose, high fructose syrup, and sugar alcohols/polyols for consumption. Modified starch are called starch derivatives, which dextrin being one of them. Don't confuse dextrin with dextran. Cyclodextrin and maltodextrins are different types of dextrins. Maltodextrin is a polysaccharide used as a food additive whereas cyclodextrins (sometimes called cycloamyloses) are a family of compounds made up of sugar molecules bound together in a ring (cyclic oligosaccharides). Cyclodextrines are used in food, pharmaceutical, drug delivery, and chemical industries, as well as agriculture and environmental engineering. Dextrins are a group of low-molecular-weight carbohydrates produced by the hydrolysis of starch or glycogen. Genetically modified starch can be modified (genetically modified) starch or modified GM starch. New food additives are made from GM starch. Starch is not 100% pure homoglycans, it contains almost everything else from the plant that it came from, so it will contain the plant's DNA, the herbicide used on the plant, the contamination that occurs during manufacturing and processing. Starch is also used as an excipient, a natural or synthetic substance formulated alongside the active ingredient of a medication. GM starch excipient might be a reality. Having strictly GMO free starch excipient in your medications is a must to not have Monsanto and DuPont's -cides suffix poisons as well as GMO DNA.\n\nThere is something called resistant starch. It is considered a type of dietary fiber to lower insulin. Resistant starch (RS) is any starch or starch digestion products that are not digested and absorbed in the stomach or small intestine and pass on to the large intestine. RS has been categorized into four types: RS1 Physically inaccessible or undigestible resistant starch, such as that found in seeds or legumes and unprocessed whole grains. RS2 Resistant starch is inaccessible to enzymes due to starch conformation, as in high amylose corn starch. RS3 Resistant starch that is formed when starch-containing foods are cooked and cooled, such as pasta. Occurs due to retrogradation, which refers to the collective processes of dissolved starch becoming less soluble after being heated and dissolved in water and then cooled. RS4 Starches that have been chemically modified to resist digestion. By definition, resistant starch does not release glucose within the small intestine, but rather reaches the large intestine, where it is consumed or fermented by colonic bacteria (gut microbiota). On a daily basis, human intestinal microbiota encounters more carbohydrates than any other dietary component. This includes resistant starch, non-starch polysaccharide fibers, oligosaccharides and simple sugars which have significance to colon health. The fermentation of resistant starch produces short-chain fatty acids, including acetate, propionate and butyrate and increased bacterial cell mass. The short-chain fatty acids are produced in the large intestine where they are rapidly absorbed from the colon, then are metabolized in colonic epithelial cells, liver or other tissues. The fermentation of resistant starch produces more butyrate than other types of dietary fibers. Butyrates aid in giving colon cells energy while encouraging cancerous colon cells to commit apoptosis or programmed cell death. Since you know the general differences between starches, it is important now to realize that you should seek to consume starchy foods that contain higher amounts of resistant starches for your larger colon's cells to prevent colon cancer that way, but of course, having a healthy gut biome is necessary.\n\nWhen you take in foods containing sucrose, you would feed the yeast and bacteria in your body. However, yeast is not what you want to have much of in high quantities. Candida, a genus of yeast, used frequently in flour. Say goodbye to bread, cakes, pizzas, stuff made in bakeries, almost everything that uses Candida Albicans. Not everything that uses yeast is bad, Kombucha is made from yeast, but there's other strains of bacteria being used in those. Yeast is fungus, fungus creates mycotoxins, mycotoxins causes cancer and allows the yeast to merge with the host cells into forming cancer by bypassing and changing the p53 gene that prevents cancer cells from forming, thus, apoptasis doesn't occur, and the cell becomes immortal and again, becomes a part of the yeast which metastasize like fungus when released into the blood stream. To beat candida is not to stop taking \"sugars\", but to replace the gut flora by introducing healthy good bacteria from kefirs and yogurts, as well as eating resistant starches in using butyrates to trigger apoptasis in the p53 gene. Stopping the consumption of sugars aggravates the candida to accelerate growth. Alcohol contains mycotoxins which alcohol is the byproduct of yeast. Look into carcinogenesis, you would find many things. Cancer is not solely caused by candida, but it is imporant to avoid feeding it too much sucrose and fructose in its extracted, concentrated form. Sucrose in its natural form is always accompanied by dietary fiber, enzymes, vitamins, minerals, etc. A juicy, delicious fruit when ripe contains high levels of sucrose, assuming that it should be sweet. Sweetness is a sign of maturity and ripeness in sweet fruits and vegetables. That isn't to say that you should take protein powders and dietary fibers in its extracted form, they would make you sick. This doesn't mean that you should eat lots of fruits and vegetables, they're still high in sugar compared to animal products and byproducts, but what about honey? Isn't honey supposedly really bad for you?\n\nTaken from the video description of<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoTH5FYo5CU\" target=\"_blank\"> Honey, Survivalist Superfood. Only Quad-Purpose Superfood that Exists</a> (with some formatting):<blockquote>(Honey is) the only QUAD-PURPOSE Survival superfood on earth. As an antimicrobial agent, honey may have the potential for treating a variety of ailments. Antibacterial properties of honey are the result of the low water activity causing osmosis, chelation, its slow release of hydrogen peroxide, high acidity, and the antibacterial activity of methylglyoxal.\n\n1. water purification\n2. cut scrape and wound treatment\n3. attribute - NEVER EVER GOES BAD, 3000 year old ancient egyptian honey STILL edible today!\n4. cures meat and fish and other foods.\n5. move to a new area local honey inoculates one against allergies\n6. attribute - denser calories and lower glycemic and is quicker digested than sugar\n\nTable sugar is sucrose, which is made up of two molecules bonded together. When we eat table sugar, our stomach has to use its own enzymes and works HARD to separate the molecules apart before we can use the sugar's energy. Honey is quite different. The bees have added a special enzyme to the nectar that divides the sucrose into glucose and fructose -- two simple sugars for our bodies can absorb directly MUCH faster.\n\nHoney has a healthier Glycemic Index (GI)\nSugar doesnt have vitamins and minerals OR antibiotics in it!!\n\nHealthiest skinny people I know eat TONS of honey....NOT SUGAR!!!\nEveryone needs at least 50 pounds raw honey on hand....if you CAN freeze it, freeze it.\n\nOne tablespoon of table sugar or sucrose contains 46 calories, while one tablespoon of natural honey has 64 calories.</blockquote>\n\nWould I avoid eating honey when I'm having cancer? No, it also contains polysaccharides which takes time to break down as it goes to the larger intestine and breaks down to butyrates via good gut bacteria which then activates the p53 gene causing apoptasis while revitalizing your colon cells. Not all polysaccharides are resistant. Besides that, honey again, has other properties mentioned, but please take in moderation, and don't confuse it with heated, filtered honey. Honey was naturally protected by honey bees, but since we can use smoke on european bees to calm them down, harvesting honey became a thing. Remember, not all bee species have a colony. Therefore, the question remains, did God made the honey bees for man to exploit them, or should we lower our consumption of honey because the very honey bees that harvests nectar are also equipped with stingers. Besides the exploitation of Haitian people into slave labor in Dominican brown sugar plantations owned by the Vicini family, don't get brown sugar, it's inferior to raw organic unfiltered unheated honey. Don't get agave syrup, it's factory processed to extract the fructose from the agave plant and to break down the polysaccharides into simple sugars. It's practically high fructose syrup. Consumption of large amounts of fructose can be deleterious and can trigger fructose malabsorption, metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, decreased glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and accelerated uric acid formation. If you sweared by agave syrup to be good for you, you're easilly duped by food trends. It's not nectar either. I don't know of any company that gets agave nectar from agave flowers. Blue agave is used in tequila, so you're indirectly supporting companies that also make alcoholic drinks. The consumption of the sugar alcohol: erythritol, would feed Brucella, causing Brucellosis, which they frequently target reproductive organs, causing abortion, infertility in both men and women. Erythritol as \"Steviol glycosides\" also has a hormone structure similar to gibberellin and kaurene that also causes infertility. Xylitol is only good for brushing your teeth, but it can cause diarrhea and your body does not digest it well. Avoid sugar alcohols, they're just as bad as alcohol like ethanol as an example. Avoid sugary stuff added into the food like pastries, sugar cereals, sweet chocolates (they should be bitter and dark, high in cacao, low in milk and sugar) gummy bears, sodas, and so on. Fructose metabolizes like alcohol, but at least it's still real sugar. Sugar alcohols leave the body craving more real sugar, so you're better off giving it what it desires with honey than to taking sugar alcohols.\n\nIn TCM, if a person craves sweets, this is a sign of spleen deficiency. The spleen deals with sweets first. Learn more about the spleen: <a href=\"http://www.itmonline.org/5organs/spleen.htm\" target=\"_blank\">The 5 Organs Network of Chinese Medicine - Spleen/Stomach</a> Homeopathy also can prevent and heal sugar related illneses despite being \"sugar pills\".\n\nGo cold turkey on bad sweets, only eat honey as good sweets, take foods and/or supplements containing healthy gut bacteria, don't eat too much fruits and veggies, eat more meats and fats, lower your carb intake by eating foods containing higher levels of resistant starch, avoid GMO starch excipients, avoid stupid health trends, learn to read the nutritional labels.

It's a corporate funded experiment that isn't a double blind or triple blind study, the same corporation that had worked with IG Farben (AKA: Bayer). Although I don't believe in the Holohoax, I don't believe that Nazi Germany was 100% good, it was more of an 50/50 thing. On one side, they used to be Zionists but for political reasons, the British government abandoned Germany. On another side, they were controlled by some Zionist Jews that killed off the anti-Zionist Jews that were sent to the labor camps to keep them suppressed which Typhus happened to broke out (no that is not because of the Jews). For the 13 years that Hitler made Germany great again before Hitler implemented the pre emptive strike method to save some persecuted Germans in other countries say in Poland that sought help from their motherland, there were no Freemasons, no banking Jews, no degenerate culture that the Jews brought into Germany after WWI, it's pretty much the exact opposite of what Merkel's doing. Hitler's Germany used fluoridated water in the labor camps for research purposes, IG Farben did some huge human experimentation that the modern world had taken for granted of its research yet because of the stigma placed by the religion that is the Holocaust, the modern world hide these facts. They also hide the fact that practically all countries conducted drug experimentation and human experimentation in the name of \"psychiatry\" which strangely enough, can be tied to the Jews: <a href=\"http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/J/bo3615668.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jewish Origins of the Psychoanalytic Movement, Klein</a>\n\nOne of the most basic things self taught people that looked up conspiracy theories online since around 2000 and onwards is that fluoride is one of the master poisons used that destroys people's health. Black and Hispanic people are more affected by fluoridated water than White people. Japanese people were also adversely affected by fluoridation. Concerning fluoride's detrimental effects for now but the trend is that the genetically stupid people gets stupider from fluoride than genetically smarter people, so yes, niggers are dumber than spics and beaners as they get even dumber with the same poison than spics and beaners. Nazi Germany used fluoridated water, and they got that idea from USA, see: <a href=\"http://truth11.com/2009/12/01/nazi-connections-to-flouride-in-americas-drinking-water\" target=\"_blank\">Nazi Connections To Flouride In America‚Äôs Drinking Water</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7BqFtyCRJc\" target=\"_blank\">The Great Culling: Our Water Official Full Movie</a>\n\nSea salt is \"acidic\" and lack many minerals in comparison to salt mined from a mountain. Here's a concept that won't make sense at first. Lemon water is \"acidic\", but the body takes in its digestive enzymes and sodium, chloride, potassium, iodine minerals to maintain pH balance in the blood. If you eat something fatty, drinking some lemon water will help your body to release the fats. Factory processed table salt is rumored to contain a third microscopic glass and a third microscopic sand mixed with crystalline sodium chloride which is why white table salt is bad for one's veins as it cuts up the wall which then chloresterol comes in to cover up the damaged vein wall but since people continuously take table salt, it gets worse and worse. The solution is not to lower cholesterol (which is a precursor to many nutrients that our body needs) but to throw out the table salt. Fortified table salt now might contain aluminum as well, see Wikipedia about salt (but again, Wikipedia is anti health). Fortified table salt is worse than \"regular\" table salt, though what Latin America takes is fluoridated fortified table salt. If you don't want to clog your veins, one: don't be afraid of cholesterol, two: stop adding processed salt to your food, three: stop taking any food, drink or supplements that contains ADDED calcium, four: stop drinking soda, period. Pasteurized milk with added calcium is inferior to raw milk with nothing added into it.\n\nBecause of the UN, practically everywhere in the world, everyone drinks a low level of chlorine in the water. Because bromine is preferred over iodine, bread is toxic and detrimental to your thyroid and also is toxic to your health. Without filtering your water, simply leaving out your water to sit for 24 hours to have it evaporate before you drink it would help. Don't take bread, avoid pantry stuff. Most people can get plenty of carbs from fruits and veggies alone.\n\nFluoride/Fluorine, Chloride/Chlorine, Bromide/Bromine, and Iodide/Iodine are elemental buddies. The human body does not need Fluoride/Fluorine and Bromide/Bromine. We get Chloride/Chlorine but those with autoimmune disorders should avoid their exposure to pool water and other sources of Chloride/Chlorine as possible. When the body take in Iodide/Iodine, the body chelates F, Cl, Br while some Iodide/Iodine is taken into the body as nutrition. If you give what the body needs, the body will let go what it doesn't. Iodide/Iodine should ideally be taken with selenium (Magic Johnson's cure for the mythical \"HIV\") and fat soluble B vitamins. Usually people use a Potassium Iodine and Potassium Iodide solution called \"Lugol's Solution\". I add a few drop of that to soup and things that have a strong taste because the metallic taste is hard to get used to. A higher concentration or more drops of that can be used to purify water, though having a water ozonator machine would be preferred, second being colloidal silver water.\n\nPink himalayan salt contains iodine, but like 80+ other elements as well. It isn't \"acid forming\" like sea salt so it's good for one's digestion and also good for one's veins because of its wider spectrum of elements. It calms some people down, probably because it also contains magnesium, while it doesn't have the impurities that factory processed salts and sea salts contains. It's Artisian tier salt. It is delicious, it doesn't have that strong salty taste, it has a subtle flavor when lightly used to flavor stuff. Assuming what you get from the store isn't sprayed through with fluoride before it gets packaged as \"PHS\", it doesn't contain high levels of fluoride (although it does have a little bit naturally, see: <a href=\"http://themeadow.com/pages/minerals-in-himalayan-pink-salt-spectral-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">Minerals in Himalayan Pink Salt: Spectral Analysis</a>). Redmond salt is #2. I haven't tasted it but really once you go pink, you can't go back. I have tasted black salt, red salt, white sea salt from Okinawa, they all suck.\n\nHimalayan Salt is a bit expensive, but real health in general costs more money than junk plebian food. Either you spend more money on higher quality food, or spend even more money for surgery and possibly shorter lifespan due to chemical buildup of junk food. If your family doesn't switch completely to PHS or Redmond salt, you are probably taking junk salt. Be careful when around salt, there is an assault against your salt. Just don't be too salty. Regular table salt is bad in every way possible. Your body needs a good source of salt, so eating seafood might be an alternative to eating salty foods. Your body needs more sodium than potassium. Whenever you make a fruit or veggie smoothie, add a little Himalayan salt. Your lungs being made up off 98% or so of water, needs some salt to hold in that water in the lungs. If you got asthma attacks, put a wee bit of Himalayan salt under your tongue along with a little bit of water during an attack. That would trick your body into thinking that it has ample amount of water in the lungs.\n\nSalt is not addictive, just as fats are not addictive. Caffeine, alcohol, sugar, they're all addictive, but caffeine has relatively less damaging effects than sugar and alcohol though it will make you forgetful and stupid. Fluids are not water, whatever fluids you take in, whatever amount of water in that fluid is not only expelled but also robs more water off of your body. You can't really talk about salt without talking about water. Watch Dr. F. Batmanghelidj talk about water and salt: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xweziIaUMo\" target=\"_blank\">Water, Natural salt (Not sodium) first, then diet and exercise in that order!</a> but if you want the best summary of everything concerning water, watch this: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwB0JKl8Ew\" target=\"_blank\">The Water You Drink Is Killing You</a>.\n\nüí´<strong>Is Christianity a Religion? Jul 31, 2016 @ 15:42</strong>\n\nHere's some words defined by <a href=\"http://www.constitution.org/bouv/bouvier.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Bouvier Law Dictionary 1856 Edition</a>:\n\nLIEGE, from the Latin, ligare, to bind. The bond subsisting between the subject and chief, or lord and vassal, binding the one to protection and just government, the other to tribute and due subjection. The prince or chief is called liege lord; the subjects liege men. The word is now applied as if the liegance or bond were only to attach the people to the prince. Stat. 8 Hen. VI. c. 10; 14 Hen. VIII. c. 2; 1 Bl. Com. 367.\n\nRELIGION. Real piety in practice, consisting in the performance of all known duties to God and our fellow men.\n\n2. There are many actions which cannot be regulated by human laws, and many duties are imposed by religion calculated to promote the happiness of society. Besides, there is an infinite number of actions, which though punishable by society, may be concealed from men, and which the magistrate cannot punish. In these cases men are restrained by the knowledge that nothing can be hidden from the eyes of a sovereign intelligent Being; that the soul never dies, that there is a state of future rewards and punishments; in fact that the most secret crimes will be punished. True religion then offers succors to the feeble, consolations to the unfortunate, and fills the wicked with dread.\n\n3. What Montesquieu says of a prince, applies equally to an individual. \"A prince,\" says he, \" who loves religion, is a lion, which yields to the hand that caresses him, or to the voice which renders him tame. He who fears religion and bates it, is like a wild beast, which gnaws, the chain which re-strains it from falling on those within its reach. He who has no religion is like a terrible animal which feels no liberty except when it devours its vic- tims or tears them in pieces.\" Esp. des , Lois, liv. 24, c. 1.\n\n4. But religion can be useful to man only when it is pure. The constitution of the United States has, therefore, wisely provided that it should never be united with the state. Art. 6, 3. Vide Christianity; Religious test; Theo- cracy.\n\nTHEOCRACY. A species of government which claims to be immediately directed by God.\n\n2. La religion qui, dans l'antiquite, s'associa souvent au despotisms, pour regner. par son bras ou a son ombrage, a quelquefois tents de regner seule. Clest ce qu'elle appelait le regne de Dieu, la thiocratie. Matter, De l'influence des Moeurs sur les lois, et de l'influence dos Lois sur les moeurs, 189. Religion, which in former tinies, frequently associated itself with despotism, to reign, by its power, or under its shadow, has sometimes attempted to reign alone, and this she has called the reign of God, theocracy.\n\nREGNANT. One having authority as a king; one in the exercise of royal authority.\n\nECCLESIA. In classical Greek this word signifies any assembly, and in this sense it is used in Acts xix. 39. But ordinarily, in the New Testament, the word denotes a Christian assembly, and is rendered into English by the word church. It occurs thrice only in, the Gospels, viz. in Matt. xvi. 18, and xviii. 17; but very frequently in the other parts of the New Testament, beginning with Acts ii. 47. In Acts xix. 37, the word churches, in the common English version, seems to be improperly used to denote heathen temples. Figuratively, the word church is employed to signify the building set apart for the Christian assemblies; but the word eclesia is not used in the New Testament in that sense.<hr>The question here is twofold: can there be a theocracy of liege men without the liege lord or regnant present, and would this be under royal law, or ecclesiastical law? What I think is that though there could be a royal decree in the formation of an ecclesia, I don't know at what point it constitutes as a theocracy. What I do know that if Christianity is used by a nation as a political authoritative stick to put people in their place, it is no longer qualified to be a genuine ecclesia. The more \"humanitarian\" you are, you would probably seek some form of biblical justification to try to not use the same \"church\" system of the heathen temples and to separate that from ecclesia. Kuriakos/kuriakon is where \"church\" comes from. Church is not ecclesia, ecclesia is not church. Until Jesus Christ comes and become a sort of an benevolent dictator or a philosopher king, there won't be a 100% theocratic ecclesia ruled directly on earth from earth ending all objections by royal decree. Therefore, any ecclesia formed is a social experiment that is subject to interpretation, subject to eisegesis even if they don't intentionally seek to misinterpret the bible. Unless something big happens like purging the world in flames and making the New Heaven, New Earth, Jesus Christ would never be accepted 100%. In the Partial Preterist/Amillennialist stance, we're already in the allegorical 1000 year reign of Christ. However, the general interpretation is not literal concerning a physical reign, and people still share the gospel message within this time period that nobody knows specifically when it would end, while the Kingdom of God is not literal but spiritual among the Christians. It is therefore, eisegesis to push biblical literalism to form a humanitarian cult with Christian pretenses by insisting that God had demanded Christians to make a theocracy without Him being with everyone like in New Heaven, New Earth, and it would also seek to do away with the prophecies that had yet to occur though in some forms it symbolically has within Revelation 20. God's priority is the salvation of one's soul, and setting up an ecclesia is a secondary goal for now. Christians can seek to form a genuine ecclesia, but we must all come to know that whatever that might be, is still a social experiment until the New Heaven, New Earth. Get saved first, then perhaps consider seeking spiritually matured Christians to form a proper ecclesia. You would need to mature in your faith before making potentially rash decisions that might turn out to be bad company, seeking to use and trick people into their system that they pretend to \"know it all\", be \"the only way\" and abused the \"us verses them\" rhetoric. Social. Experiment. Try to grasp what is being said here.\n\nüí´<strong>Hello again!

That's the one many know about concerning Preterism but not Partial Preterism which considers the 1000 year reign as a figurative, symbolic age of the church that Jesus Christ would reign through the Holy Spirit to all of the world through Christians. At the end of that 1000 year reign, the spiritual Jerusalem that is the Christians wherever they are, are in danger since after the figurative 1000 year, Satan gets out of the abyss and deceives many, in tempting people to go against God and His Christians. God puts an end to it all for good through a \"fire baptism\" of punishment that burns up all the unbelievers up and also burns up the oceans and cleanses the whole world. Then everyone gets judged in front of God in judgement day and get sent to either the lake of fire/\"hell\"/gehenna or the new heaven new earth new Jerusalem. Whether or not \"judgement day\" occurs to people immediately after their death is a different matter altogether that really doesn't even matter that much since everyone gets judged by God in the end. Those that prefer premillenialism/futurism are those that believe that God would save them from their suffering that God had predestined them to go through. They can't cope with God being as such, they can't cope with death, they can't handle what history actually says about it, and they don't want to live in a world that the only \"prophecy\" left is to wait for God to burn up the world while before then, Satan (not to be confused with his army) gets to mess around with people, leading them away from God. All but two chapters in the bible is fulfilled, so all that end time eschatology that idiots learned in a bad bible college is a waste of their time and money unless they try to forcefully apply prophecy that had already happened before.\n\nThe Scofield bible pushes \"pre-trib\" that falls under futurism as in, the tribulation is in the future. Those that are \"mid-trib\" or \"pre-wrath\" also technically believe that the tribulation is in the future, ergo, it's still futurism. Those that believe in \"post-trib\" yet believe that's in the future still look forward to seeing the beginning of the book of Revelation to be fulfilled for it hasn't happened in their interpretation. Futurism is inherently premillenialism because they don't include a rapture after the figurative 1000 year reign, they never ever mention that there's other views concerning this and when they do, they would point to the nonsense that is Full Preterism, also known as Hyper Preterism that thinks that the whole book of Revelation and consequentially, the whole bible was already fulfilled, that the \"new heaven, new earth\" is only in \"utopian communities\" among the \"visible saints\", a highly humanitarian perspective that isn't biblical. Only Partial Preterism can be Amillenialism since to the Hyper Preterist, there is no rapture, everything's done and fulfilled. There is a type of \"rapture\" that has not happened which was falsely attributed to the time of Jacob's trouble during the tribulation in Jerusalem from AD 66-70. At some point in history, people somehow mixed up historicism with pre-wrath and post-trib premillenialism and calling pre-trib as futurism when they're all premillenialism and they seek a rapture before the 1000 year reign. This issue had duped the most fundamental of so called Christians, but by the grace of God, I've gotten out of that deceptive mindset. What's worse than the footnotes of the Scofield reference bible is the writings of Francisco Ribera SJ that predates it. In some forms, even the Protestant Reformation itself tried to imply that the Jews are going to be saved when history says otherwise concerning the fall of Jerusalem. Josephus records how the Christians were not there in the destruction of Jerusalem. Only the Christians and the Christian Judahites escaped, the unbelieving Judahites were not saved. Again, the Jews are not Judahites, so they're butthurt for nothing which their lies are built upon. Only a couple theological seminaries teach Partial Preterism to be biblical, since I rarely ever hear anyone talk about it, and I've \"church hopped\" in many denominations.\n\nTo clarify, the Partial Preterist stance is not futurism not because some Partial Preterists don't necessarily believe in the rapture, but because they don't believe that the \"tribulation\" is in the future, but it's in the past while the rapture of the living happens before God cleanses the earth in fire, happens after the end of the church age, while everything else before that like Satan being locked up and the time of Jacob's trouble had happened in the past.\n\nThere's a comparison near the bottom of this website: <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/PartialPreterism/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/PartialPreterism/index.html</a> It says \"8th trumpet\" though there isn't an 8th trumpet, rather, a voice like a trumpet:<blockquote>7th TRUMPET\nA parousia of Christ\nJerusalem\nJudgment on Judaism\nFulfils Matthew 24\nEnds the Old Covenant Age\nProceeds from preaching the Gospel to Jews first throught the oichoumene (Empire)\nSuffering, misery and death\nSatan is bound\nThe beginning of Christ's Kingdom\n\n8th TRUMPET\nThe Final Parousia of Christ\nEarth\nFinal Judgment\nFulfils Matthew 25; 1Thess.4; 1Corinthians 15\nEnd of the Age\nProceeds from the making of disciples of all the nations (Matthew 28:18-20)\nSuffering, misery, and death done away with (Rev. 21:3-4)\nSatan is damned\nThe culmination of Christ's Kingdom (Eph.1:10; 1Cor. 15:24)</blockquote>\n\nTaken from <a href=\"https://biblicisminstitute.wordpress.com/2015/10/27/where-is-satan-now/\" target=\"_blank\">Where is Satan now? | Biblicism Institute</a> (with my objections in bold):<blockquote>He is currently chained and imprisoned in the bottomless pit.\n\n‚ÄúThen I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed‚Ä¶‚Äù Revelation 20:1-3\n\nThe abyss is a horrific place, even for demons.\n\n‚ÄúFor Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man‚Ä¶ And Jesus asked him, ‚ÄòWhat is your name?‚Äô And he said, ‚ÄòLegion‚Äô; for many demons had entered him. They implored Him not to command them to go away into the abyss.‚Äù Luke 6: 29-31\n\nTHE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS\n\nAfter Christ rose from the dead and went up to heaven in 30 AD, He patiently waited 40 years for the disobedient Hebrews to accept Him as Messiah. <strong>Objection: many Partial Preterists insist that Jesus went up to heaven in 30 AD and that 40 years had passed before the destruction of Herod's Temple, but actually, Jesus went up to heaven riding on a cloud in 34 AD and so it wasn't 40 years, 4 years off, so I wouldn't be dogmatic about it have to be 40 years. Josephus by the way, is inconsistent in his dating, see: <a href=\"http://torahtimes.org/writings/josephus-unreliable/article.html\" target=\"_blank\">Josephus‚Äô Unreliableness</a></strong> The reason He waited was because the Hebrews were:\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶beloved for the sake of the fathers; for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience, so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy. For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all.‚Äù Romans 11: 28-31\n\nBut, in 70 AD, Christ unleashed hell upon the disobedient ones. He opened the abyss and allowed its resident demons to escape in order to devour them (through war).\n\n‚ÄúThen the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him. He opened the bottomless pit, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit. Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.‚Äù Revelation 9: 1-4\n\nAll the chalices in Revelation were curses God poured on the disobedient Hebrews who refused to acknowledge Him. The trumpets that blasted their introductions along with the four Horsemen were all designed for those Judahite Hebrews who crucified the Lord. However, those who accepted Him fled Judah/Judea before the beginning of sorrows and of the Apocalypse in AD 70.\n\n‚ÄúBut when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is near. Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those who are in the midst of the city must leave, and those who are in the country must not enter the city.‚Äù Luke 21: 20,21\n\nSoon after Pentecost, Christians took Jesus‚Äôs warning very seriously. They started selling everything they had with an eye towards leaving Judah or Judea.\n\n‚ÄúThey began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need.‚Äù Acts 2:45\n\nThose Christian Hebrews who escaped the infernal LAST DAYS of the Old Covenant embodied 1) ‚Äúall Israel shall be saved‚Äù of Romans 11:26 and 2) the grass of the earth‚Ä¶ (the) green thing‚Ä¶ (the) tree of Revelation 9:4 that were not to be hurt.\n\nConsequently, those Christian Hebrews were the ones who did not have the mark of the beast. Their symbolic number in Revelation is 144,000 (12 tribes squared/Father &amp; Son x 1000/many or 12¬≤ x 1000). Those with the mark of the beast were annihilated. <strong>Objection: This is partially a Binitarian or maybe Arian interpretation, and I'm neither, for I am a Trinitarian. I don't think the numerology here is that important, for it is clearly symbolic of the Israelites whether or not you know why John used that number. My interpretation is that every tribe had 12, self affirming that they're still Israelites in a fractal form, and ultimately were related to each other anyways.</strong>\n\nIn other words, there are NO LOST TRIBES of Israel roaming about. They‚Äôre all DEAD. Besides, if they‚Äôre lost, why don‚Äôt they pick up a cell phone and call someone. After all, this is the 21st century.:-)\n\nThe Apocalypse of 70 AD was the day of reckoning for those who killed the Messiah and the end of the age of the Hebrews and of the Old Covenant.\n\n‚ÄúI am with you always, even to the end of the age.‚ÄùMatthew 28:20\n\nWhile God poured the chalices of His wrath on the disobedient Hebrews and shut down the Old Covenant, the whole earth felt the ripples of the dying Old Order and experienced the birth pangs of the New Order as the physical war spread.\n\n‚ÄúYou will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet the end. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes. But all these things are merely the beginning of birth pangs. Then they will deliver you to be persecuted, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name. At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another. Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many. Because lawlessness is increased, most people‚Äôs love will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved. This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.‚Äù Matthew 24: 6 ‚Äì 14\n\nOnce the Old Order came to an end, Christ zoomed in on Satan the Serpent and had him bound and thrown into the abyss.\n\nWhy?\n\nSo he would deceive the nations no more the way he deceived the Hebrews and the world.\n\n‚ÄúThe god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.‚Äù 2 Corinthians 4:4\n\nHowever, only Satan was bound and thrown into the bottomless pit. The locusts or demons that were released therefrom are still rummaging about, like chickens without heads or in this instance without their head Satan. <strong>Objection: the locusts here can be interpreted as the Roman army just as the book of Joel had used \"locusts\" figuratively and literally. Satan is a general collective of anyone that is an \"adversary\" to God, but in this instance, it seems to be more appropriately referring to the demons which were locked up because just as the LEGION pigs implied that they were going to be in the abyss some day.</strong> In other words, their capacity to wreak havoc and their deceptive prowess are limited, but to the spiritually naked (i.e. those without Christ) they still pack a punch, albeit not as impactful as before.\n\n‚ÄúFor we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.‚Äù Ephesians 6:12 <strong>Objection: the Geneva Bible has a better translation: \"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, and against the worldly governors, the princes of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness, which are in the high places.\" Against the worldly governors? Princes? Now why is that not in the KJV? They sought to remove any authoritative titles in order to validate the pagan, English, and Venetian Divine Right of Kings doctrine.</strong>\n\nSatan‚Äôs incarceration is for a thousand-year period ‚Äì not a literal thousand, just like the thousand in the following verse is not literal either:\n\n‚ÄúFor every beast of the forest is Mine, The cattle on a thousand hills.‚Äù Psalm 50:10\n\nThe word thousand in these instances means many or a great amount. The cattle on the thousand and first and second and third hills do not belong to someone else, they still belong to God.\n\nWith that same understanding, Satan is bound for a thousand-year time as Christ reigns over the earth through the New Order, and no one but God knows when that unlimited period will end.\n\nWhen it does, God will release Satan for a little while.\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.‚Äù Revelation 20: 3\n\nUpon his discharge the following will take place:\n\n‚ÄúWhen the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison, and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore. And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.‚Äù Revelation 20: 7-9 <strong>Objection: there's a theory which a book called the \"Matrix of Gog\" shows that the Khazarian Jews are Magog while Gog is their \"king\", that they are already forcefully seeking to destroy the people in physical Jerusalem/Palestine, already in war in the Gaza strip while imprisoning the Palestinians in the Gaza strip and West Bank. They are spiritually, mentally, geopolitically at war with Christians and had invaded physical Palestine and also wherever Christians are in the high places. Who knows what would happen?</strong>\n\nThe beloved city is the spiritual New Jerusalem, not the physical Old One. It is comprised of the Saints of God or Christians.\n\n‚ÄúI saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem‚Ä¶‚Äù Revelation 21:2\n\nChrist will intervene in that final spiritual war by ‚Äúraining fire from heaven‚Äù to destroy the enemies of His Bride the Church Assembly and by shutting down the course of history, thus bringing about the end of the world. This is how Jesus described it:\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, ‚ÄúFirst gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.‚Äù Matthew 13:30\n\nThe tares will be gathered first. Not the Saints.\n\n‚ÄúThen we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.‚Äù 1 Thess 4:17\n\nThen finally:\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶ the devil who deceived them (will be) thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.‚Äù Revelation 20: 7-10\n\nSatan‚Äôs angels along with those who reject Christ and those who supposedly follow Christ but reject His commands will also partake of the eternal fire:\n\n‚ÄúThen He will also say to those on His left, ‚ÄòDepart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels‚Ä¶‚Äù Matthew 25:41\n\n[See How to Become a true Christian and avoid that eternal anguish.] <strong>Objection: the original link leads to an article that I don't agree with.</strong>\n\nThose who follow Christ and obey His commands will be rewarded.\n\n‚ÄúThen the King will say to those on His right, ‚ÄòCome, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. ‚Äù Matthew 25: 34\n\nAnd then Christ will start everything over.\n\n‚ÄúThen I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea.‚Äù Revelation 21:1\n\nNo longer any sea is symbolic for no longer any abyss, the pit wherefrom came the demons.\n\n‚ÄúThe dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea.‚Äù Revelation 13:1\n\nTherefore, there will be no more demonic and destructive forces in the new earth to contend with.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSatan is currently in jail, just like an incarcerated mafia don whose goons are running amok in the streets. <strong>Objection: we don't know that for certain, but what is certain is that the fire from heaven would happen first, then the \"rapture\".</strong>\n\nThat is why the Apostle Paul penned the following:\n\n‚ÄúThe God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.‚Äù Romans 16: 20\n\nThat crushing was the expected binding of Satan who was subsequently thrown into the abyss.\n\n‚ÄúAnd Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúI saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.‚Äù Luke 10:18\n\nNote\n\nRemember, the entire New Testament ‚Äì including the Book of Revelation ‚Äì was written prior to 70 AD and must be read with that context in mind in order to understand many of its passages.\n\n‚ÄúNot forsaking the assembling of ourselves together‚Ä¶ and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.‚Äù Hebrews 10:25\n\nIn addition, the Word JUDAHITE not JEW is in the Bible. The word JEW is a mistranslation and causes quite the confusion about the Book of Revelation, especially since Jews are NOT the Hebrews of the bible ‚Äì all the Hebrews are irrevocably dead. Therefore, the bible is not talking about the Jews nor about modern-day Israel, but about the Judahite Hebrews of old.</blockquote>\n\nThe post apocalyptic \"Synagogue of Satan\" now goes to the Samaritans that pretend to be Judahites yet adopt their Pharisaism, moved to Babylon then Europe then all over the world then back in Palestine persecuting Palestinians who were long time ago related to each other but no longer are due to merging with people of other nations, so those people in Palestine are more white than anything, white washed Palestinians against Palestinians that sometimes adopt the Islamic faith. Don't \"free\" Palestine, instead, kick out the Judahite wannabes to Madagascar. Over half a million Palestinians displaced yet these white washed Palestinians want to keep a perpetual state of \"Hiroshima\" to the Gaza strip and the remaining Palestinian land not under the rule of white Palestinians? That's what's going on. Let Palestine be Islamic, they're not the radical Wahhabis being funded by foreign countries. Islam made a pact to the Vatican and by extension all \"Christians\" to protect their homes and churches, though that doesn't mean that I'm for Sharia Law, just saying that in comparison to the Jews, real Muslims of the Islamic faith that's against Sufism and such black magic rituals isn't as destructive as the Jews that work behind the scenes to put Christianity and Islam against each other and if both sides knew, both sides would be able to effectively kick out the Jews from high places. What the illegal State of Israel is doing is making experimental weaponry and selling them to other nations. There is no biblical ground for supporting a literal Israel, a literal Jerusalem.\n\nDoes that mean all the Reformers are wrong as to the real interpretation of the Book of Revelation? No. Some would say that Luis de Alcasar SJ created the myth of Partial Preterism, that it helped the Papacy and such, but Futurism was \"created\" by Francisco Ribera SJ yet they give a blind eye towards that and how there's Catholics that believe in Sede Vacante (besides SSPX but in the Roman Catholic Church's history) existed before the Jesuit Order itself had pushed a mix of Futurism and Historicism in identifying popes as Anti-Popes or just not legitimate popes therefore the seat is vacant, and also how this blaming of the RCC served to help the Venetians and the Jews to divert the blame away from them, utilizing genuine movements to adhere to some of their bidding which the Protestant Reformation is guilty of such compromises. The Roman Empire was the Beast and Rabbinism was the Harlot, but now the Jews run the nations/beasts in the world and Roman Catholicism is one of their many victims of their degenerative cancer furthering the destruction of the patriarchy. The Reformation was controlled in the first place through the Lollards. It was only until later when Martin Luther and some others became anti Rabbinism which was a part of biblical Christianity. John Calvin, Martin Luther, John Wyclif, C. H. Spurgeon, Arthur Pink, Noah Webster, the writers of the Geneva Bible, and many more were \"Historical Preterists\" (closer to what I call biblical Partial Preterism): <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/c/calvin-john.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/c/calvin-john.html</a> <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/l/luther-martin.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/l/luther-martin.html</a> <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/w/wyclif-john.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/w/wyclif-john.html</a> <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/s/spurgeon_c-h.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/s/spurgeon_c-h.html</a> <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/p/pink-arthur.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/p/pink-arthur.html</a> <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/w/webster-noah.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/w/webster-noah.html</a> <a href=\"http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/g/geneva-bible-notes.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.preteristarchive.com/StudyArchive/g/geneva-bible-notes.html</a>. Partial Preterism isn't wrong just because a Jesuit wrote about it. Athanasius Kircher SJ for example, had drawn up a map of Atlantis which turned out to be a small submerged island which Danny Wilten had discovered: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY30rU1_ZIQ\" target=\"_blank\">Athanasius Kircher's Atlantis - Updated Map &amp; Plato's Dimensions - Danny Wilten</a>. Anti Zionism is a part of biblical Christianity, yet it just so happened to be that scholars and Messianics relying on Jewish (Talmudic, Kabbalistic) interpretations of the Christian bible that they corrupted with their tradition, pushing a false name of God over the real <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/name-of-god/\" target=\"_blank\">Name of God</a>. All the things mentioned in <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/biblical/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Biblical\"</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/rudimentary-constituence-satans-cults/\" target=\"_blank\">The rudimentary constituence of Satan's cults</a> articles applies to this.\n\nTed Pike's The Other Israel and Steven Anderson's (and Texe Marrs') Marching to Zion therefore, in some forms, had fallen for Jewish propaganda that they had yet to tackle directly. Texe Marrs might be a closet Partial Preterist for promoting the Matrix of Gog book, but on the other hand, he could be just open to interpretation concerning escatology, though focused on exposing the Jews. Texe Marrs is right that America is Babylon, spiritually speaking, submissive the the cult of Rabbinic Judaism that came from Babylon, AKA: the \"Jews\". Since I don't think that the Jews are Judahites, I don't think that they, the Judahites, would ever repent and accept the Christian God like the Judahite Christians that had escaped the 3 and half year war, because THERE ARE NO JUDAHITES LEFT. Ted Pike doesn't believe in Replacement Theology and also believes in Futurism. Steven Anderson knows the futility of endless genealogies, but he believes in Premillennial Mid-trib/Pre-wrath Futurism. I don't know if Ted Pike knows that the Holocaust was a Holohoax, but Steven Anderson sure does.\n\nGetting eschatology right is not enough to stay clear off of all lies from the Jews, but it is a huge step forward into accepting that the Judahites all died out. If that step isn't made, there leaves much room for fear, uncertainty, and doubt to seep in. Covenant Theology is the politically correct form of Replacement Theology which the difference between them concerns whether or not all Jews are Judahites, which they are not, and whether or not all Judahites are Jews, which they are not but they had also either merged with Christianity or had died out and spread through their Pharisaism making gentiles \"Jews\" by faith. That is why Covenant Theology is wrong and I now stand firm in that. There is much seeming conflicting contradictions of what Luther and Calvin had said concerning Replacement theology, whether or not the Jews as a race are saved, though I suspect this is just a linguistic trap due to the limitations of our language in conveying denotative explanations behind the words that are used. That does not mean \"Jews\" can't be saved, they just need to let go completely of that RELIGION. Just as you might call yourself a Luciferian Christian, or an Atheistic Christian, or a Humanistic Christian, or a \"Messianic\" Christian, or a Christian that only listens to the red letters and reject everything else in the bible, doesn't mean that you really are a Christian. Why? It should be obvious why since I've already explained it. Authentic Judahites by blood are harder to scientifically prove that they exist, not to say that they don't exist within the gentiles, but there is no reference to authentic Judahite stock, it's all speculations or lies. Don't deal with endless geneaologies.\n\nPerhaps the most notable reason why Americans might seek to help the Zionists because of the similar story that the Puritans had gone through. The Puritans left England to the New World, and sought to kill off the Amerindians as Moses' Israel left Misraim for the promise land and sought to kill off the Canaanites as the Zionist Rothschilds (((Bauer))) lead the Jews to Palestine and sought to kill off the Palestinians. Moses claimed that the land of the Canaanites was ultimately was the land that God had promised to Jacob. However, there is no biblical prophecy for the Jews to supposedly return to Palestine. All the Old Testament prophecy of the Judahites returning to their land had already happened before the events of the New Testament had begun. Not only that, God had divorced flesh and blood Israel and had destroyed Herod's Temple just as Jesus had promised. American Christians and Christians all across the world should stop feeling any sympathy for the Jews for their misinterpretation of the bible, rather, disdain from them and correct their errors with confidence.\n\nFor some more information, watch in this order: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5yh-LB7sAQ\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5yh-LB7sAQ</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9MYoZEwuQQ\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9MYoZEwuQQ</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTXGfztVqKQ\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTXGfztVqKQ</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufLAitMq3zI\" target=\"_blank\">The Zionist Story</a>.\n\nüí´<strong> Some Examples of Memetic Psychological Operations Aug 23, 2016 @ 04:06</strong>\n\nThe Jewish controlled Communist Russians had brought disinfo concerning the moon landing to be a hoax into America to have the Americans lose their trust in the system and the funding that went to NASA which by the way, the inventions that were made in order to fulfil the dream that JFK had presented had contributed to the American economy in supplying a steady source of new ideas and industry structured around innovation for the technology used for the space program in turn has multiple uses from finding and utilizing a better source of energy, defense, transportation, infrastructure, computations, communications, life preservation, understanding of nature, and many more. The UFO disinfo that the US and Russia had was to trick each other and also to cover their own secret flying machines in the realm of aviation as UFOs, though among the various UFOs recorded by people, how much of it were of extraterrestrial source is for me, not that clear but what I do know is that most of it isn't really reliable because they're controlled by people with a monopoly in getting money from people by hiding some of the things that they know of, groups like MUFON which Joe Jordan exposed. The more practical explanation is that UFOs are controlled by people in secret government bases. NASA unfortunately, had become a political tool for Prince Philip controlled environmentalists and their NGOs after JFK's assassination, as well as being blamed for faking pictures on Mars on Devon Island, Canada, see: <a href=\"http://humansarefree.com/2015/12/where-on-earth-are-nasas-rovers-sending.html\" target=\"_blank\">Where On Earth Are NASA's Rovers Sending Pictures From? Devon Island, Canada</a>. However, NASA wasn't always evil, though they fell for Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, the ad hoc theories that they come up with in trying to explain unexplainable observations as the truth is dishonest to say the least, most of which can be explained by those that understand the Plasma/Electric Universe theory which is a legitimate criticism that seeks to pick up where modern science had stopped progressing through promoting people like Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, Francis Bacon, Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison while suppressing people like Johannes Kepler, Gottfried Leibniz, Carl Gauss, Henri Poincare, Oliver Heaviside, James Clerk Maxwell, Nikola Tesla. Unfortunately, the Plasma/Electric Universe people don't understand what say Nikola Tesla understood.\n\nWhat has come to my attention and many others is the rise of more relatively sophisticated disinfo that spreads faster than wildfire, a mindset transplanted through an intellectually engineered mind virus that's infecting the series of tubes, forcebly targeting specific groups of people against their will without the infected knowing what intent had took over their own will in invoking a desired reaction. Selfies for one, is such an example of a forced meme mistaken as an naturally formed meme by the sheeple to encourage people to share their biometric data of their faces which some people otherwise wouldn't participate having their photo online which the selfie meme becomes an excuse for closet narcissists to upload their faces attached to their social media accounts that is stored in a datamining company in M-DISCs which would last a thousand years, while facial recognition software, along with surveillance cameras placed all over would make you much more trackable with an everlasting database. Besides the \"memes\" that became stale yet persists to seek relevancy among the internet with clickbait material and trying to keep up with the memes while establishing their status as an e-celeb, some of these memes had served to sow confusion and doubt among the general truther movement to the point of being beyond an individual scammer selling an idea for profit regardless of its authenticity and methodology used to come to certain unwarranted conclusions, but a collective of scammers sharing the same thing, dedicating all their time on it, and had been proven to be funded or mastered by a lobbyist for truthers or forming their own groups with initially genuine intentions but later hijacked from outside interest groups, if they already didn't have their agents among the genuine groups to start with, while the more people adhere to their teachings, the more layers it forms around themselves to keep the true nature of the groups occulted. Many look from the outside towards the inside, but in most cases, the perspective isn't always the same as from the inside looking towards the outer layers as well as the more inner most layers. That does not mean that what such groups present themselves publicly is not damning enough concerning what their motives are, which is undeniable. Some of such groups concerning Christians is the Anglican King James Version Onlyism movement, any Christian denomination that has ties to Anglicans, Espicolicans, Methodists, Pentecostals, \"Evangelicals\", the Freemasonic, pro Zionist Messianic/Hebrew Roots Movement, the revitalized Freemasonic Flat Earth Society, the Christianized Ancient Aliens \"Nephilim\" pseudo-xenoarchaeology, the \"every symbol is Saturn\" dimwits, and so on and so forth. I am more focused on those that seek to use memes for their favor. I'm not going to talk about what seems to be propaganda, rather the attempt to use memetics as a form of propaganda in which one knows what is \"memetics\" while the other doesn't yet it ultimately serves the same purpose.\n\nIn its core, the disregard of etymology, history, logic, and science brings forth the political brainwashing nature that these terrible forced memes invoke against humanity which more often infects those with average to low IQ people and on occasion, infects higher IQ people with a low mindset that ensnares them and makes them think deeply yet insanely. For example, the \"original\" Flat Earth Society was pretty much dissolved through the death of Charles K. Johnson on March 19, 2001 while the Flat Earth Society of Canada survived. The earliest Flat Earth proponets in America was Freemason Samuel Rowbothan who has ties with the Owenites as an ex-Owenite whom Robert Owen and Charles Fourier influenced the Venetian-British controlled Fabian Society as the father of British Socialism and through the Fabian Society, those two had indirectly influenced the Jesuits, Karl Marx (whom by the way has common ancestry to the Rothschilds via Barent-Cohen of Amsterdam), the Frankfurt school, Bertrand Russell, Kibbutzim, and the UK Labour Party, thoroughly funded by Zionist lobbyists. There's much more to be said concerning \"SIR\" (knighted) Samuel Rowbothan but he didn't use memes. It is his followers that are increasingly controlled like a mason's widow: Lady Elizabeth Anne Mould Blount pushing what she calls Zetetic Astronomy based off of Samuel Rowbothan's ramblings calling it Zetetic Astronomy. It is also under her that the Zetetic Society came about which is also a Freemasonic debate/lecture club. Jesuit trained Freemasonic evangelical faith healer John Alexander Dowie founded Zion, Illinois. Their churches taught the Flat Earth lie through the KJV but it's actually eisegesis, making it say whatever you wanted it to say to have no biblical epistemology of the Christian faith, ignore the principle of non-contradiction, reject properly applied textual criticism, and just throw out logic out the window. His follower, Wilbur Glenn Voliva was their apologist and spread the false gospel all over the world as far as Australia through his radio station. He was a millionaire in deceiving dumb idiots, having 5 million USD in 1927. His father was also a Mason. From Voliva came Samuel Shenton, also a Mason, renaming the Universal Zetetic Society into the Flat Earth Society that Charles K. Johnson took over. Flat Earthers hate it when you call them Freemasons as they abuse ad hominem hatred against everyone that has any ties to Freemasons, but they are historically pushed by them. Just because a Freemason knows that 1+1=2 doesn't mean that they are always lying to you concerning the answer to 1+1. The modern International Flat Earth Society gets money from dumb sheeple while conveniently hiding the facts concerning the Jesuit, Freemasonic ties that the revitalized IFES claims to be its spiritual successor in. This level of deception is like how the Seventh-Day Adventists claim to not be controlled by Freemasons when from the beginning and continuing through this day, they were always was and always will be Freemasons within their inner circles.\n\nThough Lodowicke Muggleton was claimed to be an early proponent of the Flat Earth hypothesis (not a theory, not a fact) by Bob Shadewald (see: <a href=\"https://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/flat/flateart.htm\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/flat/flateart.htm</a>), nobody knows for certain if he really was one. What I do know is that he isn't a Calvinist, pushed Quietism, have a fringe Protestant sect called the Muggletonians, hated the Quakers but was guilty of the same accusations he had given to them, was worked within the City of London, and \"Puritan\" is a vague description for real Puritans were essentially Anglicans that sought to reform the Anglican church and the state to be less Papish. There's considerable time between Muggleton and Rowbothan, but the claim that a truly Reformed Protestant sect would promote the Flat Earth garbage is simply false. Real Reformed Protestants don't believe in a translation, but the gospel message. The English Reformation tried to subvert the Protestant Reformation for their favor but they were also anti Protestant AND Catholicism, which Anglicanism is a sort of a compromised state sponsored religion of the Church of England. Martin Luther also compromised and allowed the militarization of Lutherans by compromising his convictions, pleading for protection under the princes of Germany to protect his church while giving Germany the spiritual position to defy the Vatican while having a Christian social order in place of it that's controlled by the state. I don't think the Puritans that left for the New World believed in the Flat Earth, Christopher Columbus had set sailed to the New World already which is why the Puritans even know that such a place exists. They brought not the KJV but the Geneva bible that had footnotes which at that time, was full of scholarly notes of the Reformed Faith that explained verses and the definition of some words in the source texts used to translate them into English, so they had no relative unbiblical, unscholarly, eisegetical literalism.\n\nFlat Earthers abused Poe's Law to appeal to honest and legitimacy (something so crazy that it might be true), create ad hoc explanations that would answer any objections at face value but will not suffice as a proper answer when such ad hoc explanations would only build up to the point of being much more clear that they are abusing logic by first assuming that logic is infallible, therefore, any explanation is made valid even if it's insufficient. With the corrupted worldview, fallible methodology, and simply spreading the word enough to find stupid people, Flat Earthers do what they do, but the problem is that the online Flat Earth Society came out of nowhere, while the already corrupted NASA gets even less money under the Obama administration. It is highly suspected by many that this is CIA PSYOPs by looking at the past with the CIA pumping disinfo about the UFO conspiracy alongside with the KGB mutually trolling and baiting each other. The Flat Earther movement didn't spread like wildfire, it wasn't gradual. One day, a bunch of these disinfo agents came out of nowhere and started sharing some bullshit. Multiple flames were started and all not only converged and created a fire all across the world, it PERSISTS. The initial boom of Flat Earthers was mistaken as an actually genuine movement of imbiciles, but more and more and more of them came about and share the same thing, complain about the same thing, use the same ad hoc explanations, and they've been going at it very long and hard to prove their stance, infecting other controlled alternative media groups which makes their stance more seemingly all encompassing as a worldview that has answers to everything when in reality, they were placed there to infect pre-existing truther movements by associating Christians and truthers alongside with these Flat Earthers to be anti-science and such. There's probably more Flat Earthers than the other controlled groups on Youtube, filling up your research with irrelevant video suggestions concerning reality.\n\nHere's some links to cast unto these Freemasonic Flat Earther swines for it never seems to be enough proof against their presuppositions: <a href=\"https://eyewarnub4eye8u.blogspot.com/2015/05/flat-earth-masonic-jesuit-cia-psyops.html\" target=\"_blank\">FLAT EARTH MASONIC JESUIT CIA PSYOPS - ERIC DUBAY &amp; MATTHEW BOYLAN 'CO-ADJUDICATORS'!!!</a> <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/live-iss-stream\" target=\"_blank\">Live_ISS_Stream on USTREAM</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikmOGqA7R7A\" target=\"_blank\">Flat Earth &amp; Fake NASA Conspiracy COMPLETELY Debunked into Oblivion - Case Closed Forever (RIP)</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCh-tbTd_Pc\" target=\"_blank\">Flat earth stupidity exposed</a>.\n\nWhat ties the Flat Earthers and Moon Hoaxers together is the fact that in 1980, the Flat Earth Society accused NASA of faking the landings, arguing that they were staged by Hollywood with Walt Disney sponsorship, based on a script by Arthur C. Clarke and directed by Stanley Kubrick, see this article from 1980: <a href=\"http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/fe-scidi.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/fe-scidi.htm</a>. This is why you can't debate them, they abuse Poe's Law like crazy religious fanatics yet asserts their stance that they're right even though they never ever properly explain their own tangental made up laws of physics correctly. The evidence is widely available to them, yet it's their religious conviction, their presuppositions that blinds their thinking. They again need to realize that they don't know that they know and that their methodeutic to derive to know is flawed before they can start thinking again, but if they have a low IQ to start with, you simply just can't get through them at all.\n\nIf we had gone to the moon, we would have to make certain preparations in order to make the improbable, possible, and also reexamine the purpose behind those that perpetuate a lie concerning the moon landing being a hoax. First and foremost, all calculations needs to be done from a geocentric perspective. Why is that important? It's to make things EASIER to calculate the trajectory of point A to point B in the perspective of point A than to calculate the trajectory of point A to point B in the perspective of point C. Once they had reached point B like say the moon, they COULD use the mooncentric perspective, but Houston is in earth, and so it keeps on using the geocentric perspective. That being said, there is no geometric differences between the Tychonic model to the Copernican model to the Ptolemaic model, but all three didn't use ellipses but circles within circles to simulate seemingly ecliptic motions that can allow everything that the modern concept of the \"Heliocentric\" model has in using ecliptic orbits instead of circles going around in a bigger circle while rotating in space. Kepler's model is an improvement off of the Copernican model while the Tychonic model is an amalgamation off of the Ptolemaic model and the Copernican model. Most people don't grasp the Ptolemaic model, neither heard the Tychonic model, and doesn't know that there's a modified Tychonic model in which the stars are fixed but has the sun at its center while the sun orbits around the earth. <a href=\"http://geocentricity.com/geocentricity/refs.html\" target=\"_blank\">There is no physical difference between the Geocentric model and the modern Heliocentric view</a>. There is Globular Earth Geocentricity, Flat Earth Geocentricity, and last but not least, the most absurd; Concave Earth Geocentricity. Geocentrist does not automatically mean Flat Earthers. They will try to group any Geocentrist to a Flat Earther. Most Protestant Christian Creationist Scientists are Galactocentric, that based on what we can observe, our Milky Way galaxy appears to be in the center of the universe. There is two forms of Globular Earth Geocentricity: the one that thinks the distances between the sun, moon, planets and the stars are at least three digits or more shorter than what numbers Heliocentrists provide while the other thinks that the distances calculated are legitimate and accepted by both Geocentrists and Heliocentrists, as I've already shared that <a href=\"http://geocentricity.com/geocentricity/refs.html\" target=\"_blank\">there is no physical difference between the Geocentric model and the modern Heliocentric view</a>, while on the other hand, the Flat Earth model is also a \"near sighted\" model, for the lack of a proper term, so the sun, moon, planets are also smaller, but in the Flat Earth model, they cannot be using the same distances that traditional Heliocentrists and Geocentrists uses. In essense, what they believe in is similar to someone playing in the Minecraft world except that the sun and the moon doesn't go straight up and down from east to west while in a globular model, the sun and the moon COULD go straight up and down depending on your geographic location usually closer to the equator.\n\nThere needs to be some way of shielding the space shuttle and the space suits to protect themselves from the Van Allen belts' radiation, and also when going through the earth's atmosphere. The space suits are not really meant to go through the earth's atmosphere but the space shuttle uses ceramics for that purpose, but what would they defend themselves from the Van Allen belts? Besides the ceramics, they would use Polyethylene, and 3 millimeters of it is needed to have enough protection. They've also used reflective material in the Apollo 11 mission. Even with that, astronauts are in potential danger from direct contact from solar flares and many develop problems up in space like tunnel vision and loss of bone density and after comin, but they're still alive and they're not fried up. If you still pay for those TV sets with DVR and if you live in the USA, you can probably see the NASA TV channel for yourself. Just leave that channel on and learn the rudiments concerning all things space exploration. You could optionally look for Youtube videos of foreign space programs in what they do because the fundamentals don't change. To make sure the moon landing goes right, they need to play pretend, set up a studio in doing simulations of the moon landings for practice and to avoid making certain mistakes. In later years, many of these simulations are done in a big indoor pool for a more realistic training, dealing with similar replica machinery that they intend to fix or improve in the real thing up there in the ISS. Of course some moon landings were faked and was shown on TV, it was an exercise for the real thing but it seems like some people didn't know that studio footage was aired on TV at times, though there were real footages aired on TV. Where did I get the claim that NASA aired mock moon landings on TV? Look at this: <a href=\"http://archive.is/8jpF0\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.is/8jpF0</a>. That link by itself debunks many of the claims made by Moon Hoaxers and in extension, Flat Earthers. I'm also drawing some other information from it as well for this article, so to give credit where it's due, thanks Jim Stone for being firm in your stance. Wikipedia has surprisingly great articles on this as well: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings</a>. I don't really need to prove that the moon landing was real beyond this point really, I've directed you to where I get these claims from.\n\nConcerning Mars, all I have to say about that is if NASA had continued to receive its funding in perfecting nuclear fusion rocket propulsion technology, we would of had 7 day round trip missions to Mars by now, all the while mining the exotic resources on the moon to further improve nuclear fusion technologies and even contribute for future mining on Mars and even terraformation of the Martian environment. People had disposed that baton but Russia, India, and China, even North Korea seeks to improve their technology and thus, for the benefit of all of humanity to bring forth new inventions, a by-product of dreaming big. We have taken Kevlar suits, solar panels, velcro, and other things for granted, but they wouldn't have come forth without hard working innovators, geniuses that is homegrown and inspired to helping the economy that benefits at least four times the amount of money invested in these endeavors. Now, NASA is simply a propaganda machine that is contempt with faking Mars Rover pictures and aiding the Alien Agenda for the New World Order. Anyways, let's move on.\n\nAnother forced truther meme is stuff concerning the Illuminati, 9/11, and the holocaust. It mocks those that believe that the Barvarian Illuminati controls the world, and it mocks those that believe jet fuel can't melt steel beams. The \"Illuminati\" in the context of the music industry is misunderstood by many black people and it ultimately in their conclusions, make white people the devil, ignoring the Jews and the Italian Mafia and the Jesuits behind Hollywood or \"holy wood\" which is what magic wands are made out of. John Todd's information is insufficient in understanding what is the Illuminati, and so is Milton William \"Bill\" Cooper's info, all falls short and doesn't mention the real players though they grasp the gist of the system. They both appeal to the absurdity of these topics like blaming only the Jews doing everything or blaming the Jesuits to be behind everything while refusing to honestly listen to the other side from someone COMPETENT. It is true that many so called truthers are incompetent in stating their cases, but that doesn't mean that they're wrong. Having the right mindset is more important than having a high IQ. One with transcendental knowledge from above sees the sun and the light that illuminates their surroundings and realizes the cave that they were in seeing those shadow puppets was a false reality. To many people, it had became a crude joke mocking the truthers, which now they group us with the Flat Earthers, New Agers, and other groups. It had become normalized in our culture to criticize truthers in public as a joke, because there's more truthers now that talk about these things more often than say ten years ago. They now push this so hard that it really has lost its comedic value, well at least for me. Know that some of these memes might had been naturally formed but were later used as argumentation for trolls to ridicule truthers to death. To some, this isn't enough to be used against truthers, so they had utilized a more deceptive method since really, someone competent can explain to the deceived their stance to dismiss the ad hominem memes. The arguments concerning the Jews are not going to be discussed here, it deserves to be extensively talked about in multiple articles.\n\nEvery now and then, they pull off a prank false flag event like the CERN mock ritual sacrifice that was done outside, had people wearing sneakers, no long ceremony, no proper chanting, was quick and short, no rituals relating to Hinduism, and the guy who had recorded it wore the same clothing as the people in the mock ritual as seen off of the reflection of the window which was within the CERN's hotel building. It went viral and then thoroughly debunked as a hoax, giving the media and those of the cult of Quanta means to remove the credibility of conspiracy theorists. Hypocritically, they believe that an object can act like a field while being unable to denotatively explain what is a field and a field modality without using atomistic interpretations. In their Aristotelian philosophy, they had tried to define something similar to spirituality to physicality, but in doing so, they had rejected metaphysics by defining it through an improper form of physics and mathematics in which whatever answer they give to you in exchange for lots of money is set up so that they have all the authority to claim whatever that they like to because it is trying to conform physics and metaphysics to mathematics instead of having the math conform to reality. Metaphysics affects physics top down, field theory is metaphysics, but a field is not matter, therefore, a \"quantum field\" cannot and will not exist. The protons and neutrons doesn't make up the space of the atom. An electron and a photon is not matter. Every atom has a field, a dielectric plane in the center with a toroidal, hypotrochoid field of both spatial divergence and counterspatial convergence that flows in one direction yet in both sides. It is \"magnetic\", but incoherent magnetism like how the celestial bodies function, while coherent polarized magnetism aligns the atoms to unnaturally form a stronger field that its shape does not want to be in which is to be as spherical as possible. There is no force involved in bringing magnets together just as there is no force involved in dropping objects to the floor, but there is force involved in bringing two \"poles\" of the same polarity forcefully together. Gravity is incoherent magnetism. There is only one field in the observable universe, just in different field modalities. Here's a Youtube playlist of Ken Wheeler's videos concerning these things: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtluP-X1MQIKu_nwzpcW3vBv32JRHB2Wf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtluP-X1MQIKu_nwzpcW3vBv32JRHB2Wf</a> but here's a summary: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KooPsEE7E-Q\" target=\"_blank\">Unifying Gravity, Magnetism, Electricity &amp; Dielectricity as ONE THING ONLY</a>.\n\nThe Mandela effect meme was controlled from its origins, Nelson Mandela really did died in prison in July 23rd 1991 recorded in history in books yet the media decided to resurrect him, with a lookalike (truth be told, the whole issue of dopplegangers deserves another article in itself). The Berenstein bears were originally always was Berenstein, but the internet, many search engines, as well as the modern books and the authors had changed their name to Berenstain. There's some TV guides mentioning Berenstein Bears instead of \"stain\". Sex And The City \"changed\" into Sex In The City. C3P0 was fully gold from Star Wars Episode 4-6, there were toys of him that didn't have the silver leg. Any remastered junk after Episode 1 had made C3P0 with the silver leg, all the DVDs and such has the edited version. It was always Depends underwear, not \"Depend\". This is more of a social experiment, and utilizing QM and GR, people had found means to say that there has been shifts in the universe through separate timelines and such garbage that New Agers had pushed prior to the rise of the Mandela effect meme garbage, which syncretised with the CERN disinfo of supposedly altering time and therefore, also \"timelines\". \"Shifts\" into being under different timelines is highly subjective and only exists within then mind that lowers its skeptical levels to irrational levels. Most of these changes occured much before the Mandela effect meme came about. This isn't about dyslexia, neither confabulation, not even close. That being said, there is no physical proof that there is a Mandela effect, rather, a conscious change in the media and marketing companies which seems like for now serves to make one not believe in reality, so that they can get away with lying in the media and make you complacent and question how your own memories in hopes of fragmenting them in a global scale, a light dose of MPD/DID mind control. It is \"gaslighting\" to claim that it is merely a confabulation. It is hard to convince those that think that they are lied to that they are not either. Paranoia breeds like wildfire through the Mandela effect.\n\nThough what I am about to share to you might not interest most of you, it is nevertheless, an actual thing, and a prime example of memetic psyops. I would have to briefly explain the origins of some memes that had been changed to be a new meme more suited as a tool to spread their lies. At least 100 years ago in 4chan, pretty much since its beginnings, there were people whom had used the post number as means of divination, which consecutive numbers determined the validity of the post. Singles being undesired, doubles (AKA: dubs), triples, quadruples (quads) and so on was desirable, was called a \"get\". Many had sought to predict their own post number, some had actually succeeded though mostly it was done by a bunch of scripts. If they can predict even the last digit of their post number, it was also a \"get\". Usually, they've failed and was called a \"faggot\" which isn't the same meaning as the world uses it but now even calling someone a faggot in imageboards had become obsolete and was replaced with \"cuck\" since Moot/m00t, the founder and former administrator of 4chan, was \"cucked\" (cuckolded) by a Jewish Social Justice Warrior named Mallory Blair Greitzer which m00t used to be called a \"faggot\" pretending to be homosexual but now he's a \"cuck\", which if you want to know more about that, you can just look up #GamerGate and you'll find lots and lots of articles about that ordeal. The \"kek\" meme came from the [s4s] (shit 4chan says) board from 4chan when someone found a picture of a Turkish cake named Topkek, or top cake. Kek also has its origins in World of Warcraft as an equivalent to lol but the separate keks amalgamated alongside with the \"toplel\" meme that existed prior to Topkek made by the /sp/ (sports) board of a hat that says \"TOP LEL\" instead of \"TOP GUN\" from the Workaholics movie while lel is a corruption of lol. By sheer coincidence, someone had combined them all together with \"topkek\" just by finding an image of the Turkish snack pastry. Before that picture was found, topkek had already existed, both the word and the actual cake, but to see reality seemingly conform to whatever memes people make up was nothing short of wonder. In time, this desire to seek more sheer coincidences had became in itself a problem, like the modern \"kek\" meme that has multiple origins that has no real ties to the kek that I've just explained. Though I have no authority over defining memes, the topkek meme was what I would call a naturally occuring meta meme.\n\nThere was another similar meta meme that dealt with a meme that came from /tv/ from watching Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight Rises\" surrounding the scene of Bane crashing the plane and the dialogue between the CIA agent Bill Wilson which to some sounds like a gay porno script or just a poorly written script with sexual innuendo and seemingly poor acting. This video speaks for itself concerning the meta meme: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW0otG1buB8\" target=\"_blank\">Memes are magic</a>. Take note that it was a little more \"forced\" by lowering the standards of what qualifies as \"coincidence\". Unlike Predictive Programming, the concept being pushed here is that memes directly controls reality. I need to make it clear, Memetics is not Predictive Programming. Forced memes and meta memes is unfunny, neither is explaining the nature of these things. The more modern forced kek meta meme is a combination of this, Pepe the frog, the dubs meme, the pill meme (red pilled, blue pilled, green pilled, etc., with descriptions of the pill's effect), Ba'al (the part of Ba'al with the frog head), Ebola-chan (anthropomorphised ebola as an 2D anime girl), and it's justification is from an egyptian hieroglyph of kek as a deity, also spelled Kuk and Keku which \"Kuk\" reminds people of cuck or the state of being cuckolded as well. Kuk's male form was depicted as a frog, or as a frog-headed man which essentially, Pepe the frog was an anthropomorphic frog from a rare online comic book whose author stopped drawing more comics while it became a meme on 4chan's /r9k/ (Robot9000 in using a filter based upon the open-source chat moderation script developed in 2008 by Randall Munroe) board and slowly spread and evolved in its form alongside with \"Wojak\", AKA: feels guy whom had also gotten various transformations. In essense, the memes were taken over by edgy self proclaimed fringe magicians and those that think that they've mastered online memetic PSYOPs in using thoughtforms, sacrifices, and sigils. Some of these people are from 4chan's /int/ and 8ch's /intl/ that had pushed a \"Kek pill\" before its current form. Kek became deified, became full blown worship of darkness and chaos that Kek represents while they abuse syncretism to make anything mean what they want to. Some of these people were the Saturnalian Death Cult conspiracy theorists that believed every single symbol is syncretised to Saturn, disregarding the etymology of the symbols. Though before Kek worship came about, Ebola-chan worship was where the Kek worship borrows from.\n\nGuess what? the Mandela effect meme and the newer Kek meme was not only syncretised but also merged with pro Trump people, associating Trump as Pepe, Pence as Wojak. Not only that, they had insisted that the KJV has gone through the Mandela effect and that \"Trump\" is in the bible. The KJV actually has lots and lots of versions while the newer (not talking about NKJV or the QJV or the KJV 2000 or the American KJV, etc.) versions have changes in its capitalization of certain words in order to legally sell the book because it's not the same as other publishers' KJVs. They straight up lie to you in your face to imply that the bible is talking about Trump and Pence as a deified savior from the Zionist Jews which various anonymous imageboard website collectively understand the nature of the Jews as well as black people and SJWs that are controlled by the Jews or some other Zionists. They had also worshiped Kek during the BREXIT voting and got the desired result. They are confident that they can do the same for the next election of the United States of America. In a similar tangent, some of these people had also attributed the Jesuits to I.H.S. to ISIS to Isis to Shiva to CERN. Shiva has nothing to do with Isis, has nothing to do with the controlled Venetian, British, Zionist, Freemasonic infiltration of Islam through creating a third school in competition to Shi'ites and Sunnis called the Sufi school that brought forth the Wahhabis as well as the Sauds who are crypto Jews. The Free Syrian Army's \"Syrian Rebels\" dissolved into ISIS, was thoroughly funded by the US, UK, Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, etc., and they kill Syrian Christians while NATO and their hired mercenaries from the private sector like Xe bombs the legitimate, democratically elected government's hospitals and claim to had been attacking ISIS. The supposedly mock sacrifice that happened raised some questions as to whether or not this was done in parody or was serious because of Poe's Law again. Many anti CERN people are anti NASA, anti moon landing, pro Nephilim (it's not even rendered that way in the bible), and pro Flat Earth. The Saturnalian theory makes Saturn a projector of reality as well as the moon, controlling what happens on earth, which is why the sky is a dome projection and other nonsense like the Lunar Wave which is not visible to optical, non electronic devices while the water like unstable but minute movement of the appearance of the moon is just the air molecules and water vapor moving about in the sky between you and the moon, sort of like how mirages work but without the mirage. There just is no \"matrix\" dome or any dome. This serves as a distraction from real truthers that talk about the BRICS, what Russia and China are really doing for the sake of humanity against the Zeus/Chronus partnership of the Venetians and the Jews of the New World Order. They don't really expose the DNC, DCCC, Hillary, Soros, despite the leaks while making those that favor Trump look like idiots that believe in \"meme magick\". These meta memes are forced so they are not genuine memes, while it is used as a function, a post ironic forced meta meme that has no resemblance of what it used to be. This isn't the same as meme combining, for this is at a whole different level. Forced memes and meta memes are cancerous to the psyche and is in its essense, an evolved form of propaganda.\n\nPredictive programming is not quite propaganda. Propaganda can convince people to obey a different will other than their own, by their own will, even using FUD, to have something happen. The nature of predictive programming is different from propaganda, for whatever that is signaled symbolically to happen is going to happen no matter if you've seen the predictive programming or not, while the goal is to have people accept that reality once it happens because it subconsciously already happened so it pacifies people and so suppresses the shocking nature of whatever agenda or false flag event were to happen. The nature of predictive programming is pacifying, suppressive, but has nothing to do with taking any conscious form of action of the viewer's part. That doesn't mean that they change physical reality through their mind, rather, the PERCEPTION of what they think is to be reality through their mind. Meme magick claims to change physical reality to force sheer coincidences while memetics is not meme magick, rather, using memes as means of low dose propaganda that spreads through the internet without forcing it like a forced meme which propaganda is. Predictive programming is more of an inside joke than a meme, for there's no inherent viral nature of predictive programming. The Mandela effect and predictive programming are similar in changing perception, but the Mandela effect looks back into the past because the present information contradicts the past while predictive programming looks into the future though the present information is lacking as to what it really is to be in the future. Predictive programming is not prophecy in a religious sense, for the act is done by the puppets of the elite's goals against humanity. Learning predictive programming signals is not enough when the underlying agendas gives its sustenance, agendas formulated by various groups and factions given to lower level puppet groups and factions.\n\nüí´<strong>Statements of The Faith Aug 25, 2016 @ 15:35</strong>\n\nSince most of you are so hopelessly oblivious to the reformed Christian faith, I've decided to share with you multiple \"Statement of Faith\"s and FAQs that I generally agree with besides some minor trivial facts and linguistic snares which the definitions changes in context and etymology that doesn't change the core foundational truths that all these \"Statement of Faith\"s and FAQs are in agreement with each other.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.aomin.org/aoblog/index.php/statement-of-faith/\" target=\"_blank\">Statement of Faith - Alpha and Omega Ministries</a>:<blockquote>We believe the Bible to be the written revelation of God, complete and sufficient in all respects. We believe the Scriptures to be ‚ÄúGod-breathed‚Äù and therefore fully authoritative in and of themselves; they rely for their authority upon no church, council, or creed, but are authoritative simply because they are the Word of God. The Scriptures, as they embody the very speaking of God, partake of His authority, His power.\n\nWe believe in one true and eternal God, unchanging, unchangeable. We believe God is the Creator of all that exists in heaven and in earth. The God who is described in the Bible is unique; He is unlike anyone or anything else in all the universe. God has all power, all knowledge, all wisdom, and is due all glory, honor and praise. All that comes to pass does so at the decree of God. All things will, in the end, result in the glory of God.\n\nWe believe the Bible teaches that there is but one being of God, yet there are three Persons who share this one being of God: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Each Person is fully and completely God, each is described in Scripture as possessing the attributes of God. The Father, Son, and Spirit have eternally existed in the relationship described by the term ‚ÄúTrinity.‚Äù\n\nWe believe that man was created in the image of God. Man rebelled against His Creator, and fell into sin. As a result, man became spiritually dead, totally unwilling and indeed incapable of seeking after God. God, from eternity past, having foreordained all things, joined a certain people to Christ Jesus, so that He might redeem them from their sin and in so doing bring glory to Himself. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died in the place of this elect people, providing full and complete forgiveness of sins by His death upon the cross of Calvary. No other work can provide for forgiveness of sins, and no addition can be made to the completed and finished work of Christ.\n\nWe believe that God, in His sovereign grace and mercy, regenerates sinful men by the power of the Holy Spirit, not by any action of their own, bringing them to new life. God grants to them the gifts of faith and repentance, which they then exercise by believing in Christ and turning from their sins in love for God. As a result of this faith, based upon the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, God justifies or makes righteous the one who believes. God‚Äôs gift of faith, and the continuing work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of the elect, results in good works. These good works flow from true, saving faith; they are a necessary result of faith, but are not to be considered necessary to the gaining of justification, which is by God‚Äôs grace through faith alone, so that no man can boast.\n\nWe believe Jesus Christ established His Church, which is made up of all the elect of God. His Church, as an obedient bride, listens to His Word as found in the Bible. All who believe in Christ are placed in His body, the Church. The local expressions of the Church are very important, and each believer should be actively involved in such a fellowship.\n\nWe believe that Christ is coming again to judge the living and the dead. This promise is found throughout the inspired Scriptures. Till His return, believers are to live lives that bring glory to God through Jesus Christ. The Church is to be busy doing the work of evangelism and discipleship, proclaiming the pure, uncompromised Gospel of Christ by teaching the Word of God.</blockquote>\n\n<a href=\"https://carm.org/statement-faith\" target=\"_blank\">CARM Statement of Faith</a>:<blockquote>by Matt Slick\n\nWe do not apologize for the length of this Statement of Faith. It is necessary because the more assaults there are against the Christian faith, the more precise we need to be. The following SOF is good! It is biblically sound, very orthodox, and yet fair enough to allow differences of opinion on debatable issues.\n\nIntroduction: CARM is a conservative Christian Ministry based on the teachings of the Bible (66 books, excluding the Apocrypha).\n\nBible: The Bible is the Word of God, and that its original manuscripts are free from errors and contradictions. It is the one and only infallible, authoritative, and trustworthy rule for faith and life. (2 Peter. 1:21, 2 Tim. 3:16). The Roman Catholic Apocrypha is not inspired scripture and is not part of the canon of scripture. The Bible is to be taken as literally as possible except where obviously figurative. Genesis, for example, is literal, and Adam and Eve were actual people.\n\nGod: God is the only Supreme Being with no gods created before or after Him in all of existence, in all places, in all time (Isaiah 43:10; 44:6; 44:8; 1 Tim. 1:17). He has always been God and was never anything else (Psalm 90:2). He is Holy (Rev. 4:8), Eternal (Isaiah 57:15), Omnipotent (Jer. 32:17, 27), Omnipresent (Psalm 139:7), Omniscient (1 John 3:20); etc. He is Love (1 John 4:8, 16); Light (1 John 1:5); Spirit (John 4:24); Truth (Psalm 117:2); Creator (Isaiah 40:12, 22, 26), etc. He is to be worshiped (Gen. 24:26; Ex. 4:31; 2 Chron. 29:28; 1 Cor. 14:25; Rev. 7:11). He is to be served (Matt. 4:10; 1 Cor. 6:19; Phil. 3:7; 1 Thess. 1:9; Heb. 9:14). He is to be proclaimed (Matt. 28:19f.; John 14:15f.; Acts 1:8).\n\nTrinity: There is one God in whom are three eternal, distinct, simultaneous persons--the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. All three are the one God, coeternal, coequal, etc., yet there is only one God--not three gods--and not one person who took three modes, offices, or forms. (Isaiah 44:6, 8; 45:5; Gen. 1:26-27; 3:22; Matt. 3:17; 28:19; Luke 9:35; 2 Cor. 13:14). See also, The Trinity\nJesus \tJesus Christ is the Word (God) who became a man. He added human nature to His divine nature. He is both human and divine and, therefore, has two natures. Yet, He is one person--not two. He is not part God and part man. He is presently a man, one person, with two natures where one nature is wholly God and the other wholly man. (Phil. 2:5-11; Col. 2:9; 1 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 1:5-13; John 1:1-3, 14). Jesus will eternally remain as a man and intercedes for us eternally as a high priest after the order of Melchizedek. (Heb. 6:20; 7:25).\n\nVirgin Birth: Jesus Christ was miraculously conceived and born of the virgin Mary (Luke 1:42). Mary ceased to be a virgin after the birth of Jesus (Matt. 1:25).\n\nResurrection of Christ: Jesus Christ rose from the dead in the same body He died in after being in the grave for three days. He was raised in a glorified, physical body (still retaining his crucifixion wounds). He ascended bodily into heaven, sits at the right hand of the Father, and rules heaven and earth. (John 2:19; 1 Cor. 15; Luke 24:39). Likewise, we Christians will be raised bodily from the dead and spend eternity with the Lord.\n\nSubstitutionary Atonement: God the Father so loved us that He sent His only begotten Son Jesus Christ. Jesus, the Word, became man, bore our sins in His body on the cross (1 Peter. 2:24), and died in our place, suffering the consequences of breaking the Law (1 John 3:4), which is physical death (Rom. 6:23) and spiritual death (Isa. 59:2), that was due us (Isaiah 53:4-6). He became sin on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21). His sacrifice was a legal substitution for us (1 John 2:2; John 19:30; 1 Pet. 2:24). It was legal since sin is breaking God's Law (1 John 3:4) and substitutionary since Christ took our punishment (Isaiah 53:4-6) and tasted death for everyone (Heb. 2:9). As a result, God's justice was satisfied, Christian believers are released from eternal punishment (1 Pet. 3:18; Matt. 1:21; 25:46; Rom. 5; 1 John 2:2), and their debt that our sin brings against us has been cancelled (Col. 2:14).\n\nBaptism: Baptism is an important action of obedience for a Christian and signifies a person's identification with Christ. Baptism is not necessary for salvation. It is an outward manifestation of an inward reality of trust in the sacrifice for Christ, of conversion, and of identification with Christ. The act of water baptism does not save anyone. We are made right before God by faith--not by faith and baptism (Rom. 3:28-30; 4:3, 5; 5:1; Gal. 2:16, 21; Phil. 3:9; see also Acts 10:44-48).\n\nMan's Condition: Man is fallen, corrupt, and wicked. Man believes in God by God's grace through faith (John 6:28-29; 15:5; Phil. 1:29), is unable to come close to God through his own efforts (John 6:44; Rom. 3:10-12), nor is he born again of his own will (John 1:13), nor can he understand the spiritual things of God on his own (1 Cor. 2:14; Rom. 8:7), nor can he earn salvation by his attempt at good works (Eph. 2:8-9; Rom. 4:1-6), nor once saved does he maintain his salvation by his works (Gal. 3:1-3). Eternal punishment in hell and separation from the blessed presence of God are the consequences of the unregenerate person's sinfulness who has not trusted in the redemptive sacrificial work of Christ on the cross (Eph. 2:1-3; Rom. 6:23).\n\nDivine Election: God elects/chooses people for salvation. \"But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.\" (2 Thess. 2:13). And, \"From all eternity God chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,\" (Eph. 1:4-5). And, \"So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.\" (Rom. 9:16).\n\nSalvation: Salvation is being saved from the righteous judgment of God upon the sinner. Salvation is obtained by grace alone, through faith alone, in the work of Christ alone (John 3:16) and not by our good works (Rom. 3:20; Eph. 2:8-9). We are chosen for salvation by God (2 Thess. 2:13).\n\nJustification by Grace through Faith Alone: Justification is being declared legally righteous by God. This justification is received by faith alone without any ceremony/baptism (Rom. 4:1-6), in the work of Christ fulfilling the Law in his earthly ministry (1 Pet. 2:22), and his removing of sin by his sacrifice. Justification is a gift from God (Rom. 3:24) and is received apart from the works of the Law (Rom. 3:28; Gal. 2:21).\n\nRegeneration: Regeneration is the work of God that occurs with faith. This regeneration means the person is made a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17) and is then able to resist his sin and seek to increase in sanctification before the Lord. Those thus regenerated do not seek to abide in sin though they do fall into it but war against it and repent of sin before the Lord.\n\nEternal Security: \"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; 28 and I give eternal life to them, and they shall never perish; and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.\" (John 10:27-28). Christ has done all that is needed for our salvation, and he says that those who have eternal life will never perish. Those who appeared to be Christian but fell away never were Christians to begin with (1 John 2:19). Eternal security does not mean that we have a license to sin (Rom. 5:21-6:2), and those who say it is a license to sin do not understand eternal security and how God regenerates the sinner and turns his heart to repentance (2 Tim. 2:25). Because of the diversity of opinions on this issue, CARM does not condemn or pass judgment upon those who believe it is possible to lose one's salvation. However, CARM opposes the position that a person's security before God is maintained through his good works since this would be works of righteousness.\n\nSanctification:\tSanctification is the process by which the Holy Spirit makes us more like Christ in all that we do, think, and desire and increases our ability to repent from sin--by God's grace, (1 Thess. 4:7; Eph. 2:10; 1 Tim. 4:4; 1 Peter. 3:15; 2 Tim. 2:25). This process continues all of the Christian's life and is the result of salvation--not a cause of it, nor a contributing factor to it. Furthermore, the effort of sanctification does not maintain the believer's salvation.\n\nFree Will: Free will is the ability of a conscious being to be able to make choices that are not coerced. All people possess free will and exercise it according to the conditions revealed about it per the scriptures (1 Cor. 2:14; Rom. 6:14-20). Free will choices require the ability to be aware of a choice to be made. Free will does not necessitate the option of choosing between good and bad; otherwise, God would not be free since he cannot choose to sin.\n\nChristian Church: God calls Christians to his Church where the Word of God is preached, where baptism and the Lord's Supper (communion) are administered, where believers are discipled and disciplined, and where believers serve to build up one another (Matt. 16:18). There is no one true earthly ecclesiastical body that is 'the true church.' Rather, the True Church consists of all true believers wherever they might be.\n\nChurch Membership: Church membership varies in structure and requirements among different churches and denominations. Therefore, we cannot say it is or is not biblical since different Church membership styles cannot all be examined here. Nevertheless, church membership is sometimes assumed (with no legal, official agreement), and other times it is a formalized (and often legal) contract where a person agrees to be subject to the ecclesiastical body within the local congregation. Formal agreements are not a requirement to be a member of the body of Christ at large since it is not found in the New Testament. However, various local bodies do require official church membership along with a formal, legal agreement. CARM considers both to be within biblical orthodoxy.\n\nChurch Officers: God calls qualified Christians to be ordained and to serve Jesus Christ in special leadership capacities, i.e., Elders, Deacons, Ministers of the Word, and Evangelists. The office(s) of pastor and elder is limited to qualified men only who are called by God, recognized by the body, and who meet the biblical standard of eldership (Titus 1:5-9). Women are not to be pastors nor elders and are not to hold positions of authority in the Christian Church where that authority is exercised over men (1 Tim. 2:11-15; 3:11-13; Titus 1:5-9).\n\nRapture: The event where, upon Jesus' return, those who have died in Christ and those Christians who are then alive will be physically caught up to the clouds and meet the Lord Jesus in the air. We will then forever be with the Lord (1 Thess. 4:16-5:2). Because of the diverse opinions among Christians regarding the rapture, CARM considers pre-trib rapture, mid-trib rapture, and post-trib rapture to be within the scope of Christian orthodoxy.\n\nSecond Coming: Jesus Christ will bodily and visibly return from heaven to earth with great glory and majesty.\n\nMillennium: Because of the diverse opinions among Christians regarding the millennium, CARM's position is that amillennialism, premillennialism, and post millennialism are within the scope of Christian orthodoxy. CARM rejects full preterism--the teaching that Jesus returned in A.D. 70 but affirms that partial preterism is within orthodoxy.\n\nSpiritual Realm: There is a spiritual realm of angels and demons. Angels serve God and carry out his will. Demons are fallen angels (2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 6) who war against God and who will ultimately face eternal punishment (Matt. 25:41; 2 Per. 2:4). Christians cannot be demon-possessed.\n\nEternal Judgment: All who are not justified by faith in Christ and the blood of Christ will face eternal, conscious, and agonizing judgment away from the presence of God (Matt. 8:12; Luke 16:19-31; Rev. 20:14-15; 21:8)\n\nEvangelism: Part of the purpose of CARM is to carry out the work of evangelism which means that we must teach the gospel of Jesus Christ to all people in every nation (Matt. 28:19-20). Also, we are to refute false doctrines, false religions, and whatever else might contradict the word of God; but we are to do this without insult (1 Pet. 3:15) if perchance God would grant them repentance (2 Tim. 2:25).\nKingdom\n\nWork: Part of being a Christian means to participate in expanding the Kingdom of God. Every Christian is to work for this end according to the gifts given him or her by the Lord (Matt. 28:18-20; Rom. 12). Not all are pastors or evangelists or teachers (Rom. 12), but each Christian is expected to do his or her part to promote the gospel whether it be by prayer and/or tithing and/or teaching and/or bearing and training children and/or evangelism, etc.\n\nMorality: Homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexuality, pedophilia, bestiality, necrophilia, cross-dressing, trans-genderism, lying, bearing false witness, adultery, wife-swapping, pornography, fornication, coveting, etc., are all sinful practices, against scriptural revelation, are contrary to proper living, and are not acceptable to the CARM ministry as normal or approved behaviors. Still, we do not hate or persecute those who practice these things but pray for their deliverance and salvation and expose their sins and call them to repentance.\n\nMarriage: Marriage is between one man and one woman.\n\nHeresy:\tAny doctrine that deviates from the historical, orthodox, and biblical position of the Christian Church, throughout Church history, as judged from a Protestant perspective. There are heresies that are damnable (denying the Deity of Christ, denying Christ's physical resurrection, denying justification by grace through faith, etc.). There are heresies that are not damnable (advocating women pastors; practicing polygamy, divorce for convenience sake, etc.) There are also teachings within Christianity that are debatable whereas differences of opinion are not heresy (eating or not eating meat, worship on Saturday or Sunday, etc.) See Rom. 14:1-12.\n\nLiving: Where possible, Christians are to live in peace with all men, suffering wrongs, false accusations, and misrepresentations with charity. However, Christians are free to defend themselves (Luke 22:36) and promote the truth of Christianity by correcting false teachings and refuting error (2 Tim. 2:25; 1 Pet. 3:15). They are free to use the political system and its laws in order to promote a more godly and moral society. Christians are to live in the world as examples of godliness and are not to participate in the sinful passions of the world.\n\nCreation and Evolution:\tGod created the universe and all that is in it by his creative effort. God brought the universe into existence by the exertion of his will. Within Christianity there is room for the interpretation of the six creation days (Genesis 1:1-31) to be literal seven 24-hour periods but also longer periods. Nevertheless, Adam and Eve were real people--created by God just as Genesis says. CARM does not affirm macro evolution (the formation of life on earth from a single cell that evolved via natural selection over millions of years into the species all over the earth) or theistic evolution (that God guided macro evolution to bring humanity into existence). CARM denies them both. However, micro evolution, the modification of existing species with existing genetic information that allows species to adapt to environments, is within the realm of Christian orthodoxy. We did not evolve from other species into our present condition. God did not guide evolution of species by which humanity, the animal kingdom, or the plant kingdom was developed. The General theory of evolution is unscriptural and counter-factual.</blockquote>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/questions-answers/\" target=\"_blank\">Questions / Answers - Proof That God Exists</a>:<blockquote>If you have reached this page without going through the proof, please click <a href=\"http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/\" target=\"_blank\">‚ÄúThe Proof.‚Äù</a> For those who have gone through the proof to get here, it may have been a huge step to finally admit that God exists. While it may be a relief to finally make such an admission, it is just the first step, not the last. The Bible teaches that even demons believe in God ‚Äì and tremble. (James 2 vs. 19)\n\nSince you affirm your belief in God, you should be better able to understand the answers to the questions below. I hope that God will use these questions and answers to guide you further on your journey.\n\n1. What are some of God's characteristics?\n\nGod is a personal being (not an impersonal force). God is immaterial, omnipresent (everywhere), omniscient (all knowing), omnipotent (all powerful), omnibenevolent (all good), immutable (unchanging), sovereign (supreme in authority), free, perfect, and eternal (without beginning or end). As the creator and sustainer of the universe it is understandable that there are some characteristics of God that are beyond our ability to comprehend. For instance God is one divine being in three distinct persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each are equally and eternally the one true God.\n\nGod reveals His characteristics to us through ‚Äògeneral,‚Äô or ‚Äònatural‚Äô revelation, and through ‚Äòspecial revelation.‚Äô God‚Äôs general revelation includes what He has revealed to us through His creation in nature and in our God given conscience. Special revelation on the other hand is what God has revealed to us through supernatural means including His Son Jesus Christ, His Spirit, and His Word the Bible.\n\n2. Could God have used fallible people to write an infallible book?\n\nOf course, He is God after all.\n\n3. How can we know that the Bible is true?\n\nNo doubt you have heard much evidence for the textual validity of the Bible. From its uniqueness in history claiming to be the inerrant word of a personal God, to the early date of the manuscripts; From the precision of the copyists, to the internal consistency among so many different authors over such a long period of time. But, as you have probably gathered by now, as wonderful as the physical evidence is, this website is not about physical evidence. (Later in the Q&A this will be probed deeper). You see, for someone who approaches the Bible thinking that it cannot be true, the evidence will be as quickly discounted as evidence supporting the truth of a fairy tale. Furthermore, evaluating evidence without God as the necessary foundation for the reasoning with which you do so, puts your reasoning on a higher authority than God. God is Lord of our reasoning, not subservient to it.\n\nRather than use physical evidence to show that the Bible is most probably true, we again go back to intellectual evidence, and logical proof, to show that the Bible is necessarily true. We can know that the Bible is true because it claims to be true and proves it by the impossibility of the contrary! It is only because the Bible is true that we have justification for universal, immaterial, unchanging laws. It is only by God‚Äôs revealing Himself to us through His word that we have grounds for rational thought. We use rational thought, therefore we can know that the Bible is true. Attempting to use logic to try to disprove the only possible source for logic would be self-refuting.\n\n4. By what authority do Christians claim the Bible as their ultimate authority?\n\nAny claim to ultimate authority must be self-authorizing. If we use any other authority by which to authorize the Bible, THAT authority then becomes our ultimate authority. For instance, if we say that we will accept the Bible as our ultimate authority only if %100 of literary scholars say it is true, then those scholars become our ultimate authority, not the Bible. Christians therefore claim the Bible as our ultimate authority by its own authority as the word of God. I‚Äôm sure many people will say: ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs using circular logic!‚Äù (using what is to be proven in the proof). What you must realize though, is that any claim to ultimate authority uses circularity, but not all can be (read only one is) valid.\n\nIf you are not a Christian I ask: What is your ultimate authority? Most ‚Äòunbelievers‚Äô have never given this question much thought but the answer is often: ‚ÄúMy own human reason.‚Äù My question then is: ‚ÄúBy what authority do you use human reason as your ultimate authority? ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶my human reason?‚Äù This logic is entirely circular!\n\nTo be valid an ultimate authority must first claim ultimate authority and then prove itself internally. Lets contrast the ‚Äòunbeliever‚Äôs‚Äô view above with the Christian view.\n\nThe first fatal flaw of the ‚Äòunbeliever‚Äôs‚Äô view is that it is completely arbitrary, (totally up to the individual), and therefore is not law-like in nature and loses any degree of necessity. If this was the case, no ultimate authority could be ‚Äòright‚Äô or ‚Äòtrue‚Äô and no one could be at fault for pursuing their own ultimate authority.\n\nThe second fatal flaw is the inconsistency of such a view. ‚ÄòUnbelievers‚Äô may claim that they are their own ultimate authority but quite often (and thankfully) do not live that way when they submit to a higher authority.\n\nThat brings us to the third fatal flaw of the ‚Äòunbeliever‚Äôs‚Äô view on ultimate authority, the consequences of such a view. If people actually did what they often really wanted to do, and did not submit to higher authority, there would be anarchy. If, for instance, someone decided by their own reason and authority to do an evil act, there would be no reason to stop, since to them it would by definition be right and true.\n\nContrast these three points with the Christian belief that the Bible is God‚Äôs word and therefore our ultimate authority. First of all, the Bible as an ultimate authority is not arbitrary. It is written word that is entirely certain, and law-like in nature. Secondly, while Christians are sometimes inconsistent with their submission to the Bible as their ultimate authority, such actions are entirely consistent with the Biblical description of the depraved nature of the human condition. And thirdly, the consequences of sure laws such as ‚Äòloving one‚Äôs enemy,‚Äô ‚Äòturning the other cheek,‚Äô or ‚Äòtreating others as you would have them treat you,‚Äô if universally adhered to, would not result in anarchy, but peace.\n\nIn addition to the above points, the Bible teaches that denying the truth about God and His word leads to ‚Äòfoolishness‚Äô and ‚Äòvain reasoning,‚Äô I hope that when you examine the beliefs of other worldviews that this becomes ever more clear to you.\n\nThe Bible claims to be our ultimate authority, is the only book which makes sense of rationality and human experience, and says that rejecting the truth about God leads to foolishness. By this, the Bible claims to be the word of God (our ultimate authority), and proves it.\n\n5. Why must the God proven on this site be the God of Christianity?\n\nThe God proven on this site must be the God of Christianity because He is the only God that HAS been proved here and the only one that exists. No other version of God is logically defensible. The God of Christianity is the only God who makes sense out of human experience.\n\nAlong with the truth and authority of the Bible, the truth of Christianity can be demonstrated by the reduction to absurdity of those who deny it. If you would like to witness this for yourself, just ask a professed unbeliever where the universe came from ‚Äì where universal, immaterial, unchanging laws came from. The answers that I have heard require far greater faith to believe than what I possess.\n\nLooking for another God is like looking for an answer other than ‚Äò4‚Äô to the question ‚Äòwhat does 2 + 2 equal?‚Äô Sure there are many other answers to that math question but nobody has ever asked me ‚ÄúWell what about 5, or 9, or 3,286,428?‚Äù Many people, either to avoid accountability, or for a host of other reasons, try to make up other ‚Äògods,‚Äô but when the true answer is known, one need not look any further.\n\nFor those who still have questions about other worldviews, please read OTHER WORLDVIEWS. The list is in its‚Äô infancy, but with input from visitors to this site, I hope that it will become substantial.\n\n6. Aren't there many ways to God?\n\nThere are an infinite amount of ways to get to made up ‚Äògods,‚Äô there is only one way to get to the one true, living God of Christianity.\n\nJesus said: ‚ÄúI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.‚Äù (John 14 vs. 6)\n\n7. Isn't the Christian claim to exclusive truth arrogant and the reason wars start?\n\nThe first thing we must consider when discussing this topic is that it is only because Christianity is true that we have a source for absolute morality by which we can condemn the actions of people who start unjust wars, and take innocent lives. Without absolute laws of morality, and a God who makes them possible, what one ‚Äòbag of matter‚Äô does to another ‚Äòbag of matter‚Äô is totally irrelevant.\n\nThe next point to consider is that anyone who engages in an unjust war in Jesus name, would be doing so contrary to the teachings of the one they claimed to be fighting for. Jesus taught us to ‚Äòlove our enemies, and to ‚Äòlove our neighbours as ourselves,‚Äô so condemning Christianity because of those who go against Christ‚Äôs teachings would not make sense. Christians and so-called Christians have done some terrible things, but this should not bear on the belief that they are living contrary to. Imagine for instance that you discovered that the person who taught you algebra turned out to be a child molester ‚Äì would that make the algebra you learned any less true?\n\nA friend of mine who is not a Christian and happens to be a vegetarian told me that she could not become a Christian because of all the terrible things so-called Christians have done. I asked her if she went to a convention for vegetarians, and saw each and every one of them sneak some meat to eat, would she stop being a vegetarian? Of course she said that she would not give up being a vegetarian as her vegetarianism had nothing to do with how other people behaved. It is illogical to give up a philosophy because of its‚Äô abuse.\n\nWhile truth in itself is not arrogant, those who claim to know it can certainly come off as arrogant. Truth by its very nature is exclusive. If something is true, then all other contrary claims must be false. There may even be people who claim that truth is not exclusive, but as we saw in the opening page of this website, such a claim is also an exclusive truth claim. If truth was arrogant, shouldn‚Äôt people who make the claim ‚ÄúAbsolute truth does not exist‚Äù or, ‚ÄúChristianity is false,‚Äù also be considered arrogant? Nearly all major religions claim at least some degree of exclusivity, even those religions that say that all religions are true would have to exclude the exclusivist religions that say they are wrong. If another religion did not claim to be true, why should anyone believe it?\n\nExclusive truth does not seem to bother people when they are dealing with their bank tellers, but often those same people are loathe to hear the truth that they are sinners and will suffer the wrath of God unless they repent. Dispensing truth in an unloving way is a sin and contrary to Christ‚Äôs teachings. Dispensing the truth that we are sinners and that Christ is the only way to God, should be done in a manner that glorifies the very source of love.\n\n8. If God is all powerful and all good, why is there evil and suffering in this world?\n\nThe Bible teaches that God IS all powerful and all good. There is evil in this world. The only answer to the question of why there is evil and suffering then is:\n\n‚ÄúFor a reason which is perfectly sufficient for God.‚Äù\n\n9. But I am suffering now. Why doesn't God stop it?\n\nI don‚Äôt know why. God may stop it, He may not. But I do know this:\n\nRomans 8 vs. 28 says: ‚ÄúAnd we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.‚Äù\n\nNot just some things, not just the good things that happen to us but ALL things, even our most terrible experiences, even our worst afflictions. One of my favourite quotes sums this up nicely:\n\nWhatsoever is good for God‚Äôs children they shall have it, for all is theirs to further them to heaven; therefore, if poverty be good, they shall have it; if disgrace be good, they shall have it; if crosses be good, they shall have them; if misery be good, they shall have it; for all is ours, to serve for our greatest good. (Richard Sibbes)\n\nA quote attributed to Anjez√´ Gonxhe Bojaxhiu also lends some perspective:\n\nIn light of heaven, the worst suffering on earth, a life full of the most atrocious tortures on earth, will be seen to be no more serious than one night in an inconvenient hotel.\n\nWhile minimizing our present suffering by contrasting it to an eternity with God may be a relief to some, others still try to figure out how God uses our suffering for His glorious purpose. Some things in Christianity however remain a divine mystery, possibly because we are not meant to understand them or because our limited minds could never understand them.\n\nIsaiah 55 vs8,9, says: ‚ÄúFor my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are my ways your ways,‚Äù declares the Lord. ‚ÄúAs the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.‚Äù\n\nSuffering leads some to bitterness, anger, and further rejection of God, but can also have the opposite effect as the Bible teaches:\n\n‚Ä¶suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us. (Romans 5 vs. 3 ‚Äì 5)\n\nGod knows our suffering. God‚Äôs own Son Jesus Christ endured the worst suffering by bearing the sins of the world when He died on the cross. Since the worst suffering can have the best outcome, surely we can trust God that if we love Him, our suffering will be for our ultimate good. Rather than asking God to take you out of your suffering, invite Him into it. If you love God, He will work His will in you for your eternal well-being. Is this not reason enough to love God?\n\n10. What is sin and why am I a sinner?\n\nThe Bible teaches that we were created in God‚Äôs image. God has many characteristics that we do not share. For example, we are not all good, all powerful, or all knowing. How then are we created in God‚Äôs image? We are created in God‚Äôs moral image. The law of God is not a set of rules which God arbitrarily imposes on mankind. The law of God is a reflection of God‚Äôs moral character. The law is ‚Äòwho God is.‚Äô God is perfect, therefore His law is also perfect. Since we were created in God‚Äôs moral image, the requirements of His law have been ‚Äúwritten on our hearts.‚Äù We therefore know right from wrong and are to do right to reflect God‚Äôs character. We shouldn‚Äôt steal, for instance, not because stealing is bad (which it is), but because God is not a thief and we were created in His image.\n\nSin then, is falling short of that which God has created us to be and lying about Him by the way we live. We are all sinners first because we inherited the sin of Adam, and secondly because we all fall short of God‚Äôs requirement to keep his law.\n\nSome people say that all sin is equally bad. How does it make sense that murder can be on the same level as a ‚Äòwhite lie?‚Äô Of course these sins are on opposite ends of the scale in severity, but either would make us equally undeserving of God‚Äôs grace because both are lying about God. Sin is not a measure of how bad we are, sin is a measure of how good we are not.\n\nRather than criticize the only possible source of fairness for His perceived lack of fairness, we should take into consideration how terrible lying about God must really be to warrant an eternity in Hell no matter which sin we commit.\n\n11. Why do I need to repent?\n\nWe all need to repent because we are sinners and the penalty for sin is death and eternal banishment in Hell. We need to repent to receive life and an eternity with God. The Bible teaches that ‚ÄòWe are not our own, we were bought at a price‚Äô (1Cor 6 vs. 19). We have offended our maker by the way we live and need to repent to be put right before Him. Living under the wrath of God and constantly looking for ways to escape Him is no way to live.\n\nSome people think the only reason they should repent is to get to heaven. While this is a really good reason to repent, it would be on par with calling the auto league when your car is broken, to have it towed back to your garage. We need to repent to ‚Äòget the car fixed.‚Äô The human ‚Äòmachine‚Äô was meant to run on God, and anything else we try to run it on may turn the engine for a while but will ultimately lead to its‚Äô destruction.\n\nThe word ‚Äòrepent‚Äô means to change one‚Äôs mind. We need to change how we think and submit to what God reveals to us in order to make sense out of any knowledge or experience. We need to change our minds about the way we live, and instead of living for ourselves, live for God. That is not to say that we should all become ministers, but that we should be janitors, or nurses, or pizza delivery people who are alive in Christ, not who are dead in our sin. Jesus did not come to make bad people good, but to make people, who are dead in their sin, live.\n\n12. Why should I become a Christian?\n\nYou should become a Christian because Christianity is true.\n\nThis site was not about whether you are satisfied, happy, at peace, whether you are fed up with yourself, or think you are a failure. Certainly Christianity offers the only sure hope in this life and the next but we ought to become Christians because Christianity is true and Jesus Christ is the truth.\n\nBeing a Christian is not about asking God to give you strength to help you get over life‚Äôs hurdles. Being a Christian is asking Christ to live in you and BE your strength. When you go to the airport you do not ask the ticket agent to give you the ability to fly to your destination on your own, you ask to be flown. No one is able to live a righteous life on their own. Becoming a Christian means trusting Christ to get you through life by leaning entirely on Him. Proverbs 3 vs. 5-6 says: ‚ÄúTrust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.‚Äù\n\n13. How do I become a Christian?\n\nRomans 10 vs. 9 says: ‚ÄúIf you confess with your mouth ‚ÄúJesus is Lord,‚Äù and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.‚Äù THAT is how you become a Christian.\n\nOnly God knows if you have truly made this commitment, because God alone is the one who makes such a commitment possible.\n\nRomans 3 vs. 10 ‚Äì 11 says: There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.‚Äù If you have come to a point of understanding and belief, it is not because of anything you have done or understood. If you are so inclined as to believe and be saved it is only because God is calling you; calling you by name. It is solely by the grace of God that one becomes a Christian.\n\nEphesians 2 vs. 8 says: For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith ‚Äì and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God ‚Äì not by works, so that no one can boast.\n\nNote that the verse says that it is the gift OF God, not FROM God. It is the saving work of Christ‚Äôs death and resurrection FOR you and IN you that allows you to be saved.\n\nChristianity differs from all other world religions in that in all other religions you have to DO something to earn favour from their fictitious Gods, In Christianity it is what is DONE in you and for you that allows you to stand blameless before God. If you are urged to examine your own actions for the reason that you have been saved, rather than what Christ has done for you on the cross, then you are looking in the wrong place.\n\nIt is my hope and prayer that God has made it possible for you to confess Jesus Christ as your Lord (The One who has ultimate authority over you), and Saviour (The One who rescues you from the fate you deserve), so that you can repent of your sin and enjoy an eternal relationship with Him.\n\n14. Okay, I'm a Christian, now what?\n\nFirst know that as Jesus Christ said in Luke 15 vs. 7 there is rejoicing in heaven when a sinner repents.\n\nChristianity is a relationship with your maker. Now you should learn as much as you can about the One who you are in relationship with by reading His word. I would suggest starting with the New Testament Gospels. In that Word you can learn about God, and what He requires of you as a follower of Christ. Since you are in a relationship with God, you must communicate with Him through prayer and seek His guidance for your life through His word.\n\n2 Corinthians 10:5 teaches us to ‚Äòto take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.‚Äô\n\nHebrews 10 vs. 25 says: ‚ÄúLet us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another ‚Äì and all the more as you see the Day approaching.‚Äù\n\nThis means that you should find a church to give and receive encouragement in your walk, and to worship God. It is important to find a church that holds the Bible alone as the ultimate authority over mankind. If you go to a church and you are not made to feel welcome, or if they are doing weird things that they cannot justify in God‚Äôs word, look for another church. 1 Thessalonians 5 vs. 21 says: ‚ÄúTest everything. Hold on to the good. Avoid every kind of evil.‚Äù\n\nAs a Christian you can rest assured that your sins have been paid for and that you will spend eternity with God even though you do not deserve it. That is the Good News. I hope you have a wonderful spiritual journey and look forward to hearing from you. I will leave this question with the words from Philippians 4 vs. 4 ‚Äì 9:\n\n‚ÄúRejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable ‚Äì if anything is excellent or praiseworthy ‚Äì think about such things. Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me ‚Äì put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.‚Äù\n\n15. What is Heaven like?\n\nDespite what some books may claim, neither I, nor anyone alive today knows what heaven is like, but I do know this:\n\n‚ÄúNo Eye has seen,\nno ear has heard,\nno mind has conceived\nwhat God has prepared for those who love him.‚Äù\n1 Corinthians 2 vs. 9\n\n16. Does God choose us or do we choose Him?\n\nI‚Äôm sure that from the previous question and answers you have gathered that it is in fact God that chooses us rather than us choosing God. I want to delve a little deeper into that truth as it can be difficult to understand. One analogy that I found helpful was a story that Cornelius Van Til gave to his students in one of his lectures. The story went something like this:\n\nThere was a man who was working in his basement on a serum to bring the dead back to life. After many years he finally came up with the formula that he felt would accomplish this goal. Excitedly he divided this new serum into many doses, packed up his equipment, put it in the back of his pick-up truck and drove down to the local graveyard. Once at the graveyard he set up his tables, laid out the serums and yelled at the top of his lungs: ‚ÄúCOME AND GET IT!!!‚Äù\n\nYou see, before we can even hear the Good News of Jesus Christ, God first has to ‚Äòbring us back to life.‚Äô\n\nThere are Christians who mistakenly feel that the best and only gift we can give to God is to choose Him. Absolutely we must choose Him, but it is God who makes that choice possible. This is made very clear when Christians pray for the salvation of others (as I‚Äôm sure all Christian‚Äôs have). What is it that we are asking God to do when we pray for the salvation of others? Surely it is not to ask God that he make people choose Him on their own, because wouldn‚Äôt that be God‚Äôs doing as well?\n\nThe difficulty that many people have with this concept is trying to reconcile God‚Äôs sovereignty and our free choice. The Bible teaches that God is sovereign over ALL things. The Bible also teaches that we must freely choose God. The question then becomes how does God plan our free choices so that they are entirely according to His plan and also made freely by us. The answer: I don‚Äôt know. God plans what we choose and we are entirely responsible for those choices.\n\nWe must ‚Äòlet God be God.‚Äô There will be things that we cannot understand but we must remember that ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs thoughts are not our thoughts, and his ways not our ways‚Äù as it says in Isaiah. There are many things that we cannot understand about God‚Äôs ways. This is where we need to trust Him.\n\n17. If Christian faith is not a 'blind leap,' what is it?\n\nSome people argue that faith takes over where reason leaves off. This is not so with Christian faith. Reason requires a foundation, which only the Bible can provide. There are only 2 choices, either we try to reason our way TO the truth of the Bible or we reason FROM the truth of the Bible. The first choice attempts to arrive at belief, without justification for the tools of reasoning, the second takes the Bible as the foundation for truth and the justification for all reasoning.\n\nFaith is not without reason. Faith is not above reason, or contrary to reason. In fact faith is demanded by reason. Everyone starts from faith, but not all admit it. Professed unbelievers say that they use reason as their starting point and not faith. We must ask though, what is their reason for trusting reason? The thing is, they don‚Äôt have a reason for trusting reason, they have a ‚Äòblind faith‚Äô in reason.\n\nEveryone starts from faith. The question is not whether we start from faith but whether we will place that faith in God or in man.\n\nThe faith of the professed unbeliever cannot give a reason for reason. Christian faith on the other hand is the basis for all knowledge. The Bible teaches that ‚ÄúAll the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ.‚Äù (2 Colossians vs. 3), and that ‚ÄúThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.‚Äù (Proverbs 1 vs. 7)\n\nChristian faith is not blind, rather it is the pre-condition for rational thought.\n\n18. How do Christians account for universal, immaterial, unchanging logic?\n\nChristians account for universal, immaterial, unchanging logic as it reflects the very nature and thinking of God.\n\nThe Bible accounts for immaterial entities as in John 4 vs. 24 it states: ‚ÄúGod is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.‚Äù\n\nIn Malachi 3 vs. 6 God says ‚ÄúI the Lord do not change.‚Äù accounting for His unchanging nature.\n\nPsalm 90 vs. 2 states: ‚ÄúBefore the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.‚Äù and Psalm 139 vs. 7 ‚Äì 10 states: ‚ÄúWhere can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there. If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast,‚Äù accounting for God‚Äôs universality.\n\nIn Jeremiah 33 vs. 25 God speaks of how He has ‚Äòfixed the laws of heaven and earth.‚Äô Universal, immaterial, unchanging logic is foundational for knowledge. The apostle Paul said in his letter to the Colossians: My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge‚Äù (Chapter 2 vs. 2 ‚Äì 3). Proverbs 1:7 says: ‚ÄúThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.\n\nOf course everyone uses universal, immaterial, unchanging logic, but many do so denying its only possible source. Christianity proclaims the source: ‚ÄúFor from him (God), and through him and to him are all things‚Äù (Romans 11:36).\n\n19. Why don't you use 'traditional' arguments for the existence of God like the 'cosmological' argument?\n\nThe biggest problem with ‚Äòevidential‚Äô type arguments is that if used improperly they leave man as the judge over God, rather than God as the judge over man. You see, even if one is convinced by an evidential type argument, the ultimate authority of that person could very easily remain their own ability to reason, and not God.\n\nA common misconception is that the Christian and ‚Äòunbeliever‚Äô are on common philosophical ground, but the Christian just believes a few things extra that the professed unbeliever does not believe. If this were the case, it would make perfect sense to try to reason with the professed unbeliever, and present evidence so that they too could use their unaided reason to come to that extra belief. The problem is, the minute you use traditional arguments, you grant that the unbeliever can use logic and reason to assess them. You lend credence to a worldview that does not support logic or reason.\n\nThe Bible teaches that everyone knows God but those who deny Him are ‚Äòsuppressing the truth in unrighteousness.‚Äô Apologetics is not about giving evidence to the ignorant, but it is about bringing to light the foolishness of suppressing the truth. ‚ÄòEvidential‚Äô arguments end up showing that God ‚Äòvery likely,‚Äô or ‚Äòmost probably‚Äô exists, but they fall short of the biblical teaching that God‚Äôs existence is inescapable.\n\nWhen I first planned to make this site, I had studied what I felt were the best arguments for the existence of God. As a Christian, I really enjoyed the truth and power of these arguments (one of which I will include at the bottom of this answer). Using these ‚Äòevidential‚Äô arguments however I found made very little impact on those who claim that they do not believe that God exists. Sure, God can use these arguments to bring people to Him, (as I trust He has), but we must make sure that our arguments are consistent with Scripture. Thankfully I was shown the ‚Äòpresuppositional,‚Äô approach which I feel accomplishes this task.\n\nWhat Christians need to do is challenge the ‚Äòpresuppositions‚Äô of other worldviews and, in the most loving way possible, reduce them to absurdity. Christians presuppose (take for granted) that God exists, and therefore we have a basis for universal, immaterial, unchanging laws. We need to ask the materialist, for example, how, based on their presupposition that the universe is entirely made of matter, they can account for such laws.\n\nI used to try to explain away, with evidence, the reasons for evil and suffering in our universe, to ‚Äòunbelievers‚Äô who say it is not possible for an all good God to exist in such a universe. Now I challenge the presuppositions of those who deny the existence of God. How, according to their worldview, can they justifiably distinguish good from evil? They can only do so by being inconsistent with their basic beliefs. They must borrow ideas about right and wrong from the Christian worldview even to state their objection.\n\nStill, for Christians, evidential arguments can be wonderful in lending confidence to what they already believe. My favourite evidential argument is the ‚ÄòCosmological,‚Äô or ‚Äòfirst cause‚Äô argument. Basically stated, ‚Äòeverything which begins to exist, must have a cause.‚Äô For arguing that the universe must have began to exist I like the argument of the impossibility of an absolute infinite past. If the universe had an infinite past, we could never have gotten to a ‚Äònow.‚Äô I use the illustration of an ‚Äòeternal, cosmic video camera.‚Äô:\n\n‚ÄúImagine, if you will, that everything that ever happened in the universe, was recorded on some sort of eternal, cosmic, video machine and you wanted to watch the tape from the beginning to see how you got to be sitting in front of your computer. Unfortunately, since this tape is of an infinite past, with no beginning, once you hit the rewind button, the machine would never stop. You would get to see nothing because an infinite past would have no future. I imagine the only suitable snack for such a viewing would be a bowl of just-popped-into-existence-corn.‚Äù\n\nThe creation of the universe must have been by an entity which is beyond time, or eternal, exactly how the Bible describes God. Great argument for the Christian, but not to be used in a way that leaves the professed unbeliever as judge over God.\n\n20. Why do so many marriages fail?\n\nFirst, no one needs to point out the irony of a man who has never been married telling others why so many marriages fail. I realize that the subject is off topic from this website but I heard a talk recently from a Christian marriage counselor and I felt that the information was important enough to share.\n\nThe reason marriages fail is because they are built on the wrong foundation. They are built on the foundation of ‚Äòbeing in love.‚Äô This may surprise some people, but let me explain. The Biblical definition of love is best summed up in the familiar passage from 1 Corinthians 13 vs. 4 ‚Äì 8:\n\nLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.\n\nWith this definition of love we can see that people do not fall ‚Äòin love.‚Äô Can people ‚Äòfall into kindness?‚Äô Can people fall into ‚Äònot delighting in evil,‚Äô or ‚Äòprotecting‚Äô or ‚Äòtrusting?‚Äô People fall into arousal, they CHOOSE to love.\n\nThe Bible does not teach that people should be ‚Äòin love‚Äô with their spouses, but it does command people to love them.\n\nThe Christian marriage, then, is a marriage where a man and woman make a covenant before God to love each other, not a display that they are in love. Sure it would be wonderful to be ‚Äòin love,‚Äô in fact I can‚Äôt imagine marrying someone I was not ‚Äòin love‚Äô with, but that is not what Christian marriage is about.\n\nIf people get married because they ‚Äòfall in love,‚Äô it makes perfect sense to end that marriage if they ‚Äòfall out of love.‚Äô\n\nIn Christian marriage, the reason to be faithful and remain married is not because your spouse is wonderful or worthy of love, but because of the vow you made in the presence of Almighty God to love that person.\n\nFor those who are not yet married, don‚Äôt decide if you are in love with your chosen partner, but decide if you are willing to choose to love this person for the rest of your life, and to make that commitment before God.\n\nThink of the reason God loves you. Would anyone be so deluded as to say that God loves them because they are worthy of love? Surely not! God loves us because he chooses to love us. Our marriages should be built on the foundation of choosing to love as well.</blockquote>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/limited-atonement/\" target=\"_blank\">Limited Atonement - Proof That God Exists</a>:<blockquote>Indeed Jesus did not do the same for everyone, which means that His atonement for sins is limited. Here are some Bible verses which further support that position:\n\nIsaiah 53:12 ‚ÄúTherefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors.‚Äù\n~ (He bore the sins of many, not all).\n\nMatthew 1:21 ‚ÄúShe will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.‚Äù ~ (His people, not all people).\n\nJohn 6: 37-40 ‚ÄúAll that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.

In my research, I've gained more than just a feel of its metastatic nature, but just a wider vantage point which can always be improved on in time's passing. In comparison, the Jesuit conspiracy is an infant, the Venetian conspiracy, child's play. I can only give descriptions, descriptions that are not necessarily denotative, singular, irrefutable, but somewhat extensive as an article. Current and future journalists and historians might see this and say, an attempt was made but failed to provide much useful information that they didn't already know. I do this for my own conscious, but I also do this for the truth.\n\nEveryone is born into a race, era, nation, class, and gender, but the Jewish Identity is ridiculously transparent in that the more vague it becomes, the less one can discern from others as to what it is to begin with for it reinvents itself so often and had survived this long that it is nothing short of parasitic and cancerous as its descriptions. It has its own hierarchy yet at the same time, without one. It has its own hidden, isolated network, which absolutely must be discerned from its private networks which is externally visible, internally hidden concerning what they do but does some public tasks as middle men. The hidden network is more akin to what the Rothschilds do in contrast to the private network which is what George Soros does for the Rothschilds. They're multiple networks, multiple people in multiple nations, class, genders, eras, religions, and races in their respective hierarchy yet as a whole, collectively seeks to help each other out as an loosely termed Jew in eternal metamorphosis as a tribe that isn't a tribe.\n\nThe very word Jew comes from Judah which means thanksgiving/praise, which is the very thing Lucifer seeks and abuses. Its root word (without the vowel points) is worse, for it means to thank/to praise, and they will find any way to seek after it from you, even \"by way of deception\" which is what MOSSAD in Babylonian Aramaic Hebrew means, which has an English acronym called the Israeli Secret Intelligence Service or I.S.I.S. before they had changed their name to \"The Institute\" (by way of deception, I.S.I.S.) to keep people from being triggered by knowing its real name.\n\nThe word Jew did not exist until 1775 in English. How can that be? No I mean its relatively modern definition that people use as \"Jew\" did not exist until 1775. It was an amalgamation of Judahite and Rabbinic Judaism/Pharisaism, the religion formulated from Neo Babylon. Iewe specifically meant Judahite, but once it changed into Jew, that was no longer the case. There is a difference between Judean and Judahite. Judean means a citizen of the southern kingdom of Judah or within the land of Judah, depending on which biblical era you are referring to. Benjamites were Judeans, some Gentiles were Judeans, but before the kingdom of Judah came about, the Judeans, the Judahites, the Benjamites, the proselyte Gentile believers within the land of Judah within the united tribe of Israel were Israelites. Judeans after the separation of Judah from Israel, Judeans no longer became \"Israelites\" of the northern kingdom of Israel which was reigned by wicked kings and was taken into Assyrian captivity before becoming completly rejected by God. The proselyte Gentile, the foreigner, the \"goy\" which means cattle, within four generations, can be a part of the flesh and blood Israelite. The Judahites and the Benjamites are the flesh and blood Israelites, but to God, it isn't the flesh and blood He was concerned with, rather the title, the identity, which was preserved by a few among those with the same title whom He predestined to be saved not by their works but by their faith that God had given to them.\n\nThe word Hebrew isn't explained properly in the bible as to its etymology, it is mentioned that Joseph was identified as an Hebrew by an Egyptian. Jonah/Jonas called himself a Hebrew but whether he used a name to describe a flesh and blood race or a national identity, is not specified. It is generally assumed for it to be derived from Eber. The Egyptians have a word called (H)a(b/p)iru which is not a specific denotative definition with a flesh and blood identity. Habiru is found in Sumerian, Egyptian, Akkadian, Hittite, Mitanni, and Ugaritic sources to a group of people living as nomadic invaders in areas of the Fertile Crescent from Northeastern Mesopotamia and Iran to the borders of Egypt in Canaan. Depending on the source and epoch, these Habiru are variously described as nomadic or semi-nomadic, rebels, outlaws, raiders, mercenaries, and bowmen, servants, slaves, migrant laborers, etc. The Israelites, if there even is a connection, are just one branch of the Habiru, though Ibri and Habiru are not the same, but Iberi and Habiru might be. Ibri/Ha-ivri means outsider, Hebrew. Habiru means a member of a group. The Ugaritic Habiru/Chabiru is not the same as the Egyptian.\n\nThe word Semite is understood by flesh and blood genetics as \"Mongoloid\" or Asiatic. Its political definition is flesh and blood Arabs, Middle Eastern people. The objective of the Jews identifying with \"Semite\" is to separate themselves from the general grouping of races behind the three \"Abrahamic\" religions in exclusion of Christianity, Europeans/Aryans/\"Caucasoid\" and Africans/Dravidians/\"Negroid\" while very loosely associating with Asians and more specifically favoring Arabs and the religion of Islam over Christianity while ignoring the genetics of the so called Jews in comparison to Arabs which they are genetically predisposed to not be related to them, but if some of those that call themselves Jews are actually Arabs, are they still Jews? Assuming that Jews are Semites, are they being Antisemitic dealing with their Palestinian brethren in bombing them and imprisoning them with walls three times taller than the Berlin wall in certain places?\n\nThe New Testament definition of a Judahite splits into two groupings: Spiritual Judahites, and Physical Judahites. Actually, this definition comes from reading the Old Testament through the Holy Spirit that those who love the Lord with all their heart, soul, mind, strength are those that circumcise their hearts, not their foreskins. The Physical Judahites had hearts hardened by God so they were rejected by God so God had divorced from them through Jesus Christ who is Abraham's Seed (singular noun) from the royal line of Judah of the Order of Melchizedek who is Shem that inherited Noah's blessing, whom Noah was from the untainted line of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God, but Jesus is the \"Second Adam\" though he existed from everlasting (before \"time\") to everlasting (the end of the corrupt history of mankind into the New Heaven/Earth/Jerusalem forevermore) as the Alep and the Taw, the sacrificial passover lamb on the cross. The promise God had given to the Judahites was transferred to the Judahites inwardly that serve King Jesus as God had made it clear to the Judahites by flesh and blood that they are no longer chosen, no matter what works they do, it is over. The Spiritual Judahites became the Christians. If a physical Judahite or a physical Gentile was not a Christian, they are not in the promise of God. A Christian was a spiritual identity just as Judahite used to be a spiritual identity before it became corrupted and reverted to a traditional cultural identity. Here's a different example, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese people are collectively identified as the people of the Han (dynasty) yet they had later became their own separate sovereign nations and had multiple different dynasties in their respective territories and with more than two thousand years of wars to this very day, they had become historically, genetically, religiously, politically, fundamentally different from each other. Only complete idiots seek to restore the Han dynasty to reunite the Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese people. There's also many different Chinese nations that are not apart of China. If a foreign entity tries to revitalize this ancient Imperial system within the heart of China, there's nothing short of evil that seeks to make people unite under a new system that is in concept, not the same as it formerly was, nor will it ever be \"close enough\", it will serve to control and destroy China from within like \"The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited\" is doing to China through Hong Kong and their underground City of London aligned Black International gangs.\n\nJudahists are what we call \"Jews\" now, which are of the Religious, Rabbinic, Pharisaic, Essene, Talmudic, Kabbalistic, Gnostic, Ebionite, Manichaean, Messianic, Crypto, Banking, Occult, Court, Freemasonic, Frankist, Sabbatean, Communistic, National, Cultural, Secular, Political, et cetera, Jewish identity, though some of those are obsolete, there's still some revitalized forms of it. Judahists are not specifically biblical Judahites because of the destruction of Herod's temple in AD 70 as a prophetic sign of God divorcing physical Israel for the Israel of God, prophesied by Jesus Christ that no stone shall be left unturned, the time of Jacob's trouble had already happened in AD 66-70. The literal tribulation had already happened, the physical type of rapture had already happened by the Christians (that includes the Christian Judahites) that fled for the mountains based off of the sign that Jesus described that would be the sign to know when to leave. The spiritual tribulation happens in the lives of the predestined, it is God who chastises them. The spiritual rapture have not happened. The tares have to be gathered first to be burned while leaving the wheat unharmed. Gog is the Judahists while Magog is their leader. The Antichrist was Nero the Caesar rendered as NRO QSR (616) or NRON QSR (666), converting the Greek letters in Hebrew then using Hebrew Gematria. The False Prophet to me was the Pharisees, the Whore of Babylon, the Synagogue of Satan. The First Jewish Revolt came about when the Judahists not only decided to coin their own coins, but also to not pay their taxes to the tax collectors working in part of the Roman system while the Christians had their separate system that was mistakenly accepted legally by Pontius Pilate with the authority of Caesar/Kaiser in his proclaimation of Jesus of Nazareth to be the King of the Judahites, thus everything he said is law which the Roman Empire respected its traditions as it had done to King Herod's system. I believe in the Partial Preterist + Amillenialist stance, we are already in tribulation in our daily lives so I believe in a Post-Tribulation rapture, while again, maintaining the Partial Preterist + Amillenialist stance. Anglican Priest Ethelbert William Bullinger (E.W. Bullinger) is where most of this modern understanding of the seven Dispensations garbage comes from, which is not the same form of \"Dispensationalism\" that was traditionally held which is that the church was formed at Pentecost that had done away with the older system God had with the Judahites. This dispensationalism you know of is called hyper/ultra-dispensationalism. E.W. Bullinger is also a member of the Universal Zetetic Society, the name of the Flat Earth Society before they had their name changed. Through hyper/ultra-dispensationalism, the Pre-Trib rapture as well as the acceptance of (Rabbinic) Judaism in implying that the Jews can be raptured just for being a Jew and push eisegetical interpretations that makes a Jew saved by blood, that people have to serve the Jews in order to be saved even if they disregard whatever you say concerning true biblical, exegetical interpretation of the bible concerning the Judahites in distinction to and contrast of the Jews.\n\n\"Biblical Judahism\" is going to confuse some of you, so let me say the Levitical Priesthood system along with the Royal Line of David had ended with Jesus Christ. The Saducees were probably the only legitimate Judahists during Jesus' time, but again, they had no Levitical Priesthood, so no King can be crowned, so no Judahite were Judeans. King Herod and his descendants are Edomites that the Roman Empired named him the King of the Judahites. The Pharisees served King Herod's line with bitterness to the point of rejecting him as well as Jesus for Caesar to be their king, completely rejecting what had made them a Judahite and/or Benjamite Judean to begin with. The Judean population was destroyed by 70 AD, while their religion, the false Judahism had spread to proselytes the gentiles into thinking that they are still not rejected by God and that they're Judahites by flesh and blood. The Saducees died out, the Essenes were Phoenician Jews from Phoenicia that served Marduk/Dagon/El/Moloch/Belus/Ba'al/Ba'al Zebub/IHVH/Adonis/Jupiter/Zeus and Inanna/Ishtar/Asherah/Asher/Ashtaroth/Esther/Easter/Venus/Aphrodite which the Zidonians brought into Israel as mentioned in the books of 1 Kings and 2 Kings (1 Kings 11:5,33; 2 Kings 23:13), while the Zidonians were Canaanites and the Phoenicians are also the Canaanites, Tyre is in Lebanon is in Canaan. The Tribe of Dan was dissolved into the Canaanite tribes while also being the Spartans, which the land of Dan was close to Canaan. Later, as Samaria, the Ten Tribes of the northern kingdom of Israel dissolved and had overlapping with Canaanite land. IHVH is a Samaritan guess name. Sacrifices were done to Moloch in the name of IHVH. The temples/altars of Yaho made in various places outside of Palestine were syncretised with its respective surrounding idols. There were lots of syncretism of idols and symbolism going on between the time of Solomon to Jesus, as well as in the Renaissance period and the Enlightenment period, to this day by those that tries to fuse all the attributes of all the idols into one unified system like what Giordano Bruno sought to accomplish with his mnemonic devices. I should also mention that in the bible, you were a Judahite from your father's side for it's a Patriarchy.\n\nThe lesser known form of Jewish Identity is the one from the line of King Herod and the line of Jesus ben Gamala the High Priest that married Mary Magdalene, in essence, is tied to the real \"Holy Grail\", the chalice, the womb of Mary Magdalene/Boethus. The myth of Joseph of Arimathea was conjured up, conveniently came up during the time England sought to reform its own system to be independent from Rome yet have a similar setup without Rome through using pseudo-archaeological, dubious sources to claim that England is a better Rome than Rome instead of focusing on the doctrinal issues which Anglicans were really pushing the same Catholic Penance, Arminianism-like doctrines that Henry VIII liked but hated their Pope, persecuting Protestants for not believing in what he believes in. In a similar manner, under \"Bloody Mary\" and \"Shamie Jamie\" but lenient more towards Catholics a tad bit as they're both Catholics. In a similar manner under Charles I and Oliver Cromwell lenient towards Protestantism but under Oliver Cromwell, the Jews were welcomed in and he enslaved Ireland. This is a political, as well as a bloodline claim to being the Jews through the line of the other Jesus, not the Jesus Christ. The Merovigians claim this bloodline, whether or not if it's real, nobody knows. The Venetians claim this bloodline and call themselves \"The Chosen\", many of the Black Nobility are related to the Rothschilds or their real last name being Bauer, many of the Papal Nobility married to the Jews, the claim whether or not is real, is a lie in itself, for they also believe that they are saved by blood, like all Jews do. They also claim to be tied to other ancient bloodlines like Thor, the Pharaohs, and the Roman Oligarchs. There is a truce between the Jews with power and the oligarchs while the Jews and the oligarchs become one. \n\nThe Khazarian Jews are of the line of King Herod, an Edomite, made proselytes out of the Khazarian people since their leader was converted. Some of the Sephardic Jews are also former Islamic people that had converted to Judaism and became one with the Marranos, crypto Jews. Sepharvaim i.e., \"the two Sipparas,\" or \"the two booktowns\" is an Assyrian town whose people worshiped Adramelech and Anamelech and later the people went to Samaria which the Samaritans/rejected northern kingdom of Israel are outside of God's will. Obadiah/Obadias was a Edomite prophet that went to Sepharad or Saparda in the Persian language. Sepharim comes from this, which they are not Sepharvaim. Sepharims are Edomites, Sephardic Jews therefore are not Judahites, not even Israelite, but a brother of Israel so are technically \"Hebrew\" yet God didn't bless all Hebrews, only a remnant of them. A Hebrew that isn't a Judahite isn't God's people by blood. The Spaniards became good at torturing people through over a thousand years of dealing with Muslims but now Spain is virtually irredeemable and a rotting corpse of its former image under the kingdom of Aragon. There's many other different Jewish groups worldwide but only the Sephardic and Ashkenazic were deemed to be legitimate while the black Jews were no longer identified as a Jew through the Babylonian Talmud which only the Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews are aware of while they shoved that down the other Jewish population's throats to claim their unwarranted self importance over them. Through the Hamitic myth derived from the Babylonian Talmud, black people was cursed by Noah to be their slaves. Also, slanted eyes are made \"kosher\" but black skin is not. Ancient Asian Jewish populations like the Kaifeng Jews do exists, but they're not considered to be legitimate until they adhere to the Babylonian Talmud. The various black Jews like the Morrocan Jews, the Ethiopian Jews, Beta Israel, Lemba people, they're all not legit by the Babylonian Talmud yet they are technically Jews. The accepted race of the Jews is primarily of German stock, which Germans are Ashkenazi, secondarily of the diaspora that includes both Sephardim Jews and Ashkenazim Jews. Genetically speaking, the Jews have no genomes that they can claim as their own to be identified from other genomes of other races. This also applies to the Sephardi, even the Mizrahi Jews, Maghrebi Jews, Berber Jews, Indian Jews, and last but not least, the Yemeni Jews though besides the Sephardi, the latter groups are more likely candidates to be genuine flesh and blood descendents of a dead nation and religious system taken over by a Babylonian religion, and they're still not Judahites inwardly like Christians until they completely renounce their Jewishness, while they're smaller in numbers in comparison to the Ashkenazi and Sephardi. However, they will be genetically not like their spiritual ancestors, but become the people that they had intermarried with for multiple generations to not have any resemblance of their own DNA. All the other Jewish groups not mentioned that are in other nations are more likely to be from afformentioned populations. Khazarian-Ashkenazic Jews and some Sephardic Jews are more genetically predisposed to be psychotic and have mental disorders for extensive, restrictive interbreeding. The Jews have an oath that nullifies and voids any oath that they've taken a year prior and a year in the future called the Kol Nidre that is done at Yom Kippur, the Rabbinic version of Yom Teruah that is their traditions added to, considered superior to the written Torah that is the Pentateuch; Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. In other words, it's not in the law, ergo, has no power to nullify and void.\n\nKaraite Jews by definition is \"a Jewish sect that recognizes only the Hebrew Scriptures as the source of divinely inspired legislation and denies the authority of the postbiblical tradition of the Talmud; the sect arose in Iraq in the eighth century\". Some people assume that these people were those that Jonah/Jonas witnessed to, but some Muslims claims that they have some ancient Muslim influences. Whether or not Jonas made babies later in Nineveh, we don't know, but again, through Jesus Christ, people are Judahites in the inside. Karaite Jews are like Orthodox Hasidic Jews that hate Zionism and fighting in the army agaisnt the Palestinians, yet tend to be pro Israelis if they live within the State of Israel.\n\nChristianity was historically and biblically against the Jews as well as those that call themselves Judahites yet weren't Christians in what they taught. Attempts of infiltration had occured ever since the Rabbinic Pharisees tried to call Jesus a Rabbi bringing him to their system as equals. To Jesus, the only one deserving to be called Rabbi was the Holy Spirit which the Pharisees had not but the Shekinah glory, Semiramis, Inanna, Queen of Heaven. The Samaritans were duped by Simon Magus, many Gnostic sects were formulated by Rabbinic Judahists along with duped Greeks, Byzantine was a tool of the Venetians, the Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Salomonici came in contact with the Morets and the Sturgeon family teachers of the Babylonian mysteries that also taught the Kabbalah and the mystical side of the Muslim religion, the Marrano Jews, Gasparo Contarini the Venetian, and the Aragon controlled Los Alumbrados Templars that fled from persecution became the Jesuit Order that later in turn helped create the Barvarian Illuminati while the Venetian controlled Sir John Dee and Sir Francis Bacon with the help of the Venetian Paolo Sarpi and the Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel whom assisted Sir John Dee create the Rosicrucian Order and British Freemasonry. The B'nai B'rith (Order of the Sons of the Covenant) is above Scottish Rite Freemasonry in one sense, but were both formed under the Black Guelphs and the British Knights of Malta whom some Templars and Venetians as the British East India Company merged under the Order of the Garter that controls the Council/Commitee of 300 and had set things up to have a New Venice through British Freemasonry within the City of London. The Jesuits went under and joined the British system since they were getting kicked out of many other countries.\n\nPierre-Jean De Smet SJ controlled the Freemason Brigham Young the Mormon leader as well as the Scottish Rite founder Albert Pike whom based his system from the Rite of Perfection made by Chevalier de Bonneville within the Jesuit college of Clermont. The ancient rites of Scottish Rite Freemasonry were formerly devised by the groups in France including the Council of the Emperors of the East and West (now known as the European Council of Princes) and the Royal Stewart's Chapter of Clermont, based at the College of the Jesuits, Paris. Scottish Rite founder Albert Pike and the B'nai B'rith and Order of Zion leader Judah Philip Benjamin, both were for the Confederacy and funded by the Rothschild-Baring bankers for the British monarchy created the Knights of the Klu Klux Klan from whatever left of the Knights of the Golden Circle, which was a \"Protestant\" order but was also funded by the British to destroy America, controlled by Freemasons. Who controlled them both? Lord Palmerston. It was also the B'nai B'rith that had created the Sufi school which is a British Freemasonic front to militarize and control the Muslims into Freemasonry as well as pushing the more hate fueled parts of the Quran during Mohammad's Medina Jihad instead of the Mecca Religion though both are within the Quran and are not separated from each other so Islam was always inherently a radical religion. The Mecca part of the Quran during the first 13 years of Mohammad's ministry talks not of Jihad but the Medina part of the Quran and the Sira and Hadith is focused on the Jihad, so in total, 31% of Islam is pushing Jihad while the remainding 69% is the religious part of political Islam which was funded by the Vatican initially to take over Jerusalem for them but they've rebelled. Much of what Roman Catholicism and the Orthodox Church does is what the Muslims practice as well, from the veneration of the dead, the clothing for women, using the same symbols in their architecture, and so on. However, because of their radical nature, they had become a threat to Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Nationalism, nearly any -ism except for Judaism to an extent. Ibn-Saud is a crypto Jew, Wahhab is also a crypto Jew supported by Ibn-Saud pushed Salafism. Though the Sufis and the Wahhabis have different history, they're both controlled by the British since its inception and both are under the general Muslim Brotherhood that functions as a Freemasonic Order also controlled by the British monarchy and the Jews. There's also Zionist Muslims in spite of what the Quran implies (even believed by Muslims themselves) about some Christians along with Jews being turned into monkeys and pigs by Allah. These fake Muslims are called the Tafkiris which there's some overlapping between the Tafkiris and the Salafis as Salafi-Takfiris. Hamas is controlled opposition by the Jesuits so that the Palestinians can't have a genuine revolt. Saudi Arabia was always controlled by the British Empire for as long as \"Arabia\" is under the Saudis.\n\nThe Jews among themselves have a huge identity crisis. It is a melting pot of confusion. There are religious Jews, secular Jews, Israeli citizens, Palestinian Jews, Zionists, Ex-religious Jews, Ex-secular Jews, Ex-Israeli citizens, Ex-Palestinian Jews, Ex-Zionists. You can see how it can overlap each other. Every \"Jew\" would have to pick what they identify with, but not many of the Jews understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the genetic question, the Holohoax, the underlying geopolitical agendas, even their own culture. Some of these also apply to the \"goyim\". A Zionist that's a goyim that does things for the Jew (usually during the Sabbath since the Goyim are not under the \"law\") are called \"Shabbos Goy\" although it's used in a more general sense of being proxy agents for the Jews which Hillary Clinton (whom has some Jesuit Perci blood) and Angela Merkel are through George Soros the Hungarian Nazi Jew that stole from his own Jewish neighbor's goods under the Nazi army which was to him, was the happiest time in his life. Being an Ex-Jew would label one a \"self hating Jew\" that would only encourage Jews to not lose their identity by a negative example which is a concept that they mastered, that any opposition to their cause is in turn the source of their spirit of self vitimization, a common cult mindset that I see in every group ever, but for the Jewish Identity, it is emphasized, it is everything. It's a form of dualism and worship of evil. There is nothing to be proud of an heritage that promotes hypocrisy and the destruction of nations that self victimize themselves as means to pass judgement over others. The Jews use pity for their favor, which is why they had been trying to manipulate feminists, other races, the LGBT crowd, even promoting Muslims to destroy their societies which it had backfired to some poor and middle class Jews that can't afford to leave to greener pastures or be protected from them and are there to make the rich Jews blameless so that the Jews as a whole (remember, it's a multilayered, decentralized, distributed, transparent, private, hidden network) aren't going to be blamed. This is a multilayered self victimization that the inner circle (B'nai B'rith, Sanhedrin, Rabbis, court Jews, banker Jews) uses that outer group (religious, secular, poor Jews, \"innocent Jews\") and even among the inner circle, there are factions and backstabbing that goes on and on. This is their parasitic nature that feeds off of negativity to gain footing into whatever society that they find themselves within. Their anti messiah being Adolf Hitler had given the means for their messiah Rothschilds to create the State of Israel in a seemingly win-win situation in getting rid of the Jews in Germany and providing the Jews a place to be without fearing oppression. Did I mention that Adolf Hitler was funded by Jewish bankers? Oh yes, the Jews therefore are responsible for the fake Holocaust caused by typhus because they had funded Hitler to even have a Nazi Germany to begin with, all the while, we ignore the German Holocaust of the firebombing of Dresden and other places in Germany, and the Jews are responsible for the Palestinian Holocaust that goes on because Adolf Hitler promoted a Zionist State of Israel. There is always and end to a terrible evil with its own destruction upon itself, the win-win situation for Germany was temporary and it is the International Jews that further gives grounds to promote \"Zionism\" just by being identified as one either negatively or positively. Until all the Jews were sent to Palestine, the Jews will always guilt trip people and infiltrate into the rankings of every society that they come in contact with. Without them, the Yinon/Greater Israel Plan and the Kalergi Plan would never happen, the Tikkun Olam would be nothing more than a fable to scare people in campfire stories.\n\nWherever one looks, there's a distant Jewish hidden hand behind the chaos that occurs at least in the geopolitical scale of things. They have many proxies and uses their confusing Identity Politics to lower the mindsets of what one is to be bound by what others say that it is. They control virtually all of the secret societies one way or the other, through doctrines, through infiltration, through creation of proxy organizations. They also love Aristotelian philosophy as much of the things Aristotle teaches is also what the Babylonian Talmud teaches in its essense. They sometimes pretend to be white then focuses on all possible negatives concerning reality and history and whatever that they teach. They have the mindset of a nomadic shepherd. To some measure, even well intended Christians adopt a Draconian mindset of the pessimism of King Solomon. In some sense, even anti Jew, anti Zionist Christians are still a Jew by even identifying with them in any shape or form, as they would claim that anything right that the Christian or the Muslim talks about comes from (Rabbinic) Judaism that birthed the Christian and Muslim faith when in reality, Christianity is the true continuation of biblical Judahism reformed through Jesus Christ and had done away with the law that kills for the Holy Spirit which the wholeness of the doctrines that came from the Holy Spirit was completed after the book of Revelation was made, while the Vatican's Islam is a mere political tool that in essense is not the same as genuine Christianity which was found again under Saint Augustine and reformed the Roman Catholic Church under Martin Luther and later John Calvin in creating a genuine Catholic Ecclesia without the heresies in the Roman Catholic Church as well as the Orthodox Church. Saint Augustine was more of a Platonist than an Aristotelian although he might not had been an hardcore Platonist which would make one believe in Monism which is neither theistic nor atheist, yet fundamentally the opposite of both. If someone reads John chapter 1 in the greek very closely, and if they also grasp the concepts of Monism, what John is saying here is beyond the traditional concept of what cultural Christianity depicts who God is, for it's almost similar to Monism, and it might had been the chapter that would help the Greeks understand how great is God which isn't the same gods and goddesses described in other religions, greater than and different to ŒßŒ¨ŒøœÇ but more closer to ŒºŒøŒΩŒ¨œÇ, but that's just my opinion.\n\nüí´<strong>The Death of the Truth Movement Sep 11, 2016 @ 00:00</strong>\n\nIt's been 15 years since 9/11/2001 three towers were detonated not just with C4 but also with nukes beneath the Twin Towers that vaporized the asbestos filled, silver filled towers at free fall while the Pentagon gets hit by a missile and George Walker (Bush/Scherrf + Perci) reads a children's book upside down. 19 years since 9/11/1997 NASA's Mars Global Surveyor reaches Mars. 25 years since 9/11/1991, George (Bush/Scherff) Sr. made the New World Order speech. 66 years since 9/11/1950, President Harry S. Truman approved military operations north of the 38th parallel (The Korean War was also a false flag operation). 190 years since 9/11/1826 Captain William Morgan, an ex-freemason is arrested in Batavia, New York for debt after declaring that he would publish \"The Mysteries of Free Masonry\", a book against Freemasonry. 227 years since 9/11/1789 Alexander Hamilton is appointed the first United States Secretary of the Treasury. 367 years since 9/11/1649 Oliver Cromwell's English Parliamentarian troops take the town and execute its garrison ending the Siege of Drogheda. 790 years since 9/11/1226 the Roman Catholic practice of public adoration of the Blessed Sacrament outside of Mass spreads from monasteries to parishes. 911 is IXXI which is just a part of the Kabbalistic Tree of Knowledge and also the two pillars and the square and compass in which the compass contains the eye which to them is the anus, their upside is down, the crown is affected by the root (but not to be mistaken with the base chakra), it is a bastardization of what Monism is about, they know not of what Pythagoras, Plato, and Plotinus meant, but they liked Aristotle's irrational logic that self defeats itself when epistemologically looking at the root of what their claims stand upon whom Martin Luther compared all of the writ of the Rabbis to be less enlightening in comparison to the pagan Aesop's fables that have more wisdom.\n\nIt is with great disappointment to say that the real Truth Movement is becoming ever more crazier and falling away into a freemasonic psychological operation called the Flat Earth Theory. This day is for me, a memorial of formerly intellectual truthers that at least mentally, sold themselves out to the Flat Earther garbage. Every day from here on out is a perpetual memorial of the death of the Truth Movement until they wake up, which they probably won't and will continue to believe in many more garbage from the mindbending Tavistock Institute. It goes to show how stupid many of these former truthers are seeking after an egotistical, psychologically appealing doctrine. I haven't made an article that is entirely dedicated to their stupidity but I've made this article concerning the nature of their deception here: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/examples-memetic-psychological-operations/\" target=\"_blank\">Some Examples of Memetic Psychological Operations</a>. Ever since December 2014, the rise of Flat Earther disinfo exponentially exploded, though before then it was a very slow, gradual, linear climb or should I say, decline of IQ that had kept them in obscurity until something triggered the explosion, making them from nobodies to somebodies. They invoked the moon landing hoax mentality which really the hoax here is that people are calling a hoax. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings\" target=\"_blank\">Third-party evidence for Apollo Moon landings</a> exists. There were mockup training sessions done in studios as well, that part isn't even a mystery. Mars picture being taken on Earth are real but are diversions of a deeper conspiracy that doesn't automatically means that not even our rovers haven't gone to Mars. When I see people like Texe Marrs and Eric Jon Phelps fall for this stupid meme, in retrospect, it makes sense to me as to WHY they are just that stupid. Excessive eisegetical Anglican KJV literalism. They had drank too much British Propaganda as well as CIA and KGB disinfo. Historians get rusty when it comes to mathematics and physics. Their own mindsets are limited in focusing too much on instincts over intelligence. In a similar manner, those that believe in the moon landing to be a hoax are in a similar mindset of a open mind that has nothing inside. Many ideas when examined properly simply crumble. To me, there's only two specific and distinct pure religious and philosophical mindsets that are worth looking into, but all else are either Satanic or simply imaginary, full of evidence against itself in trying to justify their irrational stance. Most Truthers will probably never ever know what these two specific and distinct pure religious and philosophical mindsets will ever be from their own research, and for that I can say, can't be helped. I am not boasting in saying such a statement, but I can live with and die with the fact that I have been graced to be able to comprehend them. Though you might know what they are connotatively, you probably won't grasp it denotatively.\n\nüí´<strong>Health Conclusions 2 Sep 29, 2016 @ 11:54</strong>\n\nPerhaps this is my last conclusion concerning health though there is no Health Conclusions 1, there is <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/conclusions-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Conclusions 1</a>. I'm slowly running out of things to share for I've seem to reach the limit of human healing in this era in history. Perhaps the future really does lie in genetically modified evolution and in XNA, but in its process, will lower the current population of the earth. Would we form entities greater than ourselves that would replace us? If so, I'm right in saying that we've reached a dead end as humans, we can't ever escape death through our works and that it always was a fool's errand. As many Intelligent Idiots had said: \"Life sucks and then you die\", one can't help but to think like a nihilist in such mindsets, but there is a soul as there is a signal, but the receiver doesn't cointain the soul, just like there's no little men behind the TV or the radio. It is for humanitarian purposes that one seeks to lessen the pain that we all have in our lives as we seek to innovate our problems away, but until we break through a singularity into a paradigm shift, for most people, we can only seek comfort among each other no matter how meaningless it might seem to be while seeking after dreams that are worth dying for to elevate humanity in which is always better than nightmares that are not worth living for to destroy our humanity.\n\nUtilize Homeopathic Tissue Cell Salts first to get your minerals before moving onto general Homeopathic medicine all the while utilizing Urotherapy which isn't limited to drinking your own pee unless you are taking synthetic B vitamins which then you shouldn't drink it. Sex could be a form of healing though I don't promote playing with fire so casually. Don't rely on any stimulants and aromatics. Have a High Fat Low Carb diet regardless of if it's organic and/or non-GMO. Become a Omnivore that's not afraid of eating raw meat from the land and sea. Brush your teeth with some Sodium Bicarbonate and invest in a waterpick. Move your body but gaining excessive muscle mass or too much cardio isn't healthy. Distilled water is pure water, but don't rely too much on it in its pure state or else you will leech out minerals that your body needs. Seek to be relatively clean within your environment inside and out, but living within sterile environments for too long is in itself unhealthy. Getting a medical grade back brace is cheaper than investing too much on Chiropractors and Osteopaths all the while try to grasp how you can adjust your own spine without pulling it too hard. Pectus Excavatum and flared ribs are curable with the right corset. Seek to incorporate and be aware of TCM principles concerning what you eat. Don't trust Naturopaths and Vegans, they're most likely wrong about multiple subjects concerning healing. Have your food be your medicine but don't have your food be your main medicine. Besides genuine, pure, non GMO powdered aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), melatonin, and DMSO, seek vitamins and minerals in its natural state, buffered and in natural ratios and dosages observed in nature in a synergistic blend. Don't take poisons, but be aware of whatever few things that western synthetic medicine shares that is actually helpful under emergency situations. Don't overuse colloids. Any form of zappers are useless against Lyme's disease and Morgellon's disease because of artificial nanoparticulants in the air and food that we eat is a game changer obstacle that we all face to minimize intake in as much as possible. There is no perfect cure for everything. Avoid everything that contains aborted fetal cells. Get a midwife to help you and your spouse in having natural live birth. Don't have your child leave the side of the mother until the age of five, that means breastfeeding continues up until they're five years of age as well. Don't have them exposed to matters concerning sex until they're old enough while avoid giving them toxins that causes premature puberty. When they are mature enough, teach them about true healing.\n\nüí´<strong>Time in Metaphysics and Christianity Oct 5, 2016 @ 16:47</strong>\n\nTime is passing of magnitudes. Time doesn't exist. Your memories exists in your mind and soul but not in \"time\". Zero isn't a number but it represents magnitude. Time is a measuring stick. There's much effects observed through passing of time, but time is not the cause of that effect directly. How the Christian Bible defines time isn't against the purely Neoplatonic understanding of time directly. The rudimentary principle (see Colossians 2:8) are the orderly arrangements of the cosmos set in motion by God which the sun and the moon shows day and night and the passing of time observable. Eternity isn't bound to said rudimentary principle, but there can be events occuring in the New Heaven, New Earth, there won't be however, any rudimentary principle that governs the world now for the Lamb of God becomes the light of the world and have no darkness, no sea, no stars, no sun, no moon. It is God that sustains eternity as a continual miraculous state that's the greatest testimony that God is who He is and only the saved would desire to be a part of the final parousia while those that doesn't seek to be raptured as how the Book of Revelation in and of itself explains how it would happen actually adds to it and in doing so, seeks not to hear the last trump which by the way, is after the seventh which the seventh trumpet already happened in AD 70. How the Christian Bible defines time is actually irrelevant to metaphysical concepts of time since there still will be a \"flow of time\", a passing of magnitudes, but the state of the whole universe would be qualitatively different. The sun and the sky stopped under Joshea (it's not Joshua) which \"stopped time\" but had given the Israelite army more \"time\" to fight their battle.\n\nAlthough there is a passing of magnitudes that our minds can remember passing, the 3D world in and of itself isn't dependent on time, while time is dependent on the 3D for it is a privation of 3D just as shadows are a privation of light, shadows aren't real, and time isn't either. If there was an infinitely perfect and large conceptual hourglass filled with infinitesimal units of conceptual stuff, although there is a qualitative difference in measuring the directional flow of time from a distance, if one were to look closely at the middle of the hourglass infinitesimally close as possible, you can't see anything pass through it, there's no time taken between one infinitesimal unit to reach the bottom half of the hourglass, there's no time flowing within the conceptual borderline itself.\n\nSpatial force and motion by privation creates time, but time isn't real, while \"space\" in \"outer space\" also has no attributes in and of itself. The force and motion that creates the centrifugal divergence radiation as space present in matter is not present in the inertia and acceleration that the black hole has although it's point nonspecific and there is no such thing as a \"hole\" in \"space\" when space itself is nothing, rather, it's counterspatial inertia and acceleration that is centripedal convergence as counterspace overriding the spatial force and motion that is centrifugal divergence, but it still \"ejects\" stuff out from itself and goes back into itself while the dielectric plane of the black hole is what creates planets or galaxies which there is no magnetism within, like there is no magnetism within the center of a magnet. What occupies an atom is from counterspace emanating from the center as space, the dielectric inertial plane which 180 degrees from it, \"magnetism\" emanates or radiates as two hyperbola planes which are ultimately connected as a hypotrochoid, a toroid that flows in one direction yet in effect creating two qualitative different \"poles\" although they're not really poles. Dielectricity gives \"mass\" to matter. Light is not matter, but it can affect matter as a transverse coaxial circuit with the dielectric plane in the center of the axis while the electric and magnetic \"waves\" are 90 degrees from each other. How can light \"emit\" anything in a vacuum that is the lightbulb? Light is aether/field perturbation just as anything in our universe is frequencies. Anyways, there is still \"time\" even if you ever get crushed by the inertia and acceleration of the black hole which its super mass doesn't exist in the XYZ plane but in the negative, so to speak. There's no \"wormholes\" in space, there's no alternative universes, \"time\" is always in the present but our feeble minds have a hard time grasping that while we seek to reify an abstraction, a privation that only exists within our minds and doesn't exist in existence, in ontological reality, in field theory.\n\nThere is eternity in God which all souls that is of God has in Heaven, while all the rest of the souls that is of Satan also has in Hell for there is no death, termination, annihilation of the soul in Hell/Gehenna/Lake of Fire which is a metaphysical spiritual location of eternal torment where the worms don't die and neither does you. To assume that is to be so is to first assume that there is no separation of the triparte being which leads to soul sleep doctrines and the unbiblical annihilation irrationalization in not trusting the bible to mean what it says and so are not believers. The bible shows many times that when people gave up the \"ghost\", it means their spirit departs from their body which is the biblical definition of death. You don't die in Hell, your spirit however, might go to Hell. You can't have your soul be annihilated either to be in a state of nonexistence in the metaphysical sense when you're already non-existent. Destroyer of souls, that is God, the second death is eternal punishment, there's no way of getting around that. They insist that Hell is a state of which one is under jurisdictionally and is accepted by non believing humanists that say that they are Christians yet reject the core tenants of Christianity and are closet \"gnostics\" that want to live in the world righteously as if that merits spiritual life in heaven which in doing so have no righteousness of God because they have no faith in Jesus Christ with all their everything to place their complete trust in God. They don't want to grasp the eternal things in Christ but the temporal rudiments in the cosmos.\n\nHow Monistic cults in history talk about matter is that it's ever changing its form and likewise, paradigm shifts in our understanding of our universe is also ever changing. That's what they meant by reincarnation. Fecal matter becomes food for the plants that bear fruit of which we eat and defecate till we die as the matter that is used is deconstructed and reconstructed eternally. They don't talk about the soul being tied to the matter, it is matter that reincarnates, but the soul is not matter, therefore, souls don't reincarnate, rather, they return to the One. They believe in the soul but they don't believe in God. The Absolute, the Monad to them is real but it isn't a \"being\" which to them is represented as the number 5, mankind, anything with animus and a conscious. This is why Neoplatonic Christians are not Hardcore Neoplatonists, neither are Neoplatonic Humanists which they are more akin to being Pagans than Christians in their outlook. All \"gnostics\" that are not Hardcore Neoplatonists are usually atheists that doesn't believe that the soul is real or they are actually pagans that has a corrupted translation and amalgamation of religious concepts which is what Humanists and Naturalists do, which that also includes the Kabbalahists that follow the Talmud, the Zohar, etc., all stemming from fables, myths, which true Neoplatonists can distinguish metaphysics from spiritual concepts. Christians as well as the many cults that fails to grasp the concepts of Monism in history are guilty of misrepresenting Monism and vice versa.\n\nTime cannot be reified, but that doesn't mean that God isn't in control of the destiny of everyone and what happens in the finite temporal rudimentary principle time and in the eternity \"time\" in Heaven and Hell. He determines what goes on in time in being the creator of time at least in the biblical definition of time as well as the metaphysical definition of time. Time can only exist in relation to something, but before the creation of time/cosmos, God was in time/eternity. It is a great mystery which all Christians seek to be a part in the time/eternity which no Monist can truly grasp because it's beyond their understanding based on Apophaticism which isn't properly understood as the (retroductive/abductive) method explained by those that aren't Neoplatonists that doesn't understand how to come to conclusions via negativa. Because we don't know what time/eternity is although we know what time is, it is going to stay a mystery for God hating Monists but something that would be experienced for Christians.\n\nSome external sources for more proper context as to what I'm talking about:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlJqWNlyRKw\" target=\"_blank\">ETERNITY DOES NOT SUBMIT TO TIME HERESIES: The Refutation Of All Gnostic Heresies</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlZUcuCyWSY\" target=\"_blank\">Rediscovery of Lost Pythagorean Sacred Geometry, Platos Divided Line & Pentagram Part 1</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNN3VhcRfjM\" target=\"_blank\">Uncovered Lost Pythagorean Grand Unified Theory Equation, Platos Divided Line & Pentagram Part 2</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNIWMX-r7iU\" target=\"_blank\">The Greatest LOST SECRET of the PYTHAGOREANS rediscovered & explained</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCfzL9ncbKo\" target=\"_blank\">Two Selves & the Soul: Lost teachings of ancient Greek & Monistic metaphysics</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2OgZovex9k\" target=\"_blank\">Magnetism: Two Competing 'pictures' of Reality.

Many of these people are really at the mercy of the judges' own interpretations on whether or not they decide to use the spirit of the law or the letter of the law. Not only that, they are also at the mercy of ever changing laws that would come in the future under evil people. Some of the subgroups under the Tax Honesty Movement are seeking to form what is practically the same as the Sovereign Citizen Movement except as through misinterpreting religion, primarily Christianity. In one hand, the subgroup hides behind the facade of the Tax Honesty Movement but on the other hand, not only misinterpret scripture to suit their eisegetical, heretical agendas and make you think that their way is the only way, they honestly believe that they can use \"Church Immunity\" to be exempt from taxation which if you are a genuine researcher in history, you will find that many Christian groups were persecuted for not paying their taxes that they believed that they didn't owe, all the while, only Christianized nations didn't bother with taxing churches. These extremists are so blinded by their confidence in the system while at the same time hating the very system that had given them the liberty to live in their own utopian communities though that had been increasingly obvious that it isn't the case. Instead of trying to work through the system that they don't have enough understanding in history and politics to even begin to understand reality but only through their misguided misinterpretations of the bible that fits the mindsets of the eisegetical utopian communities that had existed in America, they only seek to destroy what the likes of what Cusanus, Kepler, Leibniz, Franklin, Hamilton, Schiller, Verdi, Lincoln, Gauss, Vernadsky, Edison, Roosevelt, Kennedy, LaRouche had sought to elevate humanity under. Although the LaRouche movement ignores the Jewish question or substitutes it with British Israelism/Zionism and promoting Philo over Jesus Christ, they have some understanding concerning the genuine solutions that humanity needs to implement that historically worked time after time, every time when it was implemented.\n\nBefore I start, please watch these videos:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btJtIImmGfw\" target=\"_blank\">Sherry Peel Jackson - Breaking The Invisible Shackles Of The IRS</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWqf96GqMiI\" target=\"_blank\">Theft by Deception: Deciphering the Federal Income Tax</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TCBanwM8X4\" target=\"_blank\">Why Does the IRS Keep Telling Everyone that Income Tax is VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE! by Steve Hempfling in 2010</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzWn4pvCi6E\" target=\"_blank\">Innocence Revealed</a>\n\nThe Tax Honesty claim as seen in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzWn4pvCi6E\" target=\"_blank\">Innocence Revealed</a> video is that until the IRS can prove in their own Internal Revenue Code that all the things written in it by the letter of the law shows that one is liable to the taxation imposed, they are not liable to pay what they are not liable for. By the spirit of the law, a judge might point to the 16th Amendment against them, but by the letter of the law, some people wins the case with proper training and attorneys that know all about true nature of the IRS could help them win the case. However, to have laywers that would represent you properly in court that's a part of the Tax Honesty Movement would cost just as much to pay for taxes anyways. It is true that the IRS doesn't have the time to go after everyone that doesn't file a 1040 or their taxes in any form, but they would go after those that did file a 1040 more than those that didn't file a 1040, while they use an algorithm to have a computer select such cases for them to abuse. There was a time when that they sought to attack Christians, but none of these things would matter if Hillary Clinton becomes president. She will enforce a police state, make abortions legal through Executive Orders, remove your guns, just as exposed in the leaks and in public. It is highly probable that she will enforce churches that doesn't allow same sex marriage to pay taxes since her top adviser Karen Finney implied. Do you think that she wouldn't raise taxes on everyone? Do you think that she would push the myth that everyone is liable to pay taxes by the letter of the law? If Hillary becomes president, you should forget about the Tax Honesty Movement without a Black Swan event from Putin in taking out all the evil people in Washington DC and placing Trump in his rightful place because they will make every attempt to steal the election. Vote only on paper ballots and with a pen so that they can't physically erase your votes as it was done during the BREXIT Referendum.\n\nOne of the lesser known forms of the Tax Honesty Movement has nothing to do with taxes but is being applied to the state and federal level, making their own IDs and passports, not paying for any car insurance, stuff like that is allowed through the letter of the law but not the spirit of the law. Steve Hempfling gets into this, and so does many others. If you just kick out and/or imprison all of the bankers, Jews, Freemasons, Shabbos Goys, etc., out of power then join the BRICS which is the New International Economic Order, improve upon the infrastructure to eventually create the World Land Bridge, implement the Glass Stegall Act, the genuine U.S. Credit System, invest in increasing the Energy Flux Density through NASA and Fusion technologies, promote a Classical Renaissance, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and perhaps then we could round up all the Jews and sympathizers and send them to the moon or on an isolated manmade prison island where they can't get out, ever. Remember, Jews are not a flesh and blood race but an identity that they insist that they are a flesh and blood race. Times had changed for the worse, but until we can change things for the better, IDs will continue to stick around in society. Resisting the system is one thing, changing it is another, but resisting the system is not a genuine solution to change it. This doesn't change even under the context of the Tax Honesty Church Movement which outright abuses the lesser known letter of the law tricks.\n\nThe Tax Honesty Movement people are pro Libertarians as well as pro Austrian Economics. Libertarianism and Austrian Economics should have nothing to do with the Tax Honesty movement, yet they like each other because they don't grasp history. From what I've seen, Libertarianism is a gateway political stance into the more obnoxious groups of the many forms of Anarchism/Anarcho-whatever which hypocritically, is in and of itself have leaders which makes them front groups of their authoritarian counterpart forms in insisting that they're not a state or not have any leaders and CEOs yet becomes exactly that in which they abuse their titular titles every. single. time. Libertarian Ecomonics doesn't exist, they merely adopt Austrian Ecomonics and calls it its own. They deliberately compartmentalize Economics from Politics yet insist that in promoting limited government that they also limit evil corporations which can't be done by definition under Austrian Economics. Yes, this means that the Ancap stance is the Libertarian stance and it leads to the authoritative form of Capitalism anyways, which when left to be abused since Libertarians don't want to bother Corporations, they will privatize public banks and public resources away from the people through the power of money, and buy up the politicians and everyone that they manage to corrupt. This is no different to Marxist Communism in insisting that it isn't a state yet functioning exactly like a state. This realization is not an extreme misinterpretation of their claims at all. These Libertarians are also among the Christian side of the Tax Honesty Movement of which they make no Authoritative claims as to stuff like Abortion which is reduced to \"Pro-Choose-Life\" instead of \"Pro-Life\", as if people even have a choice to choose Abortion to be allowed under them. Such heresies are promoted by these people. They reject most, if not, everything here: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/statements-of-the-faith/\" target=\"_blank\">Statements of The Faith</a> so they are not Christians to me, neither to God. I don't call these people my brethren as I depart from their iniquities and call others to come out of their brainwashing. They hide where they get their information from while they occult it as means to create a cult that adheres to their eisegetical heresies.\n\nThere's of course, the aspect of Ron Paul being thrown into the Tax Honesty Movement. He's a Freemason whether he admits it or not for his family is full of Freemasons and has ties to Nazis and Templars. He's pro Israel and anti Palestine, he promotes Ayn Rand's selfish \"Objectivism\", he casually ignores how the Federal Reserve is privately owned while insisting on Wall Street to do as thou wilt which is the core of the Austrian Ecomonics. It should be a huge warning for people to see him promoting Jill Stein concerning Foreign Policy (although he's promoting Gary Johnson for president) for it means that she's also pro Israel and anti Palestine. The Green Party is a front of Prince Philip's Greenies/Environmentalism that pushes draconian laws over people to push a Post Industrial state that stops the Energy Flux Density. Agenda 21 and Memorandum 200 stuff would happen under Jill Stein while she also promotes raising minimum wages so they're all closet Democrats seeking to ever inflate the bubble that isn't allowed to pop through ever increasing debt limits. Anyways, Ron Paul and friends are shills that divert the solutions away from the truth seekers while they cover up their own inconsistencies and flaws. Don't vote for a \"third party\" candidate, you know that deep down, it's a vote wasted. Because these things never work, some people had realize the importance of seeking Authoritative leaders that would be like the Philosopher King as described in Plato's Republic. We seek a Benevolent Dictator at the very least, which the awakening of the Alt-Right (which isn't the Far-Right) comes from former Libertarians and people who are sick of the modern Liberals and Neo-Conservatives. Genuine Philosopher Kings I'd argue, are people like Gaddafi, but the media demonized so much about him that you've probably never grasp what he truly promoted and also achieved. The EU isn't run by Philosopher Kings, neither is it a Democracy, but an \"Aristocracy\" in a sense of heeding to Aristotle's philosophy over Plato's, which isn't the same as the Aristokratia described in Plato's Republic that has Philosopher Kings, which what normal people call \"Aristocracy\" is mistakenly attributed to Synarchy/Plutarchy of the Rich and the Oligarchs controling Democracy to eventually form full blown Tyranny, but those types of people again, likes to use Aristotle's philosophy to justify their means of control.\n\nAlthough the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzWn4pvCi6E\" target=\"_blank\">Innocence Revealed</a> video distances itself from the \"Tin Foil Hat Brigade\" of those that use the Name in Caps argument, the Uniform Commercial Code argument, the Redemption Process argument, the 1099 O.I.D Return argument, the Act of 1871 argument, the Admiralty or Maritime Law argument, I'll add to it the State of Emergency argument as well as the Birth Certificate argument and everything else these people would come up with that has no real basis in the courtroom and would send them to jail as proof that the judge has the jurisdiction over them. All these types of arguments from these \"gurus\" in turn promotes the same Libertarian garbage propaganda along with it.\n\nSomething to think about:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.schillerinstitute.org/conf-iclc/1990s/conf_feb94_intr_nbs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Schiller Institute/ICLC Conference \"The Palmerston Zoo\"</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SArNakgDqAk\" target=\"_blank\">The Fraud Of 1st & 2nd Law of Thermodynamics</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYiX_ekB6Ec\" target=\"_blank\">LPACTV: The New Dark Age</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zMgsR23RFk\" target=\"_blank\">Plato Versus Aristotle - Economy and Philosophy</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzyq4BXTkhQ\" target=\"_blank\">Oligarchy: The Cancer in Human History</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BImExxKpBYM\" target=\"_blank\">HOW THE BRITISH EMPIRE BRAINWASHED THE WORLD</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSk3OIrhDfA\" target=\"_blank\">The Harvard Yard: Fraud of Modern Education</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-BqZNJ9rnU\" target=\"_blank\">The Takedown of Glass-Steagall</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnirPO3YJaQ\" target=\"_blank\">Who We Were - America Before the British Coup</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKRG_k4oOes\" target=\"_blank\">The Fusion Torch</a>\n<a href=\"https://larouchepac.com/glass-steagall\" target=\"_blank\">Restore Glass Steagall</a>\n<a href=\"https://larouchepac.com/credit-system\" target=\"_blank\">American Credit System</a>\n<a href=\"https://larouchepac.com/energy-flux-density\" target=\"_blank\">Energy Flux Density</a>\n<a href=\"https://larouchepac.com/fusion-economy\" target=\"_blank\">The Lunar Helium-3 Fusion Driver</a>\n\nüí´<strong>Just a reminder 8 Oct 25, 2016 @ 08:08</strong>\n\nI'm on Diaspora*.

Due to security reasons and among other things, I've decided to abandon the use of the favicon. I might one day create a blog on Zeronet but until I share the link on my website here, I don't have one. Don't give them enough time to change your votes, vote on the last day if you're going to vote. The system was broken for a very, very long time, so to assume any form of responsibility for the actions of corrupt leaders because you've voted is an illogical conclusion which no thinking man would ever accept such asinine guilt tripping, while your great-grandparents and their parents had made too many mistakes beyond the point of no return which cascaded and amplified into the current generation being the last domino piece to fall. Although Trump is the lesser of four evils (yes, he's better than Johnson and Stein you stupid Liberals and Communists!), he's not a substitution of Jesus Christ. God's remnant believers will gladly die for their faith in Jesus Christ over humanity itself when it comes down to it. Go ahead and prep, but don't worship prepping over your assurance of your salvation in Jesus Christ or else you will risk your own salvation by adopting Molinism, Arminianism, Lordship Salvationism, Word of Faithism, and whatever compromising gnostic twisting of the scriptures that deceives you into rejecting God. If you really are saved by faith and by grace through Christ alone, if you are currently deceived and are a part of the Elect (which externally by looking at other people, we can't really tell because we're not God), you won't be the afformentioned types of gnostics.\n\nüí´<strong>The reason why only the few grasps Monergism Nov 17, 2016 @ 09:35</strong>\n\nThe central point of the reason why only the few grasps Monergism is that it is God whom chooses who would understand the Gospel message from heaven down to earth, not from earth up to heaven. The true Gospel message hardens that hearts of many people which then leads them away into Synergism. The reason why Christians pray for the salvation of others including corrupted people is because it is only God whom hardens or softens the hearts of others, it is God who has the power to save, not people. People can gain the trust of others through works, but you can't merit salvation through your works to God. Many, many people in history had tried to explain some things concerning Monergism but they had failed to because they are not God which ironically leads people to seek God more yet had left many vulnerable to heresies of compromise to Synergism.\n\nBelieve it or not, Aurelius Augustinus only defended the false doctrines concerning Mary because of his mother told him to defend. Believe it or not, John Calvin is one of the most brilliant man that understood the gospels more than those before and after him that people twisted his words to make him look more of a crook by dishonest historians. Believe it or not, R.C. Sproul had promoted Presuppositional Apologetics and the Orthodox Partial Preterism eschatology (as did debatably John Calvin and many Early Church fathers) yet ended up pushing the heretical Lordship Salvation Synergistic compromise doctrine. Believe it or not, Cornelius Van Til despite being a master of Presuppositional Apologetics, he had pushed the Unitarian doctrine and justifies it through the heretical Irreconcilable Paradox doctrine and rejects the perspicuity of the scriptures that Martin Luther held and condemned Erasmus as a blasphemer for rejecting. Martin Luther was generally a Monergist but held onto some doctrines which John Calvin rejects but even John Calvin allowed Infant Baptism which has no purpose whatsoever for it wasn't a Believer's Baptism, they both clearly held onto some Roman Catholic Church rituals. Anabaptists focused too much on the act of baptism over the metanoia conversion of the faith in repentance, not penance. Although the Anabaptists are right that the Roman Catholic Baptism is illegitimate, Water Baptism isn't necessary to be saved at all. Anglicanism held onto Synergism and some vain Roman Catholic traditions which had influenced the corrupt King Henry VIII's Great Bible, Queen Elizabeth I's Bishop's Bible, and the King James VI/I's Authorized Version. The KJAV is a compromise between the Calvinists' Geneva Bible and Queen Elizabeth I's Bishop's Bible which was not the bible that the Puritans that had left for the New World on the Mayflower had used despite naming their town Jamestown, the Puritans didn't like King James VI/I and Anglicanism which the King James Bible had removed all of the footnotes in the Geneva Bible and tried to incorporate both Anglicanism and Calvinism within the translation itself in \"Anglicanization\" of the text into English. Though both the Geneva Bible and the Bishop's Bible has its flaws, the KJV also has its flaws in justifying the Kabbalistic, Gnostic, Roman Catholic Divine Right of Kings doctrine pushing British Israelism and falsified historical evidence in identifying the Royal Family to the long gone Israelites, the Tribe of Dan, the line of King David, even being related to Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, the Sangreal myth since it's really Jesus of Gamala, wrong \"Jesus\", marrying Mary Magdalene, but the claims of the royals having any lineage to them is also in myth, in tradition only.\n\nMuch later, the Westminster Theological Seminary was compromised by incompetent people that haven't sought to teach people about what John Calvin actually taught besides TULIP which is in and of itself a summation the Old and New Testament which isn't the Gospel message since the T in TULIP concerns the Law that condemns people, therefore, Total Depravity. It is from that seminary that brought forth Cornelius Van Til but again, pushed heresies that weren't corrected. Academia in general had tricked Calvinists into not defending themselves against the spirit of the age, anything that affects us in our culture. Why? They had forsaken Monergism and so they had forsaken to address the evil that they had brought onto themselves in letting it go, completely defeated with stuff like Roe vs Wade. You can't speak against evil without knowing the true Gospel. In modern days most Calvinists are really compromised forms of Presbyterianism which is technically Calvinism (since John Knox was John Calvin's student) but with a slight emphasis in believing not only with the mind but also with the heart, believing with everything that isn't more or less than who you are in believing in Jesus Christ which in some forms can be mistaken as Hyper Calvinism which mind you, is ultimately Synergistic for they still seek after signs of good works to gain trust among others that they are the Elect when really, only God knows if one had truly repented. You can't prove to others through works that God had saved you, you can only trick people into thinking that's the requirement of being saved, through works. Sanctification is only done through Monergism from top down, not through Synergism from bottom up. The difference between Lordship Salvation and Hyper Calvinism is that one believes that they gain salvation through works while the other doesn't, yet Hyper Calvinism despite not claiming that their works merit to salvation, they say that it is God working in them that merits salvation in externalized works, again, having the judge be the Christian peers over and superior to God's divine and perfect judgement in claiming who's saved and who's not saved in looking at works. The specific claims varies but it's a rejection of Monergism and makes salvation somewhat subjective to how others see you as, not how God sees you as which no one knows who is saved through their works. Those who understands Monergism can tell if someone rejects Monergism and thus, rejects the Gospel message, Limited Atonement yet the Synergist, the Arminianist, and the Lordship Salvation proponents hypocritically claims that not everybody does get saved ontologically speaking, not epistemologically speaking because they take the bible out of context through eisegesis in believing that God wills for everyone to be saved. You can't love God without being loved by God first which if God wills everyone to be saved yet not everyone would be saved, God therefore actually only wills a few to be saved since His will shall be done so He doesn't really will everyone to be save as God wills only a few to receive the Gospel message, wills only those whom He wills to be saved which is outside of the control of mankind. One either believes in Limited Atonement or a limited god. This is why Arminianists are Semi-Peleganists in seeking to limiting God's attributes despite deceptive claims stating otherwise by Arminianists, but that's a diversion away from teaching them the differences between Monergism and Synergism which Lutherans should actually be against Arminianists yet Martin Luther wasn't alive to speak specifically concerning Arminianists.\n\nCalvinism, or more specifically Monergism which Jesus, Paul, Augustine, Luther (to a degree) and Calvin understood doesn't claim that you can deterministically tell if one is saved through their works, not even through their doctrines for they could just be saying the right doctrines as well as the right works done in righteousness not that they should boast that they're by any means saved because of said works. You can however, tell if one is NOT saved through their doctrines in which they say the wrong things as if it were the Gospel yet being contrary to the Monergistic nature of the Gospel. You can also tell if one is NOT saved if they don't accept the Monergistic nature of the Gospel explained properly in ways that they can understand. You can't argue against faith derived from biblical exegetical study through unbiblical eisegetical explanations. You can however make an attempt to attack the methodoloxy as well as the presupposition directly yet fail miserably in the case agaisnt Monergism. Just because Monergism is explained through incompetent people doesn't mean that there isn't competent people that can't explain Monergism sufficiently enough. Even if it is explained properly with words they understand in the same language and dialect but with a reliable bible translation, if people reject the Gospel, it's because God had rejected them first in not choosing them. However, if God does intend to save said person, it's simply not their time to be saved at that moment which we can only hope and pray in faith that God would open their eyes even though we don't know if they are the Elect. The day we absolutely know with 100% assurance who are the elect is after Heaven comes down to the purified Earth.\n\nThis really means that there's only a handful of Calvinists and Presbyterians that not only understands Monergism and Presuppositional Apologetics through their churches and seminaries, but also rejects its inconsistencies and paradoxial claims concerning their theology. If they really cared, these Calvinists and Presbyterians won't be using any bible translation besides the Geneva Bible or the inferior KJV while seeking to genuinely \"reform\" Academia to be more consistent than the Geneva Bible and the KJV without letting corrupt people from translating them into yet another junk inferior version. Dr. James White had failed to understand that all \"new\" translations like the ESV, NASB, NKJV, NIV, are worse than the KJV, worse than the Geneva Bible which he had defended. He also has a weak form of Lordship Salvation in justifying Irreconcilable Paradoxes concerning what the book of James says. Matt Slick has an article in clarifying what James meant within the context of Paul and Jesus, see: <a href=\"https://carm.org/are-we-justified-faith-romans-or-works-james\" target=\"_blank\">Are We Justified by Faith (Romans) or by Works (James)? | CARM Christian Apologetics & Research Ministry</a>, however, he still uses inferior versions. Steven Anderson believes that Jesus suffered in Gehenna/Hell for three days and three nights before resurrecting which James White is correct in getting upset about since nowhere in the bible does it says that Jesus suffered in Hell even though it's suspected that it should be Sheol/land of the dead since Gehenna or the lake/pool of fire isn't Sheol/land of the dead/\"Hell\" which Sheol gets thrown into Gehenna or the lake/pool of fire. Roger Jimenez pushes Lordship Salvation while Steven Anderson pushes \"Easy Believism\" which is doing it in the mind but not with the heart although salvation is simple, it's impossible if you're a Synergist. I don't think Reformed Baptists really even exist, they're either Monergists or not, and if they are Monergists, they won't believe that the act of Water Baptism is necessary for salvation. Calvinists also do Believer's Baptisms though some Reformed Bapists are against Infant Baptism, so are many other Calvinists and there's Calvinist churches that don't do Infant Baptism either. These Southern Baptists have more ties to Arminianism and Anglicanism than the Reformed faith in being KJV only instead of being KJV preferred as a transation or TR preferred as a source text. Many of them also Freemasons, wearing the black suit white shirt black tie, some of them bringing a Freemasonic phallic cane with two balls representing Tubal Cain in church.\n\nIt is through Monergism that Presuppositional Apologetics should seek to protect, but some of those that had taught Presuppositional Apologetics believes in many false doctrines. It is through Monergism that there can be any self correcting, perfecting Systematic Theology that is only improves in time instead of being more corrupted in time in Synergistic heresies. It is through Monergism that there could even be a good bible translation that exceeds its predecessors, but through the guise of Scholarism pretending to know what they are doing, we let them destroy key doctrines of the bible through translations should one seek to derive to exegetical conclusions through the bible would instead reject God and the Gospel in deliberately creating contradictions which there's many examples to choose from these <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFtI_mVOXbQ\" target=\"_blank\">New World Order Bible Versions</a>. There's much more that is lost if one has not the Gospel like being able to defend against other religions, cults, forms of governments, \"science\". No Christian can know everything at once, many Christians spend many years and decades reading and studying the bible yet they fell for Synergism and condemned themselves by their own will against God's will concerning salvation. That being said, the novice Christian needs to also spend many years and decades reading and studying the bible before doing what God had called them to do which if you were a woman for example, you won't seek to become a minister although you could still preach the Gospel. You need to be able to rightly defend the faith, but every novice falls for some corrupt lies of the devil now and then from their lack of knowledge and wisdom from God, not from their lack of faith in God assuming they believe in the Monergistic nature of the Gospel. Yes, those that believe in Synergism have no truth in them, have not the Spirit of Truth that is the Holy Spirit, have not received the Way, the Truth, and the Life through Jesus Christ, have not seen God the Father. There can't be other ways as the \"Orthodox Church\" speaks of, there can't be paradoxial ways as the Roman Catholic Church believes in, there is only one way to God through Jesus Christ in accepting the Holy Spirit when God softens your heart to the Gospel in which you can't soften your own heart to accept what God gives only to those whom He loves first.\n\nEverything else, this sums it up: <a href=\"https://blog.exousiakaidunamis.pw/statements-of-the-faith/\" target=\"_blank\">Statements of The Faith</a>\n\nüí´<strong>The Three Methods Nov 18, 2016 @ 00:00</strong>\n\nThere are only three methods. There's the Inductive method, the Deductive method, and the Apophatic method. Abductive and Retroductive are only descriptions that are taken too literally by people that looked into Charles S. Peirce, and he hasn't fully described them on that book he died before finishing. The current expert in Apophaticism is Ken L. Wheeler, he had only rediscovered what was lost in ancient Monistic literature from Greece, India, and Egypt.\n\nThe Inductive method is like individually picking up strands of hay from a haystack until you find the needle.\n\nThe Deductive method is like tracing back to see where you've last dropped the needle in the haystack and look around that general area that by your deductive logic has to be there.\n\nThe Apophatic method is like remembering that the needle is metallic, that the haystack is flammable, so you simply get rid of the haystack by burning it all up, leaving only the needle.\n\nIn all three, everyone knows that the needle should be in the haystack, but the logic is different.\n\nIf you follow the Inductive method's logic, if you keep on having null results over and over again until you hope on finding by sheer chance, by mistake, you essentially expect doing the same thing for essentially ad infinitum to expect a different result by mistake. If you give up, you would have to illogically conclude that the needle is gone when you know that it's there.\n\nIf you follow the Deductive method's logic, if you keep on having null results over and over again, you would then result to the Inductive method's logic because by your deductive logic, your estimation was incorrect as to where and for how long it would take to find the needle, while if you do eventually find it, in dealing with a smaller chunk of hay from the haystack, you've spent less time and so, more efficient than the Inductive method.\n\nIf you follow the Apophatic method's logic, the point was to get the needle, you do not need the haystack, by negation, you remove the haystack by fire since you already know that the haystack is flammable and the needle isn't because it's made of metal, rest assured, you simply set it ablaze and look for the metal needle within the ashes. You weren't told NOT to burn up the haystack, you weren't told NOT to use a match and gasoline to speed up the burning process, you weren't told NOT to use alternative means that isn't looking for the needle besides picking through the straw one by one by hand. The haystack is NOT the needle, the needle is NOT flammable.\n\nLet's replace the needle as A = 1 and the haystack as B where AB = x.\n\nIn the Inductive method: AB + (-AB + 1) = A where B = n.\n\nIn the Deductive method: If A + B = AB therefore AB + (-AB + 1) = A where B is less than ‚àû.\n\nIn the Apophatic method: If A ‚â† B and B ‚â† A therefore AB - B = A.\n\nThe Inductive method requires an unknown amount of tries to find A out of AB.\n\nThe Deductive method requires a determinate amount of tries to find A out of AB.\n\nThe Apophatic method finds A out of AB in one try via negativa.\n\nThe Inductive method was made by Sir Francis Bacon modeled after Paolo Sarpi's synthesis in allowing inventions but not allowing people to come to knowing how to derive to absolutes concerning creation, except for the \"experts\" in Academia. The truth can't be known by them.\n\nThe Deductive method was made by Aristotle the flunkee of Plato. Though some of his statements are not wrong in and of themselves like claiming that there is no soul in the body, his conclusions are just as illogical as the Inductive method, he rejects the metaphysical nature of the soul just because it doesn't exist within the body itself. Aristotle is a materialist, rejects the concept of morals, and believes in Greek Atomism after Leucippus and Democritus. The Inductive method is a watered down form of the Deductive method. The Deductive method could at times come to the truth yet how they trust in truth is practically the same as the Inductive method: through various test after test, not to say that testing a hypothesis isn't necessary, it's only useful to confirm but not to affirm.\n\nThe Apophatic method existed in all ancient Monistic cultures which the ones we know that held the same Monistic metaphysics were in ancient Egypt, India, and Greece. They all believed the Light and Illumination cannot be negated from each other, and had applied the same principles to their metaphysics. Nothing/counterspace begat nothing/space, the soul came from nothing, the body is a mere receiver of the signal of the soul, the signal is not in the body, the body is not the soul. The \"source\" of light and the illumination that light gives off is also light, you can't separate them from each other. You don't actually see light nor darkness, light is invisible until light bounces off of something and slows down to the frequency of visible light. Light is an aether perturbation, it is not physical but metaphysical. Calling the ripples on the surface of a still pond formed from a pebble to be real in and of itself separate from the water is a fallacy in reifying a privation.\n\nApophatic science is necessary for people to stop people abusing the Inductive and Deductive method through Mathematica or advanced bean counting to replace Arithmos AKA: \"Arithmatics\", harmonics, harmonic golden section/ratios in nature, divine proportions, Monistic metaphysical mechanics of supersymmetry sacred geometry taught by Pythagoras and Plato.\n\nüí´<strong>Name of Satan Dec 3, 2016 @ 19:15</strong>\n\nThe claims concerning the definition and identity of Lucifer is completely and utterly dependent on context of how it's used in a sentence. The bible jumps back and forth from literal to metaphorical. The bible also makes its own definitions. Let's take a look at the following: <a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2pe/1/19/t_concf_1157019\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2pe/1/19/t_concf_1157019</a> 2Peter 1:19 talks about a day star which astronomically tends to be the planet Venus although it doesn't necessarily have to be Venus since other planets in the solar system also shows up in the morning time (see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYnbEFh6KBQ\" target=\"_blank\">An Explanation of Morning and Evening Stars</a>) but nevertheless, the context is metaphorical. 2Peter 1:19-21 says: 19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: 20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. 21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\n\nFirst of all, the false assumption made here by Gnostics is that the Judahites were allowed by God to worshiped the stars as deities. The stars in the sky are there to show a passing of time. These people didn't have TV and watched the skies carefully, and although Venus is commonly associated with the day/morning star, it isn't always the case, while the point of the day star analogy is that it's bright and shows up at dawn. Light give illumination, it's really ultimately a metaphor for truth. If one has the Holy Spirit, they have the light that illuminates the darkness which in the metaphor represents prophecies made up by the will of man, AKA: false prophets, so it's also about God keeping promises as well as revealing them to His people. Jesus Christ is the fulfilment of all the prophecies promised by God, some of which spoken through the prophets. Jesus Christ isn't Lucifer the fallen one. Jesus himself said in Luke 10:18 \"I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.\" <a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/10/18/t_concf_983018\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/10/18/t_concf_983018</a> which refers to Isaiah 14:12 \"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!\" <a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/isa/14/12/t_conc_693012\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/isa/14/12/t_conc_693012</a> and you can't say that Jesus was refering to King Tyre in Luke 10:18. Lucifer Son of the Morning is not the same as identifying Jesus Christ as the fulfilment of prophecy and the truth that illuminates and exposes the lies of false prophets. ◊ë÷º÷∂◊ü÷æ◊©◊Å÷∏◊ó÷∑◊® is ben-shachar, it means SON (of the) MORNING. The KJV translated it word for word. Shachar in the Old Testament isn't used alongside any other word that resembles anything close to star. Ben-shachar is only used once. Jesus is not Lucifer/Heylel Son of the Morning, Jesus Christ can't call himself Satan, neither is he refering to himself in Luke 10:18. Satan is identified as the serpent and the devil in Revelation 12:9 \"And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\". Satan/\"Lucifer\"/Serpent/Devil/Dragon are all one and the same. All modern translations omit Ben-shachar and simply state Lucifer and the definition of Heylel which is morning star, however, since it should be Heylel Ben-shachar, Heylel here is a name, not a definition, sort of like how people are named Christian but aren't necessarily Christians because of their name. Therefore, Heylel is not what that name means, rather, just a name. Heylel Ben-shachar is a name, not its description. Heylel as a description is not Heylel as Heylel Ben-shachar which in Hebrew, Heylel is used only once in the bible AS A NAME, NOT AS A DESCRIPTION. Don't rely on the Latin Vulgate and anything based on the Septuagint, use the Textus Receptus. All bible books in Latin are translations from the Greek, most often, proven mistranslations. Just because the root word of Heylel is Halal which means to shine, to praise (which is what Cherubims did), to boast, doesn't mean that Heylel means Morning Star.\n\nSatan is syncretized with other entities as a general \"Adversary\" to God, so all pagan, gnostic, even heathen deities are candidates for \"Satan\". However, this really depends on the context of how the general term of Satan is used, for Jesus called Peter \"Satan\" but it is understood by the Calvinist scholars as noted in the Geneva bible that \"Satan\" here meant adversary, not a literal translation of the being of Peter to be 100% Satan incarnate. Baalzebub, Moloch, Baal, Ashtaroth, Leviathan, Abaddon etc., are \"Satan\", but some of these are not Satan the being. Abaddon for example, although is a personification of Destruction in Strong's H11 ◊ê÷≤◊ë÷∑◊ì÷º◊ï÷π◊ü , is also Strong's G3 ·ºàŒ≤Œ±Œ¥Œ¥·ΩΩŒΩ. Abaddon is the place of destruction within Sheol/land of the dead which is separate from Paradise which is also in Sheol but not in Abaddon. Abaddon is also the name of the angel-prince of the infernal regions, the minister of death and the author of havoc on the earth. It might be hard to visualize that for some, but Abaddon the spirit is the \"Hell\" part of Sheol that also reigns over Abaddon in \"Hell\" and on the Earth wherever Destruction is. You need to realize that they are spirits, not physical entities, but supernatural beings having jurisdiction over some forms of evil which collectively is under the leadership of Satan the spirit and being, Satan the being controls Satan the spirit, the Adversary to God. Abaddon being \"Hell\" gets cast into the Lake of Fire, Gehenna in the book of Revelation while Satan the being gets cast into the Abyss, therefore, Satan the being is not Abaddon the being, Abaddon the spirit is not Satan the spirit but Satan the spirit is Abaddon the spirit, Satan the being and spirit has de facto authority over Abaddon the being and spirit until God revokes Abaddon away from Satan as he throws Abaddon into the Lake of Fire.\n\nAzazel is Scapegoat in Babylonian Aramaic Hebrew. ◊¢÷≤◊ñ÷∏◊ê◊ñ÷µ◊ú is not Satan. Seventh Day Adventists and Gnostics believe that Satan died for our sins because he's in the Abyss as a sacrificial goat so that Jesus Christ as a scapegoat can get out of Hell and reign from Heaven the Kingdom of God on Earth as the Ekklesia which is not \"Church\", not a physical House of the Lord that should be our spiritual hearts, but \"Assembly\", \"Congregation\". Actually, they also believe that Judas was the sacrificial goat, that Judas died for our sins, not Jesus Christ that becomes the true Scapegoat that escapes death which is eisegetical heresy. Judas' suicide didn't resurrect Jesus Christ, he was a sinner. That's one occult reason why Messianic churches also push the Menorah/Tree symbolism over the Cross because Judas hung himself on an actual tree. I believe the crucifix has some Gnostic interpretations to it for they reject Jesus Christ's resurrection, they want him to die perpetually in Hell ever shedding his blood, while they seek Mary for salvation, Mary as Sophia, Semiramis, Queen of Heaven, the Harlot, the Jezebel spirit, Venus, feminine principle, the chalice filled with the blood of martyrs, etc. The real Scapegoat is the Elect, the Saved, the adopted \"Son of the Father\" through the sacrifice of THE Son of the Father. Barabbas mean son of the father, he was a prisoner for being a robber. He was set free while Jesus Christ paid the full price for his sins and for all the sins of the Elect yet Jesus knew no sin although he resisted temptation and understands my struggles, your struggles. Not everyone gets saved, God predetermines a few of those who will get saved even though he wishes everyone to be saved, doesn't mean everybody can get saved even if they are externally Christians and repented, man can't guarantee their own salvation, it is God who knows who he saved and who he didn't choose, while it is a sign that those that accepts the true gospel message are probably the elect, again, external signs are not trustworthy. Believe with all your heart and all your mind, with everything not external to yourself, not a part of yourself, but with everything in your being.\n\nThe names of demons (all demons are fallen angels) doesn't have to be in Hebrew or Greek, it is anything that is not life, anything that grows bad fruit in one's life. The spirit of video games for one is demonic if the context of video games promotes sin. Do I think there's a specific demon ruling over a specific game? No. Are all these demons only exist in the mind as concepts, ideas, lies? Demons are not limited to them since they tempt the flesh to accept their concepts, ideas, lies, etc., but does that mean a demon always have to be behind every concept, idea, and lie? No, the flesh is what accepts the lies of demons, and if they accept the demonic lies, it gives the demons de facto jurisdiction over the flesh. People have some varying levels of resistance to the flesh, but Christians cannot receive demons, it's impossible. However, that doesn't mean that Christians can't believe in false doctrines. If they really are saved, God will show them the truth about the lies and have them repent for their sins. Christians are affected by other people's corrupted flesh that rejects the Holy Spirit physically or through the laws of the land if they don't respect God's divine laws written in the Christians' hearts by the Holy Spirit that is the Spirit of Truth that comforts us in the truth, not through works. Christians can believe in some minor lies that has nothing to do with the gospel message and still go to Heaven which I think that is the case for most Christians since there's lots of liars out there. Depending on the eschatological beliefs you have, there could be demons, there could also not be demons, there could be Satan the being in the world, there could be Satan the being locked up in the Abyss. Nevertheless, what I've said here is still true.\n\nSons of God or Bene ha Elohim is not the fallen angels, it is the Sethite bloodline by the men. Daughters of men is the Cainite (not Canaanite/Phoenician, not Kenite) bloodline of their women. God never approved of his people mixing with unbelievers (heathens) and pagans and every time that happens, they get punished for it, nothing good ever comes from it. Nephilim is not demons, it's properly translated as giants, it is not fallen ones. Nephilim is not another name of Satan, there never was a first incursion. Giants were associated as heathens and pagans of other people that are against God, and Goliath was about 9 feet 9 inches based off of the measurements the Textus Receptus gives out in cubits converted into United States customary units, barely under 3 meters at 2.97 meters. The spies that Moses sent out to survey Jericho in fear called the people there giants and calling themselves grasshoppers in comparison which Joshea and Caleb disagreed and didn't cower. Gigantism is usually caused by a tumor on the pituitary gland of the brain. In some cases the condition can be passed on genetically through a mutated gene. Yes, mutated gene, not a normal gene. Just because there's occasionally giant people being born into the world doesn't mean that they're demon hybrids or some other nonsense. There is no second incursion either. There had been no mating of spiritual beings with our women. Jesus is not an offspring of any angel. Jesus was born of a virgin, nobody knocked up Mary physically. Joseph didn't know her. God miraculously got her pregnant and nobody knows the details, nobody knows if God had injected \"God sperm\" into Mary's egg or any other specifics and to make speculations then declare them as doctrine is heresy. After Jesus was born, then Joseph did the monster mash with the intact virgin Mary and had children so Mary is not a perpetual virgin, Jesus had half siblings on his mother's side, he had no siblings from both his mother and Father. Jesus is the Morning Star, Jesus is not the Son of the Morning, Jesus is not Heylel Ben Shachar, Jesus is not Venus, Jesus is not a demigod, Jesus is not impregnated by an angel, Jesus is not Michael the Archangel, Jesus is not the son of the Son of the Morning, Jesus is not the son of Heylel Ben Shachar, Jesus is not the son of Venus. Gnostics and pagans uses literal interpretations when it suits their lies and mocks Christians that uses literal interpretations when it is the context determines if it should be literal or allegorical.\n\nJust because other religions syncretize their characters with the Christian ones doesn't mean that Christians need to take their interpretation. There is biblical proof that Christians can syncretize all the false idols to Satan because they're all adversaries to Christianity, but that is not the same as how other religions syncretize because they do it outside of the context of Christianity, neither is that admission to claiming that the gods of other religions are by any means gods, rather, idols made up by vain imagination of man through the carnal desires of the flesh in sin in rebellion against God. Just because some idols are syncretized to demonic spirits doesn't mean that they're in equal footing to the Trinity. The Royal We in the first chapter of Genesis is the Trinity, Jesus Christ himself declared himself to be the I AM, Ehjeh Asher Ehjeh, pre existing existence itself. Angels were made by God, even Satan is subject to obey God's will. There is no dualism in Christianity, there is no feminine spirit equivalent of God. Shekinah is from the Talmud, God addresses himself in masculine gender, the Holy Spirit isn't feminine, Jesus isn't a woman, the Trinity isn't feminine. God the Father is not \"God the Mother\", he's ultimately above our mortal concept of gender but Jesus although pre existed, didn't ever present himself as a woman to the prophets and was born a man, male. The Ekklesia although known as a women is not a physical entity but is the invisible Body of Christ is not the Shekinah Glory, is not the Holy Spirit, is not the Harlot/Queen of Heaven/Jezebel spirit. I won't bother with syncretized names for Satan outside of the bible here, honest people with discernment won't take things out of context.\n\nBiblical demonology is very simple, it isn't as convoluted as some make it to be, while trying to rationalize it outside of the bible is for the pagans. Christians have nothing to fear, Christians can learn what symbols are theirs and what are not theirs but those that seek to use \"magic\" are not Christians and/or need to repent for practicing witchcraft, divination, sorcery, etc. Only learn their lies to abstain from evil, do not believe in their lies. Just because one rejects demonic lies doesn't mean that they are saved. Some Atheists don't practice paganism, that doesn't mean they're saved.\n\nüí´<strong>Huge changes Jan 4, 2017 @ 18:30</strong>\n\nI have made a ZeroNet blog <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1DDF4xkuci7KywT9ei4FWKRsTa5z3n8kx8/\" target=\"_blank\">http://127.0.0.1:43110/1DDF4xkuci7KywT9ei4FWKRsTa5z3n8kx8/</a> which if you don't have ZeroNet installed, you could use a proxy like <a href=\"http://bit.no.com:43110/1DDF4xkuci7KywT9ei4FWKRsTa5z3n8kx8/\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.no.com:43110/1DDF4xkuci7KywT9ei4FWKRsTa5z3n8kx8/</a> as an example. I'm also going to delete some of my old posts and eventually settle with a new non ICANN controlled domain that isn't also controlled by the US at the very least, and at most, not within the Five Eyes network, unless I give up in that endeavour which I'll let you guys know. I'm also going to ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà so yeah, that'll be fun.\n\nüí´<strong>Impossible lifelong goals to strive for Jan 6, 2017 @ 18:15</strong>\n\nEnough of the reasons why we can't have nice things, most of mankind don't know what are nice things to begin with which is why people don't pursuit them. I won't guarantee that you will get all these nice things, but at least you cah promote people to seek them and if you better their lives, it will trickle down to you if there's enough people that recognize your heart and mind in educating them in things that are true and avoiding what isn't. I have achieved some of these goals, but obviously not all of them. The goals that takes less physical work takes more mental work and vice versa, while some of these requires specific skills and mindsets that doesn't come so easily. As you look into these goals more and more, you will realize how it is impossible to get everything off this checklist while alive, and while after death, isn't guaranteed if you don't meet some of the things in the checklist, but a spiritual successor to these goals might come around for you. This is more of an incomplete outline for a small book if I've also put in my other articles into this in their own chapters that elaborates on these things.\n\nEducate yourself about anything and everything possible that interests you for the rest of your life. Try to master it unless if it isn't worth mastering. Being good at a few things that you are willing to invest your time in can give you some freedom to pursue some other goals in whatever profit that comes from it. A jack of all trades is a joker, at least be a king or queen of something, and an ace on at least one thing. You can only do what you can do, but that doesn't mean you should do what you can do in every specific situation when you can do it in. Seeking too much balance brings imbalance, being too imbalanced requires some stability. Opprotunity is relative, yet it can be created sometimes by sheer willpower, but it isn't necessarily necessary to do so quickly, for you would lose your humanity when you abuse you willpower. Be aware of how those that abuse their willpower act against you in learning their tricks before you get tricked. Sometimes their trickery can be redirected back to them at the right timing to others and of course, ethically, in exposure to the truth of how they trick others into thinking one way or another, but some battles can't be won over because many times it's done by surprise. Sometimes you just let them have it, so that they will stop seeking to get more out of you, but of course that is also can be perceived as a sign of weakness hiding behind a bluff. When a path closes, a path opens, even if that open path is death, it just goes to show that it was meant to be (not justifying suicide here) and a risk worth dying for.\n\nSeek likeminded individuals through social media and in the physical world through your journey in life, but beware, if you change, they would see that as something bad and will try to suppress you depending on how much they think that it's worth trying to keep you which is an unfortunate reality when one seeks the truth, which hypocritically, makes you seek to justify your actions more and become more critical of others and less critical of those that you think alike with. You don't change even though your mindsets do, and such changes are to be seen in a positive light, but not all change are justified changes in their own system, and you will realize that there's more inconsistent claims that arises within such mindsets that brings up valid concerns. If you flip flop between two mindsets, your mind is trying hard to make sense of it all and until you settle with one comfortably well justified, you don't fully grasp either of those mindsets and have counquered nothing, but on the other hand, it may not even be that crucial to grasp to begin with, and if you are not thinking sanely but insanely, you will pick the wrong mindset and deceiving yourself in thinking that you know the truth to both of the mindsets when in choosing the wrong mindset, you then know not both of them and are back to where you were before but with the added insane mental handicap of the false mindset that blinds you and deafens you from the visible and audible sane truth and wisdom that gives proper meaning to the knowledge present before you.\n\nSeek unlikeminded individuals to test yourself in things that you lack or in things that you think that you don't lack in, to try and convince them as they try to convince you. Avoid such individuals in the physical world if the risk isn't worth owning up to your actions, some things are embarrasing and anonymity is required to safely \"work out your faith\". To have anonimity online, one needs to take certain actions to achieve this. Physical anonimity is not online anonimity. Security is not privacy, is not anonimity, is not security, is not anonimity, is not privacy is not security. A more practical way to grasp these things is to learn about the four SECs: OPSEC (Operational Security), PERSEC (Personal Security), INFOSEC (Information Security), COMSEC (Communications Security). Operational security is the process of protecting individual pieces of data that could be grouped together to give the bigger picture (called aggregation). Personal security is protecting your personal information. PERSEC focuses on protecting information such as rank, your home address and information about your family. Generally, it is basic common sense that reminds you not to advertise that you are living alone or otherwise giving out personal information to others who you may not know. Communications security is the discipline of preventing unauthorized interceptors from accessing telecommunications in an intelligible form, while still delivering content to the intended recipients. Information security is the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information. It is a general term that can be used regardless of the form the data may take (e.g. electronic, physical). See, hear, speak no evil in public, think about evil, don't be evil, love your enemies by seeing, hearing, speaking about all evil, but do everything while remembering and practicing the four SECs.\n\nUnderstand that there is a legitimate form of appeal to an authentic, verified representative authority within a context in trying to grasp if one thing has any legitimate authority over or not. Understanding a proper representation of any concept requires a genuine expert in the field of knowledge and wisdom that they represent. Even though such experts can be false in their statements in their field of expertise, understanding both the divisions and the consensus of the experts within that field of expertise to their claims, one can use the principle of noncontradiction to see which of the divisions among them are honest or the least contradictory when following their line of logic in comparison to the other divisions, which from there, do the same for another field of expertise, then look at both the similarities and differences of the least contradictory of both sides of the most pure and honest divisions that seek the least contradictions within their logic, and see if which one of the two concerning an overlapping subject are the more qualified to answer certain questions. For example, if you want to have a church that isn't bound to the law of the land but seeks to abide in parts of the law where there isn't any doctrinal problems with, you don't seek an existing church that does just that, you seek after someone who's an expert in laws that isn't necessarily of your faith or even have a faith but is willing to give out such crucial information. If you are looking for an authentic understanding of ecclesiology, you don't see your local government to define what is a church for you, you consult an expert within that church as to what a church should be like, but you also won't look for such an expert that is yoked with the government in blurring and occulting the understanding of ecclesiology and the codes of the government set up concerning churches either. If you are looking for a church that is truly set apart from the law of the land, you got two options: join an existing church that will or will not compromise the truths of the religion, or make your own somehow. If you seek to make your own, you need to consult an expert in laws that is willing to teach you about such matters, as well as an expert in ecclesiology that doesn't blur the lines between the church and the state.\n\nThe dillema for most people is that many times, when there's a church state, they compromise on their doctrines concerning salvation while if they are a state church, they also compromise on some of their doctrines concerning things besides salvation, ironically so. A church in and of itself can speak about a state in and of itself and vice versa, but there needs to be an agreement between the church and state that they both adhere to, or else the state would replace the functions of the church and vice versa. A small church state community ends up practicing a form of feudalism under a shepherd/lord that one reveres instead of being ministered by, pretending to be a philosopher king or at least a benevolent dictator, but in reality, pushing communitarianism which scripturally and historically always fails within a few generations every single time regardless of what religion that is, so there is a degree a futility to try to emulate what could be practiced after death that many hope to do it then. The example I've just given actually has more things overlapping like health, agriculture, economics, politics, history, science, law, religion, education, philosophy, business, sociology, psychology, anthropology, et cetra. There are more such dialogues and overlapping concerning other subject matter but in seeking to understand more overlaps and seeking the proper understanding to them both which can bridge other unrelated things together to expand your point of reference.\n\nSeek to gain some measure of independence and self reliance enough to be able to consistently provide for yourself and prepare for the future through interdependence with likeminded people. This means limiting yourself from being dependent on the services of others by replacing those services somehow first, while at the same time, have a fallback plan to rely on when you can't rely on yourself and even others close to you. Just this goal by itself is a hard one for many people being simply unable to do this because of the circumstances that they are under, and our very nature won't allow us to live alone for too long in most, if not, in every case which every infant depends on milk and not having being killed by a doctor through an abortion. Everyone is dependent on others by default, which independence is earned through labor whether if it's your own or others that you receive a portion off of in being their manager or the owner of an establishment in where you conduct your business in through individuals that seek to do business with you and through your hired servants, not \"slaves\" as in, forced against their will to work through whatever reasons justified or unjustified. At a certain point, one can utilize natural resources, energy, and cycles to clean your water, power your electrical systems, build your house, provide you food, provide food for your fishes and livestock, and so on, which earthships that has an internal permaculture setup that utilizes renewable energy like solar panels, collecting rainwater, repurposed materials as the walls to provide insulation in any weather, growing greens, fruits, and vegetables that is in an aquaponics system whereby all waste is recycled in a closed system, minimizing the need to get food outside and significantely reduce buying things that are bad like non biodegradable plastics, only very few things needs to be maintained like the battery and sometimes the pipes while the rest are a part of living within a permaculture system. Trying to connect to the internet is something harder to do when living such a life, that's a service that is still very much controlled by a few ISPs but if people set up a local mesh network in a community of likeminded people living pretty much the same way as their neighbor is, the less people need to use an ISP but a locally served web server of a locally hosted social network of some sort like maybe a Diaspora* pod can be hosted in every single earthship house.\n\nThe problem with such a lifestyle is that it's a passive reactionary response to another problem coming from cities and government which isn't designed properly to deal with these things, it assumes that cities are evil by default, and that it can't ever change to be functional for more types of people. Permaculture based megacities might become a thing in some places in the world in the distant future, but in actuality, it's not enough to sustain humanity. We absolutely have to rely on higher sources of energy like Thorium for example, which a little bit can run a car for a century when properly done, while we can focus on elevating the Energy Flux Density. An ever increasing population with a great educational system that teaches people about Neoplatonic thinking as well as actually explaining and showing how many great thinkers in the past had came to their conclusions in having the discovery be formed from the minds of the students, experiencing what people before them had experienced which fosters the conditions in raising up philosopher kings and people who seek to invent things that would have people that can not only work, but also inspired to innovate to further increase productivity which such innovations can lead to more discoveries of even denser, more higher forms of energy to tap into as we move on from nuclear fission to nuclear fusion to another paradigm shifting concept that elevates everyone with a better source of power that can be used to revitalize the steel industry and such with the perfecting the use of nuclear fusion to perhaps one day isolate iron elements or make specific alloys from a nuclear fusion based \"alchemical pot\" that breaks down everything to its base elements and can be directed to reform into its isolated or alloy form that doesn't use electrolysis and chemical reactions yet have a higher purity and durability which can be used to improve on itself as well as to build up and replace the rotting existing infrastructure which can be used to distribute water more efficiently from the north to the south as the NAWAPA project, while helping to form the World Land Bridge. All the while, the same nuclear fusion technology being used for the next frontier that is the heavens above which we can mine helium-3 from the moon that can be used to detect nuclear missiles being launched through torsion field detecting systems on satellites to avoid and prevent nuclear missiles from detonating through early detection, while the same helium-3 can help people go farther out into space faster and better.\n\nWith more energy comes more creativity and productivity, which if there's more room to grow, people procreate and keep this cycle of \"enbetterment\" (Nazi-Sozi CIA [Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst + Office of Scientific Intelligence] Skull & Bonesman SMOM knight Catholic Zionist Freemasonic former President George Walker Bush/Scherff made that stupid word) to continue on ad infinitum which is the \"Promethean\" concept that is against the halting of growth which Zeusian systems function under. In the US, specific actions need to be taken place, like reinstating the Glass Steagall act, the Hamiltonian national banking system, Federal Credit to increase physical productivity, all before setting up \"a fusion economy\", a fusion and space science driver that encourages innovation and improving on higher energy sources to the next frontier. The US also needs to get rid of the Federal Reserve, IRS, AMA, CDC, EPA, DARPA, FBI, et cetra, leaving the UN completely, join the BRICS, switch to intrinsic metal backed currency eventually and inevitably down the line to prevent inflation and devaluation of credit. The equivalents are sought to be done for other countries to follow suit. The UN is under the Royal Institute of International Affairs which is under the Committee/Council of 300 that is under the Order of the Garter and the Livery Companies all controlled by an inner circle of the New Venetian Empire that was transplanted into England of which the Jesuits went under the Venetian system, being thoroughly infested with Jews pushing British Zionism which the Venetians being Talmudists fancy themselves in pretending to be the chosen ones like the Pharisees that Jesus Christ had called \"of the Devil\", practicing the traditions of the ancient Cainite-Sumerian-Phoenician-Babylonian-Medo-Persian-Greco-Roman death cults syncretized with pagan deities, some Greek philosophy, codifying the Talmud and the Kabbalah, which such syncretic eisegesis being done with all the other religions under the Enlightenment/Renaissance period, \"The Second Awakening\", Theosophy, the Bahai faith, and other excessively ecumenical cults that compromise their beliefs for false unification for a Zeusian World Order that's Aristotelian in its degenerative mindsets.\n\nThere can and should be ethnocentric nations which the primary purpose of any nation is to protect the DNA of the majority, but in a multicultural pot like the US, white ethnocentric nationalism needs to be implemented to protect them from the genocide of their own people while other races in the US are just as, or even more prideful of their own race, but not as much as International Jewry that has a vast network all over the world that's identity oriented which they are the masters of identity politics of which the current Populism movement is partially hijacked by these people pretending to be for white people when they are just using their hatred against them to promote something that can be backstabbed against them if we sit idly and ignore the problem in not answering the Jewish question which less than two percent of people had taken over the US while they are taking over Palestine with systematic genocide worse than Agenda 21, even worse than what even Aboriginals go through which Australians don't bomb Aboriginals yet the Israeli Zionist Jews do. Some measure of White Identity needs to be implemented to secure themselves from non assimilating Mohammedans with low IQs that will down the IQ of all of Europa significantly and collectively, while the Jews that had taken out Gaddafi and fund the \"refugees\" from wars the Jews made foreign countries fight to dismantle and create a power vacuum for new regimes to take over, to also invade Europe by the millions, will get the Jews to leave their respective places and go to Germany or Israel or wherever they seek to wander on the face of the earth as they wonder in foolishness as to why God doesn't intervene in creating a Third Temple.\n\nThe reality is, their Rabbinical eschatology prevents a Jew from realizing that Jesus Christ fulfills many things on time just as the scriptures show the coming of the Messiah, the Rabbis removed some years off of their calendar to make it appear that God didn't fulfil His promise, for they hid how the promise of another temple being made and the return to Jerusalem was done some time before Jesus Christ was born in the creation of Herod's Temple and the calling of all the Judahites to go back to their land to get taxed by their jurisdiction under the Roman Empire through the Herodian rulers that were Edomites and were not the true King of the Judeans, not being proclaimed a King by a High Priest which that role was done through John the Baptist, a Levite that had the Holy Spirit. It is God that destroyed the Second Temple and it is God that made the Body of Christ a collective living temple of God on earth where whosoever receives God's grace and faith through Christ can receive the Holy Spirit within a new heart of the flesh replacing the heart of stone. Judean and Jew are not equivalents. The Holocaust is a Holohoax, yet countries that have nothing to do with it are forced to learn the false narrative of the secularized religion of the Holohoax that uses guilt against people to silence them about what they can't criticize which Jewish power is the power to silence, which what you can't speak about is what you are controlled by through passive silence. There still needs to be a form of identity politics minus gender and sexual divisions which are done away with through Christianity and recognizing the intelligent design of creation, to preserve dying races that are bred out through miscegenation.\n\nYou can't \"scientifically\" justify anything because there is no higher authority besides people according to science, so logically, they would adopt Aristotelian Atomistic Materialism which rejects the metaphysics of forms, divine proportions/golden ratios, morals, et cetra, mistaking a 30¬∞‚Äì60¬∞‚Äì90¬∞ triangle as a \"Pythagorean Triangle\" about a theorem that was found prior to the existence of Pythagoreans then claim that the Trivium is superior to the Quadrivium when the Trivium is just a bunch of rules that doesn't help inspire and be innovative, completely ignoring how the world works through mathematics not based on reality, mistakenly attribute arithmos to mathematics which arithmos deals with the metageometry of divine proportions/golden ratios, the beauty of the divinely simplex nature of 1 over œï, 1, 1, and œï which adds up to 1 over œï to the -3 which equals to 1, which 1 is to œï and œï is to 1, which it is the space between the 1 and 1 where the dividing line is drawn from one corner of the pentagon across from the point on the dividing line within the pentagram, to the point that intersects between 1 and 1 which makes a fractal 108¬∞‚Äì36¬∞‚Äì36¬∞ isosceles triangle and so on and so forth, that both phenomena and noumena are from one and the same source being both its principle and attribute, so there is no beginning, \"creation\" wasn't created at a beginning for time is an attribute of the principle of centripetal convergent counterspace as a loss of inertia and acceleration centrifugal divergent spatial mass/magnitude as force and motion formed out of the dielectric plane, space and time cannot be reified as its own principle of what is an attribute, while electricity exists 90 degrees from the magnetic force shaped like a hypotrochoid torus which electricity is also made from the loss of inertia, where the lines of force intersect is where electricity is created even on a static, coherent, polarized object, AKA: \"magnet\".\n\nLight is not a quantity, virtual particles are imaginary and are not based on reality, light is a field perturbation on the aether/counterspace which is also a transverse coaxial circuit where the dielectric plane goes at a curved linear path while electric and magnetic fields are 90 degrees from the moving dielectric plane where a \"photon\" is mistakenly understood as the nodes of the convergence of both the electric and magnetic fields drawn on a two dimensional plane while the shorter the \"waves\" are, the higher the energy output in the light, so a coherent violet laser can move a vacuum sealed Crookes radiometer faster than a coherent red laser. All lightbulbs don't emit anything, they're vacuum sealed just like the Crookes radiometer Everything is a field, not a quantity. No amount of quantity of anything can explain instantaneous action at a distance without believing that virtual particles are what behind magnetism which only exists in paper but never observed in reality of this supposed virtual entity. Light in Monistic metaphysics cannot separate light from illumination and cannot claim one is an attribute of an other, they're both principles and attributes to each other. This is how they reasoned that the soul will return from where it came from after death which the physical body was just an attribute of the principle of the soul that doesn't exist in an atomistic sense, but the signal is picked up by the body somehow, like how the radio doesn't have little people inside talking but is receiving radiowave signals, the soul is broadcasted from somewhere but what that is is assumed that souls come back into the world to provide an answer concerning anamnesis, after it first returns to the \"Nous\" so they do believe in some form of reincarnation that could occur, but the soul is not attached to the atom so there is a materialistic recycling of matter into life and death ad infinitum, but that isn't the same as anamnesis if it's actually legitimate although Christians would claim that's just demons pretending to be the deceased within the body of an unregenerate being by inserting thoughts into them in the spirit or they would claim that it's from Satanic Ritual Abuse, and so on and so forth.\n\nWhat in the world am I chatting on about? I am actually demonstrating how Neoplatonism to some measure make people that can be somewhat reasoned with as opposed to what Aristotelian thinking does to people, which the inductive method is another downgrade of logic from the deductive which is inferior to the apophatic method which there is Monistic forms and Christian forms of such thinking which the likes of Philo of Alexandria and Nicolaus of Cusanus tried to make the claim that the mind of God is the Nous and/or the Logos, whichever fits into their faulty presuppositions since Monism believe in no gods and no beginning while Neoplatonic Christians believe that the Pythagoreans and Platonists didn't have special revelation from God to make any explicit claims concerning what can't be known to be speculated about with confidence, which something with no beginning that existed forever can never come to the present, unless you simply believe that it can. In the end, Monism is a religion, a cult formed to elaborate on natural revelation by denying that there needs to be any creator of an inevitable source of everything of which everything came from in claiming that a creator and a creation would be dualistic by default, while a necessary Absolute to counter such claims is made to create a \"justified dualism\" that becomes one and the same with itself, whereby nature needed to exist by itself without a reason, but Christians believe in the Aseity of God, God doesn't need to create in order to be God, God doesn't need us to be God, God doesn't need to depend on anything that we could do for God, God can and has sent people to hell, mocking them and shaming them like when God burns His enemies by fire, justifying His sovereign will in every action He does that He chooses to reveal by His sovereign will for a perfectly sufficient reason for God to do so. All religions that can't have any intellectual dialogue like such are not worthy to exist. There's many forms of Presuppositional Apologetics in many different religions, but that doesn't mean that they're consistent to their own claims either. To a Neoplatonist, one can make the obvious case that usually sex is binary except for situations of extra or missing chromosomes, and therefore, gender is also ontologically binary, the form of a women and the form of a man are necessary for procreation. However, they might go the Aristotelian end of their logic to reject morals when it doesn't suit them and then accept morals in a Neoplatonic understanding when it does suit them.\n\nIn an international stage, assuming that there's a New International Economic Order (NIEO) that replaces the New World Order, the nation can't abandon their DNA, needs to preserve some of their culture, but if they are against raising the Energy Flux Density, they have to result to war and depopulation agendas like degenerate anti-life scumbags that reject their own soul (AKA: the no soul doctrine) which leads to Nihilism, which is why the Talmudist Venetians like to use Aristotle against the host nation through academia as a false religion that they don't believe in but it's nevertheless very similar to some forms of Greek philosophy due to the likes of Maimonides that had tried to stop Jews from doing barbaric Babylonian paganism, but the Jews still practice a demonic ritual called the Kapparot which a rooster is waved over people's heads before slaughtering the rooster then fed to the \"goyim\" and that blood being used to curse objects and such, of all their sins that was atoned through the rooster transferred to their neighbor through false pretenses of a charitable act, in their foolish rationale. Therefore, get rid of the Jew by doing to them what they are doing to the Palestinians in systematic oppression and genocide. Those that insists on converting to a religion compatible to at least Neoplatonism (Neoplatonic Judaism is still Rabbinic Judaism), needs to go through special intensive training to prove themselves and also to have them isolated from the world, which if they fail, they are sent back to their open prison. An international collaboration is required to get these Jews out of their own countries and into isolated prisons where they are tried for their crimes and it would usually result to 100+ years in prison or the death penalty, and they are not allowed to procreate of course. The only way to explain the evil of the Jew is to fully expose every facet that they controlled and conspired against everyone, even themselves. After we get rid of the Jew and the elites and the non Jewish Zionist (Shabbos Goy), perhaps then we can burn up all the books and vain philosophy inspired through the Babylonian Talmud and the Zohar and other non inspired writ. The Jews void any oaths they made every time they participate in the Kol Nidre, sort of like Catholic indulgences, it's a vain tradition that corrupts people and is not based on the very scriptures they pretend to use.\n\nIn a said \"NIEO\", it should give a 20 year opprotunity for everyone to not only return to their ancestral homes, but also form an semi international city to accomodate such people that seeks to reassimilate from the countries that they've fled from for whatever reasons, even pardon people that fled because of low level crimes. If it's a European country or any country within the Anglosphere, if there are people that came from other countries and are without citizenship and are proven to be incapable of assimilation, deport those foreigners until the white population reaches a third of the world's population. The NIEO should also seek to ban all Matriarchal systems and LGBTQ propaganda. Every country should seek to raise the Energy Flux Density, but stuff like food aid as well as depopulation programs like poisonous vaccinations (not the same as microdosages and homeopathic remedies) and AIDS testing (HIV and AIDS isn't real) should be banned. Palestine gets returned to the Palestinians completely, restore the Byzantine Empire so to speak in letting Russia have Constantinople as well as letting Russia deal with the Mohammedans from invading Europa through Turkey, respect some but not all religious organizations that seeks to make a church state separate from whatever nation they were within with an occasional checkup to see if they aren't doing something fishy which eventually becomes the case for many such utopian societies, but these people can't be denied their right to leave and seek a different lifestyle outside of such communities, and since they are their own country so to speak, they can stop trespassers from entering into their land. Let those simpletons live how they like, as long as they don't become excessively parasitic of their host nation, but if the host nation let them get assimilated by the church state, the NIEO won't intervene. However, should a church state completely replaces a nation, the NIEO needs to push the same rules that it pushes on all nations, so no Matriarchy, no LGBTQ junk, no death cults, no genocide except towards death cults in self defense, and the promotion of increasing the Energy Flux Density.\n\nIn order to change a nation, enough good people need to be seating in the political system of that nation and it sometimes requires the head leader of the nation to be you specifically. To have a NIEO, you need to have people of other nations do the same and seek the same goals. None of such goals can be met if the Jews and the elite are pulling the strings. Concerning the elites, they use royal orders as well as pseudo orders in getting people to do favors for them through the \"Noble Lie\" in going up the ranking in being closer and closer to royal families and people that pretend to know everything when really they are using you for their gain, which again, church states can end up functioning through a Diocletian feudalism type of authoritative abuse of power, which nations also would become if they adopt Zeusian politics and Aristotelian mindsets over Promethean politics and Neoplatonic mindsets. Mankind however, in the Christian perspective, should seek to be with God in the New Heaven, New Earth instead of the fallen world where no matter what people do, there's always some room for bad things to happen that keeps people from having nice things, while seeking to raise the Energy Flux Density is really to ease the pain of living in elevating each other to have that experience more fulfilling but how productive you are has no direct 1 for 1 bearing with whether or not you are saved, neither can people know if people are saved even if they do and say the right things because people don't know who are saved, while Christians only know who's probably not saved from what they say and do, but probability isn't actual, only God knows whom he elected. Limited election of the saints predestined before the creation of the universe leads to limited atonement, a reality that Molinists absolutely hate to hear from Calvinists, they confuse potential outcome with actual outcome, taking things too literally where it seems to fit their feelings over what the bible logically concludes to limited atonement, which only those who are predestined to receive atonement can be atoned for their sins, no as below so above nonsense, which their claim of universal atonement as well as limited election contradicts each other which they seek not to follow the principle of noncontradiction by declaring the two contradictory claims are not contradictory, creating a doctrine that comes from eisegesis.\n\nüí´<strong>Ontological explanations behind society Feb 7, 2017 @ 15:57</strong>\n\nIn all things metaphysical, everything is in various levels of emanations, but not everyone knows the source of it all, neither know how things emanate and why. Let's begin with good and bad. Good is in example: logos, beauty, arithmos, art, nature, wisdom, noumena, principles, explanations, while bad is absence or lack of good. Bad is also the evil mindset behind the reification of itself as its own principle in direct opposition to good instead of being an necessitative emanation of bad just as light creates shadows but shadows are not a thing in itself yet we deceive ourselves into thinking those shadows are the light that can exist independently from the light. Light is actually invisible, it is only visible when it \"hits\" something and goes into our eyes that picks up red, green, and blue within the visible spectrum, so magenta is an illusion that is not on the light spectrum, our eyes just treats the absence of green as magenta, negative green, the light color wheel Goethe made is what is observed but it is not based soley on how light actually functions but on how we perceive colors in our minds. As light is to matter that gives off a shadow in the presence of light, so is wisdom is to knowledge that gives off a form of knowledge in the presence of wisdom. Wisdom can differentiate what is real knowledge from what is false knowledge. Real knowledge gives explanations of a principle, false knowledge is descriptions of a principle as well as its attributes. Wisdom is how to derive to positive truth through negation in correcting what was illogically reified as a noun back to its true form as a verb then seeking the true noun behind the cause of that verb. Light is an aether field perturbation, for light at rest is darkness just as sounds at rest is silence and how waves at rest is nothing.\n\nWhat is evil? It is the utilization of the absence of good against good, which in and of itself, comes from bad. Just as Lucifer Son of the Morning is not the opposite of God but takes the side against God which he is good, so is all evil ultimately subject to good, and won't exist without good. What is holy? it is the source of all good expressed through utilization of good because it's good primarily, which is also against evil secondarily but not dependent on bad which evil comes from bad but evil doesn't exist without bad. There are holy people, good people, bad people, evil people. Holy people are those that seek to do good. Good people don't seek to do good but are generally good. Bad people don't seek to do bad but are generally bad. Evil people seek to do bad. Bad and evil people are not tapped into any source of good. Holy people are not holy in and of themselves, but through the source of their holiness. Evil people are evil in and of themselves, through the denial of the source of all things good and holy. Generally good people and generally bad people are within a spectrum but are not wholly on one side or another influenced by either holy people or evil people. There are therefore, four types of morals: holy, good, bad, evil. Within a consistent Christian theology, only those God predestined can accept God, to have the faith to choose to accept the true gift of grace which God regenerates them before they even begin to choose. However, I am making an ontological case, not an epistemological case.\n\nThere are four types of people: sheep, wolves, guard dogs, groundhogs. Sheep are confident, passive, stupid, does not attack, defenseless, always visible. Wolves are brave, aggressive, cunning but not always smart, attacks primarily, defends secondarily, sometimes visible. Guard dogs are courageous, assertive, not so smart, defends primarily, attacks secondarily, mostly visible. Ground hogs are cowards, passive aggressive, very smart, rarely attacks, rarely defends, always hiding.\n\nThere are six types of intellects: demonic, idiot, intelligent, intelligent idiot, wise fool, wise and intelligent. Demonic people are evil and bad people, they are wolves. Idiotic people are based on their senses, the physical, they are sheep, sheep are usually too stupid to grasp the concept of good nor evil so they can be good or evil people but never holy or evil people, only through happenstance. Intelligent people are educated but not wise, they tend to be sheep, guard dogs, and groundhogs. Intelligent idiot people are highly educated morons, they tend to be wolves primarily, the guard dogs secondarily through deception, they may or may not be aware of their evil which if they are, they are evil wolf intelligent idiots, if they aren't, they are bad guard dog intelligent idiots, but they're never holy nor good people. Intelligent idiots are not the same as demonic, for the demonic people may not be idiots, but they are not intelligent either, this is about intellect, not about the type nor the moral, so by demonic I don't mean it in the moral sense in their heart, but in their mind. Intelligent idiots are also mentally demonic people with an education that is also an idiot so they keep their demonic intellect but expressed through their intelligence without wisdom. They indoctrinate the intelligent people with foolishness and have gain credibility over those that fall for their foolishness to the idiotic people, as well as the demonic people that lack wisdom and existential intelligence.\n\nWise fools are primarily ground hogs, secondarily guard dogs. They have wisdom but not knowledge, they are happy with gaining enlightenment and are not fixated on the physical, tend to not be able to know how to read and write and conduct advanced bean counting, cite trivial facts, function in modern society, just the bare minimal necessities for survival but not living for the sake of living. Wise and intelligent people are some mix of guard dog and ground hog primarily, some mix of sheep and/or wolf secondarily if any though they detest their secondary nature that occasionally show up. They have wisdom and knowledge, so they can make sense of the knowledge in front of them not through their knowledge, but through their wisdom. They are not necessarily as happy as the wise fools because they are so burdened with wisdom and knowledge. They can explain what the wise fools couldn't explain to intellegent people and intelligent idiots because the wise and intelligent is educated enough to go down to their level which the wise fools can't but only recognize if one truly has wisdom or not. They know phenomena and noumena, be able to define between the two and apply that wisdom through knowledge. There can't be someone who is by any means wise who's also demonic, though they can be bad occasionally, they're primarily good people and detest evil but not necessarily holy people, which in the moral aspect, the difference between a wise fool and a wise and intelligent person is just a matter of time in discerning another's moral standpoint which the wise fool takes a longer time than wise and intelligent person.\n\nWolves can be evil or bad, the alpha wolf is always the intelligent idiot while the pack wolves can also be the intelligent idiot but lower in credentials, or they can be demonic, which they are not idiots but are not intelligent either. Wolves sometimes trick guard dogs to do their dirty work. There's sometimes a good wolf but they rarely stay a wolf for long if they were truly good. Guard dogs sometimes mistaken groundhogs for wolves but there's sometimes bad or even evil groundhogs too. Can there be a holy groundhog? Perhaps. A dangerous mix is any mix between wolf and anything else, but from least to greatest, wolf-sheep, wolf-guard dog, and wolf-groundhog, which really when it all comes down to it, it is groundhog-wolves that control the guard dog-wolf and the sheep-wolf, they are the worse archetypal mix. However, their intellect determines how much more credibility they have. The intellect idiot groundhog-wolf therefore, is the logically greatest evil people out there. Their primary focus is everyone that has no wisdom, that includes people like themselves to keep them under check as well ironically so, while seeking to foster this special breed of evil as limited and far removed from reality as possible. This is why there is a evil covert order, and the denial of their existence is to first assume that there is no absence of good in the ontological sense. The evil covert order runs the evil overt governments, corporations, religions.\n\nEvil people are in opposition with is any holy person, especially holy wise and intelligent people. There is a holy invisible government among holy people, but whether or not there is a holy covert order, I am not aware of such a group currently existing run by holy wise and intelligent groundhog people that controls actual overt governments behind the scenes through proxies. However, there are people online that seeks to conspire against evil though how few they truly are while the rest are not groundhogs and/or not wise and intelligent which makes them either visible and/or stupid concerning wisdom and knowledge, being ensnared by the lying intelligent idiots and the intelligent people that listen to and parrot the doctrines of the intelligent idiots. What a holy wise and intelligent groundhog seeks is primarily holy wise and intelligent groundhog-guard dog people that can meet them halfway and secondarily, holy wise and intelligent guard dog people that would protect them as well as their proxy holy wise and intelligent groundhog-guard dog people. Groundhog-guard dog types detest full blown groundhog people but can still relate to their struggle in keeping the truth alive and underground. The guard dog people can reach out to guard dog-sheep people which they can in turn reach out to full blown sheep people. They all need to beware of the wolf-sheep, wolf-guard dog, wolf, and wolf-groundhog from least to greatest, from infiltrating for the bad and/or evil intelligent and/or intelligent idiot to undermine them. Can there be a holy intelligent idiot? If you didn't know, they do exist, but these people's egos might compromise the goal and flip to the other side quite easily in their own ignorance, thinking that they are behind it all which visibly they might appear to be. The holy covert order cannot allow holy intelligent idiots and lower intellects among them but holy wise fools and wise and intelligent people can, along with the occasional holy intellect that shows up. What is holy cannot mix with what is evil and vice versa. True wolves are always bad or evil but never truly good or holy, primarily intellectually demonic or intelligent idiot, secondarily idiot or intellectual, never ever a wise fool or wise and intelligent. If a wise fool or a wise and intelligent decides to be evil, they're no longer a wise fool or wise and intelligent person. A wise fool and the wise and intelligent can never be truly 100% sheep, wolf, demonic, idiot, intelligent idiot, just rarely or they were but no longer are. People can change but it rarely happens.\n\nThe real reason why there isn't any known holy covert order is that holy people don't like to keep things hidden, they fear that it can lead to corruption from within. They seek some form of transparency and some form of public front, while practicing the four SECs, without utilizing vain vows and oaths. I have yet to see a holy overt order that continued to be holy, they always failed one point or another. Similarily, people in the past that fled from persecution inevitably were found and massacred, so a holy overt church for example, becoming a holy covert church never continues to be covert and was overt at some point. This is why there needs to be some form of layered immunity system of the structure of the holy covert order and its holy overt order, whereas order is organization whether it is a church, a company, a government or some combinations between such.\n\nEvil people increase wealth and income disparity to gain power which the love of money is the root of all evil of which rich people end up being powerful people by being born into it and sometimes by ingenuity alone but rarely is that the case. Rich and evil people are dangerous people that pay off intelligent idiots or sometimes are the intelligent idiots themselves through other proxy groups and people that are a part of their system. They use their proxy groups to infiltrate other groups that seek to overthrow their system overtly or covertly. There's rarely ever rich and holy people to be on the face of the earth at any moment in history but they do occasionally do pop up in history and in modern days although they are grossly outnumbered by bad and evil rich people. Almost never do such rich people have wisdom. They are mostly indifferent to the suffering of the middle class and the lower class people while they don't seek to distribute their wealth fairly enough to increase the middle class people and have lower class people virtually nonexistent, while they either wage wars (no pun intended) against the middle class through a class revolt of the lower class against the upper class, and/or they deceive the middle class to give up their power through the lobbied authorities of any institution (intelligent idiots) before they gain enough power without the consent of the people at all. It doesn't matter what specific system it is, they will destroy it from all angles while distancing themselves from the destruction. The rich and evil keep their power limited within their families, their \"Houses\". Yes, they are the nobles. They have some infighting among them which is still going on, but it has been mostly settled and very limited among them. Like all functioning systems of government, they protect their families and their extended family. However, they are a synarchy of oligarchs controling nations in the shadows, underground. That's why the true evil and rich people are groundhogs.\n\nThe necessities for any nation is the distribution of power to the people in the government and in the physical so they also need to learn how to protect themselves even from themselves should wolves be among them, distribution of land for land ownership to all the families of the tribes to be owned by them and protected by them, distribution of baseline wealth to everyone that resets at the very least every 50 years/jubilee and at most whenever you forgive others for their trespasses and their IOUs which is also when land that was sold to others for some money is later returned to the original owner of the family, basic existential necessities like clean air, organic food, filtered water, shelter on their own land, energy to make stuff whether that is wood, coal, alcohol (as fuel), electric, oil, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, et cetra, protection of traditional values that truly obeys the golden rule, and of course, a growing population that seeks to be fruitful in their works and multiply their own people not just limited to physical growth but also through giving others a chance to join your nation well within reasonable means to be abundantely self sustainable. This is what holy people encourage and have good people listen to and have bad and evil people kept in check. This is the best we can do on our limited time alive, and if any of these things are deprived from us, it is the decline of that nation. The problem is, with globalism without borders, the decline of globalism will bring forth misery to the whole world for centuries that no one is immune from, for the wolves always get their way eventually at the cost of the lives of others once they destroy the system that they had sought to utilize against people, which will trickle down to affect them unless of course, they prepared for such a scenario as means of a cataclysmic world depopulation agenda of biblical proportions, though I personally believe before that happens, if they seek to round up all the Christians to murder them in the global scale and not just in spots here and there, God would just burn up the whole world for the New Heaven New Earth only for the Elect.\n\nThere are many evil religions out there. Some religions are expectant religions as in waiting for a greater truth to convert to while other religions proclaim to be that greater truth. However, only one of those religions are the truth while the rest being false. Philosophy is another religion although some forms of philosophy serve as merely mental tools for deriving to truth. Only a handful of such religions truly respect the golden rule while many of such religions are either extinct or became obscured and isolated from the world's view by the sands of time or even misinterpreted which that is the case for surviving religions that do hold to a genuine form of the golden rule. Many religions and philosophies are vain political tools for the demonic or intelligent idiot wolves used against the weak. Politics is for evil people when it all comes down to it, holy and good people as well as wise people almost instinctively know what to do to restore mankind to its proper place in the world naturally without much guidance from others because they recognize what is good. Even the rules holy and good people make is for bad and evil people to keep them responsible for their actions which they seek to get away from. The problem is that when bad and evil people make rules, it's a slippery slope that enables them and disables holy and good people. I would make the case that the US in example, were created by good and bad people which later became a slippery slope that enabled bad and evil people and suppressing holy and good people. The struggle of humanity is to keep society to function for holy people and against evil people at the same time, it needs to be restored to such high and strict standards and smart, rich, and evil people realize how they can't keep on destroying nations, which is why ironically they contribute in building new nations or flee to such places throughout the ages to maintain their power. They are ultimately parasitic of the good just as without the good, they cannot exist by themselves. They steal your livelihood, kill your people, and destroy your future.\n\nWhat group is there that fits this picture? They fit any barbaric, tribal or imperialistic, parasitic group of people, and every race had been just that group and persecuted people unrighteously in violation of the golden rule. However, some groups are more effective in being both the victim and the aggressor. This is where we get into the realm of the proper understanding of Identity Politics. Remember that this is what the intelligent idiots do to people and they are puppets to the evil wolf-groundhog types that are above and indifferent to the suffering of the peasants. Identity Politics is actually a part of Logomachy which generally means a dispute about or concerning words or in other words, lip flapping excuses to justify anything. Lawyers do it, politicians do it, everyone bad and evil do it, everyone good and holy detests doing it but realize how they need to spend their energy going against it so that the bad and evil people won't be able to get bad and evil things happen. There's much reason why wise fools and wise and intelligent people don't deal with politics and tend to be groundhogs, it's really a waste of their time and energy and they only get pushed through frustration to waste their time on it, while what isn't ever spoken is what truly matters which the intelligent idiots have a monopoly on the ignorance of the people. It's so easy to point out what is wrong with the world, but not the solutions to them.\n\nHere's a generic placeholder identity named Y, every weird letter combination is also a placeholder. Y is world renown for their mastery of Identity Politics. A Y is not a noun, it‚Äôs a verb reified as its own noun, so a Y doesn‚Äôt exist but it insists it does through its action but that action is dependent on something supposedly greater than itself. Y pretends to be J but J doesn't exist, the real J people disappeared while Y assumed themselves to be the J people that somehow survived. Y is narcissism and ego that overrides their nihilism. Y uses the AHQ, the VKN, the KVFR, Uakln, Xgeuarulburt, Qgurw Ayoewnlxuara and the NFRIQ people against each other. The Y gets you to focus on lesser political problems but they can never have you name one of their own to be the source of the problem. They are nothing, they are the absence of good, whether you promote them or are against them, if you are not holy or good, you end up being bad and evil as they are. They live off of the horizontal tension that they've created so that people won't realize that they've also created the vertical tension and even preventing people from having some form of vertical tension which is also in and of itself another trick to distance themselves from that and oversimplify it as a class war. They use your resistance against you as justification of their evil in pretending to play dumb and ignorant of whatever identity baiting they play to even get you to go against them in the first place, which this fabricated guilt becomes the means of justifying more destruction of the host nation, which is also in itself bait for people to seek to resist but can never seem to gain enough power to completely go against it because the Y through this process had gained too much control over the people.\n\nThe Y renders their opponents into a carbon copy of themselves for they try to do the opposite of Y when the Y plays both sides and are nothing which you can't reify nothing to be a noumena, a thing in and of itself, so in turn, they think like Y and become like Y, giving purpose to Y, and feeds off of Y, becoming the parasite of the parasite that pretends to be the host but is actually feeding off of your livelihood. The Y are just like the FM, the S, the P, they all are fundamentally one and the same because they seek to be good through the rejection of good, as below so above, a bottom to top form of obtaining salvation which is not as above so below, a top to bottom form of receiving salvation. The fool says in their heart that there is no God, therefore, they assume to be as gods by rejection of the God. The Y are their own enemy and friend, their enemies are also their friends that they deliberately become enemies for, they even exist because others say that they do when that is a lie. The Y pretends to be a race but it is ironically universal and not limited to one race at all, it's all who adheres to the doctrines of Y 100% that are the Y while it also pretends to be a race and so they are ethnocentric as well. An identity is not the person. People can change and repent from their wickedness and we need to give them some room, some mercy to be able to do just that, to truly mature in their consciousness, but we also need to limit such people from causing havoc. There's many evil plans that Y has in store for mankind which are real which limits everything necessary for any nation to thrive but going through them individually only explains a symptom of a problem, not addressing the problem directly.\n"

I reserve the right to change my mind when further analysis of empirical evidence proves my older mindsets to be false, and so do you. Proceed with caution.\n\nend@zeroid.bit"
