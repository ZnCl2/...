# Translations

Thank you for your interest in translating ZeroLSTN!

Whether it be fixing existing translations or writing new ones, translating couldn't be easier thanks to ZeroNet's built in translation system.

# Translation Files

Translations are held in "translation files" in the `languages/` folder. Inside you will find `.json` files, their names corresponding to the language code that they translate to. You can find a list of all supported language codes on the front page of [ZeroHello](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D/) behind the "three-dot" menu at the top left.

The contents of a translation file are simply a list of a word to translate in English on the left, and its translation on the right. A basic example is below:

```
{
    "Song": "Canto",
    "Artist": "Artista"
}
```

Feel free to make modifications to existing translation files and add new translation files as you please.

Thanks for making ZeroLSTN more accessible!
