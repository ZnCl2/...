			"body": "I made a searchable archive of the metadata of all galleries on sadpanda/exhentai before it was shut down.\nHere the address:\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/19dfPUtRhw6KxzAYBzfntburwuZDQULMZ3/\n\nAs you probably know sadpanda/exhentai died recently. Fortunately in all the panic when joe gave the warning, someone had the calm mindedness to scrape the entire homepage of exhentai in extended mode, saving (most of) the metadata of all galleries in the process(that includes metadata for all of e-hentai).\nSadMetadata is based on that set. Aside from around 22000 galleries out of the around 600000, which are only missing the tags, it has the complete collection of:\n- Gallery title\n- The number of pages\n- Username of the person that uploaded the gallery\n- The url/link where the gallery could be accessed in the past\n- The type of the gallery\n- The  date the gallery was uploaded \n- The tags including [namespace]:[name] and the power('high' or 'low')\n\nAs well as some metadata about the scraped sites I used:\n- The set where the metadata of the gallery has been found in.(\"SET_INFO\")\n- The metadataID(=every that comes after 'exhentai.org'(including the '/')).(\"ID\")\n- The page on the homepage where the metadata of the gallery was found.(\"PAGE\")\n- Whether or not the tags could not be recovered from the scraped data for that gallery.(\"IS_DATA_MISSING\")\n\nIf you still have the exhentai or e-hentai link to the gallery, you can go there and get the metadata mentioned above.\nFor more complex things (like if you have only the title or similar) you can also make your own SQLite query to find the metadata you need.\n\nFor now these are the only options you have, but I'll plan to add more user friendly and better filtering/searching options in the future.\n\nSeeders are highly appreciated. Please consider to activate the 'Download and help distribute all files'-option in the zero menu(pull the icon in the top right) in order to start helping to distribute the database(~500MB).\n\nI'm also planning to build a backup of exhentai here on zeronet, if you want to help me with that or contribute galleries to that let me know.\nBug reports and contributions to SadMetadata as well as advice are also welcome!\n**This is largely a repost from millchan /l/**",
