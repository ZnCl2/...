Identify theft is pretty scary.\n\n> Another solution could be an usb key with our identity, so when we wanna use It we can mount It and run part of this script! difference is that it will exchange the data in the /path/to/zeronet/data/users.json with the data in /path/to/the/mounted/data/ZN-login/users.json\n\nGood point. By the way, I'm working on a system to encrypt data so that it can be \"*safely*\" and efficiently stored on cloud storage systems. I'm still thinking up the *protocol* and how it would work, writing it should be pretty fast. It'll be out soon-ish.\n\n> actually, this is a very useful post!\n\nGlad you found it useful :)",
