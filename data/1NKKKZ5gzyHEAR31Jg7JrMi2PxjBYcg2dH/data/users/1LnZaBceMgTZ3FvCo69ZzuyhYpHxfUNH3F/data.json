Usually, it is self-proclaimed by the community of certain public blockchain. There are few popular algos: CryptoNight, Dagger Hashimoto, Equihash, Cuckoo Cycle and the others. More of these are memory hard. But it is possible that for this pow algorithms will be built ASICs in future. For example, DASH X11 algo had been known as ASIC resistant before ASICs had been created. Some crypto like Monero will change algo in case ASICs appearance or even in regular manner twice in a year to prevent ASICs development.",
