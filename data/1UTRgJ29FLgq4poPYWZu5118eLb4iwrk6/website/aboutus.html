                We lost our home when KAT went down last year. After skimming through the possibilities, we decided to have our own website / forum and at the same time also remain active at KAT. We now have a deeper respect and love for KAT. Simply put, all torrent sites suck ass in comparison to KAT. Only option was to go privy, but we have 1200 followers and not even 10% can get into private, never mind obligating to the seed back requirements.

                -What to do?
                <br>
                We, the team and I, decided to split the group into two sister release groups UTR & UTR-HD. UTR-HD found exclusively and only at PrivateHD.
                <br>
                <br>
                -What does that entail?
                <br>
                Simply put, half the team is going to release torrents on public trackers under the UTR tag. The latter will be going to PrivateHD under UTR-HD. (As you may remember, we always had 3 classes of content to choose from, LQ, normal and perfecto. The perfectos and extremos will now be found only at PrivateHD)

                UNITEAM ORIGION STORY
                <br>
                AUTHOR : QMAN
                <br>
                <br>
                I was contacted by a celestial being that had traveled through miles of sewers and had to climb up through my porcelain toilet but was trapped underneath the lid because of child safety locks. I had free the alien and in gratitude, he rolled a joint of star leaf, a space weed from the farthest cosmos. As we had our pow-wow he passed onto me the age-old ritual of piracy. By placing his 3-fingered hand onto my temples, placing his forehead lightly onto my dome, I felt the electricity surge from his fingertips into my brain, filling my mind with vivid, lovely and indescribable, unfathomable knowledge. The experience was similar as when Neo learned Twi Kwon Do in the matrix, for I had received a firmware upgrade of the highest degree. After my absorption of such knowledge, the alien said you are now the missionary for my kind, you are to recruit as many people you feel fit, encode and encode and upload alike until your fingers fall off. I said why alien, why is my path destined as such. He replied because of, my boy, my kind feeds from the seeds as an energy and out planet was invaded by wretched leechers, which consumed all our seeds and I traveled a great distance to get here and even a greater distance to travel to you. I said to him, why me? He replied because you are the one; pure, opened and your life path was made for you before you were made, and like art of clay, you were sculpted for this very cause. <br>
