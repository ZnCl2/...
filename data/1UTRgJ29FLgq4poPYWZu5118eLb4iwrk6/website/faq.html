                Welcome to our frequently asked questions page. If we haven’t answered your question, join us on the forums and we’ll answer any additional questions you may have.

                <br>
                What is does UTR stand for?
                <br>
                UTR is our release tag and stands for ‘UniTeamReleases’.
                <br>
                <br>
                What is UTR all about?
                <br>
                UTR is a collaborating team of encoders that work to bring you some of the best HEVC X265 encodes available on the net. The team is always looking to provide our fans with a high quality content usually outdoing our competitor’s releases. Content comes in the form of movies, anime, documentaries, TV seasons and also popular currently airing TV episodes.

                <br>
                What is HEVC and why do I want it?
                <br>
                ‘HEVC’ stands for High Efficiency Video Codec. It’s a new video codec that allows for a considerable quality boost for the same file size as predecessor codecs. Using this we are able to offer (usually) the same quality in much smaller files or improve what is achieved for the larger ‘normal’ file sizes.
                <br>
                We draw in some of our fans for the lower sizes as can be expected since we’re able to offer competitive quality for smaller files meaning you can save download bandwidth by sticking to our or other HEVC releases.
                <br>
                We currently use the x265 encoder for all of our releases, an open source HEVC encoder which is perfect for our needs. Learn more about it here.

                How do I get involved?
                <br>
                You’re already involved! Somehow you made it to our website so you’re clearly interested. Check out our catalogue of UTR encodes, all hosted under one roof by following <a href="index.html">UNITEAM WEBSITE</a>. Feel free to join the discussion on our forums - we won’t bite.
                <br>
                <br>
                Can I contribute my own encodes?
                <br>
                Sure you can! Create your own torrents and get them vetted to possibly join our team or pester us with questions on <a href="https://uniteam.co/forum/" target="_blank">UNITEAM FORUM</a> where we’ll hopefully help you out. UTR doesn’t hide it’s encode settings, but we won’t hand them to you. It’s a learning process but we’ll help you along the way. If you’re willing to learn and want to contribute, you’ve found the right place.

                <br>
                How come your currently airing releases are so slow?
                <br>
                Firstly, we don’t often have our own sources, most are x264 releases which we convert to x265. This means we have to download them, encode them (often taking upwards of 3hours) before starting to upload. As you’ll notice, we have multiple members taking on different shows and at the end of the day, many of us have lives and jobs. We can’t be around to do this 24/7 so delays happen. Also we have a pass the parcel system in place attempting to ensure we release bad encodes. Sometimes it still happens, but it happen more often without such a system. Additionally, some of the team may be busy and the upload again delayed.
                <br>
                That said, we will always attempt to get our stuff up as soon as possible. In the even a team member goes missing, give us a nudge and someone will usually step in to take over.
                <br>
