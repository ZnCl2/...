I used an APK actually to install on a friends Nexus 7 tablet. Google play wouldn't allow him to install it for some reason, so we did it manually and he just connected the tablet to a mobile hotspot. And the more torrents we have on here (even if a google search or two could find them as well) the better it is for the site in general.\n\nThe APK is fine and dandy and I applaud using it, its that there's no point in putting it in a torrent. You can also add it to almost any cloud drive it's so small.",
