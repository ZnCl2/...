The checkbox does\nnot trigger the corresponding setting in the service.\n\nWindows Firewall Control - Managing Windows Firewall is now easier than ever\nProgram Overview\n\nWindows Firewall Control is a powerful application which extends the functionality of the Windows Firewall and provides quick access to the most frequent options of Windows Firewall. It runs in the system tray and allows user to control the native firewall easily without having to waste time by navigating to the specific part of the firewall. This is the best tool to manage the native firewall from Windows 10, 8.1, 8, 7, Vista, Server 2008, Server 2012. Windows Firewall Control offers four filtering modes which can be switched with just a mouse click:\n\nHigh Filtering - All outbound and inbound connections are blocked. This setting blocks all attempts to connect to and from your computer.\nMedium Filtering - Outbound connections that do not match a rule are blocked. Only the programs that you allow can initiate outbound connections.\nLow Filtering - Outbound connections that do not match a rule are allowed. The user can block the programs he doesn't want to allow initiating outbound connections.\nNo Filtering - Windows Firewall is turned off. Avoid using this setting unless you have another firewall running on your computer.\nProgram Features\n\n√ Intuitive and easy accessible interface in the system tray, next to the system clock.\n√ Full support with standard user accounts. Elevated privileges are required only at installation.\n√ Disable the ability of other programs to add Windows Firewall rules.\n√ Multiple and easier ways of creating new rules in Windows Firewall.\n√ Integrated support of creating, modifying and deleting Window Firewall rules.\n√ Lock feature which can disable the access to the settings of the program and Windows Firewall.\n√ Shell integration into the right click context menu of the executable files.\n√ Display invalid rules with the possibility to delete them very quickly.\n√ Merge multiple similar rules or duplicate existing ones.\n√ Search for executable files through folders and create new rules in seconds.\n√ View recently allowed and blocked connections and create new rules from the Security log.\n√ Choose if you want the program to start at user log on.\n√ Import, export and restore all firewall rules or just the selected rules.\n√ Protection to unauthorized uninstallation.\n√ Possibility to restore previous settings at uninstallation.\n√ Global hot keys are supported and various shortcut keys are available.\n√ And many, many more.

			"body": "Raise Data Recovery for FAT v5.18.4\n\nSpecial tool for FAT recovery\nRecover lost or deleted files from FAT, FAT32 and ExFAT-formatted disks, flash memory sticks, flash memory cards of most vendors and manufacturers.\n\nFast evaluation of file system state\nPre-start basic file system diagnostics assesses general file system condition that helps determine data recovery direction.\n\nRecovery from replaced file systems\nAccurate detection of current and previous file systems after format and targeting recovery process at certain file system state.\n\nAdvanced all-at-once recovery\nProvides for selection of necessary files and building file system tree similar to the original one on the target storage.\n\nFunctional extensions\nExtend software operations with a set of optional external modules (plugins).\n\n\nOverview\nRaise Data Recovery is a group of software applications each specially designed for certain file system type as a cost-efficient data recovery solution.\n\nRaise Data Recovery for FAT can only access and recover data from FAT, FAT32 and ExFAT file systems. Recognition of other file systems is implemented for informational puposes only.\n\nFAT file system features quite good chances for recovery of deleted files unless they're overwritten. Powerful tools used by Raise Data recovery for FAT increase chances to recover lost data with maximum possible data recovery result.\n\nThe software work applying the same powerful mechanisms as UFS Explorer Standard Recovery software that enable efficient recovery of accidentally deleted data and data lost due to logical file system damages after formatting hard disk, hardware malfunctions or software failures, virus attacks, power outages etc. With Raise Data Recovery you can recover data from your PC, USB flash drive, memory card of your photo/video camera, external hard drive as well as from disk images and virtual machines formatted with such file system. For enhanced capabilities the software were supplemented with plug-ins for reconstruction and further recovery from complex RAID-systems as well.\n\nDespite restrictions that limit data recovery to one file system, the software recognizes other file systems as well - Windows (NTFS, FAT); Apple Mac OS (HFS+); Linux (Ext2, Ext3, Ext4 , Reiser, XFS, JFS (JFS2) and FreeBSD (UFS/UFS2). Raise Data Recovery will detect file system type and find lost and deleted data that allows you to define file system type and select Raise Data Recovery software for your file system.\n\nWorking with Raise Data Recovery you can be absolutely sure of complete safety of your data. The software work in a safe read-only mode and don't alter original information. Besides, you don't need any prior technical skills for work with these programs. User-friendly interface and ease-of-use make them a perfect solution even for non-experienced users.\n\nReasonable price of the software focused on your file system type will save your money and fast-working powerful software mechanisms will save your time.\n\n\nKey features\n\nParticular specialization on FAT file system recovery\nThe software is adopted to efficiently search for lost FAT, FAT32 or ExFAT-formatted file systems and recover lost or deleted files.\n\nImmediate data access for consistent file systems\nThe software allows to access data on all the supported file systems, including file systems stored on disk images, virtual disk, RAID storages etc. without the need of prior scan.\n\nSupport of disk images and virtual disks\nThe software allows to open disk images and virtual disks produced by virtual machines of leading virtualization software vendors (including VMware Player, VMware Workstation, Microsoft Virtual PC, Microsoft Hyper-V, Parallels Desktop etc.). This application operates virtual disks and disk image files exactly as if they were physical disks and allows to access or recover lost data from disk images and virtual disks.\n\nOptional RAID recovery\nWith optional module - RAID Access Plugin - RAID Builder - the software supports virtual reconstruction of RAID system after failure of controller or RAID metadata. The program virtually builds RAID and reads its files and folders as if it was physical RAID storage. The software easily handles both simple RAID configurations (such as stripe set - RAID level 0, Span, Mirror - RAID level 1) and complex RAID such as RAID 5 and RAID 6. RAID-on-RAID feature allows to build RAID configurations of high complexity such as RAID 50, RAID 60 etc. Optional support of Runtime Software Virtual Image Files with RAID Access Plugin - VIM Import allows to set up custom RAID configuration with different data distribution algorithms.\n\nComprehensive files recovery\nThe set of tools implemented in the software provides solutions for most practical data loss cases.

			"body": "Raise Data Recovery for NTFS v5.18.4\n\nSpecial tool for NTFS recovery\nRecover lost or deleted files from NTFS file system created with any modern Windows operating system.\n\nFast evaluation of file system state\nPre-start basic file system diagnostics assesses general file system condition that helps determine data recovery direction.\n\nRecovery from replaced file systems\nAccurate detection of current and previous file systems after format and targeting recovery process at certain file system state.\n\nAdvanced all-at-once recovery\nProvides for selection of necessary files and building file system tree similar to the original one on the target storage.\n\nFunctional extensions\nExtend software operations with a set of optional external modules (plugins).\n\n\nOverview\nRaise Data Recovery is a group of software applications each specially designed for certain file system type as a cost-efficient data recovery solution.\n\nRaise Data Recovery for NTFS can only access and recover data from NTFS file system. Recognition of other file systems is implemented for informational puposes only.\n\nNTFS system features one of the best data recovery chances on condition that lost data are not overwritten. Raise Data Recovery for NTFS raises possibility for exact recovery of lost and deleted files from partitions and storages formatted with this system.\n\nThe software work applying the same powerful mechanisms as UFS Explorer Standard Recovery software that enable efficient recovery of accidentally deleted data and data lost due to logical file system damages after formatting hard disk, hardware malfunctions or software failures, virus attacks, power outages etc. With Raise Data Recovery you can recover data from your PC, USB flash drive, memory card of your photo/video camera, external hard drive as well as from disk images and virtual machines formatted with such file system. For enhanced capabilities the software were supplemented with plug-ins for reconstruction and further recovery from complex RAID-systems as well.\n\nDespite restrictions that limit data recovery to one file system, the software recognizes other file systems as well - Windows (NTFS, FAT); Apple Mac OS (HFS+); Linux (Ext2, Ext3, Ext4 , Reiser, XFS, JFS (JFS2) and FreeBSD (UFS/UFS2). Raise Data Recovery will detect file system type and find lost and deleted data that allows you to define file system type and select Raise Data Recovery software for your file system.\n\nWorking with Raise Data Recovery you can be absolutely sure of complete safety of your data. The software work in a safe read-only mode and don't alter original information. Besides, you don't need any prior technical skills for work with these programs. User-friendly interface and ease-of-use make them a perfect solution even for non-experienced users.\n\nReasonable price of the software focused on your file system type will save your money and fast-working powerful software mechanisms will save your time.\n\n\nKey features\n\nParticular specialization on NTFS file system recovery\nThe software is adopted to efficiently search for lost NTFS-formatted file systems and recover lost or deleted files.\n\nImmediate data access for consistent file systems\nThe software allows to access data on all the supported file systems, including file systems stored on disk images, virtual disk, RAID storages etc. without the need of prior scan.\n\nSupport of disk images and virtual disks\nThe software allows to open disk images and virtual disks produced by virtual machines of leading virtualization software vendors (including VMware Player, VMware Workstation, Microsoft Virtual PC, Microsoft Hyper-V, Parallels Desktop etc.). This application operates virtual disks and disk image files exactly as if they were physical disks and allows to access or recover lost data from disk images and virtual disks.\n\nOptional RAID recovery\nWith optional module - RAID Access Plugin - RAID Builder - the software supports virtual reconstruction of RAID system after failure of controller or RAID metadata. The program virtually builds RAID and reads its files and folders as if it was physical RAID storage. The software easily handles both simple RAID configurations (such as stripe set - RAID level 0, Span, Mirror - RAID level 1) and complex RAID such as RAID 5 and RAID 6. RAID-on-RAID feature allows to build RAID configurations of high complexity such as RAID 50, RAID 60 etc. Optional support of Runtime Software Virtual Image Files with RAID Access Plugin - VIM Import allows to set up custom RAID configuration with different data distribution algorithms.\n\nComprehensive files recovery\nThe set of tools implemented in the software provides solutions for most practical data loss cases. Depending on situation the software either simply reads or conducts deep analysis of file system metadata to find lost files. Even if the metadata is lost permanently, this program can guess file allocation basing on file system specifics, other files allocations and file content analysis to produce maximally successful data recovery result even in severe data loss cases.\n\n\n\nSpecifications\n\nSupported host operating systems:\n\n    Microsoft Windows: all starting with Windows NT version 5.1 (Windows XP/2003) and above; \n\nSupported host computer architectures:\n\n    Intel Architecture, 32-bit (IA-32, x86) - for all operating systems;\n    AMD64 (x86-64) - for all operating systems. \n\nSupported file systems for recovery:\n\n    NTFS: full support (access and advanced recovery);\n    FAT/FAT32: recognition only;\n    SGI XFS: recognition only;\n    Apple HFS+: recognition only;\n    JFS (IBM JFS2): recognition only;\n    Ext2-Ext4: recognition only;\n    ReiserFS: recognition only;\n    UFS/UFS2: recognition only;\n    Custom Adaptec UFS: recognition only;\n    Sun ZFS: recognition only;\n    Novel NWFS: recognition only;\n    HFS: recognition only. \n\n* - the rate of deleted files recovery can be low due to the file system design\n** - deleted files may be unrecoverable due to the file system design\n\nSystem requirements\n\nSystem configuration:\n\n    any of supported operating systems;\n    at least 20MB free disk space for software executable files;\n    at least 1GB RAM. \n  \nhttp://www.ufsexplorer.com/rdr_ntfs.php",
