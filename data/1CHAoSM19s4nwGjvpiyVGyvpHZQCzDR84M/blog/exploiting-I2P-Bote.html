        <div id='postDate' class='center'>2016-11-29</div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2pbote.xyz/">I2P-Bote</a> is an experimental anonymous decentralized “email” system that is distributed as a plugin for I2P.</p>
<p>I2P-Bote runs with a browser interface, which introduces a whole class of vulnerabilities, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF</a>.</p>
<h2>Exploiting the Client</h2>
<p>Similar to my earlier research of I2P, I discovered that I2P-Bote was vulnerable to critical CSRF attacks.</p>
<p>Anyone that was using I2P-Bote with a typical security setup was at risk to varying degrees, such as having messages sent on their behalf, their keys deleted, messages sent on their behalf, etc.</p>
<p>CSRF payloads could have been delivered by websites the user would visit, which could have used JavaScript or embedded hidden “image” elements in the page to send commands to a user’s client.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Once again, I think it is a mistake to use the highly complex browser environment to make client side software that also runs as a server locally, especially security/privacy sensitive software.</p>
<p>If you are still on vulnerable versions of I2P or I2P-Bote, I highly recommend updating immediately.</p>
<p>I want to give a big thanks to str4d, who got this vulnerability fixed, and for his work on I2P/I2P-Bote in general.</p><div class="center" style="margin-bottom: -25%; margin-top: 2em; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;"><span>Written by anonymous</span><br><br></div>
