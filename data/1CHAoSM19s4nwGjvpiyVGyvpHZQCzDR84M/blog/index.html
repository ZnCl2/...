(This was not an audit, just a short examination).</p><p><img alt="OpenBazaar Logo" src="./images/openbazaar.png" /></p><p>One of the first places I checked for security flaws was OpenBazaar's back-end API server (which comes with the desktop client), which uses HTTP. I examined the API server for CSRF issues, because in my experience other native software that uses web technologies suffer from them.</p><a href="bitcoin-shoplifting:-hacking-openbazaar-1.0.html">...</a></div><a href="tls-key-reuse-on-popular-router-models.html"><h2>Tls Key Reuse On Popular Router Models</h2></a><div class="postDate">2017-08-07</div><div class="postPreview"><p>Recently I have been researching security of consumer Internet and WiFi routers.</p><p>I knew that key reuse was an issue in device firmware, but the issue is more widespread in routers than I would have guessed. Default &amp; current (at time of writing) versions of <strong>firmware for most if not all Netgear, Linksys, and perhaps other router brands reuse TLS keys for their web management interface</strong>.</p><p>TLS for remote router management is already 'broken' since certificates are not usually valid, and few users understand how to manually verify certificate fingerprints. Even if users verify fingerprints, they will have a false sense of security since reused TLS keys provide zero protection, while still appearing to be secure.</p><a href="tls-key-reuse-on-popular-router-models.html">...</a></div><a href="hijacking-gandi.net-domains-and-servers.html"><h2>Hijacking Gandi.net Domains And Servers</h2></a><div class="postDate">2017-07-24</div><div class="postPreview"><p><a href="https://www.gandi.net/">Gandi.net</a>, a popular domain registrar and hosting provider used by somewhat high profile organizations, such as the <a href="https://eff.org">EFF</a> and <a href="https://fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>, had an XSS vulnerability on its main domain name (www.gandi.net).</p><p>This also happens to be where domain DNS settings are managed, along with other account settings and server hosting.</p><a href="hijacking-gandi.net-domains-and-servers.html">...</a></div><a href="./zeronet:-death-by-svg.html"><h2>Zeronet: Death By Svg</h2></a><div class="postDate">2017-07-19</div><div class="postPreview"><p>An often overlooked feature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg">SVGs</a> is their ability to have embedded scripts, like HTML pages.</p><p>When displayed in an &lt;img&gt; tag, SVGs are not permitted to execute scripts, however, when they are viewed directly, they are.</p><a href="zeronet:-death-by-svg.html">...</a></div><a href="creating-minecraft-plugins-in-any-programming-language.html"><h2>Creating Minecraft Plugins In Any Programming Language</h2></a><div class="postDate">2017-07-04</div><div class="postPreview"><p>This is a bit of a different post from what I usually write about, but hopefully those who are interested in programming, Linux, or Minecraft will enjoy it.</p><p>Despite being a building game, Minecraft is often praised for its circuitry features and mods that allow people to learn and apply computer science principles while having fun in the game.</p><a href="creating-minecraft-plugins-in-any-programming-language.html">...</a></div><a href="using-caddy-to-create-a-secure-socket-server.html"><h2>Using Caddy To Create a Secure Socket Server</h2></a><div class="postDate">2017-04-25</div><div class="postPreview"><h2>Why?</h2><p>Telnet wasn't all bad.
