        <p><code>&lt;apologies to people who like monopoly, no offense to ny'all&gt;</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>but its an even shittier lifestyle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this rant is bought to you by my good friend <a href="https://niu.moe/@lumi">lumi</a> who bought this to my attention, and ive been thinking about it all day.</p>
<p>short rant but it needs to be said.</p>
<h2 id="microoft-winblows">micro$oft winblows</h2>
<p>it feels good that saying that phrase is old enough now to be retro, but it feels bad that we still need to say it.</p>
<p>microsoft is a shitty company, and windows basically has a literal monopoly on the market.</p>
<p>you might go on about apple, but really they’re just as bad, and a completely different problem all together but today we’re focussing our rage towards microsoft.</p>
<p>if you’re on this website you’re either:</p>
<ul>
<li>someone who hates microsoft</li>
<li>someone who knows me irl</li>
</ul>
<p>and therefore i probably dont need to go into great detail about why they suck, but heres a brief list:</p>
<ul>
<li>they actively prohibit peoples use of hardware that theyve paid for.</li>
<li>they actively spread irrational fear about non-microsoft products to trick people into using them</li>
<li>they actively capture massive amounts of user data, something that is <strong><em>literal spyware</em></strong> for their own benefits and profits, and give you a shittier, harder to use system if you dare opt out.</li>
<li>they use exploitative marketing and misinformation to make people think they need more expensive machines than they do</li>
<li>on top of that they just make really shitty and bloated software.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-cares-just-dont-use-it">who cares just dont use it</h2>
<p>thank you, i dont.</p>
<p>but this is the topic of todays rant, even though i dont use it, i still, in some sense, have to support them, and i really hate that.</p>
<p>this rage should really be aimed at laptop manufacterers too, because for some reason its actually, what we in the business like to call:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>really <strong><em>really</em></strong> fuarking hard to buy laptops that dont have windows on them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>now, this is a mild inconvenience, but its a moral issue as well, because its undermining one of the core tennants of capitalism*</p>
<p>by which of course, i mean magical capitalism that works like people say it should, and not the garbage we have today.</p>
<p>the one thing you hear all the time, that is actually somewhat decent advice for living in a corporate world</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you dont like something, vote with your wallet!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and you know what, i would.</p>
<p>…if it was possible to buy laptops that didnt come with a mandatory pat on the back for microsoft.</p>
<p>and sure, i could find somewhere to buy a laptop that doesnt have a windows preinstalled, but its difficult, its hard, and more importantly.</p>
<p>it relies on me having the know-how on how to do that.</p>
<p>and sure, i do, but how many other people who are just learning about this sort of thing do?</p>
<p>how many people <em>dont</em> know about this sort of thing because all theyve ever known is that if you dont buy a mac, it has windows on it.</p>
<p>its disgusting, its unethical, its basically a monopoly, and im tired of paying the winblows tax just because microsoft feel the need to shove their fat mouth into everything they can get a hold of.</p>
<h2 id="fin">fin</h2>
<p>no fancy outro today, fuark microsoft, and fuark the tech sector for apparently not caring about literal monopolies we have everywhere. there are other monopolies in the tech sector but thats a rant for another time.</p>
<p>today, since i cant vote with my wallet, im voting with my mouth.</p>
