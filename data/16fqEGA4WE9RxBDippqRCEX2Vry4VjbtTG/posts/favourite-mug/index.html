<p>get your ugly mug out of here</p>
</blockquote>
<p>people who dont have strong opinions on irrelevent stuff are <strong>fukken boring</strong>, or as ive come to call them, <strong>dumbasses</strong>.</p>
<p>with that, lets talk about the features of my favourite mug at work, and my process for ensuring i get to use it.</p>
<h2 id="size">size</h2>
<p>lets start with the obvious, coffee tastes like soykaf (haha irony geddit) but yeah for real its pretty bad.</p>
<p>also it should be known that i do <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> endorse milk. fuark milk its <em>garbo</em> so milk is out too.</p>
<p>the best you can do with coffee is to have it <strong><em>black</em></strong> and with like, a tonne of sugar. im not even joking about the sugar heres an actual (tm) real life (tm) conversation i had with a friend</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tA would you like some coffee?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>yes please but no milk</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ummmm ok, how about sugar?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a bunch of it please</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>like how much?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>idk a heap</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>like this? &lt;holds up one heaped teaspoon&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>yeah put like five of those in</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so this resulting concoction tastes good if its warm, and good if its cold, and so you can just sip on it all day. good stuff.</p>
<p>for this we need a large mug, so that you can hold a suitable amount of it throughout the day.</p>
<p>as such, my favourite mug in our office is in fact, the largest one.</p>
<h2 id="colour">colour</h2>
<p>aesthetics are important, theyre one of the main reasons we as humans do anything, those reasons are of course:</p>
<ul>
<li>for the aesthetics</li>
<li>for the meme</li>
<li>cos itd be radical</li>
<li>to impress a girl</li>
<li>to be a sick cunt</li>
</ul>
<p>and so this mug has to have decent aesthetics. it is a white base with a blue, striped bunch of highlights.</p>
<p>the important thing here is that visually it looks <em>90%</em> similar to the other mugs. i want to enjoy my coffee, i dont want to be standing out and looking like a weird duder.</p>
<h2 id="shape">shape</h2>
<p>now there are two main points in favour i wanna make here, and both are semi related.</p>
<p>first of all, the bottom of the mug tapers inwards. this makes it easy to slide onto and off of my desk (which has a tonne of soykaf on it), and more importantly <strong><em>DOES NOT MAKE THAT AWFUL CHALKBOARD NAILS SOUND THAT MAKES ME WANT TO CUT MY SKIN OFF</em></strong> which imho is a pretty stellar point of favour for this mug.</p>
<p>secondly, it makes the inside of the cup super easy to handwash.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but tA, your company has a dishwasher, why do you need to handwash your mug? <del>t. definitely not a spider</del></p>
</blockquote>
<p>that is the secret, my eight legged friends.</p>
<h2 id="sneaky-shit">sneaky shit</h2>
<p>everyday i “accidentally” leave my mug on my desk at the end of the day, and then every morning i handwash it to have my morning been juuce. you know what that means?</p>
<p><strong><em>no-one else has a chance to get my favourite mug, baby</em></strong></p>
<p>chaotic neutral right there futhamuckas.</p>
<p><code>tired, wired and inspired all day every day</code></p>
