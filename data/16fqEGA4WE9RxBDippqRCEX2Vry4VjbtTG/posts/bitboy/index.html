        <p>people are, at their core, nodes on a network. given free reign and a context that precludes us killing each other, all we wanna do is be like a node on a network.</p>
<h2 id="paaaaartaaaayyyyyyyyy">paaaaartaaaayyyyyyyyy</h2>
<p>i was at a party recently, on a variety of different substances, and i stood in the middle of the dance floor, and i planted my roots into the carpet, and connected to the energy of everyone around me.</p>
<p>i closed my eyes and listened to what they had to say, everyone at once, and there was one thing that stood out to me above all else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>given free reign, everyone just talked about who else they knew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>everyone there was just a node reaching out trying to find its place in the network.</p>
<p>nameservers that would climb up the ladder of popularity until they found someone who knew the same people they did, and then they would celebrate.</p>
<p>they would tell stories about how they knew the people they did, they would proclaim how small a world we live in, and that was more or less it.</p>
<p>i myself expanded my database quite a lot that night, and by the time all the energy there was to ingest had been taken, i went home smiling <del>not only because a very attractive girl danced to king gizz through my headphones, but also</del> because id met a lot of new people, which is apparently all humans want to do.</p>
<p>we find who we can, and we broadcast who we know, and we use that to figure out our position in the abstract world of meatspace.</p>
