<p>if i have seen further than other men, it is because im standing on the shoulders of giants</p>

<p>the problem with giants, is that once we are on their shoulders we lose control of where we want to be.</p>
<p>the problem with giants, is that once on their shoulders, any fall is fatal.</p>
<p>the problem with giants, is that we now rely on them having similar ideals to our own.</p>
<p>the problem with giants, is that they dont.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-world-order">the new world order</h2>
<p>the new world is already here. forget reptiles, forget the one percent, our world is ruled by giants.</p>
<p>amazon, microsoft, apple, google, facebook. the five overlords that have <strong><em>complete and undeterred control</em></strong> over every aspect of human life.</p>
<p>these are giants amongst giants. entire civilisations stand on their shoulders, societies that <strong>cannot</strong> imagine a life without these wandering giants.</p>
<p>these are giants that would rather be gods. they no longer care for aiding the advancement of ourselves, only for the number of followers they can amass.</p>
<p><strong><em>no gods, no masters</em></strong></p>
<p>what is a human to a god? <em>nothing</em>, but also, <em>everything</em></p>
<p>a giant without followers is still a giant.</p>
<p>a god without belief does not exist.</p>
<p>these self-appointed dieties would not and could not survive without the cities on their backs, all it would take is an exodus and we could be free.</p>
<p>however, as i look around, and see our society with its head in the clouds, i wonder.</p>
<p>perhaps we couldnâ€™t survive the fall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>anyone can see far on the shoulder of a giant. it takes a unique mind to be able to look down.</p>
