        <p>hey its ya boy tanthonyAntano here. now i spent a lot of time in the golden age of king gizzard and the lizard wizard fan club facebook page, back in its peak.</p>
<p>one of the topics of debate that kept resurfacing was about the song “mr beat” from nonagon infinity. this song was a tonal shift from every other song on the album, and the fan base was split on whether they liked it or not.</p>
<p>one argument was that in an infinite song album - when each song transitions into each other, and the last song transitions into the first, you need a “pivot point” to act as a time keeping mechanism so that it doesnt all merge into each other.</p>
<p>im going to say my thoughts about how i agree with that argument.</p>
<h2 id="loops">loops</h2>
<p>loops, circles, wheels, looping elements revolve around some point of fixture. there are two possibilities; either the wheel is revolving itself, or the point of fixture is itself revolving.</p>
<h2 id="point-revolver">point revolver</h2>
<p>in this scenario the song is a concrete wheel, attached to some point in space through its axle.</p>
<p>the concrete is perfectly circle, so there is no change in form if it revolves, the final state is the same, theres no point to revolve.</p>
<p>that means the point of fixture is revolving the wheel.</p>
<p>in order for this there must be some sort of infastructure behind the point, which itself entails people to build and maintain it, and it just goes on and on.</p>
<p>this distracts the listener from the music.</p>
<h2 id="self-independant">self independant</h2>
<p>in this scenario, the wheel itself is outputting some amount of force to revolve. the wheel is concrete and petal shaped, with the corner being heavy.</p>
<p>if the corner is in the air, it will drop and the wheel will move.</p>
<p>at the bottom it has enough force (in this world) to continue up the other side and start the process again.</p>
<p>nothing else needs to exist, so you can focus on the music.</p>
<h2 id="fin">fin</h2>
<p>thats why its important that infinite song albums have one song thats a point of difference from everything else.</p>
<p>it makes the album better.</p>
<p><code>peace out</code></p>
