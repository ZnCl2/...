        <p>… is something that is difficult to think about, but a fun exercise nontheless.</p>
<p>my ideal world, as it turns out, is sorta hipster and also not feasible for anyone to actually live in.</p>
<p>go figure</p>
<h2 id="well-get-on-with-it-then">well get on with it then</h2>
<p>lets get some stuff out of the way first</p>
<h3 id="housing">housing</h3>
<p>everyone has free access to a room in a house. this is warm and cosy, and has a high speed internet connection, and all the devices you need: A highspeed grunty and lovely comfy laptop, multiple screens and whatnot, whatever you need.</p>
<h3 id="food">food</h3>
<p>is avaliable with no worry, no need to starve or worry. i have zero idea how this is handled, fuarking magic i guess.</p>
<h3 id="work">work</h3>
<p>does not exist, working sucks. people who work in this world are doing so out of want to create, rather than financial gain. people aqcuire new things <strong><em>somehow</em></strong> and there is literally no worry about finances at all. who knows how this works, i’m not a financial guy</p>
<h3 id="tech-giants">tech giants</h3>
<p>do not exist. computers are a hobby in this world, not a medium for business to work through. learning how to use a computer is your gateway to interacting with the wider world.</p>
<h2 id="computers">computers</h2>
<p>computers are rad, to use the local lingo, computers are <strong><em>fuarking computers</em></strong>, and so this world is focussed on all the good bits of computers.</p>
<p>self discovery, self reliance, self hosting.</p>
<p>learning new things is your way to discovering new levels of interaction with people.</p>
<p>using a computer in our futuristic world should be a modern analogue of philosophers trying to discover the human condition.</p>
<p>learning more and more tech should be equivilent to opening your mind and becoming more soulful.</p>
<p>it should <strong>NOT</strong> be an exercise in having your data stolen and relying on the crappily written software of the tech giants.</p>
<p>it should <strong>NOT</strong> be frustrating.</p>
<p>it should be a hobby.</p>
<p>in this world, the best thing you can do is share your knowledge and help other people reach the level you’re at.</p>
<p>in this world people are dedicated to sharing what they know, what they enjoy, and creating and contributing to their niches.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">relationships</h2>
<p>do not exist in this world as they do in the real world.</p>
<p>physical relationships hold us back as a species. they are a barrier for moving our consciousness outside of our body, and they are too built into every single action we can take to allow for purity.</p>
<p>relationships in this world are purely mental, and more akin to finding somebody to play against in a game who are as close to your level as you can find.</p>
<p>somebody who is a real <strong><em>match</em></strong> for you.</p>
<p>something pure and unsullied by needs of the flesh.</p>
<h2 id="daily-routine">daily routine</h2>
<p>everyone just sleeps as much as they feel. gets up, and begins to create, or enjoy, whatever they want to do.</p>
<p>drug use is encouraged, finding new points to view is the goal.</p>
<p>social activities are fun and should be had.</p>
<p>online activities are pure and should be undertaken as much as possible.</p>
<p>in this world your wired identity is as important if not moreso than your physical identity.</p>
<p>we cannot neglect our wired identities, for that is how we achieve immortality.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts.">final thoughts.</h2>
<p>this world will never happen, it will never be.</p>
<p>i wish it could though.</p>
