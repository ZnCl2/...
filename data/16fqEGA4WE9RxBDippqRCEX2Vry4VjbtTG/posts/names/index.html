        <p>to give something a name is to give it <strong>power</strong>.</p>
<p>sometimes, a name is what matters most.</p>
<p>names are what were most often first introduced to.</p>
<p>names are what we remember things by.</p>
<p>names are <strong><em>very</em></strong> important.</p>
<h2 id="love-letter">love letter</h2>
<p>at the moment one of my projects is a love letter engine, the classic boardgame with a million rethemes.</p>
<p>i thought itd be a good chance to develop architecture that i could then go on to use for the <em>1998 Neon Genesis Evangelion Trading Card Game</em> (admittedly not the best name ever).</p>
<p>for that one, im planning on calling it <em>EVAC</em>, for, obviously, the <em><strong>EVA</strong>ngelion <strong>C</strong>ard game</em></p>
<p>this love letter game is going to be <em>lain</em> themed (lets all love lain!) so i spent a while and came up with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>drum roll please</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="lainletta">LainLettA</h1>
<p>which i like for a couple of reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>it looks neat with the triple caps</li>
<li>it sounds similar to love letter</li>
<li>im vain and like to put tA into my project names</li>
</ul>
<p>and this time tA fits in there <em>perfectly</em></p>
<h2 id="so-what">so what?</h2>
<p>this game, so far, would probably make more sense themed to Fantasy Flight Games <strong>Android</strong> ip, an ip i really like.</p>
<p>..but then the name would be fuarked up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Le AndroidLettA? what the <em>hell</em> is a Le AndroidLettA?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so, because the name gives this project power, its staying lain themed.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-us">what about us?</h2>
<p>names can have many powers.</p>
<p>set in stone usernames give us our everlasting power, <strong>tA</strong> has been recognised from irc rooms from years back, it gives me an underlying digital identity, its <strong><em>important</em></strong></p>
<p>display names that can be changed at will give us our <em>current power</em>, they show people our current state of mind, our current mood, in a way that isn’t <em>important</em> per se, but oh so important.</p>
<p>theres a theory in rationality about <em>type 1</em> and <em>type 2</em> brain functions.</p>
<p><strong>type 1</strong> is our rational, think over all the options thinking.</p>
<p><strong>type 2</strong> is our spur of the moment, “fuark it that’ll be cool” thinking</p>
<p>and these <code>[user|display ]names</code> exemplify both of these functions, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="nani-tf-are-you-trying-to-say">nani tf are you trying to say?</h2>
<p>if i knew this blog would be better and this post would be longer.</p>
<p>names are powerful, dont neglect them, take pride in them, but feel free to take them for the <em>importance</em> they have, whether large or smol, because thats the real, meta importance.</p>
<p>stay shiny kids</p>
<p><code>:wq</code></p>
