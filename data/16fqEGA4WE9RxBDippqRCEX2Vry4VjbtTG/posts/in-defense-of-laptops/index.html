<p>&gt;be me<br />
&gt;friend wants to watch netflix on my laptop<br />
&gt;i don’t have sound drivers installed<br />
&gt;run out the room crying</p>

<p>this is a pretty common occurance for me. i like fuarking around with my laptop, i like trying to remove a bunch of stuff from it and get it to still work. i like funky workflows.</p>
<p><em>fizzityucking</em> sue me.</p>
<p>in a world of beaten up twenty-fourteen macbooks sporting the same selection of stickers, theres something comfy about having a shitty laptop.</p>
<p>when everyone has the same operating system, the same set of programs, the same everything, theres something comfy about being different.</p>
<p>my name is shaun, and i have a shitty samsung series nine.</p>
<p>the hardware support is shit.</p>
<p>the case is almost coming apart because ive lost a bunch of screws.</p>
<p>it overheats like a fothermucker.</p>
<p>it sports <strong><em>two</em></strong>, count ’em <strong><em>two</em></strong> “Lainpad” stickers, black electrical tape over all the branding, and one of those rectangular OS stickers that says “vim”.</p>
<p>software wise, not a lot works.</p>
<p>it runs NixOS and it sorta works for a couple of things. anything else i make do.</p>
<p>it is a piece of shit, but i love it. it has character, it has its flaws.</p>
<p>its a person in a world of laptops resembling carbon copy celebrities.</p>
<p>it is a flawed individual who is aware of its shortcomings, in a world of laptops that like to think they’re the hero of their own story.</p>
<p>it is mine, and i love it.</p>
<p>im sorry for the stuff ive put it through, but its become a stronger person for it.</p>
<p>thank you shitty laptop.</p>
