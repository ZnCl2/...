        <p><strong><em>WARNING</em></strong></p>
<p>im fuarking angry. this is going to be a hate filled post. you have been warned. no wholesomeness here.</p>
<p><strong><em>END WARNING</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="i-hate-the-post-office">i hate the post office</h2>
<p>so so so so so so so so so much.</p>
<p>lets get the setting sorted out here.</p>
<p>i live in a flat with about ten other people. they’re all dicks. they WILL NOT SIGN FOR ANY PACKAGE THAT IS NOT THEIRS.</p>
<p>i work 9-5 so i miss every single package delivery.</p>
<p>no worries you think, just take the little slip and go to the post office and grab ur shitty meme tshirt you ordered?</p>
<p>so lets talk about that.</p>
<h2 id="the-hours-are-fuarking-dumb">the hours are fuarking dumb</h2>
<p>the post office is open from like, 7 till 1.</p>
<p>the only way i can make those hours on a weekday is if i get up at like fuarking 6 and walk there before work and then walk all the way back to my house. im not a morning person so that sucks ass.</p>
<p>no worries you think, just go on a weekend?</p>
<h2 id="theyre-not-reliable">they’re not reliable</h2>
<p>i did that over the weekend and the postie people hadnt showed up that day so my package wasn’t there. one day wasted, you think, so what? just try again tomorrow.</p>
<p>listen here fuckface.</p>
<h2 id="the-days-are-fuarking-dumb.">the days are fuarking dumb.</h2>
<p>they are not open on sunday.</p>
<p>at. all.</p>
<p>enough fuarking said.</p>
<h2 id="just-go-the-next-week">just go the next week?</h2>
<p>no. i basically have one day a week i can check to get the package. if they’ve fucked up or i don’t wake up till 12 then im fuarked. so yeah i’ll go the next week… if i can.</p>
<h2 id="they-dont-give-a-shit.">they don’t give a shit.</h2>
<p>they give you two weeks. two weeks and then they send it back to the sender.</p>
<p>shipping to nz costs roughly several hundred dollars. fuark. you. postal service. do not send my shit back to america for fucks sake.</p>
<h2 id="just-ask-to-not-get-it-signed">just ask to not get it signed?</h2>
<p>i have. they won’t let me.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">final thoughts</h2>
<p>i have nothing but rage for the postal service. fuck you and everything you stand for. i truly truly truly hate you. i feel no remorse. die.</p>
<p><code>uh oh! nobody was home to sign! please come to your local postal office where we will tell you to go fuck yourself. have a nice day!</code></p>
