        <p>magic is real and im sure of that.</p>
<p>not much else to say really, but we’ll give it a go</p>
<h2 id="what-is-magic">what is magic</h2>
<p>magic is many different things to many different settings, however theres one description that i personally thinks captures the rough idea of most settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>magic is the act of affecting reality using your mind, in specified ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i think it’d be hard to argue this is at least <strong><em>a</em></strong> description that is acceptable, so thats the one we’re going to use.</p>
<h2 id="how-tf-is-it-real">how tf is it real</h2>
<p>magic as described 100% exists.</p>
<p>its difficult to do, but satisfying when it works.</p>
<p>its something we should all practice every day, but most people don’t.</p>
<p><strong><em>magic is having an attitude that allows you to realise your goals</em></strong></p>
<p>every time you’re suffering sbs and resolve to go outside and feel good, thats magic</p>
<p>every time you’re trying to study and you try really hard and do it, thats magic.</p>
<p>every time you stop acting like a sad cunt for a while and talk to someone and they think you’re neat, thats magic.</p>
<p>anytime your attitude is affecting reality, thats indistinguishable from magic.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">final thoughts</h2>
<p>i wish i had a spell to make me write more. i do. its called “getting off my ass and actually writing”</p>
<p>the other night i was very cold. i said “i wish i was warmer” and then i got off my ass and turned the heater on despite not being motivated to do that at all. my change in attitude granted my wish.</p>
<p>practice magic every day. its a lifesaver.</p>
