        <p>regardless of all other factors, our minds define who we are, our true identity</p>
<p>the thing behind <em>everything</em></p>
<p>how can we hope to understand the limits of our minds without first undingstanding what our mind is</p>
<p>according to physics our entire world is deterministic, if someone knew the initial state of every atom in the universe, they could apply physics to all the particles to figure out how theyll react to bumping into each other and slowly…</p>
<p>very slowly…</p>
<p>theyll progress through all time with a <em>perfect</em> model of literally everything ever</p>
<p>thats pretty fuarken overwhelming.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-us">what about us?</h2>
<p>the more or less of it is that all of our choices and even our complete mental state is the result of some function, no choice at all.</p>
<p>were all just robots on rails following a predetermined path</p>
<p>buuut also maybe not, who knows.</p>
<p>maybe the quarks really are <del>rng that wont fuck me</del> true rng, and were characters in a much shittier to live in game of dnd, played by <del>azathoth</del> <del>really azathoth</del> <del>im telling you its azathoth</del> noone</p>
<p>maybe theres <em>cool stuff</em> that exists in the sense that it has a physical result in our reality somehow, maybe even just bumping a particle, but doesnt have any <strong><em>physical presence</em></strong>, and thus we cant ever detect it outside of observing those impacts</p>
<p>hell that could even be the thing that moves the quarks</p>
<h2 id="hey-thatd-be-pretty-cool">hey thatd be pretty cool</h2>
<p>yeah wed all just be our souls or conscious or whatever playing dnd with our mates but also playing in a crappy dnd setting (outside of all of you cool friends out there, lain remembers you) for whatever reason and now our physical selves have to deal with it</p>
<p>what a dick</p>
<p>thats all folks this <del>long rambling intro</del> story has come to a close.</p>
<p>rocks fall, ACKs stop, NAK NAK NAK</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tA we get it youre a homestuck fan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh fucc</p>
<h1 id="anyway">anyway</h1>
<p>so i had a thought about where our thoughts come from that i thought was pretty neat, although probably proven wrong pretty easily by people who have seen all of rick and morty</p>
<p>im sorry pals my <del>torrent</del> legally bought copy of</p>
<pre><code>&lt;strong &lt;?php
print &quot;how do i print something i dont know the syntax&quot;
return ricardoSoundingWord ++ &quot; &amp; &quot; ++ mariatiSoundingWord
/?php&gt; /strong&gt;</code></pre>
<p>was missing one episode, so im forever destined to be a dumbass</p>
<h2 id="what-deterministic-universe-means-for-us">what deterministic universe means for us</h2>
<p>if our thoughts and decisions are all accounted for by physics, deterministically, then the key is that our thoughts exist as a function of the changes in our brains physical state</p>
<p>our determininistic thoughts are all basically a side effect of existing in the fourth dimension</p>
<p>maybe we could learn to exist in that layer alone, the one that exists in the changes and shape of time, how everythings changing</p>
<p>if we could somehow exist, the entirety of our mind, in this layer that is the sole thing we were missing in order to not be still, thoughtless snapshots, then thatd be pretty cool</p>
<p>we could all live forever without fear of decaying away or dying or anything</p>
<p>if our current thoughts are all deterministic, we could learn to encode them into this layer, and <strong><em>upload</em></strong> them so to speak</p>
<p>a true ascension</p>
<h2 id="what-about-thought">what about thought?</h2>
<p>theres a few thoughts about this</p>
<ul>
<li>the way time moves us is still determininistic</li>
<li>its not :shrug:</li>
</ul>
<p>if its deterministic still that could be bad, wed still have no free will, and we could never die, but itd still be cooler than where we are now i think (ironically)</p>
<p>the worst would be that we cant function properly with the “programming” we have, without the appropriate enviroment, and we all become basically brain dead without input, and retreat away into the smallest mind anything could possibly have</p>
<p><strong><em>oof</em></strong></p>
<p>buuuut maybe the flow of time is influenced by those cool quarks too and were now in tgs favourite…</p>
<p><strong><em>Free Form Roleplay</em></strong>, <strong>Roleplay</strong></p>
<p>meta right? maybe people could get to choose, and wed all be gods that create realities and program ourselves into certain situations to see how it plays out</p>
<p>good on them thats pretty rad actually</p>
<p>hell we could be in one of those now</p>
<p>maybe we actually do have true free will, and its just something we havent found the reason for yet</p>
<h2 id="fin">fin</h2>
<p>thought it was a neat thought, being able to exist solely on that dimension that gives us thought, at least in a physics-esque world</p>
<p>at the very least it would make a cool setting for a story</p>
<p><code>:if my blogs bad its because of the quarks i cant help it haha:</code></p>
