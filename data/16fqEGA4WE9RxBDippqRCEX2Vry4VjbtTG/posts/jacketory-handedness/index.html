        <h2 id="a-story">a story</h2>
<p>i recieved my favourite jacket for my thirteenth birthday. it was a semi-cheap fake leather jacket from a surf shop - which, for whatever reason, was the best place to get a fake leather jacket in my country in the years of 2010-2011 only. i am unsure why.</p>
<p>the important thing about the jacket, among other things, was that it was symmetrical (aside from a single, badly placed pocket on the left breast) - the importantance of this will be made clear by the end of this post.</p>
<p>i wore this jacket for many many years until the fake leather began to completely chip away and i was forced to purchase a new jacket, and, having now my own salary, went for something a bit nicer. thats right, this new jacket had the following features that to my bogan mind were absolutely <strong><em>fizzityucking stellar</em></strong>;</p>
<ul>
<li>real leather (probably)</li>
<li>brown leather (so stylish)</li>
<li>neato horizontal stitching on the arms (feel like a pilot)</li>
<li>a button flap thingy on the neck (assymetrical is neat)</li>
</ul>
<p>so for the most part i was pretty stoked with this jacket, save for <strong>ONE THING</strong></p>
<h2 id="but-first-some-back-story">but first! some back-story</h2>
<p>there are a couple of important things to note about myself before we continue:</p>
<ul>
<li>i am left handed<br />
always have been, most likely always will be<br />
</li>
<li>my preferred medium of transporting my belongings is a satchel<br />
i cannot walk with balance if i am wearing a regular back-pack</li>
</ul>
<p>so with this in mind lets talk about the problem with this jacket, which i hope one day someone will take into account.</p>
<p><strong><em>as a left handed satchel user, i have the strap on my left shoulder</em></strong></p>
<p>the reasoning for this is somewhat simple in my opinion, this configuration leaves my dominant hand next to the bag part, for which i require the strength to maneuver it when heavy. next upside is that it leaves my more finesse-focussed hand to rummage through said satchel.</p>
<p>a good system if i do say so myself.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">the problem:</h2>
<p>as this new jacket is asymmetrical, it has a single inside pocket, on the left breast. the aforementioned button flap thingy is also sits near the left clavicle, and these create two main, related problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>i cannot reach into the breast pocket without having to move my satchel strap out of the way<br />
and<br />
</li>
<li>the strap pushes the button thingy into my clavicle which is uncomfortable</li>
</ul>
<p>and both of these things could have been easily prevented had they created a line of this jacket for left handed people, that was mirrored.</p>
<h2 id="closing-statements">closing statements</h2>
<p>i will confess, i have not done any research into this topic. they may sell left handed jackets already, they may not. i do not know</p>
<p>what i do know is that the hallensteins i purchased this jacket from, as well as specifically fuarking me over by saying i would not need to sign for the package, and then requiring me to sign for the package, also did not stock any left handed jackets.</p>
<p>time to bounce, keep on keeping on nyâ€™all, and seeya round.</p>
