        <p>having wires hanging out of your everyday clothes makes you really cool and theres nothing you can say to tell me otherwise. believe it.</p>
<h2 id="cool-soykaf">cool soykaf</h2>
<p>having heaps of wires means you have a tonne of stuff you need wires to connect to, and that means you have a lot of cool shit you carry around on the reg which is rad.</p>
<p>having a tonne of music stuff? awesome.</p>
<p>having a fizzityucking computer on you? so cool.</p>
<p>so this is something i can appreciate.</p>
<h2 id="wackos">wackos</h2>
<p>normal people donâ€™t want to walk around like that for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>they dont like being weird</li>
<li>they dont wanna fuark around with tech</li>
</ul>
<p>and both of these are bad things.</p>
<p>be weird, be interesting, mess around with new tech (to you)</p>
<p>thats how you learn and thats how you discover.</p>
<p>it also means you know enough about the tech to need such a setup, and having a cool setup in anything makes you a fan of the hobby, which is what you need. it makes you interesting, it gives you opinions, it means youve passed the test. embrace it.</p>
<h2 id="short-post-boo">short post boo</h2>
<p>not much else to say, wires are rad because it makes you a cool weirdo, and i can appreciate that.</p>
<p>also i can pretend im in lain</p>
