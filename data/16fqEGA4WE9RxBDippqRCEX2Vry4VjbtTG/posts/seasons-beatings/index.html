<p>so another years down, and tbh i had a pretty neato year in some aspects.</p>
<p>the main aspect of that was i spent a lot more time with one of my best friends lunarised, as well as made another new friend mouse_ears.</p>
<h2 id="cool-shit">cool shit</h2>
<p>we did a lot of cool shit this year, and that sorta shit is what gets you through the hard times.</p>
<p>work was a little tough, and life was a little tough, but thanks to mouse_ears, and lunar specifically, i made it through.</p>
<p>no matter what good things happened this year, my main memory is gonna be sitting at starcucks doing unixy shite, and sitting at the gardens smoking with my buds</p>
<p>(and also lunar playing duvet on guitar)</p>
<h2 id="the-future">the future</h2>
<p>im hoping to get some weekly tabletop roleplaying games in next year, and no matter what i think that’ll be a lot of fun and a good way to get everyone to meet up.</p>
<p>im also, in under 24 hours, moving into me and lunars new flat, something ive been waiting all year for</p>
<p>jazhaus is its name and being the sickest shit this side of richard o’keefe’s house is its game.</p>
<h2 id="peaco-outto">peaco outto</h2>
<p>chur tu meke to my mate lunar, and all my other mates, for the great year.</p>
