        <p>if theres one thing im not too bad at, its thinking up half baked armchair psychology rants to do with why i hate working and capitalism and computers and so on and so on</p>
<p>so you know what this blog really needs?</p>
<p><del>css that isnt ass</del></p>
<p><del>content that isnt ass</del></p>
<p>you guessed it, another half baked armchair psychology rant!</p>
<h2 id="work-life-balance">work life balance</h2>
<p>is a meme, pure and simple.</p>
<p>you wouldn’t go around bragging</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ahh yes, i actually have a pretty good getting bitten by spiders all day / applying antivenom to myself balance!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yet for some reason, having a good balance between <em>living your life</em> and <em>being obligated to perform labour for someone else in order to not die</em> is seen as a good thing?</p>
<p>it got me thinking about, ya’know, <strong><em>life</em></strong> and all that and really, makes me a lil sad fam ngl</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;home-made freedom respecting alternative to alexa&gt; this is so sad, play twilight by boa</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="take-4-replicate-t2">take 4 $ replicate T2</h2>
<p>the conspiracy nut in me wants to make a statement along the lines of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the powers that be purposely impose current late-stage capitalism in order to keep the everyperson employed for as long as possible in order to diminish their ability to find purpose elsewhere in life</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the regular person in me wants to make a statement along the lines of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a by-product of our current work focus is that the everyperson has lost the ability to gain meaningful purpose outside of career advancement slash financial goals slash corporate goals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and finally the actual smart rational part of me wants to make a statement along the lines of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the powers that be purposely impose current late-stage capitalism in order to keep the everyperson employed for as long as possible in order to diminish their ability to find purpose elsewhere in life</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="we-get-it-you-cant-take-care-of-yourself-ta">we get it you cant take care of yourself tA</h2>
<p>“work life balance” is hard to grok because really, a lot of your life part of that balance is influenced by work</p>
<p>at work you (theoretically) arent allowed to do stuff for yourself, outside of the small percentage of the time you get allocated to eat food, and however long you can feasibly spend with your phone on the toilet</p>
<p>in that last sentence i mean something totally not along the lines of (in the unlikely chance i actually get this right)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>punji su’u mi selbeifonxa kei lo vimstizu ko</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as in, “with your phone, on the toilet” as opposed to “with your phone physically placed upon the toilet” but hey, if thats how you wanna spend your time at work then you have my respect for doing something odd during worktime, carry on comrade o7</p>
<p>but my actual point, however, is that once you get out of work youre;</p>
<ul>
<li>tired as fuark</li>
<li>obligated to buy and cook food so you dont die</li>
<li>obligated to do a bunch of cleaning so you dont turn into a slob</li>
<li>obligated to do so much stuff in preperation for the next day</li>
</ul>
<p>repeat for almost three quarters of the week, until you get a measly two days to <strong><em>actually live your life</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="still-havent-made-an-actual-point-friend">still havent made an actual point, friend</h2>
<p>we as people are losing our ability to make our own way in the world, and achieve a purpose that isnt related to corporatism or something work related.</p>
<p>we lose so much of our lives doing something that does not further our own purpose on this planet, and for the most part, people dont really think its a huge problem.</p>
<p>we have made so many incredible advances in technology, yet the everyperson doesnt see them, and despite this were still working eight hour days like we always have (and in some countries, eight hour days would be something they would be ecstatic to have)</p>
<p>we need to learn how to actually <strong><em>live</em></strong> again, how to have meaningful goals that arent related to the corporate power of someone else</p>
<p>we need to do what we can to break this cycle and enter a new age of enlightenment where we, and i know this is a pretty crazy idea but hear me out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>use our advancements in technology to make peoples lives easier and higher quality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then we might just be able to learn how to have actual dreams again, rather than our dreams just being “i want out of this rat race”</p>
