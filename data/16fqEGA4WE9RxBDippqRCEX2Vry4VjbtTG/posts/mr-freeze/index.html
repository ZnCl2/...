<p>the hit vidya game <em>life is strange</em> is something i’ve never played myself and have no intention to but i keep hearing about it from strangers and frens alike.</p>
<p>fun fact about the game is that its actually named after the phrase <strong>life is rough soykaf</strong> which i and presumably mr life in strange have heard thirty trillion times from a hundred million different people, yup thats right, you hear this thing roughly</p>

<p>no im not, im tA and you really should know that.</p>
<p>the point of this is occasionally we all need to sit back, relax and <del>complain about netfuxxs handling of neon genesis evangelion</del> realise something</p>

<p>thats because as im writing this im paying most of my attention to programming something that would <em>literally</em> blow fourteen year old tA’s mind wide open.</p>
<p>im busy working on card games that younger me woulda thought was the coolest thing ever.</p>
<p>if younger me could see my computer right now, theyd both have zero clue what they were looking at, and probably think it was the most elegant thing theyd ever seen.</p>
<p>whats the moral of this? surely its obvious</p>
<blockquote>
<p>young tA has zero clue what something elegant looking really is</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but also</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you’re actually much cooler than you think you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fin">fin</h2>
<p>basically, we’re all too hard on ourselves all the time and we should take a step back and admire the ways in which we’re actually pretty fuarking computers.</p>
<p>no matter how dumbass you think you are, theres always gonna be <em>something</em> that younger you woulda thought was awesome, and honestly, if you stop self deprecating for just a little, you’ll probably find something that current you thinks is pretty radical too.</p>
