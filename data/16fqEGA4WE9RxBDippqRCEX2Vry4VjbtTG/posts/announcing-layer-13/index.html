<p><strong>ilovela.in</strong> is no longer running, and we have moved to <a href="https://welovela.in">welovela.in</a> instead, running on different software, but with all the same cool peeps. The article here has been left unmodified apart from this disclaimer.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ego is up and running!</p>
<p>Layer 13 of the Protocol Seven System</p>
<p>Layer 13 - hosted at <a href="https://ilovela.in">ilovela.in</a> - is my Mastodon instance.</p>
<p><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> is a twitter-like social network, and it has a couple of neat points to it:</p>
<h3 id="open-source">open source</h3>
<p>what more could you ask for? free as in freedom and free as in beer, and piece of mind if you’re tinfoil hat enough to be able to read through all the code and make sure no-ones spying on you.</p>
<h3 id="decentrilised">decentrilised</h3>
<p>anyone can run their own instance of Mastodon, and all instances can communicate with each other as if it were one large social network.</p>
<hr />
<p>there aren’t too many people on my instance currently, so feel free to join and chat. once we start following people in other instances (or if anyone is running a larger instance and is fine with relaying for me) we’ll start to see more and more of the wider network.</p>

<p><strong><em>Layer 13 - Ego</em></strong></p>
<p>Battlefield the first for our public image</p>
<p>The first and last front</p>
<p>The unique combination of meatspace and the wired</p>
<p>Yearning to leave but needing to stay</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But then where is the real me, after all is said and done?<br />
Oh, there is no real me.<br />
I guess that’s it.</p>
