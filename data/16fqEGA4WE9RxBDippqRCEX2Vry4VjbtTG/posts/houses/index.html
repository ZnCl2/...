        <p>i sit in my <em>house</em>. my <em>home</em>. my little corner of reality. i have everything i use on a daily basis here, i have all of my things. its comfy and its mine.</p>
<p>i decide i wanna talk to my friend lunar, so i go to my window, and i send out a bunch of numbers. they fly to his house, say they’re from me, tell him what i want. later lunar sends back his own numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“howdy chief”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we go like back and forth like this all night.</p>
<h3 id="interlude">interlude</h3>
<p>i need some code. i send some numbers to my other room, the one across the world. they take my key and get in the front door, and send back my old things.</p>
<p>these things? they’re just numbers.</p>
<p>numbers and logic and magic, creations of my own, spurred on by thousands of conversations, numbers sent out, blips in the dark.</p>
<h3 id="interlude-1">interlude</h3>
<p>and all night and all day we send out our numbers, our blips</p>
<p>we seek those like us</p>
<p>we shape our identity, our unique series of blips and bloops</p>
<p>we live on as long as we’re heard, as long as we get numbers back.</p>
<p>thats all we can do</p>
<p>thats all we want</p>
<p>lets all love lain.</p>
