<p>or "how i learnt to stop worrying and love learning</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the number of times ive been told something along the lines of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but tA, that &lt;technology or field of knowledge&gt; is useless! why bother learning that when you could learn &lt;boring technology or field of knowledge&gt; instead?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>almost rivals the number of times i get told</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i swear to &lt;deity of choice&gt; tA if this is another dumbass soykaffy niche thing again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and honestly? that makes me a little sad.</p>
<h2 id="learning-for-learnings-sake">learning for learnings sake</h2>
<p>as shitty and problematic as this world may be, there are <em>some</em> good things to it, one of which is the <strong><em>webnets</em></strong></p>
<p>and as shitty and problematic as the webnets may be, its core value is pretty astounding</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lets give people the ability to look up literally any knowledge they can think of in seconds from their pocket nearly anywhere on the planet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we in the business like to call that <em>pretty fizzityucking rad as soykaf</em> and honestly thats what it is</p>
<p>which makes me sad, when we see so much /advertising/ in our free knowledge</p>
<h2 id="sponsored-content">sponsored content</h2>
<p>idris 2 is a really cool and neat language being developed by <del>a literal god</del> a literal god, Edwin Brady.</p>
<p>and it’ll probably never be used in any production system outside of some fringe projects using it because they <em>want</em> to.</p>
<p>and you know why? because people only want to hire javascript devs, or php devs, or python devs, and in three years it’ll be go devs, and thats it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>whats the point of learning idris 2 if you cant get a job in it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is something ive heard a lot when <del>talking</del> ranting to people about it.</p>
<p>and you know what? i think theres a lot of point to it</p>
<h2 id="hes-got-a-point-there">he’s got a point there!</h2>
<p>one thing im big on is that the collective we, as a species, should be doing our best to learn and do and act as we want to, as we <strong><em>truly</em></strong> want to.</p>
<p>our personality, and our identity, is in a large part influenced by what we choose to assciate ourselves with, and what we practice (or choose not to practice).</p>
<p>learning new things, or more accurately, choosing to learn new things, really says a lot about ourselves.</p>
<p>so what does it say when your metric for what you choose to learn is primarily influenced by <em>how useful to the corporate efforts</em> it can make you?</p>
<h2 id="zaa-do-simlu-lo-jimpe">za’a do simlu lo jimpe</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>uau nai do simlu lo stace nanmu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i, tiornoAiovanna, have a dream</p>
<p>that one day, i will not get mercilessly made fun of for wanting to learn lojban, or any of the other cool neat things i want to learn, simply because its not something i can find a job in.</p>
<p>day by day, slowly, we’ll begin to the mollusk ourselves off of this dependency on corporate validation, and the knowledgesphere will be in balance again, not filled with what are essentially advertisements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>learn this thing and you’ll make BIG DOLLARYDOOS!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>its a dopamine trap set up to both generate useful wageslaves, and reduce the liklihood of competing technologies gaining traction.</p>
<h2 id="lo-fanmo">lo fanmo</h2>
<p>get back into the habit of learning for learnings sake.</p>
<p>anything can be useful, as long as you have the will to enjoy using it.</p>
<p>do not fall prey to this subtle power structure, there are millions upon billions of cool things in this world, and many of them fall outside of “things that are employable”</p>
<p>peace out friends</p>
