        <p>howdy one and all, to my inaugural post.<br />
what follows is a list of potentially somewhat obscure feelings, that instill a subtle, non-zero amount of joy in me, without reaching levels for me to register them as good feelings.</p>
<p>without further ado:</p>
<h2 id="lowercase-letters">lowercase letters</h2>
<p>much, i imagine, to the disgust of my english teacher mother, i really enjoy writing entirely in lowercase when i can. i believe it started on irc as a homestuck style (yet subtle enough to not give away being trash) quirk for some sense of identity that was seperate to having an actual personality.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-y-emoji-outside-of-facebook">using the (y) emoji outside of facebook</h2>
<p>on facebook, using <code>(y)</code> will produce a thumbs up emoji that is different to the current readily and easily avaliable one, so already it’s pretty nice. theres something completely different about using it outside of facebook. i once met someone on discord who did the same thing. i have not talked to them since, nor can i remember their name, but i consider them a friend in the same way i consider anyone who uses dvorak a friend</p>
<h2 id="the-jazzy-bit-in-the-middle-of-fluffs-travels-by-phish">the jazzy bit in the middle of Fluff’s Travels by Phish</h2>
<p>shouldn’t really need an explanation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q54O03orQ4s">Fluffhead // Fluff’s Travels</a> is such a good two piece and the jazz bit is the best part.</p>
<h2 id="the-following-dialog-from-the-point-1971">the following dialog from “The Point (1971)”</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“if everything has a point, then i must have one too”<br />
“he’s got a point there!”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="swatch-internet-time-in-my-shell-prompt">swatch internet time in my shell prompt</h2>
<p>one day there’ll be enough of us to make swatch beats a standard, until then i’ll just await the day my pebble battery dies and i have to go back to a normal watch</p>
<h2 id="people-you-know-not-noticing-you-in-public">people you know not noticing you in public</h2>
<p>all the upsides of being a social person and realising you know a lot more people than you think you do, but with none of the downsides of actually having to talk to people and take your headphones off</p>
<h2 id="half-assed-projects">half-assed projects</h2>
<p>…of which this post is included. one day i’ll finish something and maintain it, but until then theres something comfy about looking into <code>~/projects</code> and finding about seven variations on <code>ta_sdl_game_engine</code> dating back to highschool</p>
<hr />
<p>hopefully you enjoyed these half assed ramblings. until next time, peace out, ima’ bounce, and carry on my dudes.xvid.h264.mkv</p>
