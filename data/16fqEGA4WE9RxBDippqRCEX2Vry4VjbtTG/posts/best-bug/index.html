        <p>my pal and i accidentally introduced a bug in our code that sorta took up a personality of its own, heres the story.</p>
<h1 id="the-setting">the setting</h1>
<p>at university comp sci, me and my buddy entered a programming contest that was run by a health company. it was free, and we thought we might be able to get some of the prizes.</p>
<p>the goal was to create an engine to play last card, and all the entries would be run against each other and ranked.</p>
<p>this was in about two hours in one of the uni labs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pretty boring stuff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it had that yellow glow of the lights as well, because it was getting dark outside.</p>
<h1 id="the-fun">the fun</h1>
<p>we started implementing a pretty basic card counting thing, and to pass the time a bit were talking about our ‘ai’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>its super good at card games, even the basic ones</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>its like outta yugioh, its kaiba or something</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>yeah jojos poses every turn, better than the rest</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>etc etc</em></p>
<p>so we finished up after…</p>
<p><strong><em>having to deal with whatever maven is</em></strong></p>
<p>i still dont understand the hundred different package management things, why do they have to keep changing? <code>/rant over</code></p>
<h1 id="uh-oh">uh oh</h1>
<p>we ended up placing second, losing to the guy that already worked for the company running the event.</p>
<p>we lost points because we didnt understand the state format correctly, but i believe we understand it right.</p>
<p>what theyd done is <del>super gross</del> <del>logically wrong</del> had any collection of cards as the java version of <code>Maybe Cards</code> such that rather than an empty list being <code>[]</code>, the whole thing was a <code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<p>a collection of cards that has zero cards in it is still a set, and therefore should be represented by <code>[]</code> or equivilent. <code>/rant over</code></p>
<p>the affect of this on ol` kaiba boi (aka kAIba which added to the charm) was that if it was the first player of a game, it would crash, timeout and the game manager would default to a pass.</p>
<h1 id="neato-bug">neato bug</h1>
<p>this cemented the persona of this bug to be a kaiba-esque dramatic dickhead, threatening to fall off buildings if he loses, but saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>huh! first player advantage? thats for <strong>noobs</strong>, you take it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and yeeting the other player first turn.</p>
<h1 id="fin">fin</h1>
<p>memorable bugs are the best kind of bugs, and have a life all of their own. part of the magic of programmation is finding these so you gotta pay attention.</p>
<p><code>:wq</code></p>
