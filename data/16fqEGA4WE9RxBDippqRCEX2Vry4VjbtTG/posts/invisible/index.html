        <p>everyone is connected.</p>
<p>we live in a world of invisible connections;<br />
peoples’ relationships<br />
peoples’ thoughts<br />
peoples’ interactions.</p>
<p>metaphorical connections.</p>
<p>we also live in a world of <strong><em>literal</em></strong> invisible connections.</p>
<p>connections that ironically, are more metaphorical than literal.</p>
<p>we are all connected by rocks that think and send invisible signals because of the logic that we spoke to them.</p>
<p>and thats pretty fuarking stellar.</p>
<p>i often wish that was all the connection we had.</p>
<p>because these invisible connections often feel more real than what we experiance daily in the real world.</p>
<p>our real world selves require so much maintenance, and that leads to requirements for nutrition, sustainence, shelter.</p>
<p>give my consciousness an internet connection and it would be happy.</p>
<p>our real world selves require so much physical sensation. it dirties relationships and drives hatred in all interactions. its unclean.</p>
<p>give my invisible connection a signal in return and it would be happy.</p>
<p>the real world is so beget around <strong>status</strong>, status is the be all and end all, fame and money drives all. the only important part of something is its <em>financial value</em> and if we have to destroy other standards or monopolize then so be it.</p>
<p>give my mind knowledge and it would be happy.</p>
<p>let us celebrate self learning, mindless tinkering, hosting because <strong><em>thats what you feel like doing</em></strong>.</p>
<p>our invisible connections are pure, unsullied, <strong>genuine</strong>.</p>
<p>we see people fantasising about godhood, for power, to be in control.</p>
<p>i want to be a god so that i can tinker all day without fear of being homeless, or hungry, or alone.</p>
<p>as a very good friend likes to say, keep your realities seperate.</p>
<p>we don’t want to sully the only good thing we have left.</p>
<p>thank you invisible connections, i love you all.</p>
