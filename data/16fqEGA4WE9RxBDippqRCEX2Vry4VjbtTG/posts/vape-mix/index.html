        <p>vaporizer tank manuals suggest that you should <em>completely</em> clean out one flavour of liquid before putting in a new one.</p>
<p>there are probably some <strong>jolly solid reasons</strong> for suggesting this, but in the name of being pretentious im going to throw that advice out the window and <strong><em>mix thos mfers together</em></strong></p>
<p>sort of.</p>
<p>my preferred solution is to wait until the tank is almost empty, then just refill it.</p>
<p>no mixing or anything, just one flavour, a weird mix of the two, and the new one.</p>
<p>sorta like the border inbetween the flavours of neopolitan ice cream.</p>
<p>except because this is a liquid, they sort of mix together slightly creating a <strong>smooth transition</strong> between the two.</p>
<p>and that gets me onto the next reason:</p>
<h2 id="why">why</h2>
<p>the media drills into us that our lives, our problems, are episodic in nature. discreet occurances that are containerised off from each other.</p>
<p>you have a problem, you fix it, repeat next week.</p>
<p>we view our lives as series of distinct things, like episodes or plot arcs, like they aren’t all entangled in a way that would make you a god if you could untangle.</p>
<p>i do not believe this is true</p>
<p>our lives are a constant shift of emotions and experiences, at any one time you are being affected by any number of links to these “episodic occurances”, no matter how small.</p>
<p>mixing vape juice to get a slow but noticable transition from one to the other reminds me to keep on trucking.</p>
<p>life will change, no matter how things seem to stick.</p>
<p>its important to think positive, because you can’t just wait till next saturday morning and change your headspace completely.</p>
<p>and above all…</p>
<p>im lazy and cbf cleaning out the tank properly</p>
