<p>i get by with a little help from my friends</p>

<p>having a cool team of peepos is great, and i think it does a lot to form our digital identities.</p>
<h2 id="digital-identity">digital identity</h2>
<p>is one of the most important things. i maintain this.</p>
<p>our digital identities are who we <strong><em>really</em></strong> are inside, and its important to not neglect them.</p>
<p>not experimenting with them is on par with neglect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>so what?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hanging with a group of friends who are like you is prime environment to do <em>whatever the fuark you want</em>, and see a response that is completely free from societal bias.</p>
<p>this is good. this is what we want, this is how we grow.</p>
<h2 id="introspection">introspection</h2>

<p>i get high with a little help from my friends</p>
</blockquote>
<p>your friend group are going to be somewhat similar to you. this is good.</p>
<p>if you can isolate the parts of your friends that are like you, and you observe that, youâ€™ll do wonders for figuring out how you think.</p>
<p>this helps out digital identity, its one of the most important things you can do for yourself, do not neglect it.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">final thoughts</h2>
<p>friends that share your interests and ideals are hard to come by, but great once you do. the kind of friends that will pick you up and hang out for no reason other than something to do.</p>
<p>the kind of friends that will encourage and appreciate any project you start, regardless of how shitty or easy it is</p>
<p>the kind of friends that help you grow.</p>
<p>thank you for helping me get by, friends.</p>
