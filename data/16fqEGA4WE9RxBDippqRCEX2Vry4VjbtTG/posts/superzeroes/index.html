        <p>superheroes arent real. Its something that hurts to think about sometimes, but its true.</p>
<p>super powered individuals may be, hopefully (or not, people suck after all) but the real <del>meat</del> mushroom and potatoes of this post is to do with the lesser powered heroes, its just harder to come up with a funny title for them.</p>
<p>this was inspired by someone who up until recently i would have considered a hero, or at least someone to look up to in certain ways, but not anymore.</p>
<p>this is going to be a bit of a short rant, you have been warned.</p>
<h2 id="war-ship">war ship</h2>
<p>celebrity worship is weird, and heroes are weird too.</p>
<p>if youre famous enough people seem to think that youre automatically a good person, and if youre a good person in some areas, people seem to think that means youre good in other areas also.</p>
<p>its odd, because if anyone you know in real life does something bad, or even something thats not bad but you disagree with, your first thought is something along the lines of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what a dickhead</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but for the people we look up to, we start to try and find ways to justify it, or claim that its not as bad for <em>some reason</em> but i think, we really shouldnt.</p>
<h2 id="outrage-but-a-pun-title">outrage but a pun title</h2>
<p>i feel outrage and callout culture in general is something thats not good, it creates divides between the people, it creates a feeling of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you fuck up once, thats it, you’re done</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which i feel is counter-intuitive to teaching people to be better people.</p>
<p>however.</p>
<p>that is not a free pass to be forgiven for shitty things youve done, and that is not a free pass to have people automatically try to defend you regardless of whats happening.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-us">what about us?</h2>
<p>back in primary school, i would look up to the older kids and think they were the biggest people in the world.</p>
<p>back in highschool, i would look up to the seniors and think they were the most grown up people ever.</p>
<p>when i was a kid, i used to think people at university were the smartest people in the world.</p>
<p>turns out i was wrong about all of them.</p>
<p>thats a little depressing, sure, but its also positive.</p>
<p>ive come to realise that in a lot of things, ive come to grow into a person i once would have looked up to and thought was the coolest person in the world.</p>
<p>i was wrong, but it means we’re always growing.</p>
<p>there is no place for hero worship in a world where we can, and constantly are, learning new things every day, and striving to be better than we were before, and making sure we follow our own ethos to the best of our ability.</p>
<p>celebrity worship creates divides, it makes perfectly doable tasks seem like insurmountable chasms, because in order to do something we would <em>“have to be as smart as so and so”</em>, which is true, to an extent.</p>
<p>but we <strong><em>can</em></strong> be that smart, and we’re not as far away as we think.</p>
<h2 id="fin">fin</h2>
<p>be your own heroes, strive to be the best you think you can be, rather than striving to be someone who already exists.</p>
<p>and remember, every time it turns out someone you thought was a hero, isnt.</p>
<p>thats just another time youve proven to yourself, that you’re better than you ever thought you could be.</p>
