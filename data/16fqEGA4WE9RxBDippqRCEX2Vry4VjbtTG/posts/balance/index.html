        <p>when i dont have anything to write about, i feel stuck. the point of this blog, or rather, what this blog devolved to very quickly, was to put forward whatever was on my mind that day.</p>
<p>if theres nothing to put forward, im stagnating.</p>
<p>if theres nothing to discuss, im falling behind.</p>
<p>if theres nothing to rant about, im boring.</p>
<p>but if theres too much to write about, then none of it gets the attention it deserves.</p>
<p>its all about <em>balance</em></p>
<h2 id="the-weirdo-swarm">the weirdo swarm</h2>
<p>one such balance ive noticed in life is the <strong><em>weirdo / normie</em></strong> ratio.</p>
<p>life is more fun when youre a weirdo, you get to talk about cooler stuff, do better shit, im a proud member of the weirdo swarm and for that im not sorry.</p>
<p>but as much as it pains me to say, being a normie has its advantages.</p>
<p>life is a balancing act between doing what we love (being a weirdo) and doing what society (yada yada rise up blah blah) tells us is normal, as such to gain the benefits society has to offer, such as social integration.</p>
<h2 id="header-two">header two</h2>
<p>balancing between work and play, too little (non-corporate) work and you never grow, too little play and you lose your soul and identity to capitalism.</p>
<p>balancing the want for a spyware free life, with the convenience offered by <strong>actually</strong> being able to talk to the general population on the interwebs.</p>
<p>balancing the want for solidarity with the need for companionship.</p>
<h2 id="idk">idk</h2>
<p>this was a train of thought, bought on by rampant sleep deprivation and a pretty bad bongover, so ymmv, really.</p>
<p>striking this balance is the hardest thing ive ever had to think about. every fiber of my physical form wants to minmaxx all the way to the weirdo side, but i dont fully trust thats a good idea.</p>
<p>hoping you all have an easier time deciding.</p>
<p>peace.</p>
