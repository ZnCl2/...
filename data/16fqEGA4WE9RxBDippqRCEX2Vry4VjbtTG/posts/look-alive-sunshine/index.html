        <p>quick post, but people who always try to look spotless and perfect are basically just not people tbh. hot take i know but <strong><em>whaddya gonna do ’bout it</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="human-condition-fuck-yeah">human condition fuck yeah</h2>
<p>we’re messy beings, we’re lazy and we get dirty. my sleeves constantly have a bunch of messy crap on them. my pants have smudges and stains occasionally. i have spilt a lot of stuff on everything, and on top of that i get ink stains a lot too.</p>
<p>if i spent all the time i needed to <strong>look acceptable</strong> and still maintain my lifestyle, i would not have any free time at all.</p>
<p>if i changed my lifestyle to <strong>fit in</strong> then im literally not a person anymore and id hate that.</p>
<p>thats all there is to that.</p>
<h2 id="psych-shit-idk">psych shit idk</h2>
<p>mentally, humans are not perfect. we enjoy things we shouldn’t. we do thinks we shouldnt. we like things we shouldnt.</p>
<p>why hide that?</p>
<p>if you have bags under your eyes own them.</p>
<p>if you have a bunch of wires and shit hanging everywhere then thats rad.</p>
<p>if you’re smoking in public then good on ya.</p>
<p>we’re meant to <em>bee ourselves</em> but what people really mean is <em>bee what we want you to be</em></p>
<p>and i say fuck that.</p>
<h2 id="make-the-headers-up-yourself">make the headers up yourself</h2>
<p>looking like shit constantly is a mark of honour. you don’t have to be a slob, but you don’t have to look perfect. you can take care of yourself and be hygenic, but still look like a tosser and have people give you funny looks in the street.</p>
<p>looking alive, the way <strong><em>they</em></strong> mean it, is no different than looking like a machine, like an idea (not in the good way either). like looking like something harmless, soulless and idealess.</p>
<p>in reality, looking alive means looking like your one drag away from keeling over, and honestly, thats the way it should be.</p>
