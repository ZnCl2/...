        <p>theres a lot of weirdos in this world, me included.</p>
<p>for some reason people think its, well, weird to be a weirdo, and they might be right.</p>
<p>but its something thats pretty useful, and heres why.</p>
<h2 id="prog-soykaf">prog soykaf</h2>
<p>anyone whos actually reading this is probably no stranger to programming, and therefore knows about the</p>
<p><strong><em>hundreds of thousands of millions of different ways to program</em></strong></p>
<p>concept space is infinite, and programming is unbridled choice of abstraction, given human readable form (unless you program in APL)</p>
<p>any, single, thing, that you can program, you can translate into another form and use that instead, you can repeat this as much as you want until you have an ever-moving lovecraftian blob of code.</p>
<p>and thats the beauty of programming.</p>
<h2 id="minds-eye">minds eye</h2>
<p>whatevers in your minds eye dictates how you do it.</p>
<p>you think about how this function works, and you say to the soul thats hearing your thoughts “its a bit like a phone board, like the old timey ones with the patch leads” and all of a sudden the entire programs architecture is telephone patch lead inspired.</p>
<p>we come up with all these random equivilencies that six months from now youll look at and think</p>
<blockquote>
<p>le grill? what the hell is a le grill?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and thats the beauty, thats the charm and character and poetic tism that we should be celebrating in programming.</p>
<p>i want to look at a program like you would an art piece, like you would an arthouse movie, and think</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i wonder what was going through their head in order to influence this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i want to redo older programs in different “styles” just to see how they would differ.</p>
<p>i want to find the weirdest way i can do something, just in case we learn something from it</p>
<p><del>i want it to be socially acceptable to use cool anime profile pictures on linkedin</del></p>
<p>and most importantly…</p>
<p><code>i just want my code to work :wq</code></p>
