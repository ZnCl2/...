        <p>clarification: this is not a guide to lambda calculus for idiots, this is a guide to lambda calculus written by an idiot.</p>
<p>imagine for a second you need to explain our numbering system without <strong><em>any</em></strong> background. any at all, think about that for a second.</p>
<ul>
<li>you have no idea what the number symbols mean</li>
<li>you have no idea what plus minus or anything mean</li>
<li>you have no idea of anything</li>
</ul>
<p>and this isn’t limited to just numbering, because almost anything we do on a computer is based around maths, imagine the same for pretty much literally anything.</p>
<p>what you would need is….</p>
<p><strong>is</strong>…</p>
<p><strong><em>is</em></strong>…</p>
<h2 id="a-way-to-describe-computability">a way to describe computability</h2>
<p>and one way of doing that is with lambda calculus. to define lambda calculus we need just a few rules - variables, abstraction, application.</p>
<p>these concepts aren’t too difficult, so awayyyy we go.</p>
<h3 id="variables">variables</h3>
<p>variables are simply a name, most of the time we use letters. there are two catches here, if you’re used to variables in maths or other languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>unlike pretty much every other language, lambda calc variables don’t have a value, only a name. this is because we don’t have any concept of what a value is.</p></li>
<li><p>unlike any language worth using, variables in lambda calculus do not have a <em>type</em>. again this is because we don’t have a concept of what type is.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>this guide is gonna use lowercase letters for the most part, so the examples are <code>a b c d e f</code> etc etc</p>
<h3 id="abstraction">abstraction</h3>
<p>abstractions are the functions of lambda calc, and take the form off:</p>
<pre><code>(λx.M)</code></pre>
<p>where <code>λ</code> denotes that this is a function<br />
<code>x</code> is an argument name (that is local to this function)<br />
and <code>M</code> is a list of variables that will form the function body</p>
<p>a quick example of an abstraction is the identity function:</p>
<pre><code>(λx.x)</code></pre>
<p>we’ll get onto more to do with fuctions in a bit, but next</p>
<h3 id="application">application</h3>
<p>application is what we pretentious people call “actually using a function” and it takes the form of:</p>
<pre><code>(M N)</code></pre>
<p>where <code>M</code> is an abstraction, and <code>N</code> is any lambda term at all. i will refer to <code>M</code> as an abstraction and <code>N</code> as the application body</p>
<p>to do the application we just use <code>N</code> as the argument for <code>M</code>, and then do a find and replace based on the abstraction definition.</p>
<p>for example, lets do an easy one using the identity function, which is a function that returns its input unchanged:</p>
<p>if we have the abstraction <code>(λx.x)</code> and the variable <code>y</code> to use for the application, and then lay the application out as so:</p>
<pre><code>( (λx.x) y )</code></pre>
<p>we can then begin applying.</p>
<p>the identity function has <code>x</code> as its argument, so we take the application body, in this case <code>y</code>, and every time we see <code>x</code> in the abstraction body (the bit past <code>.</code>) we replace it with our argument, <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>so our abstraction body is <code>x</code>, and <code>x</code> is equal to our argument <code>y</code>, so therefore our function will return <code>y</code>, which is the identity.</p>
<p>a sligtly more interesting example is something like:</p>
<pre><code>( (λx.xx) y )</code></pre>
<p>here, our argument to our abstraction is <code>y</code>, which gets bound to <code>x</code> in the abstraction body, which is then fed into the <code>xx</code> to produce:</p>
<p><code>yy</code></p>
<p>and thats how we go.</p>
<p>as a spoiler for what the next lambda calc post will cover, heres a bit of an example, imagine we were using the same abstraction:</p>
<pre><code>(λx.xx)</code></pre>
<p>and instead of passing it <code>y</code>, we passed it <strong>another abstraction</strong>… say, itself?</p>
<pre><code>( (λx.xx) (λx.xx) )</code></pre>
<p>here, we bind the entire abstraction <code>(λx.xx)</code> to the variable <code>x</code> in the first abstraction.</p>
<p>when we do the substitution into the body <code>xx</code> we get left with…</p>
<pre><code>( (λx.xx) (λx.xx) )</code></pre>
<p>the same thing, which means this is an <strong><em>infinite loop</em></strong></p>
<p>fun stuff fun stuff imo</p>
<h2 id="further-thoughts">further thoughts</h2>
<p>theres a lot more to go before we get to a numbering system, and at this point it may seem like theres not much use to lambda calculus, but i am not joking when i say <strong><em>anything that can be done on a computer can be written in lambda calculus</em></strong>.</p>
<p>it may be abstracted, it may be thousands of millions of pages long, but it is possible.</p>
<p>and thats what makes it so wonderful.</p>
<p>i’ll write more in depth on this at some point in the near future when i’m feeling smarter, less lazy, and don’t wanna write edgy armchair psych pieces instead.</p>
<p>peace out ny’all, if you’re unlucky i’ll talk about Nock after this.</p>
