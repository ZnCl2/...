        <p>i read an article talking about the three types of programmers (you can read it <a href="https://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/">here</a> and it got me thinking (as a pretty staunch poet tribalist)</p>
<pre><code>/me puts a dollarydoo in the &quot;talking about urbit&quot; jar</code></pre>
<p>were talking about urbit!</p>
<h2 id="the-poets-system">the poets system</h2>
<p>urbit is the operating system for the poets, its nice, its clean, its <del>esoteric</del> elegant, and most of all, its</p>
<p><strong><em>fizzityucking rad as shit</em></strong></p>
<p>but why so?</p>
<h2 id="implementation">implementation</h2>
<p>actually running your code is just an implementation detail, and thankfully for all us <del>lazy people</del> <del>bad programmers</del> <em>theory enthusiasts</em> tlon seems to think the same way.</p>
<p>how so? well the entire os is just a lisp enviroment essentially, and everything that isnt nice has been mashed into <del>a monad</del> a tree thing, with every single part of the system using that tree.</p>
<p>no more million different places to do anything, no more hundred different init systems, no more <code>conf_init(8)(42)(69)(1337)</code> and bash environment variables meta programming and storage system.</p>
<p>just nice, <del>easy to read</del> readable hoon code, throughout everything.</p>
<h2 id="prog-system">prog system</h2>
<p>the worst part about operating systems is that you have to do things in them, luckily for us, every part of the urbit system…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if i may interject for a second, what youre referring to as ‘urbit’ is actually ‘arvo/urbit’, or as ive come to call it, ‘arvo+urbit’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yeah yeah whatever, i bet youre gonna go on about getting blockchain out of your system too because you havent <del>read the docs</del> watched all of brick and mortimer.</p>
<p>the entire system is malleable using the lisp and brainfuck lovechild, hoon.</p>
<p>its incredible, its all the powers of using emacs, with the upside of not having to run emacs.</p>
<h2 id="yeah-but-what-about-my-shit">yeah but what about my shit</h2>
<p>oh no i cant live without my openlibframeworkjss of the week, i need all my <del>shit</del> shit</p>
<p>look, youre talking to someone whos having a blast with an os that is <em>literally</em> the joke about emacs being a great os that lacks a <del>decent</del> text editor.</p>
<p>no one actually appreciates an operating system as a, well, <em>system</em>, its all about word size and LDD_LINKER_PROFILE_FLAGs and whatnot.</p>
<p>its all about stuff that doesnt matter like "my system has the native ability to decrement numbers in <code>O(1)</code> time.</p>
<p>its just boring, gimme my fun, poetic system.</p>
<h2 id="fin">fin</h2>
<p>in conclusion, urbit is rad, its code is <del>scary</del> awesome, and i hope it takes off, if not for the privacy, if not for the multipass, but just so that us poets have a fun os to talk about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>beeteedubz theres a crypto also called urbit, its not that and we came first.</p>
