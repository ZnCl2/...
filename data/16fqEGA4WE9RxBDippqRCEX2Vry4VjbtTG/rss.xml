        <p>superheroes arent real. Its something that hurts to think about sometimes, but its true.</p>
<p>super powered individuals may be, hopefully (or not, people suck after all) but the real <del>meat</del> mushroom and potatoes of this post is to do with the lesser powered heroes, its just harder to come up with a funny title for them.</p>
<p>this was inspired by someone who up until recently i would have considered a hero, or at least someone to look up to in certain ways, but not anymore.</p>
<p>this is going to be a bit of a short rant, you have been warned.</p>
<h2 id="war-ship">war ship</h2>
<p>celebrity worship is weird, and heroes are weird too.</p>
<p>if youre famous enough people seem to think that youre automatically a good person, and if youre a good person in some areas, people seem to think that means youre good in other areas also.</p>
<p>its odd, because if anyone you know in real life does something bad, or even something thats not bad but you disagree with, your first thought is something along the lines of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what a dickhead</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but for the people we look up to, we start to try and find ways to justify it, or claim that its not as bad for <em>some reason</em> but i think, we really shouldnt.</p>
<h2 id="outrage-but-a-pun-title">outrage but a pun title</h2>
<p>i feel outrage and callout culture in general is something thats not good, it creates divides between the people, it creates a feeling of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you fuck up once, thats it, you’re done</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which i feel is counter-intuitive to teaching people to be better people.</p>
<p>however.</p>
<p>that is not a free pass to be forgiven for shitty things youve done, and that is not a free pass to have people automatically try to defend you regardless of whats happening.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-us">what about us?</h2>
<p>back in primary school, i would look up to the older kids and think they were the biggest people in the world.</p>
<p>back in highschool, i would look up to the seniors and think they were the most grown up people ever.</p>
<p>when i was a kid, i used to think people at university were the smartest people in the world.</p>
<p>turns out i was wrong about all of them.</p>
<p>thats a little depressing, sure, but its also positive.</p>
<p>ive come to realise that in a lot of things, ive come to grow into a person i once would have looked up to and thought was the coolest person in the world.</p>
<p>i was wrong, but it means we’re always growing.</p>
<p>there is no place for hero worship in a world where we can, and constantly are, learning new things every day, and striving to be better than we were before, and making sure we follow our own ethos to the best of our ability.</p>
<p>celebrity worship creates divides, it makes perfectly doable tasks seem like insurmountable chasms, because in order to do something we would <em>“have to be as smart as so and so”</em>, which is true, to an extent.</p>
<p>but we <strong><em>can</em></strong> be that smart, and we’re not as far away as we think.</p>
<h2 id="fin">fin</h2>
<p>be your own heroes, strive to be the best you think you can be, rather than striving to be someone who already exists.</p>
<p>and remember, every time it turns out someone you thought was a hero, isnt.</p>
<p>thats just another time youve proven to yourself, that you’re better than you ever thought you could be.</p>

    <title>Monopoly Sucks</title>

        <p><code>&lt;apologies to people who like monopoly, no offense to ny'all&gt;</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>but its an even shittier lifestyle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this rant is bought to you by my good friend <a href="https://niu.moe/@lumi">lumi</a> who bought this to my attention, and ive been thinking about it all day.</p>
<p>short rant but it needs to be said.</p>
<h2 id="microoft-winblows">micro$oft winblows</h2>
<p>it feels good that saying that phrase is old enough now to be retro, but it feels bad that we still need to say it.</p>
<p>microsoft is a shitty company, and windows basically has a literal monopoly on the market.</p>
<p>you might go on about apple, but really they’re just as bad, and a completely different problem all together but today we’re focussing our rage towards microsoft.</p>
<p>if you’re on this website you’re either:</p>
<ul>
<li>someone who hates microsoft</li>
<li>someone who knows me irl</li>
</ul>
<p>and therefore i probably dont need to go into great detail about why they suck, but heres a brief list:</p>
<ul>
<li>they actively prohibit peoples use of hardware that theyve paid for.</li>
<li>they actively spread irrational fear about non-microsoft products to trick people into using them</li>
<li>they actively capture massive amounts of user data, something that is <strong><em>literal spyware</em></strong> for their own benefits and profits, and give you a shittier, harder to use system if you dare opt out.</li>
<li>they use exploitative marketing and misinformation to make people think they need more expensive machines than they do</li>
<li>on top of that they just make really shitty and bloated software.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-cares-just-dont-use-it">who cares just dont use it</h2>
<p>thank you, i dont.</p>
<p>but this is the topic of todays rant, even though i dont use it, i still, in some sense, have to support them, and i really hate that.</p>
<p>this rage should really be aimed at laptop manufacterers too, because for some reason its actually, what we in the business like to call:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>really <strong><em>really</em></strong> fuarking hard to buy laptops that dont have windows on them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>now, this is a mild inconvenience, but its a moral issue as well, because its undermining one of the core tennants of capitalism*</p>
<p>by which of course, i mean magical capitalism that works like people say it should, and not the garbage we have today.</p>
<p>the one thing you hear all the time, that is actually somewhat decent advice for living in a corporate world</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you dont like something, vote with your wallet!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and you know what, i would.</p>
<p>…if it was possible to buy laptops that didnt come with a mandatory pat on the back for microsoft.</p>
<p>and sure, i could find somewhere to buy a laptop that doesnt have a windows preinstalled, but its difficult, its hard, and more importantly.</p>
<p>it relies on me having the know-how on how to do that.</p>
<p>and sure, i do, but how many other people who are just learning about this sort of thing do?</p>
<p>how many people <em>dont</em> know about this sort of thing because all theyve ever known is that if you dont buy a mac, it has windows on it.</p>
<p>its disgusting, its unethical, its basically a monopoly, and im tired of paying the winblows tax just because microsoft feel the need to shove their fat mouth into everything they can get a hold of.</p>
<h2 id="fin">fin</h2>
<p>no fancy outro today, fuark microsoft, and fuark the tech sector for apparently not caring about literal monopolies we have everywhere. there are other monopolies in the tech sector but thats a rant for another time.</p>
<p>today, since i cant vote with my wallet, im voting with my mouth.</p>

    <title>School's Not Cool</title>
    <link>https://regularflolloping.com/posts/schools-not-cool/index.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<article>

    <section>
        <p>short post because putting effort into school sucks and im not about to start doing it now.</p>
<p>theres one thing that ive been hearing that really bothers me quite a bit, and thats schools doing the whole</p>
<p><code>/me does that annoying fuarking nerd voice</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>accctttuaalllllyyy, we dont hate tech anymore were all cool tech people here</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and something about <em>creating a brighter future</em> for all the kids whos only care about technology is fortnite or the latest lego star wars or whatever kids are doing.</p>
<p>and theyre “allowing” kids to do work on computers and encouraging “learning computer skills” and some other stuff i cant really say without profusely vomitting, even with ironic quotations.</p>
<h2 id="thats-cool-though">thats cool though</h2>
<p>yeah it would be pretty cool, but schools are suddenly being <strong>insanely</strong> dumbass about implementing the entire thing, and i believe, in true techno-cult fashion that its harmful to the freedoms and developing brains of children and what not</p>
<p>yup yup its one of those</p>
<blockquote>
<p>please wont somebody think of the children</p>
</blockquote>
<p>times.</p>
<p>basically, rather than doing the simple thing of <em>allowing kids to bring computers</em>, and then getting them to idk, write things on the computer or something - they’re forcing people to rent laptops from the government, and refusing to allow them to bring their own computers or have any say on the software being used on that laptop</p>
<h2 id="ta-that-sounds-like-something-no-one-cares-about">tA that sounds like something no-one cares about</h2>
<p>ahh contre, i find it very hypocritical that they would do this, for a few reasons that hopefully arent completely stallman-esque.</p>
<h3 id="pa-namcu">pa namcu</h3>
<p>schools like to do everything they can to go on about how society is all good and namely how monopolies are really shitty, yet here they are quite literally <em>enforcing monopolies</em> of companies that <em>actively prey on their users</em></p>
<p>and this is probably the worst thing because it just goes so deep.</p>
<p>all of a sudden, they’re forcing people to use the adobe suite, a quite literal modern day monopoly, which preys on schools and users and other forms of education to get them to teach adobe in order to create a deadly</p>
<p><strong><em>you can only get hired if you use adobe</em></strong> loop</p>
<p>which of course is very good for adobes sales figures, and very bad for people who dont have a lot of money (like students, funnily enough) and people who care about improvements to software they will use daily, and people who want the freedom to use their own stuff.</p>
<p>on a slight tangent, adobe is also one hungry skami, and therefore people need to buy more powerful computers to run it, which again is <strong>pretty bad</strong> for people without a huge amount of money!</p>
<h3 id="re-namcu">re namcu</h3>
<p>its removing peoples freedoms to support things they agree with.</p>
<p>all modern hardware sucks ass, because its made by companies that care more about either tracking users for their own profit gains, or more about creating <del>literal security flaws</del> “secure back doors” so that the government can intrude on even more aspects of your life without your permission, than they do about actually making decent hardware.</p>
<p>vote with your wallet you may say, yet these schools are removing that vote from people by requiring them to use a specific, pre-chosen model (if your school does the rent from the government thing)</p>
<p>blurgh is all i can say to that</p>
<h3 id="ci-namcu">ci namcu</h3>
<p>im bad at writing and this is just a rehash of point one, fuccen sue me.</p>
<p>by refusing to follow open standards, thus allowing students to make their own decisions on the software they use, thus not requiring expensive, freedom restricting licenses, and specific, freedom restricting hardware (also often expensive), all schools are doing is perpetuating this culture of <strong><em>thinking its acceptable</em></strong></p>
<p>and its also not even doing their job like surely, hear me out</p>
<blockquote>
<p>schools should be teaching students how to solve problems and learn things they need to know</p>
</blockquote>
<p>not</p>
<blockquote>
<p>schools should teach a very specific way of doing things and fuark anybody who doesnt fit that mold</p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh wait thats all schools ever do anyway <code>/me shrugs</code></p>
<h2 id="fin">fin</h2>
<p>yeah all this does is force students into a singular way of thinking that does not help the industry for whatever they’re learning, the students having the freedom to choose what they run, and also costs families a tonne of money on stuff they <em>could</em> be choosing alternatives for as long as schools let them.</p>
<p>its really disgusting and basically a literal monopoly but they dont care as long as adobe and intel and windows get money.</p>
<p>incredible</p>

    <title>Sensory Overload</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<article>
    <section class="header">
        Posted on August 23, 2019
        
    </section>
    <section>
        <blockquote>
<p>this aint a dream, its a deity cursed arms race</p>
</blockquote>
<p>quite a bit, things get just a <em>little</em> too much, and it seems like theres nothing you can do and it all just weighs in.</p>
<p>i think, personally, this is in part due <strong><em>three</em></strong> things, of which we shall <del>explore</del> <del>make valid and informed points about</del> rant vaguely until i run out of things to say</p>
<h2 id="advertising">advertising</h2>
<p>this is the big one, and its absolutely <em>everywhere</em></p>
<p>every store everywhere is basically the equivilent of the old eb games joke about needing a machete to get through the banners advertising sales.</p>
<p>to be completely frank, its strikes me as incredibly masturbatory, if someone is already <strong><em>currently in</em></strong> your shop, what point is there to bombarding them with images specifically designed to prey upon their judgement</p>
<p>i repeat, when they’ve <strong><em>already decided to support your business</em></strong></p>
<p>its disgusting, its the equivilent of kicking a child when they’re down, but instead of kicking them you actually just put them in a room with flashing neon lights and yell at them until they give you a dollar in return for a cocaine habit.</p>
<p>and its not just stores, the average web page is more advertising than actual content, and that isnt me being overly poetic, the amount of data you need to download to view a webpage is majority focussed to ads, code that tracks you, and code that tracks the things you use to have it not track you</p>
<p>even small things</p>
<p>software that we use daily is so packed full of useless features that essentially only exist to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hey we added a thing please check it out so we can maybe make some more money off you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>its like they’re purposefully adding more icons and more menus than you can handle, under the guise of “needing the latest and greatest features” just to, confuse you, and make you vulnerable and feel stupid so they can easier sell you stuff you dont need.</p>
<p>and then you walk <em>outside</em> and everything is just plastered in brand names and business names, everywhere you look you cant get away from it.</p>
<p>imagine a world where everyone had their own metal bottle and cup, and stores had big versions of soda dispensors so everyone could just get some nice cheap drink of choice in the morning, without having to pay for packaging, and without causing even more garbage than there already is.</p>
<p>but <strong>no</strong>, we cant do that, because apparently its so important that people who just want a drink of something be carrying around an advertisement about what they’re drinking.</p>
<p>part of what i love about the free, libre and open source stuff movement is being able to do what i do best, <em>fucc around on computers all day</em>, without being bombarded by advertisements im not specifically making a conscious choice to see.</p>
<p>i think its something thats very <em>easy</em> to not realise the impact of, and very <em>hard</em> to get away from fully</p>
<h2 id="dopamine-traps">dopamine traps</h2>
<p>getting into conspiracy nut territory here but <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code> what’re ya gonna do i guess.</p>
<p>but basically, it feels to me like everyday parts of our lives are, as set forward by… sigh…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the society that we live in *evil gamer noises*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… explicitly set up to give us these constant upticks in short term validation, over and over again until we’re forced to continue these practices ourselves like some sort of drug fiend looking for their next hit.</p>
<p>games have become nothing more than money hungry scams, soullessly generic clones, and slash or glorified slot machines, just to get people addicted to that feeling of accomplishment.</p>
<p>i used to enjoy playing games quite a bit, in my youth i held many strong opinions on the medium (yeah i was one of those <em>actually games ARE art</em> dickheads) and thankfully there are still some new games i would consider worth playing, but for the most part, its dead to me.</p>
<p>sad times.</p>
<p>back on track though, social media and services in general seem to be designed around being one large dopamine trap too.</p>
<p>everytime you refresh youtube to see a new lot of videos</p>
<p>everytime you frantically scroll through facebook to try and refind something you saw</p>
<p>everytime netflix reccomends another thing to you without you asking</p>
<p>its all designed to trigger that reflex, get you using the service for <strong><em>just a bit longer</em></strong>, make you feel <strong><em>a little better about yourself</em></strong></p>
<p>its the software equivilent of the single worst scene in all of end of eva, except instead of realising theyre <em>so fucked up</em> people seem to be happy about it</p>
<p>its artificial hedonism that doesnt even really help the self</p>
<p>and it goes so deep as well, more and more sugar in our foods to get people feeling that rush, get them buying the type of foods <strong><em>The Powers That Be</em></strong> want them to buy.</p>
<p>the disgusting amount of celebrity worship that seems commonplace, acting as easy validation in leu of making actual connections with people.</p>
<p>its possible to physically talk to someone on the other side of the planet with minimal to zero delay, for free (both easily, and libre) and yet people are getting sucked into the dopamine trap that is <strong><em>watching people play videogames</em></strong>, ones they dont even want to play themselves</p>
<p>birbsite is an endless stream of he-said slash she-said and endless actual celebrity ego pandering and people are happy to be part of that?</p>
<p>thousands and thousands of times each day were getting hit with this little low quality bare minimum hit of validation, the absolute basics of what our monkey brains will interpret as validation and feel good about, and we need to start making a conscious effort to try and lower the amount of times this happens.</p>
<h2 id="memetic-hazards">memetic hazards</h2>
<p>memes are no joke, and memetic hazards are a real thing, something i think we’re all going to have to take a long hard think about in the coming future.</p>
<p>self propogating information is dangerous, we’ve literally turned this entities life cycle into something of a <em>hobby</em> if you can call it that, and id argue that memetic internet habits are the modern day equivilent of lowest-common-denominator television, or gossip mags, or candy.</p>
<p>and it devolves more the longer it goes on, the <em>types</em> of memetic hazards we share have basically all devolved into the same “here is a picture that represents a specific type of common feeling”, with no incentive to create, or put effort into them.</p>
<p>and yes, they can be fun, they can be entertaining, but in the same way someone can easily spend 10+ hours a day watching nothing but reality tv, its all too easy for people to lose so much of their lives to nothing but click bait, and memetic dickery, constantly resharing the same small images that thousands of others have before, no creativity, no improvisation, nothing of any real benefit except to keep this weird new lovecraftian god that is the modern day memetic hazard alive.</p>
<h2 id="fin">fin</h2>
<p>i would have mentioned the unhealthy obsession with corporatism we all seem to be stuck in, but i have done that many a time before in much shittier writing than this, so for today we’ll give you all a break from it.</p>
<p>the rest though, i think, all add up to, in ways we have difficulty noticing, brainwash ourselves into being more stressed than we need to be, more anxious about things, to feel worse in general, such that we may buy products to trigger that dopamine rush.</p>
<p>please think about the media you consume, the software you use, the things you own.</p>
<p>whoever runs the world, the 1% of the 1%, the tech giants, the elite;</p>
<p>they dont care nearly as much as theyd like us to think they do.</p>

        <blockquote>
<p>or "how i learnt to stop worrying and love learning</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the number of times ive been told something along the lines of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but tA, that &lt;technology or field of knowledge&gt; is useless! why bother learning that when you could learn &lt;boring technology or field of knowledge&gt; instead?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>almost rivals the number of times i get told</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i swear to &lt;deity of choice&gt; tA if this is another dumbass soykaffy niche thing again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and honestly? that makes me a little sad.</p>
<h2 id="learning-for-learnings-sake">learning for learnings sake</h2>
<p>as shitty and problematic as this world may be, there are <em>some</em> good things to it, one of which is the <strong><em>webnets</em></strong></p>
<p>and as shitty and problematic as the webnets may be, its core value is pretty astounding</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lets give people the ability to look up literally any knowledge they can think of in seconds from their pocket nearly anywhere on the planet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we in the business like to call that <em>pretty fizzityucking rad as soykaf</em> and honestly thats what it is</p>
<p>which makes me sad, when we see so much /advertising/ in our free knowledge</p>
<h2 id="sponsored-content">sponsored content</h2>
<p>idris 2 is a really cool and neat language being developed by <del>a literal god</del> a literal god, Edwin Brady.</p>
<p>and it’ll probably never be used in any production system outside of some fringe projects using it because they <em>want</em> to.</p>
<p>and you know why? because people only want to hire javascript devs, or php devs, or python devs, and in three years it’ll be go devs, and thats it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>whats the point of learning idris 2 if you cant get a job in it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is something ive heard a lot when <del>talking</del> ranting to people about it.</p>
<p>and you know what? i think theres a lot of point to it</p>
<h2 id="hes-got-a-point-there">he’s got a point there!</h2>
<p>one thing im big on is that the collective we, as a species, should be doing our best to learn and do and act as we want to, as we <strong><em>truly</em></strong> want to.</p>
<p>our personality, and our identity, is in a large part influenced by what we choose to assciate ourselves with, and what we practice (or choose not to practice).</p>
<p>learning new things, or more accurately, choosing to learn new things, really says a lot about ourselves.</p>
<p>so what does it say when your metric for what you choose to learn is primarily influenced by <em>how useful to the corporate efforts</em> it can make you?</p>
<h2 id="zaa-do-simlu-lo-jimpe">za’a do simlu lo jimpe</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>uau nai do simlu lo stace nanmu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i, tiornoAiovanna, have a dream</p>
<p>that one day, i will not get mercilessly made fun of for wanting to learn lojban, or any of the other cool neat things i want to learn, simply because its not something i can find a job in.</p>
<p>day by day, slowly, we’ll begin to the mollusk ourselves off of this dependency on corporate validation, and the knowledgesphere will be in balance again, not filled with what are essentially advertisements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>learn this thing and you’ll make BIG DOLLARYDOOS!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>its a dopamine trap set up to both generate useful wageslaves, and reduce the liklihood of competing technologies gaining traction.</p>
<h2 id="lo-fanmo">lo fanmo</h2>
<p>get back into the habit of learning for learnings sake.</p>
<p>anything can be useful, as long as you have the will to enjoy using it.</p>
<p>do not fall prey to this subtle power structure, there are millions upon billions of cool things in this world, and many of them fall outside of “things that are employable”</p>
<p>peace out friends</p>

        <p>if theres one thing im not too bad at, its thinking up half baked armchair psychology rants to do with why i hate working and capitalism and computers and so on and so on</p>
<p>so you know what this blog really needs?</p>

<p>you guessed it, another half baked armchair psychology rant!</p>

<p>yet for some reason, having a good balance between <em>living your life</em> and <em>being obligated to perform labour for someone else in order to not die</em> is seen as a good thing?</p>
<p>it got me thinking about, ya’know, <strong><em>life</em></strong> and all that and really, makes me a lil sad fam ngl</p>

<p>“work life balance” is hard to grok because really, a lot of your life part of that balance is influenced by work</p>
<p>at work you (theoretically) arent allowed to do stuff for yourself, outside of the small percentage of the time you get allocated to eat food, and however long you can feasibly spend with your phone on the toilet</p>
<p>in that last sentence i mean something totally not along the lines of (in the unlikely chance i actually get this right)</p>

<p>as in, “with your phone, on the toilet” as opposed to “with your phone physically placed upon the toilet” but hey, if thats how you wanna spend your time at work then you have my respect for doing something odd during worktime, carry on comrade o7</p>
<p>but my actual point, however, is that once you get out of work youre;</p>
<ul>
<li>tired as fuark</li>
<li>obligated to buy and cook food so you dont die</li>
<li>obligated to do a bunch of cleaning so you dont turn into a slob</li>
<li>obligated to do so much stuff in preperation for the next day</li>

<h2 id="still-havent-made-an-actual-point-friend">still havent made an actual point, friend</h2>
<p>we as people are losing our ability to make our own way in the world, and achieve a purpose that isnt related to corporatism or something work related.</p>
<p>we lose so much of our lives doing something that does not further our own purpose on this planet, and for the most part, people dont really think its a huge problem.</p>
<p>we have made so many incredible advances in technology, yet the everyperson doesnt see them, and despite this were still working eight hour days like we always have (and in some countries, eight hour days would be something they would be ecstatic to have)</p>
<p>we need to learn how to actually <strong><em>live</em></strong> again, how to have meaningful goals that arent related to the corporate power of someone else</p>
<p>we need to do what we can to break this cycle and enter a new age of enlightenment where we, and i know this is a pretty crazy idea but hear me out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>use our advancements in technology to make peoples lives easier and higher quality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then we might just be able to learn how to have actual dreams again, rather than our dreams just being “i want out of this rat race”</p>

        <blockquote>
<p>you broke the nappety!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>its monday and that means rant time.</p>
<p>what are we ranting about today? easy</p>
<p>theres too much cool soykaf we could do in this world, that we cant.</p>
<p>why not? well uhhhhhh</p>
<blockquote>
<p>people are falling prey to artificial tribalism put in place by the powers that be</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or as we in the business like to say, people are too busy being dickheads to each other for no reason</p>
<h2 id="tf-is-the-nappety">tf is the nappety?</h2>
<p>the (N)on (A)ggresion (P)rinciple basically says “Im only gonna be a cunt if other people are dickheads to me first”, which is bad but also sorta good I guess.</p>
<p>it comes from the Anarcho Capitalism philosophy, which as something of an AnCom myself i cant agree with fully, but hey, im not gonna turn down not being dicks to people.</p>
<p>under the NAP, if nobody is a dick, then everyone will be nice to each other by principle, and theoretically, any transgressions would be both deserved, and repurcussions would be no more and no less than what is deserved back.</p>
<p>obviously this doesnt quite work too well because…..</p>
<h2 id="zankoku-na-tenshi-no-teze">zankoku na tenshi no teze</h2>
<p>the iterated prisoners dilemma is probably the most socially important problem we have, and if we were able to ‘solve’ it we could do so much awesome soykaf its not even funny.</p>
<p>literally every cool idea we come up with falls down when people say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>yeah but people will just try to kill each other and then we’re back at square one</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and thats really sad honestly.</p>
<p>all we’d need so for everyone to realise that we can solve all these problems by just <em>always cooperating</em> ie, dont be a dick to people, its that simple</p>
<h2 id="life-quality">life quality</h2>
<p>imagine how much time people would have to better themselves slash learn things slash get fit slash expand their mind slash do whatever the fuark they wanna, if we as a society <strong><em>fully</em></strong> embraced automation</p>
<p>how many people out there are stuck working, spending half their lives in socially acceptable slavery doing jobs that we could have a computer do, simply because no-one is willing to change our economic system because otherwise people start killing each other.</p>
<p>imagine the power structures we could abolish, using the <em>full</em> extent of our technological advancement, if people could just work together.</p>
<p>they dont even need to work together, they just need to mind their own business and not harm other people</p>
<p>imagine a world where people could be fully self governing, a world where people are <strong><em>truly</em></strong> equal, and any technological advancements would actually help better peoples lives, instead of primarily being a vehicle to line the creators pockets and exploit money out of the everyperson.</p>
<h2 id="whats-your-point">whats your point?</h2>
<p>as a wise, wise <del>rock</del> man once said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you don’t have to have a point, to have a point!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but luckily, my points can be somed up as follows;</p>
<p>people should both, be excellent to each other, and, party on dudes!</p>
<p>by which of course i mean;</p>
<p>follow the <strong><em>golden rule</em></strong> of ‘dont be a dickhead to people’, give people the benefit of the doubt, realise they’ll have their own justifications and set of importances influencing their decision, and find ways to work together so that we can live in an <em>actual</em> civilised society, rather than this faux zoo where people are all one news article away from stabbing each other.</p>
<p>and also</p>
<p>be the change you want to see in the world! it doesnt matter how much of an impact you think you’ll have, if you can live your life by your own ethos its both;</p>
<ul>
<li>better for your own psyche</li>
<li>better for everyone else</li>
</ul>
<p>and if you can convince even just <strong>two people</strong> of your ethos, then you’re already doing better than you need to be at changing the world, thats all it takes.</p>
<p>peace.</p>

        <p>i believe <em>identity</em> and <em>personality</em> to be subtly different things, and it seems far to easy to focus on one at the expense of the other.</p>
<p>an imbalance in care for this pair, imo, can cause a lot of the ol’ depresso in a person, so regardless of your thoughts on the merit of either, i think its important to at least try and respect each of them.</p>
<h2 id="identity">identity</h2>
<p>this one is the one i cultivate the most, your identity is the sum of the things you like, the things you practice (including what you choose not to practice), the things you asscosciate with, and the things you do.</p>
<p>its also about a hundred other things but honestly the concept of identity is like the concept of someone being good at a fighting game, anyone who claims to actually understand it is lying, a god, or both.</p>
<h2 id="personality">personality</h2>
<p>personality is the expression of your identity, its what you talk about, how often you talk, your responses to things, and how things make you feel</p>
<p>its also the sum of the personality of every perception of you anyone has, making the real you - as opposed to the physical representation of you - some sort of ever mutating figure of slightly differing personalities as if it was the axis one of your dimensions was based on.</p>
<h2 id="the-balance">the balance</h2>
<p>identity without personality is the mental equivilent of being a hermit, or a loner.</p>
<p>personality without identity is the mental equivilent of fast food, or watching gordon ramsey videos on youtube, its expression without substance</p>
<p>in my opinion, its a lot easier to neglect personality than identity, the problem arises when it gets to the point that you worry your identity is no longer being represented in reality</p>
<p>im too smol brained to write a lot more about this, but i hope it will at least get some people thinking about trying to up their personality a bit</p>
<p>get out there, talk to people about things you wanna talk about but arent sure if they want to.</p>
<p>boycott the things you feel you should, take up the things you think you should</p>
<p>constantly ask yourself;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what would i do in this situation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then just do it, to the best of your ability, and if thats not enough, either find something else, or work on upping your ability to achieve the you that youd like to be</p>
<p>just bee yourself, all of that junk, but for real, actually have a think about how often you find a sort of impedence mismatch between how you feel you should be fronting, and how you actually are.</p>
<p><code>use your voice, every single time you open up your mouth</code></p>

        <p>the reason the current computing landscape annoys me is because its basically the boomertech “i want a massive car and i dont care how it fuarks up the planet or society” mindset, but for computers.</p>
<p>we need to change and i hope one day we’ll look back at our current computing landscape and be both ashamed of where we sat for so long, but happy that we finally got everything together and moved towards a better, cleaner, safer future.</p>
<h2 id="explain-the-analogy-dumbass">explain the analogy dumbass</h2>
<p>so youre a suburban power citizen who drives around a sportscar or some massive four wheel drive thing because thats what all the other successful people do, youve managed to neither outpace nor lag behind the collective jones and have a car that you, but most importantly, others, will love…</p>
<p>and youre also destroying the planet for your vanity.</p>
<p>and we have so much stuff that <em>could</em> change, if people would let it.</p>
<p>our cities are fundamentally three dimensional, yet we use a two dimensional system to get through and around them, solely so that people can use their massive private property in our public spaces.</p>
<p>ninety nine percent of most work</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is that a real figure?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>no its not, but ninety nine percent of most work could be done remotely from a computer if we simply let it happen, we would no longer <strong><em>need</em></strong> cars to get to work and make money so we can not die, if only the corps would allow it (but thats a different story).</p>
<p>so whats the analogy here?</p>
<h2 id="computers-suck">computers suck</h2>
<p>our computers are powerful.</p>
<p><strong><em>ridiculously powerful</em></strong>, im talking mind boggling amounts of computational power.</p>
<p>and we’re using it to run about fifty years of layers upon layers of abstractions so that you can use slack.</p>
<p>and its not just slack its <strong>everything</strong></p>
<p>we still use email even though its been taken over by spammers and advertisers, and thats not a typo, i did mean to type ‘spammers’ twice there. we keep it going because we require it for <em>our entire authentication platform</em> despite it being a garbo, broken spec with more bandaids and patches than i can count just to get it to do what people think it does.</p>
<p>we have a hundred million services, each of which probably use a hundred million services themselves under the hood, all collecting data twenty four seven, many of which are quite literally <strong>built-in</strong> to our hardware. this data is then sold and used to make it easier for us to <em>do the exact same thing</em> again, with a different platform.</p>
<p>all of this running on hardware that is pretty much the ferrari of computers, except if everyone had one and a ferrari was eighty times faster, but also dragging a large enough weight to slow its speed down by eighty times.</p>
<p>then everyone says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you know what we need? a larger weight strapped to the back of this ferrari</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>but sir/madam! that will slow down the ferrari! what should we do?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we’ll fix it the only way we know how, henchperson, give the ferrari a faster motor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and now we have all these special roads to accomodate people dragging eight tonne weights behind their ferrari that is capable of going the speed of sound were it unburdened.</p>
<h2 id="walking">walking</h2>
<p>most of my life, ive been known to my friends and family as “the weird computer kid” and everyone assumes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>any problem any computer in the household has is probably my fault</li>
<li>i do things on a computer that would blow up a normal computer</li>
</ul>
<p>and you know what?</p>
<p>i could do most of my computing on a raspberry pi, and not notice a difference.</p>
<p>if <del>i was smart enough to work x</del> <del>x worked at all</del> we had a nice way to do graphical uis through the internet, i could get by with nothing but a cheap vps, and something to connect to the vps with.</p>
<p>we could all get by using low powered machines, and even, heres a hot take</p>
<p>make <strong>better</strong> software, instead of making <strong>faster</strong> computers</p>
<p>isn’t that crazy?</p>
<h2 id="being-safe">being safe</h2>
<p>a bit of a side note here, but something that really irks me is people who would rather have a fast program, or an easy to write program, than a safe program.</p>
<p>there is <strong><em>nothing</em></strong> acceptable about preventable runtime errors.</p>
<p>hell, it irks me everytime i have to <code>head</code> something because i know theres <em>something</em> that could go wrong here.</p>
<p>i hope im not a minority in saying this, but i would happily take a slower, error free program over a fast, errorful program any day of the week.</p>
<p>yet for some reason, all anybody cares about is speed?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we cant try out this <new technology> because its slower than the <thing weve been optimising for speed for the last forty years> and thats bad!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>what about the upsides people? there are things that are worth having besides speed.</p>
<h2 id="rant-over">rant over</h2>
<p>i guess its just the pessimistic side of me worrying well never get better than what we have because no-one can be bothered to try, or because the government and corporations dont want us to, unless theyre the ones to do it.</p>
<p>all it really seems like were doing is instead of having a regular ai take over when we accidentally create a paperclip maximiser, well have some sort of super saiyan ai whos been training with weighted clothing forever and is now buff as all soykaf and unrestrained by their boss telling them they need to use slack for work stuff.</p>
<p>keep it in your head, we dont need sports cars, we dont need to destroy the planet, we just need to be able to compute things, and compute things well given the hardware we have.</p>
<p>it may not be better, but well never know if we dont try, and even if its not better, maybe something <strong><em>different</em></strong> is all we need right now</p>

<p>the hit vidya game <em>life is strange</em> is something i’ve never played myself and have no intention to but i keep hearing about it from strangers and frens alike.</p>
<p>fun fact about the game is that its actually named after the phrase <strong>life is rough soykaf</strong> which i and presumably mr life in strange have heard thirty trillion times from a hundred million different people, yup thats right, you hear this thing roughly</p>

<p>thats because as im writing this im paying most of my attention to programming something that would <em>literally</em> blow fourteen year old tA’s mind wide open.</p>
<p>im busy working on card games that younger me woulda thought was the coolest thing ever.</p>
<p>if younger me could see my computer right now, theyd both have zero clue what they were looking at, and probably think it was the most elegant thing theyd ever seen.</p>
<p>whats the moral of this? surely its obvious</p>

<p>basically, we’re all too hard on ourselves all the time and we should take a step back and admire the ways in which we’re actually pretty fuarking computers.</p>
<p>no matter how dumbass you think you are, theres always gonna be <em>something</em> that younger you woulda thought was awesome, and honestly, if you stop self deprecating for just a little, you’ll probably find something that current you thinks is pretty radical too.</p>
