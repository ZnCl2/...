			"body": "-You can't create an account with a vpn or proxy, if you try they know and are very strict about it. Its obvious that they want to track you.\n-Multiple users report police breaking in during their attempt even if they haven't told anyone about it (other than to the users on the website)\n-sometimes you get a private message from someone that wants to get to know you, and try to get you to reveal personal info\n-suspicious users that seem to try and prevent attempts and derail any real discussion. (i.e. someone announces they're doing it, immediately get 3-4 people trying to talk them out of it. They also try to make each method seem impossible difficult to pull off).\n\nWhat do you guys think? Its definitely suspicious that they are the ONLY site on the clearnet while other suicides sites that existed have been taken down.",
