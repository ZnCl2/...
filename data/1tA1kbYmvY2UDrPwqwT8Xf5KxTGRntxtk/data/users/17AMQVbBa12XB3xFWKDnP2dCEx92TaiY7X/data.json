			"body": "When you are sick or excessively old and tired it seems reasonable that fading into nothingness would be appealing. A psychedelic drug cocktail that ends in cardiovascular malfunction seems like the way to go. Opinions? Suicide when youth and vitality is still in your possession is usually a result of chemical imbalances in your brain. Depression pure and simple, seek treatment and live your best life while you still have the vigor to do it.",

				"body": "Pure carbon monoxide is the best substance for this. As little as 1% in your environment will cause peaceful sleep and death. The hemoglobin has a higher affinity for CO than for O2 and will absorb readily into your bloodstream, inducing a feeling of inebriation followed by sleep, and eventually death. Burning charcoal in an enclosed space will produce the required CO. Incomplete combustion, more pleasant without the choking fumes of car exhaust with all the noxious chemicals in it.",
