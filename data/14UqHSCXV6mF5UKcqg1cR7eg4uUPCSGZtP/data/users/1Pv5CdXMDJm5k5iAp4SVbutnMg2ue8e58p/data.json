Also, there is no way to tell, whether the wreckage contains mines that activate at the impact, when the UAV hits the ground. I would use only bomb robots with some natural disinfectant spray for handling that kind of trash.",

			"body": "I hate it, but I do think that the Ka-52 is the most advanced military helicopter on 2018 planet Earth. Its armor for the pilots should be improved, but apart from the armor, its superior to whatever the West has. Unfortunately. \n\nThe emergency ejection system of the Ka-52 is already something that the West has not been able to counter. Add to that the fact that the only western Tank that can counter the Russian new Armada is the French Lecrec, and militarily speaking the West is outgunned and militarily inferior.",
