It's fine for me. And I only had a handful of MB left on my phone. But I'll check it once again, and may be change the settings. However on the phone it's easier to clean up the file than to edit anything xD\n\n> Personally, I think ZeroNet will be too hard on the battery if installed on a phone or a tablet, so I put my faith in setting up a proxy so that I can access it on my mobile when I'm out.\n\nProxy is a good idea, but all my ports are closed and no way to open em. And I don't trust public proxies.\nAnd it's ok both on the phone and tablet. Drains a bit, but only worth noticing at night, when I charge my tablet (or don't have ZN on). Plus you can set it to use more memory than CPU if you are so worried. But it's fine for me.\n\nAnd it drains almost nothong when you turn off data connection, which is this way on my phone when I'm home.\n\n",
