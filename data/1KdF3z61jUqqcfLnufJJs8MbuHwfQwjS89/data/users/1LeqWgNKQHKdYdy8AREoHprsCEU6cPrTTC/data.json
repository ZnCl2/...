			"body": "Great description of Yogurt making. If you use Vili culture you just put the culture in a jar with milk. Put it in a cabinet over night and refrigerate the next day. Add sugar to taste or honey. I think that's probably the easiest method. But for those who like other types of yogurt or don't like the consistency of Vili, this is a great set of directions for making other types.\n\nAlso, if you live in the U.S. most yogurt from the store will not culture extra yogurt at home. It's basically dead. ",
