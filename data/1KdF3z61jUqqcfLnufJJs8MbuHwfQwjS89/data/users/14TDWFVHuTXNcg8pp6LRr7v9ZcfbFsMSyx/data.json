It's a filesystem.\n\nWhen you start `keybase` (that you can think of as a PGP/GPG key manager) and `kbfsfuse` (which is the actual filesystem thing), a folder named `/keybase` appears on your computer. In that folder you'll find two subfolders, `private` and `public`. Any file that you drop in `/keybase/public/musickiller` will be accessible to _anyone_ who has KBFS installed, and the file is _signed_ with your GPG key so that people can be confident that the file is from you. Any file that you drop in `/keybase/private/musickiller` is accessible by _you only_, from _any_ computer that you control (in this respect KBFS resembles Dropbox), and the file is _encrypted_ with your GPG key. And if you drop a file in, say, `/keybase/private/musickiller,kseistrup` that file will be available (read _and_ write) by both you and me. And the KBFS makes the whole signing / encrypting process automatic.\n\nI haven't put an `index.html` file in my keybase dir, but you can see the other public content here: https://kseistrup.keybase.pub/\nIf you had KBFS installed, you'd be able to access the content from the `/keybase/public/kseistrup` folder on your own computer.",

I really can't explain it and I don't have any plans writing a post about it — I'm in no position to do that.\n\nDid you read https://nxtforum.org/core-development-announcements/%28ann%29-ardor-or-nxt-2-0-a-scalable-child-chain-platform ?\n",

Supposedly it's the Finnish term for the Swedish _filmjölk_. When I were a kid I used to love the _filmjölk_ when we stayed in Sweden during the summer. For many years I thought it was just because of the novelty, but today I know that _filmjölk_ hosts its own unique composition of lactobacilli (and yeasts). Fermentation certainly is an interesting world.",
