TLS Forward Secrecy in Postfix
</h1>

<hr>

<h2> Background </h2>

<p> Postfix supports forward secrecy of TLS network communication
since version 2.2. This support was adopted from Lutz J&auml;nicke's
"Postfix TLS patch" for earlier Postfix versions.  This document
will focus on TLS Forward Secrecy in the Postfix SMTP client and
server.  See <a href="TLS_README.html">TLS_README</a> for a general
description of Postfix TLS support. </p>

<h2> What is Forward Secrecy </h2>

<p> The term "Forward Secrecy" (or sometimes "Perfect Forward Secrecy")
is used to describe security protocols in which the confidentiality
of past traffic is not compromised when long-term keys used by either
or both sides are later disclosed.  </p>

<p> Forward secrecy is accomplished by negotiating session keys
using per-session cryptographically-strong random numbers that are
not saved, and signing the exchange with long-term authentication
keys.  Later disclosure of the long-term keys allows impersonation
of the key holder from that point on, but not recovery of prior
traffic, since with forward secrecy, the discarded random key
agreement inputs are not available to the attacker. </p>

<p> Forward secrecy is only "perfect" when brute-force attacks on
the key agreement algorithm are impractical even for the best-funded
adversary and the random-number generators used by both parties are
sufficiently strong.  Otherwise, forward secrecy leaves the attacker
with the challenge of cracking the key-agreement protocol, which
is likely quite computationally intensive, but may be feasible for
sessions of sufficiently high value.  Thus forward secrecy places
cost constraints on the efficacy of bulk surveillance, recovering
all past traffic is generally infeasible, and even recovery of
individual sessions may be infeasible given a sufficiently-strong
key agreement method. </p>

<h2><a name="tls_fs">Forward Secrecy in TLS</a></h2>

<p> The non-export cipher suites in the original SSL protocol do not
implement forward secrecy.  The client sends a random "pre-master
secret" to the server encrypted with the server's RSA public key.
The server decrypts this with its private key, and uses it together
with other data exchanged in the clear to generate the session key.
An attacker with access to the server's private key can perform the
same computation at any later time.  The TLS library in Windows XP
and Windows Server 2003 only supported cipher suites of this type,
and Exchange 2003 servers largely do not support forward secrecy.  </p>

<p> Later revisions to the TLS protocol introduced forward-secrecy
cipher suites in which the client and server implement a key exchange
protocol based on ephemeral secrets.  Sessions encrypted with one
of these newer cipher suites are not compromised by future disclosure
of long-term authentication keys. </p>

<p> The key-exchange algorithms used for forward secrecy require
the TLS server to designate appropriate "parameters" consisting of a
mathematical "group" and an element of that group called a "generator".
There are two flavors of "groups" that work with PFS: </p>

<ul>
<li> Prime field groups.  The server needs to be configured with a
suitably large prime and a corresponding "generator".
<li> Elliptic curve groups.  The server needs to be configured with
a "named curve".  These offer better security at lower computational
cost than prime field groups, but are not as widely implemented.
</ul>

<p> The acronym for forward secrecy over prime fields is EDH or
Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (sometimes also abbreviated as DHE).  The
acronym for the elliptic curve version is EECDH which is short for
Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman. </p>

<p> It is not essential to know what these are, but one does need
to know that OpenSSL only supports EECDH as of version 1.0.0.  Thus
the configuration parameters related to Elliptic Curve forward secrecy
are only available when Postfix is linked with OpenSSL 1.0.0 or
later (provided EC support has not been disabled by the vendor, as
in some versions of RedHat Linux).  </p>

<p> Elliptic curves used in cryptography are typically identified
by a "name" that stands for a set of well-known parameter values,
and it is these "names" (or associated ASN.1 object identifiers)
that are used in the TLS protocol.  On the other hand, with TLS there
are no specially designated prime field groups, so each server is
free to select its own suitably-strong prime and generator.  </p>

<h2><a name="server_fs">Forward Secrecy in the Postfix SMTP Server</a></h2>

<p> First the good news: The Postfix SMTP server supports forward
secrecy in its default configuration.  If the SMTP client also
supports and prefers TLS cipher suites with forward secrecy, then
the traffic between the server and client will resist decryption
even if the server's long-term authentication keys are <i>later</i>
compromised.  When the SMTP client is Postfix, it prefers forward
secrecy cipher suites by default. </p>

<p> Postfix &ge; 2.8 when compiled with OpenSSL &ge; 1.0.0 supports
EECDH key exchange by default (via the most widely supported NIST
P-256 curve).  So when the SMTP client also supports EECDH and
implements the P-256 curve, forward secrecy just works.  </p>

<p> For Postfix 2.6 and 2.7, in which EECDH was supported, but
disabled by default, one can safely enable EECDH by setting the
<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> parameter <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade">smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade</a> to "strong".  </p>

<p> For Postfix 2.2-2.5, or for interoperability with clients
that do not support EECDH, you need the older prime-field EDH, and
here OpenSSL wants the server to provide two explicitly selected
(prime, generator) combinations.  One for the now long obsolete
"export" cipher suites, and another for non-export cipher suites.
Postfix has two such default combinations compiled in, but also
supports explicitly configured overrides. </p>

<p> The export EDH parameters are used only with the obsolete
"export" ciphers.  To use a non-default prime, generate a 512-bit
DH parameter file and set <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file">smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file</a> to the filename. </p>

<p> The non-export EDH parameters are used for all other EDH
cipher suites.  To use a non-default prime, generate a 1024-bit or
2048-bit DH parameter file and set <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file">smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file</a> to
the filename.  Despite the name this is simply the non-export
parameter file and the prime need not actually be 1024 bits long. </p>

<p> It turns out that (inadvisably patched in some Debian releases)
Exim SMTP clients enforce a minimum of 2048 bits for the non-export
prime.  See the <a href="#quick-start">quick-start</a> section for
the recommended configuration to work around this issue.  </p>

<p> So, in summary, Postfix supports 1024-bit-prime EDH out of the
box, with no additional configuration, but you may want to override
the default prime to be 2048 bits long.  It also supports NIST P-256
EECDH out of the box with Postfix 2.8 or later, but this is disabled
in Postfix 2.6 and 2.7 when the feature was too new to enable by
default.  In retrospect it turned out to work reliably, and is now
on by default.  </p>

<p> The elliptic curve situation is evolving, with new curves being
introduced to augment or replace the NIST curves tarnished by the
Snowden revelations.  Fortunately, TLS clients advertise the list
of supported curves to the server so that servers can in principle
choose newer stronger curves when mutually supported.  The OpenSSL
code for making this possible is not yet released as of late 2013
(it is available only in OpenSSL development snapshots). </p>

<p> At some point Postfix will need to adjust to the new API for
setting the elliptic curve options.  Fortunately, when EECDH support
was added to Postfix, it introduced a layer of indirection: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
    <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade">smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade</a> = strong | ultra
    <a href="postconf.5.html#tls_eecdh_strong_curve">tls_eecdh_strong_curve</a> = prime256v1
    <a href="postconf.5.html#tls_eecdh_ultra_curve">tls_eecdh_ultra_curve</a> = secp384r1
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> When it becomes possible in OpenSSL to support a "menu" of
curves, we will likely extend "<a href="postconf.5.html#tls_eecdh_strong_curve">tls_eecdh_strong_curve</a>" to be an
ordered list of curves and likewise with the "ultra" version, where
the two might now overlap, and differ mostly in the preference
order.  As a result most existing configurations will then support
more curves at the desired security level without any changes to
<a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>. </p>

<h2> <a name="client_fs">Forward Secrecy in the Postfix SMTP Client</a> </h2>

<p> EDH and EECDH use depends on SMTP client support and preference
for the corresponding TLS cipher suites.  If the client prefers
ciphers without forward secrecy, these will be used instead.  Though
Postfix &ge; 2.8 supports setting "tls_preempt_cipher list = yes"
to select the use of the server's, rather than the client's, most
preferred cipher suite, this setting will likely cause interoperability
issues with older Exchange servers and is not recommended for now.  </p>

<p> The default Postfix SMTP client cipher lists are correctly ordered
to prefer EECDH and EDH cipher suites ahead of similar cipher suites
that don't implement forward secrecy.  Administrators are strongly
discouraged from changing the cipher list definitions.  It is likely
safe to set "<a href="postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_ciphers">smtp_tls_ciphers</a> = medium" if you wish to disable the
obsolete "export" and "low" grade ciphers even with opportunistic
TLS.  Setting a minimum strength does not change the preference
order.  Note that strengths higher than "medium" exclude Exchange
2003 and likely other widely used MTAs, thus "high" grade ciphers
should only be used on a case-by-case basis via the <a
href="TLS_README.html#client_tls_policy">TLS policy</a> table. </p>

<h2><a name="quick-start">Getting started, quick and dirty</a></h2>

<p> At least one time as root (prime group generation can take a
few seconds to a few minutes): </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# cd /etc/postfix
# openssl dhparam -out dh512.tmp 512 && mv dh512.tmp dh512.pem
# openssl dhparam -out dh1024.tmp 1024 && mv dh1024.tmp dh1024.pem
# openssl dhparam -out dh2048.tmp 2048 && mv dh2048.tmp dh2048.pem
# chmod 644 dh512.pem dh1024.pem dh2048.pem
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Note: greater security against "pre-computation" attacks against
EDH can be obtained by periodically regenerating the EDH parameters
as above (an hourly or daily cron job running as root can automate
this task).  The parameter files are not secret, after all these are
sent to all SMTP clients in the clear. Mode 0644 is fine.  </p>

<p> Once the parameters are in place, update <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a> as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
 <a href="postconf.5.html">main.cf</a>:
   # Postfix &ge; 2.8
   <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade">smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade</a> = strong
   # All versions of Postfix:
   <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file">smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file</a> = ${<a href="postconf.5.html#config_directory">config_directory</a>}/dh2048.pem
   <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file">smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file</a> = ${<a href="postconf.5.html#config_directory">config_directory</a>}/dh512.pem
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> If some of your MSA clients don't support 2048-bit EDH, you may
need to adjust the submission entry in <a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a> accordingly: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<a href="master.5.html">master.cf</a>:
  submission inet n       -       n       -       -       smtpd
    # Some submission clients may not yet do 2048-bit EDH, if such
    # clients use your MSA, configure 1024-bit EDH instead:
    -o <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file">smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file</a>=${<a href="postconf.5.html#config_directory">config_directory</a>}/dh1024.pem
    -o <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_security_level">smtpd_tls_security_level</a>=encrypt
    -o <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_sasl_auth_enable">smtpd_sasl_auth_enable</a>=yes
    ...
</pre>
</blockquote>
