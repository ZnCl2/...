<h1> Postfix stable release 2.8.7 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.8.7.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.8.7.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 2.8.7 is available. This contains a
workaround for a problem that is fixed in Postfix 2.9.  </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The postscreen daemon, which is not enabled by default,
sent non-compliant SMTP responses (220- followed by 421) when it
could not give a connection to a real smtpd process. These responses
caused some remote SMTP clients to return mail as undeliverable.
</p>

<p> The workaround is to hang up after sending 220- without sending
the 421 "sorry" reply; this is harmless. </p>

<p> The complete fix involves too much change for a stable release:
send the 220 greeting, wait for the EHLO command, then send the 421
"sorry" reply and hang up.  </p>

</ul>

<p> You can find the updated Postfix source code at the mirrors
listed at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.
