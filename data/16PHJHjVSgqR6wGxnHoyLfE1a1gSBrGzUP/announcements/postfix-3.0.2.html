<h1> Postfix stable release 3.0.2 and legacy releases 2.11.6, 2.10.8,
and 2.9.14 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.0.2.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.0.2.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 3.0.2 is available, as well as legacy
releases 2.11.6, 2.10.8, and 2.9.14. </p>

<p> With all supported Postfix releases, the default TLS settings
no longer enable export-grade ciphers, and no longer enable the
SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols.  These ciphers and protocols have little
if any legitimate use today, and have instead become a vehicle for
downgrade attacks. There are no other code changes. </p>

<p> Postfix documentation has been updated to reflect the new default
settings and their rationale; the RELEASE_NOTES give suggestions for
how to enable the old ciphers and protocols if your infrastructure
requires them.  </p>

<p> Finally, abandoning deprecated ciphers and protocols does not
really improve TLS security without measures to better authenticate
remote servers. Secure DNS and TLSA are steps in that direction.
</p>
