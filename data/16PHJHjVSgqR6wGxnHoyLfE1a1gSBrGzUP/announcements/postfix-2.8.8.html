<h1> Postfix legacy release 2.8.8 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.8.8.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.8.8.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix legacy release 2.8.8 is available. This contains fixes
that are already part of Postfix 2.9 and 2.10.  </p>

<ul>

<li> <p>  The Postfix sqlite client, introduced with Postfix 2.8,
had an embarassing bug in its quoting routine. As the result of a
last-minute code cleanup before release, this routine returned the
unquoted text instead of the quoted text.  The opportunities for
mis-use are limited: Postfix sqlite database files are usually owned
by root, and Postfix daemons usually run with non-root privileges
so they can't corrupt the database.  This problem was reported by
Rob McGee (rob0). </p>

<li> <p> The Postfix 2.8.4 fix for local delivery agent database
lookup errors was incomplete.  The fix correctly added new code to
detect database lookup errors with mailbox_transport_maps,
mailbox_command_maps or fallback_transport_maps, but it failed to
log the problem, and to produce a defer logfile record which is
needed for "delayed mail" and "mail too old" delivery status
notifications.  </p>

<li> <p> The trace(8) service, used for DSN SUCCESS notifications,
did not distinguish between notifications for a non-bounce or a
bounce message, causing it to "reply" to mail with the null sender
address. Problem reported by Sabahattin Gucukoglu. </p>

<li> <p> Support for Dovecot auth over TCP sockets, using code that
already existed for testing purposes. Patrick Koetter kindly provided
an update for the SASL_README file. </p>

<li> <p> Workaround in the LDAP client for changes in the
under-documented OpenLDAP API, by Victor Duchovni. </p>

</ul>
