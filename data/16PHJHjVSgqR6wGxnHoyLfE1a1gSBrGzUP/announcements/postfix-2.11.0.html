<h1> Postfix stable release 2.11.0 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.11.0.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.11.0.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 2.11.0 is available.  This release ends
support for Postfix 2.7. </p>

<p> The main changes in no particular order are: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Support for PKI-less TLS server certificate verification
with DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities) where the
CA public key or the server certificate is identified via DNSSEC
lookup. This requires a DNS resolver that validates DNSSEC replies.
The problem with conventional PKI is that there are literally
hundreds of organizations world-wide that can provide a certificate
in anyone's name. DANE limits trust to the people who control the
target DNS zone and its parent zones.  </p>

<li> <p> Support for LMDB databases. Originally developed as part
of OpenLDAP, LMDB is the first persistent Postfix database that can
be shared among multiple writers such as postscreen daemons (Postfix
already supported shared non-persistent memcached caches).  Postfix
currently requires LMDB version 0.9.11 or later. See LMDB_README
for details and limitations. </p>

<li> <p> A new postscreen_dnsbl_whitelist_threshold feature to allow
clients to skip postscreen tests based on their DNSBL score. This
can eliminate email delays due to "after 220 greeting" protocol
tests, which otherwise require that a client reconnects before it
can deliver mail. Some providers such as Google don't retry from
the same IP address, and that can result in large email delivery
delays. </p>

<li> <p> The recipient_delimiter feature now supports different
delimiters, for example both "+" and "-". As before, this implementation
recognizes exactly one delimiter character per email address, and
exactly one address extension per email address. </p>

<li> <p> Advanced master.cf query/update support to access service
attributes as "name = value" pairs. For example to turn off chroot
on all services use "postconf -F '*/*/chroot = n'", and to change/add
a "-o name=value" setting use "postconf -P 'smtp/inet/name = value'".
This was developed primarily to allow automated tools to manage
Postfix systems without having to parse Postfix configuration files.
</p>

</ul>
