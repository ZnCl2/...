<h1> Postfix stable release 2.9.6 and legacy releases 2.8.14, 2.7.13,
2.6.19 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.9.6.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.9.6.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 2.9.6, and legacy releases 2.8.14, 2.7.13,
2.6.19 are available. They contain fixes and workarounds that are
also part of Postfix 2.10.  </p>

<p> Postfix 2.9: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Thanks to OpenSSL documentation, the Postfix 2.9.0..2.9.5
SMTP client and server used an incorrect procedure to compute TLS
certificate PUBLIC-KEY fingerprints (these may be used in the
check_ccert_access and in smtp_tls_policy_maps features).  Support
for certificate PUBLIC-KEY finger prints was introduced with Postfix
2.9; there is no known problem with the certificate fingerprint
algorithms available since Postfix 2.2.  </p>

<p> Specify "tls_legacy_public_key_fingerprints = yes" temporarily,
pending a migration from configuration files with incorrect Postfix
2.9.0..2.9.5 certificate PUBLIC-KEY finger prints, to the correct
fingerprints used by Postfix 2.9.6 and later. </p>

<p> See the RELEASE_NOTES file for more details. </p>

</ul>

<p> All supported releases: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The postconf(1) master.cf parser didn't support "clusters"
of daemon command-line option letters.  </p>

<li> <p> The local(8) delivery agent dereferenced a null pointer
while delivering to null command (for example, "|" in a .forward
file).  Reported by Gilles Chehade. </p>

<li> <p> A memory leak fix for tls_misc.c was documented but not
included. </p>

</ul>

<p> You can find the updated Postfix source code at the mirrors
listed at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.
