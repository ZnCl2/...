<h1> Postfix stable release 3.2.2 and legacy releases 3.1.6, 3.0.10 and
2.11.10 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.2.2.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.2.2.html</a>] </p>

<p> This announcement (June 13, 2017) includes changes that were
released with an earlier update (June 10, 2017). The announcement
was postponed to avoid confusion due to repeated notification. </p>

<p> Fixed in all supported releases: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Security: Berkeley DB versions 2 and later try to read settings
from a file DB_CONFIG in the current directory. This undocumented
feature may introduce undisclosed vulnerabilities resulting in privilege
escalation with Postfix set-gid programs (postdrop, postqueue) before
they chdir to the Postfix queue directory, and with the postmap and
postalias commands depending on whether the user's current directory is
writable by other users. This fix does not change Postfix behavior for
Berkeley DB versions &lt; 3, but it does reduce postmap and postalias
'create' performance with Berkeley DB versions 3.0 .. 4.6.

</ul>

<p> Fixed in Postfix 3.2 and later: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The SMTP server receive_override_options were not restored
at the end of an SMTP session, after the options were modified by
an smtpd_milter_maps setting of "DISABLE". Milter support remained
disabled for the life time of the smtpd process. </p>

<li> <p> After the Postfix 3.2 address/domain table lookup overhaul,
the check_sender_access and check_recipient_access features ignored
a non-default parent_domain_matches_subdomains setting. </p>

</ul>

<p> Fixed in Postfix 3.1 and later: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Compatibility: some Milter applications do not recognize
single-character macro names when Postfix sends these as {name}.
Postfix now sends such macros without {} as it has done historically.
</p>

</ul>

<p> Fixed in Postfix 3.0 and later: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Compatibility: prevent MIME downgrade of Postfix-generated
message/delivery status. It's supposed to be 7bit, therefore
quoted-printable encoding is not expected, and can result in users
seeing garbled non-delivery reports. </p>

</ul>

at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>. </p>
