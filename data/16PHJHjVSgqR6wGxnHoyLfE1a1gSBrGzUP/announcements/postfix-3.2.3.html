<h1> Postfix stable release 3.2.3 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.2.3.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.2.3.html</a>] </p>

<p> This announcement concerns fixes for problems that were introduced
with Postfix 3.2. Older releases are unaffected.
</p>

<p> Fixed in Postfix 3.2 and later: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Extension propagation was broken with "recipient_delimiter
= .". This change reverts a change that was trying to be too clever.
</p>

<li> <p> The postqueue command would abort with a panic message
after it experienced an output write error while listing the mail
queue. This change restores a write error check that was lost with
the Postfix 3.2 rewrite of the vbuf_print formatter. </p>

<li> <p> Restored sanity checks for dynamically-specified width and
precision in format strings (%*, %.*, and %*.*). These checks were
lost with the Postfix 3.2 rewrite of the vbuf_print formatter.
</p>

</ul>

<p> You can find the updated Postfix source code at the mirrors listed
at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>. </p>
