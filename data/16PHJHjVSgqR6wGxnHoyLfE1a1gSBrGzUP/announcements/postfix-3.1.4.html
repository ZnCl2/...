<h1> Postfix stable release 3.1.4 and legacy releases 3.0.8, 2.11.9
</h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.1.4.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.1.4.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 3.1.4 is available, as well as legacy
releases 3.0.8 and 2.11.9. There will be no further updates for
Postfix 2.10. </p>

<p> Fixed with Postfix 3.1.4, 3.0.8, and 2.11.9: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The postscreen daemon did not merge the client test status
information for concurrent sessions from the same IP address. Thus,
after one session recorded its successful tests in the postscreen
cache, a concurrent session from that same IP address that passed
fewer tests could later "wipe out" some of that progress in the
postscreen cache. The fix has proven itself for five months in the
development release, and should be safe to use in the stable releases.
</p>

<li> <p> The Postfix SMTP server falsely rejected a sender address
when validating a sender address with "smtpd_reject_unlisted_recipient
= yes" or with "reject_unlisted_sender". Cause: the address validation
code did not query sender_canonical_maps. </p>

<li> <p> The virtual delivery agent did not detect failure to skip
to the end of a mailbox file, so that mail would be delivered to
the beginning of the file. This could happen when a mailbox file
was already larger than the virtual mailbox size limit. </p>

<li> <p> The postsuper logged an incorrect rename operation count
after creating a missing directory. </p>

</ul>

<p> Fixed with Postfix 3.1.4 and 3.0.8: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The Postfix SMTP server falsely rejected mail when a
sender-dependent "error" transport was configured. Cause: the SMTP
server address validation code was not updated when the
sender_dependent_default_transport_maps feature was introduced.
The fix has proven itself for six months in the development release,
and should be safe to use in the stable releases. Unfortunately,
Postfix 2.11 is too different to benefit from the same fix. </p>

<li> <p> The Postfix SMTP server falsely rejected an SMTPUTF8 sender
address, when "smtpd_delay_reject = no". </p>

</ul>

<p> Fixed with Postfix 3.1.4: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The "postfix tls deploy-server-cert" command used the wrong
certificate and key file. This was caused by a cut-and-paste error
in the postfix-tls-script file. </p>

</ul>

listed at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.
