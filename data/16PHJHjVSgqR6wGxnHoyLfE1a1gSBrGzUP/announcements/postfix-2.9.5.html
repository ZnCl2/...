<h1> Postfix stable release 2.9.5 and legacy releases 2.8.13, 2.7.12,
2.6.18 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.9.5.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.9.5.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 2.9.5, and legacy releases 2.8.13, 2.7.12,
2.6.18 are available. They contain fixes and workarounds that are
also part of Postfix 2.10.  </p>

<p> Postfix 2.9 only: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> False error (missing "]" character) when a reject_{rhs,dns}bl_*
or permit_{rhs,dns}wl_* reply pattern started with "[".  Reported
by Martijn Brinkers.  </p>

</ul>

<p> Postfix 2.8 and later: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The postscreen_access_list feature failed to ignore case
in the first character of a command (e.g., permit, reject, etc.).
Reported by Francis Picabia. (This fix is incorrectly listed in the
HISTORY files of earlier releases, and will be removed with a future
patch.) </p>

</ul>

<p> All supported releases: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Strip the datalink suffix (e.g., %eth0) from IPv6 addresses
returned by the system getaddrinfo() routine.  Such suffixes break
the default mynetworks value, the Postfix SMTP server's reverse/forward
DNS name/address mapping check, and possibly more. </p>

<li> <p> To eliminate the possibility of collisions with connection
cache lookup keys, the Postfix LDAP client now computes those lookup
keys by joining the number-valued connection properties with ASCII
null, just like it already did with the string-valued connection
properties. </p>

<li> <p> There was a memory leak during one-time TLS library
initialization (introduced with Postfix 2.5).  Reported by Coverity.
</p>

<li> <p> There was a memory leak in the unused oqmgr(8) program
(introduced with Postfix 2.3). Reported by Coverity. </p>

</ul>

<p> You can find the updated Postfix source code at the mirrors
listed at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.
