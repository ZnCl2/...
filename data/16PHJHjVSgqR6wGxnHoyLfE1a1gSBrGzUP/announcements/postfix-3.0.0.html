<h1> Postfix stable release 3.0.0 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.0.0.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.0.0.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 3.0.0 is available.  This release ends
support for Postfix 2.8. </p>

<p> The main changes in no particular order are: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> SMTPUTF8 support for internationalized domain names and
address localparts as defined in RFC 6530 and related documents.
The implementation is based on code contributed by Arnt Gulbrandsen
and sponsored by CNNIC. SMTPUTF8 support is a work in progress; it
is expected to be completed during the Postfix 3.1 development
cycle. See SMTPUTF8_README for a summary of limitations. </p>

<li> <p> Support for Postfix dynamically-linked libraries and
database plugins. The implementation is based on code by LaMont
Jones for Debian Linux.  See INSTALL for detailed descriptions of
the available options.  </p>

<li> <p> An OPT-IN safety net for the selective adoption of new
Postfix default settings. If you do nothing, the old Postfix default
settings *should* remain in effect (complain to your downstream
maintainer if that is not the case). See COMPATIBILITY_README
for detailed descriptions of Postfix logfile messages. </p>

<li> <p> Support for operations on multiple lookup tables. The
pipemap:{map1,map2...} database type implements a pipeline of lookup
tables where the result from one lookup table becomes a query for
the next table; the unionmap:{map1,map2,...} database type sends
the same query to multiple lookup tables and concatenates their
results. </p>

<li> <p> Support for pseudo-tables that make simple things easy to
implement.  The inline:{key1=value1,key2=value2,...} table avoids
the need to create an external file for just a few items; and the
randmap{value1,value2,...} table implements random selection from
the specified values. </p>

<li> <p> Table-driven transformation of DNS lookup results and of
delivery agent status codes and messages. Typically, one would use
a PCRE table to fix problematic DNS responses or to fix the handling
of delivery errors. See smtp_dns_reply_filter, smtp_delivery_status_filter,
and similarly-named parameters for other Postfix daemons. </p>

<li> <p> Improved configuration file syntax with support for the
ternary operator such as ${name?{iftrue}:{iffalse}}, comparison
operators such as ${{expr1}==${expr2}?{iftrue}:{iffalse}}, per-Milter
and per-policy server timeout and other settings, master.cf parameters
that contain whitespace, import/export_environment settings that
contain whitespace, and "static" table lookup results that contain
whitespace. Support for multiple lookup results in access(5) and
header/body_checks(5) tables is expected to be completed in the
Postfix 3.1 development cycle. </p>

<li> <p> Per-session command profiles, logged at the end of each
inbound SMTP session.  For example, a password-guessing bot is
logged as "disconnect from name[addr] ehlo=1 auth=0/1 commands=1/2",
meaning that the client sent one EHLO command that worked, one AUTH
command that failed, and hung up without sending a QUIT command.
This information is always logged, and can help to solve puzzles
without verbose logging or network sniffers.  </p>

</ul>
