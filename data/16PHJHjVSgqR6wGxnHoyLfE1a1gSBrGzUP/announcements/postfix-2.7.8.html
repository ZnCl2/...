<h1> Postfix legacy release 2.7.8, 2.6.14 and 2.5.17 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.7.8.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.7.8.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix legacy releases 2.7.8, 2.6.14 and 2.5.17 are available.
This is the final update for Postfix 2.5, released in 2008. From
now on, the supported stable and legacy releases are Postfix 2.6
.. 2.9.  New features appear in the Postfix 2.10 development release.
</p>

<ul>

<li> <p> (Postfix 2.5, 2.6) While the Postfix SMTP client's protocol
parser uses the last SMTP reply line as intended, the error processing
routine was taking information from the beginning of the response.
This was causing "Protocol error" bounces with postscreen multi-line
responses and Postfix <= 2.6 clients. </p>

<li> <p> (Postfix 2.5, 2.6, 2.7) The fix for local delivery agent
database lookup errors was incomplete.  The fix correctly added new
code to detect database lookup errors with mailbox_transport_maps,
mailbox_command_maps or fallback_transport_maps, but it failed to
log the problem, and to produce a defer logfile record which is
needed for "delayed mail" and "mail too old" delivery status
notifications.  </p>

<li> <p> (Postfix 2.5, 2.6, 2.7) The trace(8) service, used for DSN
SUCCESS notifications, did not distinguish between notifications
for a non-bounce or a bounce message, causing it to "reply" to mail
with the null sender address. Problem reported by Sabahattin
Gucukoglu.  </p>

<li> <p> (Postfix 2.5, 2.6, 2.7) The "change header" milter request
could replace the wrong header. A long header name could match a
shorter one, because a length check was done on the wrong string.
Reported by Vladimir Vassiliev. </p>

<li> <p> (Postfix 2.7) Support for Dovecot auth over TCP sockets,
using code that already existed for testing purposes.  </p>

</ul>
