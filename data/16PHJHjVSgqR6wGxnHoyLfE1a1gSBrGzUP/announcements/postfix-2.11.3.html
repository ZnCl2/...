<h1> Postfix stable release 2.11.3 and legacy releases 2.10.5,
2.9.11, and 2.8.19 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.11.3.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.11.3.html</a>] </p>

<p> THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE OF PATCHES THAT WERE RELEASED ON OCTOBER
13, 2014.  THE HEADER PREPEND PATCH IN THAT SET IS REVERTED AND
REPLACED WITH A COMPLETE SOLUTION. </p>

<p> Bugfix for Postfix 2.11, 2.10, 2.9 and 2.8: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Fix for configurations that prepend message headers with
Postfix access maps, policy servers or Milter applications.  Postfix
now hides its own Received: header from Milters and exposes prepended
headers to Milters, regardless of the mechanism used to prepend a
header. This fix reverts a partial solution that was released on
October 13, 2014, and replaces it with a complete solution. </p>

</ul>

<p> Portability fix for Postfix 2.11: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Portability fix for MacOS X 10.7.x (Darwin 11.x) 
build procedure. </p>

</ul>
