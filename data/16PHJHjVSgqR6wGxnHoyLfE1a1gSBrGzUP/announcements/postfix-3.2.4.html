<h1> Postfix stable release 3.2.4, and legacy releases 3.1.7 and
3.0.11 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.2.4.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.2.4.html</a>] </p>

<p> This announcement concerns fixes for problems that were introduced
with Postfix 3.0 and later. Older supported releases are unaffected.
</p>

<p> Fixed in Postfix 3.1 and later: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> DANE interoperability. Postfix builds with OpenSSL 1.0.0
or 1.0.1 failed to send email to some sites with "TLSA 2 X X" DNS
records associated with an intermediate CA certificate. Problem
report and initial fix by Erwan Legrand. </p>

</ul>

<p> Fixed in Postfix 3.0 and later: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Missing dynamicmaps support in the Postfix sendmail command.
This broke authorized_submit_users settings that use a dynamically-loaded
map type. Problem reported by Ulrich Zehl. </p>

</ul>

<p> You can find the updated Postfix source code at the mirrors
listed at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.
