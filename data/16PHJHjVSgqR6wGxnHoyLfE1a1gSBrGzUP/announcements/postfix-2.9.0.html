<h1> Postfix stable release 2.9.0 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.9.0.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.9.0.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 2.9.0 is available. The main changes in
no particular order are: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Support for long, non-repeating, queue IDs (queue file
names).  The main benefit of non-repeating names is simpler logfile
analysis. See the description of "enable_long_queue_ids" in postconf(5)
for details.  </p>

<li> <p> Memcache client support, and support to share postscreen(8)
and verify(8) caches via the proxymap server. Details about memcache
support are in memcache_table(5) and MEMCACHE_README. </p>

<li> <p> Gradual degradation: if a database is unavailable (can't
open, most read or write errors) a Postfix daemon will log a warning
and continue providing the services that don't depend on that table,
instead of immediately terminating with a fatal error. To terminate
immediately when a database file can't be opened, specify
"daemon_table_open_error_is_fatal = yes". </p>

<li> <p> Revised postconf(1) command. It warns about unused parameter
name=value settings in main.cf or master.cf (likely mistakes),
understands "dynamic" parameter names such as names that depend on
the name of a master.cf entry (finally, "postconf -n" shows all
parameter settings), and it can display main.cf and master.cf in a
more user-friendly format (postconf -nf, postconf -Mf). </p>

<li> <p> Read/write deadline support in the SMTP client and server
to defend against application-level DOS attacks that very slowly
write or read data one byte at a time. </p>

</ul>

<p> You can find the updated Postfix source code at the mirrors
listed at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.
