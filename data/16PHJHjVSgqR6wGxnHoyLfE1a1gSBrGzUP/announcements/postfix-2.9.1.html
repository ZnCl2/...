<h1> Postfix stable release 2.9.1 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.9.1.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.9.1.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 2.9.1 is available. This contains fixes
that are already part of Postfix 2.10.  </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The "change header" Milter request could replace the wrong
header. A long header name could match a shorter one, because a
length check was done on the wrong string.  Reported by Vladimir
Vassiliev.  This was introduced with Postfix 2.3. </p>

<li> <p> "sendmail -bs" segfault, due to a missing guard statement
after an smtpd_check_rewrite() call was moved closer to the command
processor loop. Fix by Bartek Szady.  This was introduced 20111219
near the end of the Postfix 2.9 development cycle. </p>

</ul>

listed at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.
