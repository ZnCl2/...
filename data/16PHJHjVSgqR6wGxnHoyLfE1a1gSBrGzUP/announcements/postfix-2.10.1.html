<h1> Postfix stable release 2.10.1 and legacy releases 2.9.7, 2.8.15,
2.7.14 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.10.1.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.10.1.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 2.10.1, and legacy releases 2.9.7, 2.8.15,
2.7.14 are available. They contain fixes and workarounds that are
also part of Postfix 2.11.  </p>

<p> Postfix 2.10 only: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Workaround: down-stream maintainers fail to install the
new smtpd_relay_restrictions safety net, causing breakage that could
have been avoided. We now hard-code the safety net instead. </p>

<p> See the RELEASE_NOTES file for more details. </p>

</ul>

<p> All supported releases: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Bugfix (introduced: Postfix 2.0): when myhostname is not
listed in mydestination, the trivial-rewrite resolver may log "do
not list &lt;myhostname value&gt; in both mydestination and &lt;name of
non-mydestination domain list&gt;".  The fix is to re-resolve a
domain-less address after adding $myhostname as the surrogate domain,
so that it pops out with the right address-class label. Reported
by Quanah Gibson-Mount. </p>

<li> <p> Bugfix (introduced: Postfix 2.3): don't reuse TCP connections
when smtp_tls_policy_maps is specified. TLS policies may depend on
the remote destination, but the Postfix &lt 2.11 SMTP connection cache
client does not distinguish between different destinations that
resolve to the same IP address. Victor Duchovni.  Found during
Postfix 2.11 code maintenance. </p>

<li> <p> Bugfix (introduced: Postfix 2.2): don't reuse TCP connections
when SASL authentication is enabled. SASL passwords may depend on
the remote SMTP server hostname, but the Postfix &lt 2.11 SMTP
connection cache client does not distinguish between different
hostnames that resolve to the same IP address.  Found during Postfix
2.11 code maintenance.  </p>

</ul>

listed at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.
