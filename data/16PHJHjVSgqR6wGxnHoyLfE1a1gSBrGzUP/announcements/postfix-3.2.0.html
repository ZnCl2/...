<h1> Postfix stable release 3.2.0 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.2.0.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.2.0.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 3.2.0 is available. This release ends support
for legacy release Postfix 2.10. </p>

<p> The main changes in no particular order are: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Elliptic curve negotiation with OpenSSL &ge; 1.0.2. This
changes the default smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade setting to "auto", and
introduces a new parameter tls_eecdh_auto_curves with the names of
curves that may be negotiated. </p>

<li> <p> Stored-procedure support for MySQL databases. Contributed
by John Fawcett. See the mysql_table(5) manpage for details.
</p>

<li> <p> Cidr: table support for if/endif and negation (by prepending
! to a pattern), just like regexp: and pcre: tables. See the
cidr_table(5) manpage for details. </p>

<li> <p> The postmap command and the inline: and texthash: maps now
support spaces in left-hand field of lookup table source text. Use
double quotes (") around a left-hand field that contains spaces,
and use backslash (\) to protect quotes in a left-hand field. </p>

<li> <p> Support for per-client Milter configuration (smtpd_milter_maps)
that overrides the main.cf smtpd_milters setting, and that has the
same syntax. A lookup result of "DISABLE" turns off Milter support
for that client. See MILTER_README.html for details. </p>

<li> <p> The local SMTP server IP address and port are available
in the policy delegation protocol (attribute names: server_address,
server_port), in the Milter protocol (macro names: {daemon_addr},
{daemon_port}), and in the XCLIENT protocol (attribute names:
DESTADDR, DESTPORT). </p>

<li> <p> For safety reasons, the Postfix sendmail -C option must
specify an authorized directory: the default configuration directory,
a directory that is listed in the default main.cf file with
alternate_config_directories or multi_instance_directories, otherwise
the command must be invoked with root privileges. This mitigates a
recurring "jail break" problem with the PHP mail() function. </p>

<li> <p> "PASS" and "STRIP" actions in header/body_checks. "STRIP"
is similar to "IGNORE" but also logs the action, and "PASS" disables
header, body, and Milter inspection for the remainder of the message
content. Contributed by Hobbit. </p>

<li> <p> The collate.pl script by Viktor Dukhovni for grouping
Postfix logfile records into "sessions" based on queue ID and process
ID information, in the auxiliary/collate directory of the Postfix
source tree. </p>

</ul>

<p> Disabled or removed behavior: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> SMTPUTF8 support: Postfix 3.2 disables the 'transitional'
compatibility between the IDNA2003 and IDNA2008 standards for
internationalized domain names (domain names beyond the limits of
US-ASCII). This makes Postfix behavior consistent with contemporary
web browsers. See RELEASE_NOTES for more. </p>

<li> <p> Postfix 3.2 removes tentative features that were implemented
before the DANE spec was finalized: support for certificate usage
PKIX-EE(1), the ability to disable digest agility, and the ability
to disable support for "TLSA 2 [01] [12]" records that specify the
digest of a trust anchor. See RELEASE_NOTES for more. </p>

</ul>
