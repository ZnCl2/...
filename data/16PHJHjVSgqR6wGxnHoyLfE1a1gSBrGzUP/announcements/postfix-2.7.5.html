<h1> Postfix legacy releases 2.7.5, 2.6.11 and 2.5.14 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.7.5.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.7.5.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix legacy releases 2.7.5, 2.6.11 and 2.5.14 are available.
These contain fixes and workarounds that were already included
with Postfix stable release 2.8.4. </p>

<p> Fixed with Postfix version 2.7.5, 2.6.11 and 2.5.14: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Performance: a high load of DSN success notification
requests could slow down the queue manager. Solution: make the trace
client asynchronous, just like the bounce and defer clients. </p>

<li> <p> The local(8) delivery agent ignored table lookup errors
in mailbox_command_maps, mailbox_transport_maps, fallback_transport_maps
and (while bouncing mail to alias) alias owner lookup. </p>

<li> <p> Workaround: dbl.spamhaus.org rejects lookups with "No IP
queries" even if the name has an alphanumerical prefix.  We play
safe, and skip both RHSBL and RHSWL queries for names ending in a
numerical suffix.  </p>

<li> <p> The Postfix Milter client reported a temporary error instead
of "file too large" in three cases. </p>

<li> <p> Linux kernel version 3 support. Linus Torvalds has reset
the counters for reasons not related to changes in code. </p>

</ul>

<p> Fixed with Postfix 2.7.5: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The "sendmail -t" command reported "protocol error" instead
of "file too large", "no space left on device" etc. </p>

</ul>

<p> You can find the updated Postfix source code at the mirrors
listed at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.
