<p> Fixed in all supported releases: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The Milter "replace sender" (SMFIR_CHGFROM) request lost
an address that was added with sender_bcc_maps, resulting in a "rcpt
count mismatch" warning. Reported by JÃ¶rg Backschues. This defect
was introduced with Postfix 2.6. </p>

<li> <p> The "bad filetype" example in the header_checks(5) manpage
falsely rejected Content- headers with ``name="example";
x-apple-part-url="example.com"''.  Reported by Cedric Knight. This
defect was introduced with Postfix 2.6. </p>

</ul>
