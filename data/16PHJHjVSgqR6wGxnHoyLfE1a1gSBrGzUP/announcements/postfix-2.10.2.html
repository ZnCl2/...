<h1> Postfix stable release 2.10.2 and legacy releases 2.9.8,
2.8.16, 2.7.15 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.10.2.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.10.2.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 2.10.2, and legacy releases 2.9.8, 2.8.16,
2.7.15 are available. They contain fixes and workarounds that are
also part of Postfix 2.11.  </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> TLS Interoperability workaround: turn on SHA-2 digests by
force.  This improves interoperability with clients and servers
that deploy SHA-2 digests without the required support for TLSv1.2-style
digest negotiation. </p>

<li> <p> TLS Performance workaround: the Postfix SMTP server TLS
session cache had become ineffective because recent OpenSSL versions
enable session tickets by default, resulting in a different ticket
encryption key for each smtpd(8) process.  The workaround turns off
session tickets. Postfix 2.11 will enable session tickets properly.
</p>

<li> <p> TLS Interoperability workaround: Debian Exim versions
before 4.80-3 may fail to communicate with Postfix and possibly
other MTAs, with the following Exim SMTP client error message: </p>

<blockquote> <p>
    TLS error on connection to server-name [server-address]
    (gnutls_handshake): The Diffie-Hellman prime sent by the server
    is not acceptable (not long enough)
</p> </blockquote>

<p> See the RELEASE_NOTES file for a Postfix SMTP server configuration
workaround. </p>

<li> <p> Bugfix (defect introduced: 1997): memory leak while
forwarding mail with the local(8) delivery agent, in code that
handles a cleanup(8) server error.  </p>

</ul>

<p> You can find the updated Postfix source code at the mirrors
listed at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.
