<h1> Postfix stable release 3.1.3 and legacy release 3.0.7 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.1.3.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.1.3.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 3.1.3 is available, as well as legacy
release 3.0.7. The fixes and workaround below are for problems that
affect Postfix version 3 releases. </p>

<p> Fixed with Postfix 3.1.3 and 3.0.7: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The Postfix SMTP server did not reset a previous session's
failed/total command counts before rejecting a client that exceeds
request or concurrency rates. This resulted in incorrect failed/total
command counts being logged at the end of the rejected session. </p>

<li> <p> The unionmap multi-table interface did not propagate table
lookup errors, resulting in false "user unknown" responses. </p>

<li> <p> The documentation was updated with a workaround for false
"not found" errors with MySQL map queries that contain UTF8-encoded
text.  The workaround is to specify "option_group = client" in
Postfix MySQL configuration files.  This will be the default setting
with Postfix 3.2 and later. </p>

</ul>

<p> You can find the updated Postfix source code at the mirrors
listed at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.
