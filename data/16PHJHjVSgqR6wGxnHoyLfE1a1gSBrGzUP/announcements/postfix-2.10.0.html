<h1> Postfix stable release 2.10.0 </h1>

<p> [An on-line version of this announcement will be available at
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.10.0.html">
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.10.0.html</a>] </p>

<p> Postfix stable release 2.10.0 is available.  As of now, Postfix
2.6 is no longer updated. </p>

<p> Main changes (see the RELEASE_NOTES file for details): </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Separation of relay policy (with smtpd_relay_restrictions)
from spam policy (with smtpd_{client, helo, sender,
recipient}_restrictions), which makes accidental open relay
configuration less likely.  The default is backwards compatible.
</p>

<li> <p> HAproxy load-balancer support for postscreen(8) and smtpd(8).
The nginx proxy was already supported by Postfix 2.9 smtpd(8), using
XCLIENT commands. </p>

<li> <p> Support for the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols, as well as
support to turn them off if needed for inter-operability. </p>

<li> <p> Laptop-friendly configuration. By default, Postfix now
uses UNIX-domain sockets instead of FIFOs, and thus avoids MTIME
file system updates on an idle mail system. </p>

<li> <p> Revised postconf(1) command. The "-x" option expands $name
in a parameter value (both main.cf and master.cf); the "-o name=value"
option overrides a main.cf parameter setting; and postconf(1) now
warns about a $name that has no name=value setting. </p>

<li> <p> Sendmail-style "socketmap" lookup tables. </p>

</ul>

<p> You can find the updated Postfix source code at the mirrors
listed at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.
