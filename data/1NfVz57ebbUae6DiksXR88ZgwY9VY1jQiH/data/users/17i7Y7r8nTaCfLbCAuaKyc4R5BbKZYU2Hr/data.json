I think that is to make ease for people to easily make a version of that site of there one.\n\nThat's right. But to allow people to clone, you also need to add `\"cloneable\": true,` to your content.json file.",

The manual method needs one simple command to sign the data/users/content.json file. It's really easy.

That's also a good reason to keep your Id well guarded. I made a post (mostly for fun) that takes care of that. Sadly it's limited to Linux and Mac users, [here it is](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1QLLPpowM6BWxKYKops1WkCafuFPhFBnAx/?Post:4:Changing+and+encrypting+ZeroIds).",
