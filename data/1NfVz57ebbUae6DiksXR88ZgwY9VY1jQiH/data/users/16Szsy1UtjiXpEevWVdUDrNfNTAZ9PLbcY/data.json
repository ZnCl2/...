Interesting.\n\nOother zerosites can accept the nanasi accounts with this appended to `cert_signers` in data/users/content.json etc.:\n```\n\"nanasi\": [ \"16PmAP6z2MCJX9jNjvMrteMfnqX4KeDRNT\" ],\n```\nif the site creator doesn't mind accounts without uniqueness guarantee, and proofs of work or IP filters that (non-bitmessage) ZeroID can potentially provide.\n\nBut I don't recommend to use Nanasi account for other sites since I'm still doing experiments like changing user name generation method.\nAnd I made this while thinking about per-site accounts, which can be a privacy enhancement (than current usage of one account for all sites).",
