			"body": "I keep finding myself awestruck by the simplicity of ZeroNet's choices.\n\nAfter buying my domain name (and a bunch of others ðŸ˜…) I proceeded to figuring out how to connecting it to my website. My first step was [ZeroName](http://zero/1Name2NXVi1RDPDgf5617UoW7xA6YrhM9F) and lo-and-behold, at the bottom of the page we have a little 'How to add a domain?` button that reveals the two simple steps that are needed to be done.\n\n![The steps on ZeroName](http://i.imgur.com/XQlxKLV.png)\n\nI configured my domain name and added the following JSON to my custom configuration section:\n```json\n  {\"zeronet\": {\"\": \"1NfVz57ebbUae6DiksXR88ZgwY9VY1jQiH\"}}\n```\n![Namecoin FTW!](http://i.imgur.com/RM70z6W.png)\n\nand updated my content.js file with the new domain:\n```json\n  {\n    ...\n    \"domain\": \"acehigh.bit\",\n    \"files\": {..},\n  }\n```\n\nThe Namecoin configuration didn't need any additional action besides clicking OK after adding the custom JSON config, but for ZeroNet there is another step we need to do and that's to sign and publish the new changes.\n\nI ran `$ zeronet.cmd siteSign 1NfVz57ebbUae6DiksXR88ZgwY9VY1jQiH [priv_key_reducted]` that did it's thing (be aware here - if you see something other than a successful message at the end of the output you might have done something wrong), and then I fired `$ zeronet.cmd sitePublish 1NfVz57ebbUae6DiksXR88ZgwY9VY1jQiH` and that finished almost instantly letting me know that it was published to 3 peers.\n\n![Signed and ready](http://i.imgur.com/95HipV8.png)\n\nAnd to make life simpler for you the reader, here are the steps copied from ZeroName for your convenience:\n\n## To register just add 'zeronet' key to your namecoin domain.\n\nThe \"\" key means the primary domain, any other than that is a subdomain. \n\nExample:\n```json\n {\n    \"name\": {\n        \"formatted\": \"ZeroNet project\"\n    },\n    \"bitcoin\": {\n        \"address\": \"1QDhxQ6PraUZa21ET5fYUCPgdrwBomnFgX\"\n    },\n    \"zeronet\": {\n        \"\": \"1EU1tbG9oC1A8jz2ouVwGZyQ5asrNsE4Vr\", \n        \"blog\": \"1BLogC9LN4oPDcruNz3qo1ysa133E9AGg8\", \n        \"talk\": \"1TaLk3zM7ZRskJvrh3ZNCDVGXvkJusPKQ\"\n    },\n    \"ns\": [\n       \"ns1.domaincoin.net\"\n       \"ns2.domaincoin.net\"\n    ]\n }\n```\n \nAfter the changes confirmed by Namecoin network the domain will automatically added to the registry and anyone can access your site using the registered domain.\n\nTo make the homepage (ZeroHello) link to your site domain you have to add a \"domain\" key to your site's content.json file, for example:\n```json\n {\n  \"address\": \"1TaLk3zM7ZRskJvrh3ZNCDVGXvkJusPKQ\", \n  \"background-color\": \"#F5F5F5\", \n  \"description\": \"Decentralized forum demo\", \n  \"domain\": \"Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit\", \n  \"files\": {\n  ...\n ```\n\nDone.\nNo, really - done."

			"body": "=================\nWORK IN PROGRESS\n=================\n*Note to self: Need to have drafts.*\n\n20 years ago our society was baffled by the idea of the internet. just look at this [short video from the Today Show from 1994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJku_CSyNg) and you'll get a good idea of how our culture perceived the concept of the internet back then.\nZeroNet is far easier to explain nowadays, but don't expect the general perception of ZeroNet to be anything else than that of the internet 20 years ago - people today know what the internet is, or at least they think so; The internet is Facebook, it's Google, it's Apple, it's our Smartphone, it's the movies that we download.\nWe're all pretty used to the idea, we all have a good understanding of how this thing works, even with concepts such as *The Cloud* we seem to go along just fine - the Internet is where you get content - some server hosts your stuff, you navigate your browser to Google to find that server, you type in some words to google, google checks out it's massive databases to see what is the most relevant website in relation to your search query, presents the results to you the user, and now you can click on a link and go to this different website that has what you need.\nAll very simple really - users have browsers to download and view content that server are hosting and processing.\nZeroNet is different. It's different first and foremost in the basic infrastructure that holds the internet - while the internet is built on distributed and decentralized client-server architecture, it relies heavily on knowing what server hosts what data and what domain is pointing to what server - a centralized DNS architecture, in ZeroNet there are no servers, there are no DNS servers, there are no Bouncers, there are no cloud providers. With ZeroNet one does not need to pay a hosting company to deliver their content to their users - with ZeroNet all you need is to create your website and then just share it with others - if they like it, they'll share it some more, and your content will reach more users faster.\n\nReddit, SlashDot, or Hacker News \"effect\" is different on ZeroNet - while on the regular internet if your puny website that is used to be served to a few dozens of visitors on a weekly/monthly basis is suddenly your content hits the front page of Reddit or Hacker News, you'd experience the Reddit Effect - the effect that causes your site to crash because your web hosting service just wasn't prepared for this - it had the appropriate resources for a small website that serves a few thousands of requests on a monthly basis, now crashes under the weight of millions of viewers that are sent from other popular website.\nWith ZeroNet the opposite will happen - if your site suddenly becomes popular everyone will have a far better experience with it because of the architecture that puts the hosting of the static files needed by the users to interpret your website are hosted on individual users computers, much like the movies and TV shows that we download from The Pirate Bay (or similar trackers) that are not hosted on any server, similarly ZeroNet content is not hosted on any server - it's all on the users computers - and the more users are trying to access a given website, or ZeroSite, the better the experience they all have - content loads faster instead of slower, the site is more responsive instead of becoming sluggish to a crawl, and the costs of any individual sharing the site is dropping dramatically unlike with traditional webhosting where the owner of the site would need to pay for the storage and bandwidth, here the collective users that enjoy the website are sharing the load of hosting it and serving it and the more individuals have the same file the less they collectively need to do to get it to more users.\n\nThis brings me to why ZeroNet is the next internet - one of the largest problems we have on the internet today is the cost of hosting an application or a website. That cost is being offset by the site/app owner implementing either a paywall around the site/app, or blasting its users with advertisements - both of which are hated by the users at large, including the users that are producing the content (see Kanye's recent Pirate Bay fiasco, or RIAA employees employees that were found with dozens of pirated movies on their laptops).\n\nWith ZeroNet there is no need to \"pay for the quality\" - unless you want to profit from your content, you have no reason to erect paywalls or plaster ads all over your application, and the users will also chose to move away from such business models once the alternatives show up. Facebook - keep your ears perked here, your business might be at risk if you don't act accordingly.\n\nTo be honest that is just the tip of the iceberg - ZeroNet is much larger than just saying 'There are no servers' - saying just that would be utterly underestimating the value that ZeroNet brings in - which is the empowerment of the open web.\nFor the past decade I've been building my career as a Front End Developer, primarily focusing on building web sites and apps using Javascript, HTML, and CSS - I've recognized the opportunity and the potential in the open web platform early in my career, and decided to focus heavily on developing those skills and learning anything and everything that might be relevant.\nThe reason for that is that I think that Javascript will eventually become the Lingua Franca of computer-to-human and human-to-computer of the web - meaning everyone and everything will be able to use this language to communicate - simply because it's good enough at doing that today, and because there are more devices that can run Javascript than there are devices that are connected to the internet, every new connected device such as a drone, or smart thermostat, or a tiny computer like Raspberry Pie that comes out these days supports Javascript out of the box.\nOne of the key reasons I fell in love with the open web platform is because it is open, look at any website or webapp that you like, right click anywhere on the screen and click 'View Source' - instantly you get all the information you need to understand how to recreate the same functionality and see how the developers did whatever it is that your interested in. This simple fact of life on the internet has enabled the high quality of products that we see now so readily available to anyone who needs them.\nMarketplaces like ThemeForest and free content platforms such as GitHub are providing a great service to our society as a whole - they enable us to build on top of lessons learned by others, experiments done by others, and tools developed by others so we can focus on building WhatApp, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and many many others - are products are becoming exponentially better because they incorporate all that the others have learned and on extremely short time scales.\nZeroNet reduces the time between seeing and copying even further by making the Clone ability a core built-in functionality that is available out of the box - if you see something you like, maybe ZeroHello, or ZeroTalk, you can instantly copy it and run your own version (and modify it if you wish) by simply clicking Clone.\nThis will accelerate the development cycle of the open web even more and we'll see amazing things start popping up everywhere and immediettely their copies using spreading like wildfire - everything we know about memes is absolutely applicable to ZeroSites - these tiny torrent files that contain some HTML, JS, CSS are the evolution of memes from basic textual formats, to images, then images with some text on them, then moving gifs... and now ZeroNet. If you've seen a gif that you like or a meme that you want to use, all you need to do is search for the source - the same is true for ZeroNet sites, only that copying and modifying ZeroNet sites is far easier than modifying a gif file or a youtube video.\n\nZeroNet is right now a fast, real-time, peer-to-peer, fully decentralized and distributed alternative to often-slow, client-to-server, overly centralized web application delivery stack - the internet.\n\nWith ZeroNet right now you can reach millions[1] of people who would gladly help you distribute the workload of storing and sending your data across the users of the site without investing any money into costly servers or any kind of infrastructure - everything is provided for free.\n\nThis is Bitcoin's killer app, and it's probably going to be bigger than Bitcoin and much faster. So perk your ears and open your eyes - because we're witnessing the transition from the internet - client-server architecture - to the zeronet - client-client architecture and it's going to be an exciting thing to witness.\n\n[1] More like thousands right now, tbh"

			"body": "So far my experience with ZeroNet was phenomenal - most of the things that I need or expect are there, and almost everything works, and works well. This is no easy feat, ladies and gentlemen, people have poured many hours of hard work into developing this platform for me to be able to deliver these words to you as easily as we witness it.\n\nI credit the high quality of work that goes into this project on account of the ZeroNet leadership choosing to use **existing tools** over trying to build everything from scratch.\n\nWhile competing technologies are either being rumored or actively tested in the wild, none are even comparably as easy to use as ZeroNet, their usefulness is primarily theoretical while ZeroNet allows me to talk to thousands of people right now using the browser as the Virtual Machine that executes the content of the ZeroSites that we so easily share amongst us, while the competitors promise of Turing completeness and advanced language mechanics, ZeroNet simply works right here, right now.\n\nWhat is the difference? ZeroNet uses a lot of existing tools and technologies - Data distribution/storage? Bittorent, Email? BitMessage, Identity management? Bitcoin's crypto (which is 100% compatible with bitcoin which makes it even more useful!), Virtual machine? The Browser!, Domain management? Namecoin, Anonymity? Tor Yes Sir!\n\nYou see, the developers realized that what was needed is a good tie-in between these mostly useless tools in their stand-alone model, using ZeroNet we get the benefits of all of these tools and technologies and their individual value increases orders of magnitude now that they're so well woven together into one simple use interface.\n\nAlthough the devs are doing an excellent job of tying in those tools together, they not necessarily have the ability to fully extend their development skills to those tools that they're employing, and one such example is the domain name registration process which is \"offloaded\" to Namecoin.\n\nUp until yesterday my interest in Namecoin was pure academic, and by that I mean I knew about its purpose and existence, planned several times on using it similarly to how ZeroNet is using it in my own projects but never actually got the opportunity to buy Namecoins or register .bit domains.\n\nBeing a long-time Bitcoin user I got used to the advancements we've made in the past 5 years in wallet technologies, with the ability to choose between a plethora of different wallets on any platform with different features that suit anyone's needs - I was taken aback when I downloaded and installed the Namecoin wallet - it's basically 2011's bitcoin wallet.\n\n![ZeroSites, eh?](http://i.imgur.com/rqw6hTx.png)\n\nSo far my experience was somewhat okay, but far more lacking than what ZeroNet is able to provide until now - I purchased 10nmc off of [shapeshift.io](https://shapeshift.io) - which took about 1 minute to setup, about 3-4 hours for the exchange to actually be executed (I guess Namecoin isn't traded as often as other crypto-currencies), and then another 2-3 minutes buying the domain names (I still haven't configured them though...).\n\nAll of that is only after I've downloaded the namecoin wallet and waited about 9 hours until it synchronized with the network, at times it felt like the progress bar is stuck on that dreaded `255 weeks behind` message.\n\nAfter all said and done, I think the process is fairly simple and even technically-challenged people can go through it with some persistence and focus. Furthermore I think that domain management services will be one of the first apps to be successful on ZeroNet as a business model (apart from the usual suspects - porn, piracy, and drugs) which in turn will solve the problem altogether and make the process as simple as creating a ZeroID."

I don't mean the left sidebar on some website that you have, I mean the one that you pull out from the right side by pulling the number 0 on the top right of the screen of this very page.\n\n![The hidden sidebar](http://i.imgur.com/gJeBt1c.png)\n![The rest of it - or is it?](http://i.imgur.com/l1GEa75.png)\n\nThe data it provides is admittedly basic, but even at that it's quite powerful giving you a glimpse of how many users are actively sharing the website, where are they from (really well done there with the 3D globe guys), the amount of data and storage the site uses.\nA very important feature that lies in that sidebar is the **Identity** field that you can *Change*; doing that will allow you to select what identity you are using to identify to this site - right now there isn't a simple way to manage multiple identities, but this already gives some basic abilities to switch back and forth once you have set up multiple identities or simply to use a unique one specifically for this website, which is thankfully the default option.\n\n![What ID would you like to use?](http://i.imgur.com/m5SL6z4.png)\n\nThere is another important feature that lies in the sidebar - the *This is my site* option that is usually turned off, but can be turned on to reveal a few other settings to make managing a ZeroNet site easier and simpler that any existing web hosting solution - but that's for another post.\n\n![My hidden sidebar](http://i.imgur.com/Fl2BkPM.png)"
