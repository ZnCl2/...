Anonymous connections are achieved by encrypting the user's traffic (by using end-to-end encryption), and sending it through a volunteer-run network of roughly 55,000 computers distributed around the world.  Given the high possibility of paths the traffic can transit, a third party watching a full connection is unlikely.  The software that [[Implementation|implements]] this layer is called an \"I2P [[Router (computing)|router]]\", and a computer running I2P is called an \"I2P [[Node (networking)|node]]\".  I2P is [[Free software|free]] and [[open source]], and is published under multiple [[software license|licenses]].\n\n== Technical design ==\nI2P is [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] software since 2003.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://geti2p.net/en/blog/ | type = blog | title = Get I2P}}.</ref>  The software's developers emphasize that there are likely to be [[Software bug|bugs]] in the beta version and that there has been insufficient [[peer review]] to date.<ref>{{cite web|title=Benefits of Tor over I2P| url= https://geti2p.net/en/comparison | publisher=I2P Dev Team | accessdate =23 December 2013}}</ref>  However, they believe the code is now reasonably stable and well-developed, and more exposure can help development of I2P.\n\nThe network itself is strictly message-based (like [[Internet Protocol|IP]]), but there is a [[Library (computing)|library]] available to allow reliable [[Streaming algorithm|streaming]] communication on top of it (similar to [[Transmission control protocol|TCP]], although from version 0.6 there is a new [[User datagram protocol|UDP]]-based [[Synchronization in telecommunications#Synchronization Supply Unit|SSU]] transport).  All communication is end-to-end [[encryption|encrypted]] (in total there are four layers of encryption used when sending a message) through [[garlic routing]],<ref>https://geti2p.net/en/docs/how/garlic-routing</ref> and even the [[Communication endpoint|end points]] (\"destinations\") are [[cryptographic]] identifiers (essentially a pair of [[public key]]s), so that neither sender nor recipient of a message need to reveal their [[IP address]] to the other side or to third-party observers.\n\nAlthough many developers had been a part of the ''Invisible IRC Project (IIP)''<ref>{{Citation | title = Invisible IP | publisher = Source forge | contribution = IIP | contribution-url = http://invisibleip.sourceforge.net/iip/}}.</ref> and [[Freenet]] communities, there are significant differences between their designs and concepts.  IIP was an anonymous centralized [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] server.  Freenet is a [[censorship]]-resistant [[distributed data store]].  I2P is an [[Anonymous P2P|anonymous peer-to-peer]] distributed communication layer designed to run ''any'' traditional internet service (e.g. [[Usenet]], [[email]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[file sharing]], [[Web hosting]] and [[HTTP]], [[Telnet]]), as well as more traditional distributed applications (e.g. a distributed data store, a [[web proxy]] network using [[Squid (software)|Squid]], or [[Domain Name System|DNS]]).\n\nMany developers of I2P are known only under [[Pseudonymity|pseudonyms]].  While the previous main developer, ''[[J. Random Hacker|jrandom]]'', is currently on hiatus,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://geti2p.net/en/misc/jrandom-awol|title=Jrandom's Announcement - I2P|website=geti2p.net|language=en|access-date=2017-07-15}}</ref> others, such as ''zzz'', ''killyourtv'', and ''Complication'' have continued to lead development efforts, and are assisted by numerous contributors.<ref name=\"team\"/>\n\nI2P uses 2048bit [[ElGamal]]/[[AES256]]/[[SHA256]]+Session Tags encryption<ref>https://geti2p.net/pl/docs/how/elgamal-aes</ref> and [[Ed25519]] [[EdDSA]]/[[ECDSA]]  [[Digital signature|signatures]].<ref>https://trac.i2p2.de/wiki/Crypto/ECDSA</ref>\n\n=== Releases ===\n\nI2P has had a stable release every six to eight weeks.

Depending on the client settings, torrents from the internet can be made available on I2P (via announcements to I2P's DHT network) and torrents from I2P can be made available to the internet. For this reason, torrents previously published only on I2P can be made available to the entire Internet, and users of I2P can often download popular content from the Internet while maintaining the anonymity of I2P.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/vuze-speeds-up-torrent-downloads-through-swarm-merging-150320/|title=Vuze Speeds Up Torrent Downloads Through \"Swarm Merging\" |date=20 March 2015 |work=[[TorrentFreak]] |accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.vuze.com/w/I2PHelper_HowTo#Network_Mixing |title=I2PHelper HowTo |work=VuzeWiki |accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Email ===\n[[File:I2PBote-inbox-0.4.png|thumb|A screenshot of the inbox of I2P-Bote.]]\n\n* ''I2P-Bote'' is a free, fully [[Decentralized computing|decentralized]] and distributed anonymous email system with a strong focus on security.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = I2P | title = I2P-Bote | url = http://bote.i2p.xyz/ | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150913030443/http://bote.i2p.xyz/ | archivedate = 2015-09-13 | df =  }}.</ref> It supports multiple identities and does not expose email [[metadata]]. {{As of | 2015}}, it is still considered [[beta version|beta software]]. I2P-Bote is accessible via the I2P [[web application|web console]] interface or using standard email protocols (i.e. [[IMAP]]/[[SMTP]]). All bote-mails are transparently end-to-end encrypted and signed by the sender's private key, thus removing the need for [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] or other email encryption software. I2P-Bote offers additional anonymity by allowing for the use of mail relays with variable length delays. Since it is decentralized, there is no centralized email server that could correlate different email identities as communicating with each other (i.e. ''profiling''). Even the [[Node (networking)|nodes]] relaying the mails do not know the sender, and apart from sender and receiver, only the end of the high-[[Latency (engineering)|latency]] mail route and the storing nodes will know to whom (which I2P-Bote address – the user's IP address is still hidden by I2P) the mail is destined. The original sender could have gone offline long before the email becomes available to the recipient. No account registration is necessary, all you have to do in order to use it is create a new identity. I2P-Bote can be installed as an I2P plugin .<ref>{{Citation | title = Plugins | url = http://plugins.i2p.xyz/plugins/i2pbote/ | publisher = I2P | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20150909185051/http://plugins.i2p.xyz/plugins/i2pbote/ | archivedate = 2015-09-09 | df =  }}</ref>\n* I2P also has a free pseudonymous e-mail service run by an individual called ''Postman''. [[Susimail]] is a [[web-based]] email client intended primarily for use with Postman's mail servers, and is designed with security and anonymity in mind. Susimail was created to address privacy concerns in using these servers directly using traditional email clients, such as leaking the user's hostname while communicating with the SMTP server. It is currently included in the default I2P distribution, and can be accessed through the I2P router console web interface. Mail.i2p can contact both I2P email users, via user@mail.i2p and public internet email users from a user@i2pmail.org address.\n* [[Bitmessage#Bitmessage.ch|Bitmessage.ch]] can be used over I2P or Tor.\n\n=== Instant Messaging ===\n* ''I2P-Messenger'' is a simple [[Qt (framework)|Qt]]-based, serverless, end-to-end-encrypted [[instant messenger]] for I2P.<ref>{{Citation | title = Introducing I2P | url = https://geti2p.net/en/docs/how/tech-intro#app.i2pmessenger | date = Nov 10, 2015}}</ref> No servers can log the user's conversations. No ISP can log with whom the user chats, when, or for how long. As it is serverless, it can make use of I2P's end-to-end encryption, preventing any node between two parties from having access to the plain text. I2P-Messenger can be used for fully anonymous instant communication with persons the user doesn't even know, or, alternatively, to communicate securely and untraceably with friends, family members, or colleagues. <!--\"Thus, it is also a useful tool against data retention in a surveillance society\" Is this the part that is soapboxy?--> In addition to messaging, [[file transfer]] is also supported.\n* ''I2P-Talk'' is another simple instant messenger incompatible with I2P-Messenger, but having the same security properties\n\n=== Publishing ===\n* ''[[Syndie]]'' is a content distribution application, suitable for [[blogs]], [[newsgroups]], [[Internet forum|forums]] and small media attachments. Syndie is designed for [[Resilience_(network) | network resilience]]. It supports connections to I2P, the Tor network (Syndie does not support Socks proxies, workaround needed for Tor access), Freenet and the regular internet. Server connections are intermittent, and support [[Network_performance#Examples_of_latency_or_throughput_dominated_systems|higher-latency communications]]. Connections can be made to any number of known servers. Content is spread efficiently using a [[Gossip protocol]]. \n* ''Aktie'' is an anonymous file sharing and distributed [[Web of trust]] forums system.  Aktie can connect to I2P with its internal router or use an external router. To fight spam, \"hash payments\" (proof of CPU work) is computed for every published item.\n\n=== Routers ===\n* I2PBerry is a Linux distribution which can be used as a router to encrypt and route network traffic through the I2P network.\n\n* Kovri is an I2P router written in C++.<ref>https://getkovri.org/index.html</ref> It was forked from i2pd following developer disagreements.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the difference between i2pd and Kovri?|url=http://monero.stackexchange.com/a/2327/42|website=StackExchange|accessdate=4 March 2017}}</ref> Kovri's primary purpose is to integrate with the cryptocurrency [[Monero (cryptocurrency)|Monero]] to send new transaction information over I2P, making it much more difficult to find which node is the origin of a transaction request.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kovri - Moneropedia|url=https://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/moneropedia/kovri|website=GetMonero|accessdate=4 March 2017}}</ref> Those using the Kovri router will be running full I2P routers that contribute to the I2P network the same way the current [[Java (programming language)|Java]] router does.

Anonymous connections are achieved by encrypting the user's traffic (by using end-to-end encryption), and sending it through a volunteer-run network of roughly 55,000 computers distributed around the world.  Given the high possibility of paths the traffic can transit, a third party watching a full connection is unlikely.  The software that [[Implementation|implements]] this layer is called an \"I2P [[Router (computing)|router]]\", and a computer running I2P is called an \"I2P [[Node (networking)|node]]\".  I2P is [[Free software|free]] and [[open source]], and is published under multiple [[software license|licenses]].\n\n== Technical design ==\nI2P is [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] software since 2003.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://geti2p.net/en/blog/ | type = blog | title = Get I2P}}.</ref>  The software's developers emphasize that there are likely to be [[Software bug|bugs]] in the beta version and that there has been insufficient [[peer review]] to date.<ref>{{cite web|title=Benefits of Tor over I2P| url= https://geti2p.net/en/comparison | publisher=I2P Dev Team | accessdate =23 December 2013}}</ref>  However, they believe the code is now reasonably stable and well-developed, and more exposure can help development of I2P.\n\nThe network itself is strictly message-based (like [[Internet Protocol|IP]]), but there is a [[Library (computing)|library]] available to allow reliable [[Streaming algorithm|streaming]] communication on top of it (similar to [[Transmission control protocol|TCP]], although from version 0.6 there is a new [[User datagram protocol|UDP]]-based [[Synchronization in telecommunications#Synchronization Supply Unit|SSU]] transport).  All communication is end-to-end [[encryption|encrypted]] (in total there are four layers of encryption used when sending a message) through [[garlic routing]],<ref>https://geti2p.net/en/docs/how/garlic-routing</ref> and even the [[Communication endpoint|end points]] (\"destinations\") are [[cryptographic]] identifiers (essentially a pair of [[public key]]s), so that neither sender nor recipient of a message need to reveal their [[IP address]] to the other side or to third-party observers.\n\nAlthough many developers had been a part of the ''Invisible IRC Project (IIP)''<ref>{{Citation | title = Invisible IP | publisher = Source forge | contribution = IIP | contribution-url = http://invisibleip.sourceforge.net/iip/}}.</ref> and [[Freenet]] communities, there are significant differences between their designs and concepts.  IIP was an anonymous centralized [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] server.  Freenet is a [[censorship]]-resistant [[distributed data store]].  I2P is an [[Anonymous P2P|anonymous peer-to-peer]] distributed communication layer designed to run ''any'' traditional internet service (e.g. [[Usenet]], [[email]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[file sharing]], [[Web hosting]] and [[HTTP]], [[Telnet]]), as well as more traditional distributed applications (e.g. a distributed data store, a [[web proxy]] network using [[Squid (software)|Squid]], or [[Domain Name System|DNS]]).\n\nMany developers of I2P are known only under [[Pseudonymity|pseudonyms]].

''I2P-BT'' is a BitTorrent client for I2P that allows anonymous swarming for [[file sharing]]. This client is a modified version of the original BitTorrent 3.4.2 program which runs on [[Microsoft|MS]] Windows and most dialects of [[Unix]] in a GUI and command-line environment. It was developed by the individual known as 'duck' on I2P in cooperation with 'smeghead'. It is no longer being actively developed; however, there is a small effort to upgrade the I2P-BT client up to par with the BitTorrent 4.0 release. ''I2PRufus'' is an I2P port of the Rufus BitTorrent client.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://rufus.sourceforge.net/ | title = Rufus – BitTorrent Client |work= Sourceforge}}.</ref>  [[Robert (P2P Software)]] is the most actively maintained I2PRufus fork. XD is a standalone BitTorrent client written in Go.<ref>https://github.com/majestrate/XD/</ref>\n*  Two [[Kad network]] clients exist for the I2P network, ''iMule'' and ''Nachtblitz''. [[iMule]] (''invisible Mule'') is a port of [[eMule]] for I2P network. iMule has not been developed since 2013. iMule is made for anonymous file sharing. In contrast to other [[eDonkey network|eDonkey]] clients, iMule only uses the [[Kademlia]] for proceeding to connect through I2P network, so no servers are needed. Nachtblitz<ref>{{Citation | url = https://echelon.i2p.xyz/nachtblitz | title = Official Nachtblitz Resource | publisher = nachtblitz}}</ref> is a custom client built on the .NET Framework. The latest version is 1.4.27, released on March 23, 2016<ref>http://echelon.i2p.xyz/nachtblitz/changelog.txt</ref>. Nachtblitz includes a time lock to disable the software one year after its release date. \n* [[I2Phex]] is a port of the popular [[Gnutella]] client [[Phex]] to I2P. It is stable and fairly functional.\n* A port of [[Tahoe-LAFS]] has been ported to I2P. This allows for files to be anonymously stored in Tahoe-LAFS grids.\n\n==== Bridging to Clearnet ====\nCurrently, Vuze and BiglyBT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/former-vuze-developers-launch-biglybt-a-new-open-source-torrent-client-170803/|title=Former Vuze Developers Launch BiglyBT, a ‘New’ Open Source Torrent Client |work=[[TorrentFreak]] |accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biglybt.com/|title=BiglyBT - Bittorrent Client |work=[[BiglyBT]] |accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref> are the only torrent clients that make clearnet (connections not through I2P) torrents available on I2P and vice versa, by using a plugin that connects them to the I2P network. Depending on the client settings, torrents from the internet can be made available on I2P (via announcements to I2P's DHT network) and torrents from I2P can be made available to the internet. For this reason, torrents previously published only on I2P can be made available to the entire Internet, and users of I2P can often download popular content from the Internet while maintaining the anonymity of I2P.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/vuze-speeds-up-torrent-downloads-through-swarm-merging-150320/|title=Vuze Speeds Up Torrent Downloads Through \"Swarm Merging\" |date=20 March 2015 |work=[[TorrentFreak]] |accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.vuze.com/w/I2PHelper_HowTo#Network_Mixing |title=I2PHelper HowTo |work=VuzeWiki |accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Email ===\n[[File:I2PBote-inbox-0.4.png|thumb|A screenshot of the inbox of I2P-Bote.]]\n\n* ''I2P-Bote'' is a free, fully [[Decentralized computing|decentralized]] and distributed anonymous email system with a strong focus on security.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = I2P | title = I2P-Bote | url = http://bote.i2p.xyz/ | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150913030443/http://bote.i2p.xyz/ | archivedate = 2015-09-13 | df =  }}.</ref> It supports multiple identities and does not expose email [[metadata]]. {{As of | 2015}}, it is still considered [[beta version|beta software]]. I2P-Bote is accessible via the I2P [[web application|web console]] interface or using standard email protocols (i.e. [[IMAP]]/[[SMTP]]). All bote-mails are transparently end-to-end encrypted and signed by the sender's private key, thus removing the need for [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] or other email encryption software. I2P-Bote offers additional anonymity by allowing for the use of mail relays with variable length delays. Since it is decentralized, there is no centralized email server that could correlate different email identities as communicating with each other (i.e. ''profiling''). Even the [[Node (networking)|nodes]] relaying the mails do not know the sender, and apart from sender and receiver, only the end of the high-[[Latency (engineering)|latency]] mail route and the storing nodes will know to whom (which I2P-Bote address – the user's IP address is still hidden by I2P) the mail is destined. The original sender could have gone offline long before the email becomes available to the recipient. No account registration is necessary, all you have to do in order to use it is create a new identity. I2P-Bote can be installed as an I2P plugin .<ref>{{Citation | title = Plugins | url = http://plugins.i2p.xyz/plugins/i2pbote/ | publisher = I2P | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20150909185051/http://plugins.i2p.xyz/plugins/i2pbote/ | archivedate = 2015-09-09 | df =  }}</ref>\n* I2P also has a free pseudonymous e-mail service run by an individual called ''Postman''. [[Susimail]] is a [[web-based]] email client intended primarily for use with Postman's mail servers, and is designed with security and anonymity in mind. Susimail was created to address privacy concerns in using these servers directly using traditional email clients, such as leaking the user's hostname while communicating with the SMTP server. It is currently included in the default I2P distribution, and can be accessed through the I2P router console web interface. Mail.i2p can contact both I2P email users, via user@mail.i2p and public internet email users from a user@i2pmail.org address.\n* [[Bitmessage#Bitmessage.ch|Bitmessage.ch]] can be used over I2P or Tor.\n\n=== Instant Messaging ===\n* ''I2P-Messenger'' is a simple [[Qt (framework)|Qt]]-based, serverless, end-to-end-encrypted [[instant messenger]] for I2P.<ref>{{Citation | title = Introducing I2P | url = https://geti2p.net/en/docs/how/tech-intro#app.i2pmessenger | date = Nov 10, 2015}}</ref> No servers can log the user's conversations. No ISP can log with whom the user chats, when, or for how long. As it is serverless, it can make use of I2P's end-to-end encryption, preventing any node between two parties from having access to the plain text. I2P-Messenger can be used for fully anonymous instant communication with persons the user doesn't even know, or, alternatively, to communicate securely and untraceably with friends, family members, or colleagues. <!--\"Thus, it is also a useful tool against data retention in a surveillance society\" Is this the part that is soapboxy?--> In addition to messaging, [[file transfer]] is also supported.\n* ''I2P-Talk'' is another simple instant messenger incompatible with I2P-Messenger, but having the same security properties\n\n=== Publishing ===\n* ''[[Syndie]]'' is a content distribution application, suitable for [[blogs]], [[newsgroups]], [[Internet forum|forums]] and small media attachments. Syndie is designed for [[Resilience_(network) | network resilience]]. It supports connections to I2P, the Tor network (Syndie does not support Socks proxies, workaround needed for Tor access), Freenet and the regular internet. Server connections are intermittent, and support [[Network_performance#Examples_of_latency_or_throughput_dominated_systems|higher-latency communications]]. Connections can be made to any number of known servers. Content is spread efficiently using a [[Gossip protocol]]. \n* ''Aktie'' is an anonymous file sharing and distributed [[Web of trust]] forums system.
