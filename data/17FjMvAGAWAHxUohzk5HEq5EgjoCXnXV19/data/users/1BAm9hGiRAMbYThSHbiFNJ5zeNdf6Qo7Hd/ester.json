R can also be a hydrogen atom.]]\nIn [[chemistry]], an '''ester''' is a [[chemical compound]] derived from an [[acid]] (organic or inorganic) in which at least one –OH (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an –O–[[alkyl]] ([[alkoxy]]) group.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title = esters | file = E02219}}</ref>  Usually, esters are derived from a [[carboxylic acid]] and an [[alcohol]].  [[Glyceride]]s, which are [[fatty acid ester]]s of [[glycerol]], are important esters in biology, being one of the main classes of [[lipids]], and making up the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils. Esters with low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and found in [[essential oil]]s and [[pheromone]]s. [[Phosphoester]]s form the backbone of [[DNA]] molecules. [[Nitrate ester]]s, such as [[nitroglycerin]], are known for their explosive properties, while [[polyester]]s are important [[plastic]]s, with monomers linked by ester [[moiety (chemistry)|moieties]].\n<!--template from Chem MOS on cmpd types: \nLede\n\n2 Structure and bonding\n3 Properties\n4 Characterization\n5 Applications\n6 Occurrence\n7 Preparation \n8 Reactions \n9 History\n10 Safety-->\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe word 'ester' was coined in 1848 by a German chemist [[Leopold Gmelin]],<ref>Leopold Gmelin, ''Handbuch der Chemie'', vol. 4: ''Handbuch der organischen Chemie'' (vol. 1) (Heidelberg, Baden (Germany): Karl Winter, 1848), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4ooMAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA182&lpg=PA182#v=onepage&q&f=false page 182].<br />\nOriginal text:<blockquote>b.

Ester or oxy-acid ethers.<br />Ethers of the third type.<br /><br />Many mineral and organic acids containing oxygen combine with an alcohol upon elimination of water to [form] neutral, volatile ether compounds, which one can view as coupled compounds of alcohol and acid-water, or, according to the theory of radicals, as salts in which an acid is bonded with an ether. </blockquote></ref> probably as a contraction of the German ''Essigäther'', \"[[Ethyl acetate|acetic ether]]\".\n\n=== IUPAC nomenclature ===\n{{Main|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Esters}}\nEster names are derived from the parent alcohol and the parent acid, where the latter may be organic or inorganic. Esters derived from the simplest carboxylic acids are commonly named according to the more traditional, so-called \"[[trivial names]]\" e.g. as formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as opposed to the IUPAC nomenclature methanoate, ethanoate, propanoate and butanoate. Esters derived from more complex carboxylic acids are, on the other hand, more frequently named using the systematic IUPAC name, based on the name for the acid followed by the suffix ''-oate''. For example, the ester hexyl octanoate, also known under the trivial name hexyl [[Caprylic acid|caprylate]], has the formula CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>.\n\n[[Image:EtOAcImp.png|thumb|Ethyl acetate derived from an alcohol (blue) and an [[acyl]] group (yellow) derived from a carboxylic acid]]\n\nThe chemical formulas of organic esters usually take the form RCO<sub>2</sub>R′, where R and R′ are the hydrocarbon parts of the carboxylic acid and the alcohol, respectively. For example, [[butyl acetate]] (systematically butyl ethanoate), derived from [[n-Butanol|butanol]] and [[acetic acid]] (systematically ethanoic acid) would be written CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>. Alternative presentations are common including BuOAc and CH<sub>3</sub>COOC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>.\n\nCyclic esters are called [[lactone]]s, regardless of whether they are derived from an organic or an inorganic acid. One example of a (organic) lactone is [[gamma-valerolactone|γ-valerolactone]].\n\n=== Orthoesters ===\nAn uncommon class of organic esters are the [[orthoester]]s, which have the formula RC(OR′)<sub>3</sub>. Triethylorthoformate (HC(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) is derived, in terms of its name (but not its synthesis) from [[orthoformic acid]] (HC(OH)<sub>3</sub>) and [[ethanol]].\n\n=== Inorganic esters===\n[[Image:Phosphate Group.svg|130px|thumb|A phosphoric acid ester]]\nEsters can also be derived from an inorganic acid and an alcohol. Thus, the nomenclature extends to inorganic oxo acids and their corresponding esters: [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phosphate esters]]/[[organophosphate]]s, [[sulfuric acid]] and sulfate esters/[[organosulfate]]s, [[nitric acid]] and [[nitrate]], and [[boric acid]] and [[borate#Borate esters|borate]]s. For example, [[triphenyl phosphate]] is the ester derived from [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phenol]]. Organic carbonates are derived from [[carbonic acid]]; for example, [[ethylene carbonate]] is derived from carbonic acid and [[ethylene glycol]].\n\nSo far an alcohol and inorganic acid are linked via oxygen atoms. The definition of inorganic acid ester that feature inorganic chemical elements links between alcohols and the inorganic acid – the phosphorus atom linking to three [[alkoxy]] functional groups in [[organophosphate]] – can be extended to the same elements in various combinations of [[covalent bonds]] between carbons and the central inorganic atom and carbon–oxygen bonds to central inorganic atoms. For example, phosphorus features '''three''' carbon–oxygen–phosphorus bondings and one phosphorus–oxygen ''double bond'' in '''organophosphates''',\n\n[[File:Phosphate formula.svg|130px|thumb|structure of a generic organophosphate]]\n\n'''three''' carbon–oxygen–phosphorus bondings and '''no''' phosphorus–oxygen '''double bonds''' in '''[[phosphite ester]]s''' or '''organophosphites''',\n\n[[Image:Phosphite.png|130px|thumb|structure of a generic phosphite ester showing the [[lone pairs]] on the P]]\n\n'''two''' carbon–oxygen–phosphorus bondings, '''no''' phosphorus–oxygen '''double bonds''' but '''one''' phosphorus–carbon bond in '''phosphonites''',\n\n[[File:Phosphonite.svg|130px|thumb|structure of a generic phosphonite – ester of phosphonous acid]]\n\n'''one''' carbon–oxygen–phosphorus bondings, '''no''' phosphorus–oxygen '''double bonds''' but '''two''' phosphorus–carbon bonds in '''phosphinites'''.\n\n[[File:Generic-phosphinite-2D.png|150px|thumb|structure of a generic phosphinite.]]\n\nIn corollary, [[Organoboron chemistry#Borinic and boronic acids and esters|boron]] features [[borinic ester]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), [[boronic ester]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1), and [[borate]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0).\n\nAs oxygen is a [[group 16]] chemical element, sulfur atoms can replace some oxygen atoms in carbon–oxygen–central inorganic atom covalent bonds of an ester. As a result, '''[[thiosulfinate]]s''' and ''[[thiosulfonate]]s''', with a central inorganic sulfur atom, demonstrate clearly the assortment of [[organosulfur compounds|sulfur]] esters, that also includes '''[[organosulfate|sulfate]]s''', '''[[sulfite]]s''', '''[[sulfonate]]s''', '''[[sulfinate]]s''', '''[[sulfenate]]s''' esters.\n\n== Structure and bonding ==\nEsters contain a [[carbonyl]] center, which gives rise to 120&nbsp;° C–C–O and O–C–O angles. Unlike [[amide]]s, esters are structurally flexible functional groups because rotation about the C–O–C bonds has a low barrier. Their flexibility and low polarity is manifested in their physical properties; they tend to be less rigid (lower melting point) and more volatile (lower boiling point) than the corresponding amides.<ref name=March>March, J.

The preference for the Z conformation is influenced by the nature of the substituents and solvent, if present.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Diwakar M. Pawar | author2 = Abdelnaser A.

They participate in [[hydrogen bond]]s as hydrogen-bond acceptors, but cannot act as hydrogen-bond donors, unlike their parent alcohols. This ability to participate in hydrogen bonding confers some water-solubility. Because of their lack of hydrogen-bond-donating ability, esters do not self-associate. Consequently, esters are more volatile than [[carboxylic acid]]s of similar molecular weight.<ref name=March/>\n\n=== Characterization and analysis ===\nEsters are generally identified by gas chromatography, taking advantage of their volatility. [[IR spectroscopy|IR spectra]] for esters feature an intense sharp band in the range 1730–1750&nbsp;cm<sup>−1</sup> assigned to ''ν''<sub>C=O</sub>. This peak changes depending on the functional groups attached to the carbonyl. For example, a benzene ring or double bond in conjugation with the carbonyl will bring the wavenumber down about 30&nbsp;cm<sup>−1</sup>.\n\n== Applications and occurrence ==\nEsters are widespread in nature and are widely used in industry. In nature, [[fat]]s are in general triesters derived from [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acid]]s.<ref>Isolation of triglyceride from nutmeg: G. D. Beal \"Trimyristen\" Organic Syntheses, Coll.

Esters are common in organic chemistry and biological materials, and often have a characteristic pleasant, fruity odor. This leads to their extensive use in the [[fragrance]] and [[flavoring|flavor]] industry. Ester bonds are also found in many [[polymer]]s.\n\n===Esterification of carboxylic acids===\nThe classic synthesis is the [[Fischer esterification]], which involves treating a carboxylic acid with an alcohol in the presence of a [[Dehydration reaction|dehydrating]] agent:\n:RCO<sub>2</sub>H + R′OH {{eqm}} RCO<sub>2</sub>R′ + H<sub>2</sub>O\nThe equilibrium constant for such reactions is about 5 for typical esters, e.g., ethyl acetate.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Roger J. | last2 = Gabriel | first2 = Alton | last3 = Andrews | first3 = Roy C. | year = 1928 | title = The Relation Between the Hydrolysis Equilibrium Constant of Esters and the Strengths of the Corresponding Acids | url = | journal = J.

[[Sulfuric acid]] is a typical catalyst for this reaction. Many other acids are also used such as [[Dowex|polymeric sulfonic acids]]. Since esterification is highly reversible, the yield of the ester can be improved using [[Le Chatelier's principle]]:\n* Using the alcohol in large excess (i.e., as a solvent).\n* Using a dehydrating agent: sulfuric acid not only catalyzes the reaction but sequesters water (a reaction product). Other drying agents such as [[molecular sieves]] are also effective.\n* Removal of water by physical means such as [[distillation]] as a low-boiling [[azeotrope]]s with [[toluene]], in conjunction with a [[Dean-Stark apparatus]].\n\nReagents are known that drive the dehydration of mixtures of alcohols and carboxylic acids. One example is the [[Steglich esterification]], which is a method of forming esters under mild conditions. The method is popular in [[peptide synthesis]], where the substrates are sensitive to harsh conditions like high heat. DCC ([[dicyclohexylcarbodiimide]]) is used to activate the carboxylic acid to further reaction. [[4-Dimethylaminopyridine]] (DMAP) is used as an acyl-transfer [[catalyst]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = B. Neises | author2 = W.

The method is useful in specialized organic synthetic operations but is considered too hazardous and expensive for large scale applications.\n\n=== Alcoholysis of acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides ===\nAlcohols react with [[acyl chloride]]s and [[acid anhydride]]s to give esters:\n: RCOCl + R′OH → RCO<sub>2</sub>R′ + HCl\n: (RCO)<sub>2</sub>O + R′OH → RCO<sub>2</sub>R′ + RCO<sub>2</sub>H\n\nThe reactions are irreversible simplifying [[work-up (chemistry)|work-up]]. Since acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides also react with water, anhydrous conditions are preferred. The analogous acylations of amines to give [[amide]]s are less sensitive because amines are stronger nucleophiles and react more rapidly than does water. This method is employed only for laboratory-scale procedures, as it is expensive.\n\n===Alkylation of carboxylate salts===\nAlthough not widely employed for esterifications, salts of carboxylate anions can be alkylating agent with [[alkyl halide]]s to give esters. In the case that an [[alkyl chloride]] is used, an iodide salt can catalyze the reaction ([[Finkelstein reaction]]). The carboxylate salt is often generated ''in situ''. In difficult cases, the silver carboxylate may be used, since the silver ion coordinates to the halide aiding its departure and improving the reaction rate. This reaction can suffer from anion availability problems and, therefore, can benefit from the addition of [[phase transfer catalyst]]s or highly polar [[aprotic solvent]]s such as [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]].\n\n===Transesterification===\n[[Transesterification]], which involves changing one ester into another one, is widely practiced:\n: RCO<sub>2</sub>R′ + CH<sub>3</sub>OH → RCO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + R′OH\nLike the hydrolysation, transesterification is catalysed by acids and bases. The reaction is widely used for degrading [[triglyceride]]s, e.g. in the production of fatty acid esters and alcohols. [[Poly(ethylene terephthalate)]] is produced by the transesterification of [[dimethyl terephthalate]] and ethylene glycol:<ref name=Ullmann/> \n: (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)(CO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2&nbsp;C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> → {{frac|''n''}}&nbsp;{(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)(CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)}<sub>''n''</sub> + 2&nbsp;CH<sub>3</sub>OH\n\n===Carbonylation===\nAlkenes undergo \"[[hydroesterification]]\" in the presence of [[metal carbonyl]] catalysts. Esters of [[propionic acid]] are produced commercially by this method:\n:C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + ROH + CO → C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>R\nThe carbonylation of [[methanol]] yields [[methyl formate]], which is the main commercial source of [[formic acid]].

The carbonyl is weakly electrophilic but is attacked by strong nucleophiles (amines, alkoxides, hydride sources, organolithium compounds, etc.). The C–H bonds adjacent to the carbonyl are weakly acidic but undergo deprotonation with strong bases. This process is the one that usually initiates condensation reactions. The carbonyl oxygen in esters is weakly basic, less so than the carbonyl oxygen in amides due to resonance donation of an electron pair from nitrogen in amides, but forms [[adduct]]s.\n\n===Addition of nucleophiles at carbonyl <!--[[Ester hydrolysis]] redirects here-->===\nEsterification is a reversible reaction. Esters undergo [[hydrolysis]] under acid and basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, the reaction is the reverse reaction of the [[Fischer esterification]]. Under basic conditions, [[hydroxide]] acts as a nucleophile, while an alkoxide is the leaving group. This reaction, [[saponification]], is the basis of soap making.\n:[[Image:Ester hydrolysis.png|400px|Ester saponification (basic hydrolysis)]]\n\nThe alkoxide group may also be displaced by stronger nucleophiles such as [[ammonia]] or primary or secondary [[amine]]s to give [[amide]]s: (ammonolysis reaction)\n:: RCO<sub>2</sub>R′ + NH<sub>2</sub>R″ → RCONHR″ + R′OH\nThis reaction is not usually reversible. Hydrazines and hydroxylamine can be used in place of amines. Esters can be converted to [[isocyanate]]s through intermediate [[hydroxamic acid]]s in the [[Lossen rearrangement]].\n\nSources of carbon nucleophiles, e.g., [[Grignard reagent]]s and organolithium compounds, add readily to the carbonyl.\n\n=== Reduction ===\nCompared to ketones and aldehydes, esters are [[Carbonyl reduction#Trends in carbonyl reactivity|relatively resistant to reduction]]. The introduction of catalytic hydrogenation in the early part of the 20th century was a breakthrough; esters of fatty acids are hydrogenated to [[fatty alcohol]]s.\n:: RCO<sub>2</sub>R′ + 2&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub> → RCH<sub>2</sub>OH + R′OH\nA typical catalyst is [[copper chromite]]. Prior to the development of [[catalytic hydrogenation]], esters were reduced on a large scale using the [[Bouveault–Blanc reduction]]. This method, which is largely obsolete, uses sodium in the presence of proton sources.\n\nEspecially for fine chemical syntheses, [[lithium aluminium hydride]] is used to reduce esters to two primary alcohols. The related reagent sodium borohydride is slow in this reaction. [[DIBAH]] reduces esters to aldehydes.<ref>{{cite web | author = W.

Deprotonation requires relatively strong bases, such as [[alkoxide]]s. Deprotonation gives a nucleophilic [[enolate]], which can further react, e.g., the [[Claisen condensation]] and its intramolecular equivalent, the [[Dieckmann condensation]]. This conversion is exploited in the [[malonic ester synthesis]], wherein the diester of [[malonic acid]] reacts with an electrophile (e.g., [[alkyl halide]]), and is subsequently decarboxylated.

Protecting a carboxylic acid is useful in peptide synthesis, to prevent self-reactions of the bifunctional [[amino acid]]s. Methyl and ethyl esters are commonly available for many amino acids; the ''t''-butyl ester tends to be more expensive. However, ''t''-butyl esters are particularly useful because, under strongly acidic conditions, the ''t''-butyl esters undergo elimination to give the carboxylic acid and [[isobutylene]], simplifying work-up.\n\n==List of ester odorants ==\nMany esters have distinctive fruit-like odors, and many occur naturally in the essential oils of plants.
