For example: [[DNSSec]] offers a decentralized, human-meaningful naming scheme, but is not secure against compromise by the root; [[.onion]] addresses and [[bitcoin]] addresses are secure and decentralized but not human-meaningful; and [[I2P]] uses name translation services which are secure (as they run locally) and provide human-meaningful names - but fail to provide unique entities when used globally in a decentralised network without authorities.\n\n== Solutions ==\nSeveral systems which exhibit all three properties of Zooko's triangle have now been created, including:\n* Computer scientist [[Nick Szabo]]'s paper \"Secure Property Titles with Owner Authority\" illustrated that all three properties can be achieved [[up to]] the limits of [[Byzantine fault tolerance]].<ref>[[Nick Szabo]], [http://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles/ Secure Property Titles], 1998</ref>\n* Activist [[Aaron Swartz]] described a naming system based on [[Bitcoin]] employing Bitcoin's distributed blockchain as a proof-of-work to establish consensus of domain name ownership.<ref>Aaron Swartz, [http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/squarezooko Squaring the Triangle: Secure, Decentralized, Human-Readable Names], Aaron Swartz, January 6, 2011</ref> These systems remain vulnerable to [[Sybil attack]],<ref>Dan Kaminsky, [http://dankaminsky.com/2011/01/13/spelunk-tri/ Spelunking the Triangle: Exploring Aaron Swartz’s Take On Zooko’s Triangle], January 13, 2011</ref> but are secure under Byzantine assumptions.\nSeveral platforms implement refutations of Zooko's conjecture, including: [[Twister (software)|Twister]] (which use the later Aaron Swartz system with a bitcoin-like system), Blockstack (which can run on any blockchain and currently uses Bitcoin), [[Namecoin]] (separate blockchain), and [[Monero (cryptocurrency)|Monero]] [[OpenAlias]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://openalias.org/ |title=OpenAlias |author=Monero core team |date=2014-09-19 |accessdate=2015-02-03}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Petname]]\n* [[GNU Name System]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, [https://web.archive.org/web/20011020191610/http://zooko.com/distnames.html Names: Decentralized, Secure, Human-Meaningful: Choose Two] &ndash; the essay highlighting this difficulty\n* [[Marc Stiegler]], [http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/petnames/IntroPetNames.html An Introduction to Petname Systems] &ndash; a clear introduction\n* Nick Szabo, [http://szabo.best.vwh.net/securetitle.html Secure Property Titles] &ndash; argues that all three properties can be achieved up to the limits of [[Byzantine fault tolerance]].\n* Bob Wyman, [http://www.wyman.us/main/2006/12/the_persistence.html The Persistence of Identity: Updating Zooko's Pyramid]\n* [[Paul Crowley (cryptographer)|Paul Crowley]], [http://www.lshift.net/blog/2007/11/10/squaring-zookos-triangle Squaring Zooko's Triangle]\n* Aaron Swartz, [http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/squarezooko Squaring the Triangle] using a technique from [[Bitcoin]]\n\n{{Object-capability security}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Secure communication]]\n[[Category:Decentralization]]"
