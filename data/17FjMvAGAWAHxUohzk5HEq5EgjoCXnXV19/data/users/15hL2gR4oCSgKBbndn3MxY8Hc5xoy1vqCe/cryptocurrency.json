The funds are stored in wallets that are identified by a [[UUID]], and are encrypted with various encryption algorithms. Transactions are typically recorded by public network [[nodes]] and then distributed via [[peer-to-peer]] downloads in a ledger known as a [[blockchain]].\n\n<strong>[[Bitcoin]]</strong> is commonly referred to as the first cryptocurrency, although others existed before it. It was the first successful decentralized currency system, and the first to be widely publicized and used. \n\nSince Bitcoin's success, many other cryptocurrencies have been created with similar systems, such as [[Litecoin]], [[Dogecoin]], [[Namecoin]], and countless others. \n\n=External Links=\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/ Top cryptocurrency market captializations]",
