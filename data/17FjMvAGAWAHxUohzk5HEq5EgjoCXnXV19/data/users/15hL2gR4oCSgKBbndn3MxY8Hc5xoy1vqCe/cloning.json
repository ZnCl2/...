The website owner has to enable this in the site's [[content.json]] by setting the boolean \"<tt>cloneable</tt>\" to \"<tt>true</tt>\", then [[signing]] and [[publishing]] it.\n\n==\\*-default files==\n\nFiles with <tt>-default</tt> suffix will be copied instead of their equivalent without this suffix. For example, if their are both a <tt>data</tt> and a <tt>data-default</tt> directory in the zite, only the <tt>data-default</tt> will be copied. It's commonly used to avoid having a lot of useless data being copied, like articles in [http://127.0.0.1:43110/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit ZeroBlog].",
