In one view, databases can be classified according to types of content: bibliographic, full-text, numeric, and images.\n\n==What is a database and what is it used for?==\n\nSometimes referred to as database management systems (DBMS), database software tools are primarily used for storing, modifying, extracting, and searching for information within a database.\n\n==What is a database program?==\n\nA database program is the heart of a business information system and provides file creation, data entry, update, query and reporting functions. The traditional term for database software is \"database management system\" (see DBMS).\n\n==What's SQL?==\n\nIt is the query language of the database. SQL make it possible to easily create connections, relations and filters on vast amouts of data, using statements like <strong>\"SELECT name, age, country FROM people JOIN countries ON (people.home=countries.name)\"</strong>.\n\nThe opposite of SQL-based RDBMS (<strong>relational</strong> database management systems, where there are relations, or connections defined between data elements) are the NoSQL databases, where the data usually looked up by a few simple keys, but the speed of the database is magnitudes faster than an RDBMS, and it's much easier to replicate or parallelise its use. \n\n[[ZeroNet]] uses SQLite, an SQL-based, fast, single-user RDBMS variant.",
