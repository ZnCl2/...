BitTorrent is one of the most common protocols for transferring large files, and peer-to-peer networks have been estimated to collectively account for approximately 43\\<tt> to 70\\</tt> of all Internet traffic (depending on location) as of February 2009. \n\nTo send or receive files one uses a BitTorrent client; a computer program that implements the BitTorrent protocol. Such clients include Transmission, qBittorrent, Vuze, Deluge, and BitComet. BitTorrent trackers provide a list of files available for transfer, and allow the client to find peers known as seeds who may transfer the files.",
