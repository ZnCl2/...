''Ein Leben für die Wissenschaft.'' Germany: De Gruyter.</ref> The language classification of Bukharic is as follows: Indo-European > [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] > [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] > [[West Iranian]] > Southwest Iranian > [[Persian language|Persian]] > [[Tajik language|Tajik]] > Bukharic.<ref name=\"Tolmas, Chana 2006\"/>\n\nBukhori is based on a substrate of classical [[Persian language|Persian]], with a large number of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[loanword]]s, as well as smaller numbers of loanwords from other surrounding languages, including [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The vocabulary consists of a mixture of Persian, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Uzbek, and Hebrew words.<ref>Michael Shterenshis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vJZm9amnoAoC&pg=PA84 ''Tamerlane and the Jews'' p. 85]</ref>\n\nIn early history of the Bukharian Jews, Central Asia fell under Sunni Uzbek control. The Bukharian Jewish community was severely discriminated against and isolated from the other Jews, as well as the Uzbek people. This pushed Bukharian Jews to create their own branch of Judaism, which lead to the creation of the Bukhori dialect spoken throughout Bukharian history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/bukharan-Jews|title=Bukharan Jews|last=Sloame|first=Joanna|date=2016|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|language=english|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, the total number of speakers was 85,000. In the USSR, there were 45,000 speakers; in Israel, there were 32,000; and in all other countries combined, there were 3,000. One of the dialects of Bukharic is Rahamĭm.<ref name=\"Tolmas, Chana 2006\"/> Ethnic Tajik minorities exist in many countries, such as [[Afghanistan]], Pakistan, [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. Later Samarkand and Bukhara in Uzbekistan are two cities which are particularly populated.<ref>Ido, Shinji. 2007. ''Bukharan Tajik.'' E.C.: LINCOM EUROPA.</ref>\n\nToday, the language is spoken by approximately 10,000 [[Jew]]s remaining in Uzbekistan and surrounding areas, although most of its speakers reside elsewhere, predominantly in [[Israel]] (approximately 50,000 speakers), and the [[United States]].\n\nLike most [[Jewish languages]], Bukhori traditionally used the [[Hebrew alphabet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/bukhori.htm|title=Bukhori (бухорӣ / בוכארי / بخاری) language|website=www.omniglot.com}}</ref> But throughout the past century, due to Soviet influence, Bukhori has been written in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] in the 1920s, then [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] from 1940 onwards. The Hebrew alphabet fell further into disuse outside of Hebrew liturgy when the Bukharian Jewish schools were closed in Central Asia and Bukharian Jewish publications, such as books and newspapers, began to appear using the Cyrillic alphabet. Today, many older Bukharian Jews who speak Bukharian only know the Cyrillic alphabet when reading and writing Bukharian. The origin of its respective spelling system is Talmudic orthography.<ref name=\"Birnbaum, Salomo A 2011\"/>\n\nDuring the Soviet period, [[communists]] wanted Hebrew to be the language of culture and instruction in the Republic of Turkestan and in the Soviet’s People Republic of Bukhara. In late 1921, the Turkestani People’s Commissariat of Education ordered that schools for Bukharan Jews to teach in Bukharic and not in Hebrew. In Uzbekistan in 1934, 15 Bukharan Jewish clubs and 28 Bukharan Jewish red teahouses existed. However, in 1938, Bukharic was no longer used as the language for instruction in the schools and in cultural activities.<ref name=\"Tolmas, Chana 2006\"/>\n\nThere were attempts made to bring back Bukharan Jewish culture in the [[Soviet Union]]. One significant attempt was a council was established for Bukharan Jewish literature in the Uzbekistan Writers’ Union and was headed by Aharon Shalamaev-Fidoi (Shalamaev-Fidoi left for Israel in 1991). Another significant attempt was the ''Hoverim'' society was established in Tajikistan and was headed by Professor Datkhaev (Datkhaev left for the USA in 1992).<ref>Tolmas 2006, 69–70</ref> An organization today that is continuing to support the Bukharan Jewish culture is the World Bukharian Jewish Congress. This organization is introducing to the public the unique story of the Bukharan Jews. Their goal is for others to learn about the history of the Bukharan Jews, as well as their culture, language and literature. Based on the Soviet census of 1979, 20% more of Central Asian Jews spoke Russian instead of Bukharic.<ref name=\"Tolmas, Chana 2006\"/>\n\nAmong some Bukharian Jewish youth, especially in the New York City area, there has been a revival of using the Bukharian Jewish language written in a modified Latin alphabet similar to the one developed by Bukharian Jewish linguist and writer, Yakub Kalontarov.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Today, youths learning the Bukharian Jewish language sponsored by the Achdut-Unity Club in Queens use the modified Latin alphabet.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nClasses on Bukharian Jewish history and the Bukhori language are also available at [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College, CUNY]] since 2010, marking the first time that Bukhori has been taught in an American university. The classes are taught by Bukharian adjunct professor Imanuel Rybakov.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/podcasts/2010/05/10/saving-bukharian-jewish-history/|title=Saving Bukharian Jewish History  –  CUNY Radio Podcasts – CUNY|website=www1.cuny.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-10}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Emirate of Bukhara]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bjews.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=listarticles&secid=14 Learn Basic Bukhori]\n*[http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/3911 Endangered Languages Project]\n*[http://www.bjews.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=33&page=1 Noni padar (Father's bread)]\n*[http://www.bjews.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=115&page=1 MULOQAND]\n*[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwBo-Zi70R2cWElUSC1lQ1c5amM/edit Music Examples]\n*[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwBo-Zi70R2camdFM21lbDNzUkE/edit More Music Examples]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuy0jGYoJLM Bukharian Poem]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pB-iaJ8pTA Grisha Abramov Bukharian Jews Miami speech in Bukhoric Bukharan]\n\n{{Persian language}}\n{{Iranian languages}}\n{{Jewish languages}}\n{{Languages of the Caucasus}}\n\n[[Category:Judeo-Tajik dialects| ]]\n[[Category:Jews and Judaism in Uzbekistan]]\n[[Category:Dialects of Tajik]]\n[[Category:Languages of Uzbekistan]]\n[[Category:Endangered Indo-European languages]]",
