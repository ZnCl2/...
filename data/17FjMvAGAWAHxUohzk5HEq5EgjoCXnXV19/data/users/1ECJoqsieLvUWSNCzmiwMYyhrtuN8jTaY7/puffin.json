The Fraterculini fossil record in the Pacific extends at least as far back as the middle [[Miocene]], with three fossil species of ''Cerorhinca'', and material tentatively referred to that genus, in the middle Miocene to late [[Pliocene]] of southern California and northern Mexico. Although there no records from the Miocene in the Atlantic, a re-examination of the North Carolina material indicated that the diversity of puffins in the early Pliocene was as great in the Atlantic as it is in the Pacific today. This diversity was achieved through influxes of puffins from the Pacific; the later loss of species was due to major oceanographic changes in the late Pliocene due to closure of the Panamanian Seaway and the onset of severe glacial cycles in the North Atlantic.<ref name= smith/>\n\n==Description==\nThe puffins are stocky, short-winged and short-tailed birds, with black upper parts and white or brownish-grey underparts.

The male Atlantic puffin builds the nest and exhibits strong nest-site fidelity. Both sexes of the horned puffin help to construct their nest. Horned puffin burrows are usually about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep, ending in a chamber, while the tunnel leading to a tufted puffin burrow may be up to {{convert|2.75|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} long.

The eggs of the Atlantic puffin are typically creamy white but the odd egg is tinged lilac.\n\nWhere [[rabbit]]s breed, sometimes Atlantic puffins breed in rabbit burrows.\n\nPuffins form long-term pair bonds or relationships. The female lays a single egg, and both parents incubate the egg and feed the chick (or \"puffling\"<ref name=\"CBBC - 03Sep2009 - Kids patrol to help lost puffins \">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_8230000/newsid_8236600/8236609.stm|title=Kids patrol to help lost puffins |date=September 3, 2009|work=[[CBBC]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=26 February 2013}}</ref>). The incubating parent holds the egg against its [[brood patch]] with its wings. The chicks [[fledge]] at night. After fledging, the chicks spend the first few years of their lives at sea, returning to breed about five years later. Puffins in captivity have been known to breed as early as three years of age.\n\nAfter breeding, all three puffin species winter at sea, usually far from coasts and often extending south of the breeding range.<ref name=\"harrison2\"/>\n\nIceland is the home to most of the [[Atlantic puffin]]s with about 10 million individuals.<ref name=\"Xtreme.is\">[http://www.xtreme.is/safnahus/?p=200&s=733&i=762]</ref> The largest single puffin colony in the world is in [[Westmann Isles]], islands that belong to [[Iceland]].

Mar Sci.'' 63: 1530–1550.</ref> The puffins are distinct in their ability to hold several (sometimes over a dozen) small fish at a time, crosswise in their bill, rather than regurgitating swallowed fish. This allows them to take longer [[foraging]] trips, since they can come back with more food energy for their chick than a bird that can only carry one fish at a time. This behaviour is made possible by the unique hinging mechanism of their beak, which allows the upper and lower biting edges to meet at any of a number of angles.\n\n==Relationships with humans==\n{{See also|Faroese puffin}}\n\n===Hunting===\nPuffins are hunted for eggs, feathers and meat.

The Fraterculini fossil record in the Pacific extends at least as far back as the middle [[Miocene]], with three fossil species of ''Cerorhinca'', and material tentatively referred to that genus, in the middle Miocene to late [[Pliocene]] of southern California and northern Mexico. Although there no records from the Miocene in the Atlantic, a re-examination of the North Carolina material indicated that the diversity of puffins in the early Pliocene was as great in the Atlantic as it is in the Pacific today. This diversity was achieved through influxes of puffins from the Pacific; the later loss of species was due to major oceanographic changes in the late Pliocene due to closure of the Panamanian Seaway and the onset of severe glacial cycles in the North Atlantic.<ref name= smith/>\n\n==Description==\nThe puffins are stocky, short-winged and short-tailed birds, with black upper parts and white or brownish-grey underparts. The head has a black cap, the face is mainly white, and the feet are orange-red. The bill appears large and colourful during the breeding season. The colourful outer part of the bill is shed after the breeding season, revealing a smaller and duller true bill beneath.<ref name =harrison2>Harrison (1988) pp. 404–406</ref>\n\nAlthough the puffins are vocal at their breeding colonies, they are silent at sea.

The male Atlantic puffin builds the nest and exhibits strong nest-site fidelity. Both sexes of the horned puffin help to construct their nest. Horned puffin burrows are usually about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep, ending in a chamber, while the tunnel leading to a tufted puffin burrow may be up to {{convert|2.75|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} long. The nesting substrate of the tufted and Atlantic puffins is soft soil, into which tunnels are dug; in contrast the nesting sites of horned puffins are rock crevices on cliffs.<ref name=\"BNA Horned\">{{cite web |last2=Kitaysky |first2=Alexander S. |url=http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/603 |title=Horned Puffin (''Fratercula corniculata'') |last=Piatt |first=John F |year=2002 |work=The Birds of North America Online (A.

The eggs of the Atlantic puffin are typically creamy white but the odd egg is tinged lilac.\n\nWhere [[rabbit]]s breed, sometimes Atlantic puffins breed in rabbit burrows.\n\nPuffins form long-term pair bonds or relationships. The female lays a single egg, and both parents incubate the egg and feed the chick (or \"puffling\"<ref name=\"CBBC - 03Sep2009 - Kids patrol to help lost puffins \">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_8230000/newsid_8236600/8236609.stm|title=Kids patrol to help lost puffins |date=September 3, 2009|work=[[CBBC]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=26 February 2013}}</ref>). The incubating parent holds the egg against its [[brood patch]] with its wings. The chicks [[fledge]] at night. After fledging, the chicks spend the first few years of their lives at sea, returning to breed about five years later. Puffins in captivity have been known to breed as early as three years of age.\n\nAfter breeding, all three puffin species winter at sea, usually far from coasts and often extending south of the breeding range.<ref name=\"harrison2\"/>\n\nIceland is the home to most of the [[Atlantic puffin]]s with about 10 million individuals.<ref name=\"Xtreme.is\">[http://www.xtreme.is/safnahus/?p=200&s=733&i=762]</ref> The largest single puffin colony in the world is in [[Westmann Isles]], islands that belong to [[Iceland]].

Mar Sci.'' 63: 1530–1550.</ref> The puffins are distinct in their ability to hold several (sometimes over a dozen) small fish at a time, crosswise in their bill, rather than regurgitating swallowed fish. This allows them to take longer [[foraging]] trips, since they can come back with more food energy for their chick than a bird that can only carry one fish at a time. This behaviour is made possible by the unique hinging mechanism of their beak, which allows the upper and lower biting edges to meet at any of a number of angles.\n\n==Relationships with humans==\n{{See also|Faroese puffin}}\n\n===Hunting===\nPuffins are hunted for eggs, feathers and meat. Atlantic puffin populations drastically declined due to habitat destruction and exploitation during the 19th century and early 20th century.
