According to the rationalist stream of Judaism articulated by [[Maimonides]], which later came to dominate much of official traditional Jewish thought, God is understood as the [[monotheism|absolute one]], indivisible, and incomparable [[being]] who is the ultimate cause of all existence. Traditional interpretations of Judaism generally emphasize that God is [[personal god|personal]] yet also [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], while some modern interpretations of Judaism emphasize that God is a force or ideal.<ref>http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/modern-jewish-views-of-god</ref>\n\nThe [[Names of God in Judaism|names of God]] used most often in the [[Hebrew Bible]] are the [[Tetragrammaton]] (''YHWH'' Hebrew: {{Hebrew|יהוה}}) and [[Elohim]]. Other [[Names of God in Judaism|names of God]] in traditional Judaism include [[El Shaddai]] and [[Shekhinah]].\n\n==Names==\n{{Main|Names of God in Judaism}}\n{{Further|Yahweh|Tetragrammaton}}\nThe name of God used most often in the [[Hebrew Bible]] is the [[Tetragrammaton]] (YHWH {{lang-he|יהוה}}). Jews traditionally do not pronounce it, and instead refer to God as ''[[Names and Titles of God in Judaism#HaShem|HaShem]]'', literally \"the Name\". In prayer the [[Tetragrammaton]] is substituted with the pronunciation [[Names of God in Judaism#Adonai|Adonai]], meaning \"My Master\".\n\n==From Iron Age local god to monotheism==\n{{See also|Shituf|Yahweh|Shema Yisrael}}\nThe [[national god]] of the [[Iron Age]] kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel (Samaria)]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] was [[Yahweh]].

No consensus has been reached by academics on the origins of monotheism in ancient Israel, but Yahweh \"clearly came out of the world of the gods of the Ancient Near East.\"<ref>Smith, Mark S.''The early history of God: Yahweh and the other deities in ancient Israel.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.; 2nd ed., 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-8028-3972-5}}</ref>\n\nThe worship of multiple gods ([[polytheism]]) and the concept of God having multiple persons (as in the doctrine of [[Trinity]]) are equally unimaginable in Judaism. The idea of God as a [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]] or [[trinity]] is heretical in Judaism – it is considered akin to polytheism.\n{{quote|God, the Cause of all, is one. This does not mean one as in one of series, nor one like a species (which encompasses many individuals), nor one as in an object that is made up of many elements, nor as a single simple object that is infinitely divisible. Rather, God is a unity unlike any other possible unity. (Maimonides, ''13 Principles of Faith'', Second Principle)<ref>[[Maimonides]], [[Maimonides#The 13 principles of faith|13 principles of faith]], Second Principle</ref>}}\n\nSince, according to the mystical conception, all of existence emanates from God, whose ultimate existence is not dependent on anything else, some [[Hakham|Jewish sage]]s perceived God as interpenetrating the universe, which itself has been thought to be a manifestation of God's existence. According to this line of theological speculation, Judaism can be regarded as being compatible with [[panentheism]],{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} while always affirming genuine monotheism.\n\n[[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition holds that the divine consists of ten ''[[sefirot]]'' (attributes or [[Emanationism|emanations]]). This has been described as a strand of Judaism which may seem at odds with Jewish commitments to strict monotheism, but Kabbalists have consistently emphasized that their traditions are strictly monotheistic.<ref name=\"ww\">{{Cite web |author=Wainwright, William |title=Monotheism, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2013 |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/monotheism/}}</ref>\n\nAny belief that an intermediary between humanity and God could be used, whether necessary or even optional, has traditionally been considered heretical. [[Maimonides]] writes that\n{{quote|God is the only one we may serve and praise....We may not act in this way toward anything beneath God, whether it be an angel, a star, or one of the elements.....There are no intermediaries between us and God. All our prayers should be directed towards God; nothing else should even be considered.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}}}\n\nSome rabbinic authorities disagreed with this view. Notably, [[Nachmanides]] was of the opinion that it is permitted to ask the angels to beseech God on our behalf. This argument manifests notably in the [[Selichot]] prayer called \"Machnisay Rachamim\", a request to the angels to intercede with God.\n\n==Godhead==\n{{Main|Godhead in Judaism}}\nGodhead refers to the aspect or substratum of [[God]] that lies behind God's actions or properties (i.e., it is the [[essence]] of God).\n\n===Rationalistic conception===\nIn the philosophy of Maimonides and other Jewish-rationalistic philosophers, there is little which can be known about the Godhead, other than its existence, and even this can only be asserted equivocally.\n{{quote|How then can a relation be represented between God and what is other than God when there is no notion comprising in any respect both of the two, inasmuch as existence is, in our opinion, affirmed of God, may God be exalted, and of what is other than God merely by way of absolute equivocation. There is, in truth, no relation in any respect between God and any of God's creatures.|Maimonides|Moreh Nevuchim (Pines 1963)}}\n\n===Mystical conception===\nIn Kabbalistic thought, the term \"Godhead\" usually refers to the concept of ''[[Ein Sof ]]'' (אין סוף), which is the aspect of God that lies beyond the emanations (''[[sephirot]]''). The \"knowability\" of the Godhead in Kabbalistic thought is no better that what is conceived by rationalist thinkers. As Jacobs (1973) puts it, \"Of God as God is in Godself—Ein Sof—nothing can be said at all, and no thought can reach there\".\n\n{{quote|Ein Sof is a place to which forgetting and oblivion pertain. Why? Because concerning all the sefirot, one can search out their reality from the depth of supernal wisdom. From there it is possible to understand one thing from another. However, concerning Ein Sof, there is no aspect anywhere to search or probe; nothing can be known of it, for it is hidden and concealed in the mystery of absolute nothingness.|David ben Judah Hehasid|Matt (1990)}}\n\n==Properties attributed to God==\nIn modern articulations of traditional Judaism, God has been speculated to be the [[Eternity|eternal]], [[omnipotent]] and [[omniscient]] [[Creator god|creator of the universe]], and the source of [[morality]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} God has the power to intervene in the world. Maimonides describes God in this fashion: \"The foundation of all foundations and the pillar of wisdom is to know that there is a Primary Being who brought into being all existence. All the beings of the heavens, the earth, and what is between them came into existence only from the truth of His being.\"<ref>[[Mishneh Torah]], book HaMadda', section Yesodei ha-Torah, chapter 1:1 ([http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/6756/jewish/Perek-1.htm original Hebrew]/[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904960/jewish/Chapter-One.htm English translation])</ref>\n\nJews often describe God as omniscient,<ref name=\"ajcarchives.org\">[http://www.ajcarchives.org/ajc_data/files/913.pdf \"Jewish Beliefs about God\" in ''C/JEEP Curriculum Guide'' American Jewish Committee]</ref> although some prominent medieval Jewish philosophers held that God does not have complete foreknowledge of human acts. [[Gersonides]], for example, argued that God knows the choices open to each individual, but that God does not know the choices that an individual will make.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Louis |last=Jacobs |authorlink=Louis Jacobs |title=God, Torah, Israel: traditionalism without fundamentalism |publisher=Hebrew Union College Press |location=[[Cincinnati]] |date=1990 |pages= |isbn=0-87820-052-5 |oclc=21039224}}{{Page needed|date=December 2015}}</ref> [[Abraham ibn Daud]] believed that God was not omniscient or omnipotent with respect to human action.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Julius |last=Guttmann |authorlink=Julius Guttmann |title=Philosophies of Judaism: The History of Jewish Philosophy from Biblical Times to Franz Rosenzweig |publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company|Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] |location=[[New York City]] |date=1964 |pages=150–151 |oclc=1497829}}</ref>\n\nJews often describe God as omnipotent, and see that idea as rooted in the Bible.<ref name=\"ajcarchives.org\"/> Some modern Jewish theologians have argued that God is not omnipotent, however, and have found many biblical and classical sources to support this view.<ref>Geoffrey Claussen, \"God and Suffering in Heschel’s Torah Min Ha-Shamayim\". Conservative Judaism 61, no. 4 (2010), p. 17</ref>\n\nAlthough God is referred to in the [[Tanakh]] with masculine imagery and grammatical forms, traditional Jewish philosophy does not attribute [[gender of God in Judaism|gender to God]].<ref>\"G-d has no body, no genitalia; therefore, the very idea that G-d is male or female is patently absurd. We refer to G-d using masculine terms simply for convenience's sake, because Hebrew has no neutral gender; G-d is no more male than a table is.\" [http://www.jewfaq.org/g-d.htm Judaism 101]. \"The fact that we always refer to God as 'He' is also not meant to imply that the concept of sex or gender applies to God.\" Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, ''The Aryeh Kaplan Reader'', Mesorah Publications (1983), p. 144</ref> Although Jewish [[aggadah|aggadic literature]] and [[Jewish mysticism]] do on occasion refer to God using gendered language, for poetic or other reasons, this language was never understood by Jews to imply that God is gender-specific.\n\nSome modern Jewish thinkers take care to articulate God outside of the [[gender binary]],<ref>Julia Watts-Belser, “Transing God/dess: Notes from the Borderlands,” in ''Balancing on the Mechitza: Transgender in Jewish Community'', ed. Noach Dzmura (Berkeley, CA: North Atlantic Books, 2010)</ref> a concept seen as not applicable to God.\n\nKabbalistic tradition holds that emanations from the divine consist of ten [[Aspect (religion)|aspects]], called ''sefirot''.\n\n==Conceptions of God==\n\n=== Personal ===\n[[File:The Ten Commandments (Bible Card).jpg|thumb|right|upright|The mass revelation at [[Mount Horeb]] in an illustration from a Bible card published by the Providence Lithograph Company, 1907]]\n\nMost of classical Judaism views God as a [[personal god]], meaning that humans can have a relationship with God and vice versa. Rabbi [[Samuel S. Cohon]] wrote that \"God as conceived by Judaism is not only the First Cause, the Creative Power, and the World Reason, but also the living and loving Father of Men. He is not only cosmic but also personal....Jewish monotheism thinks of God in terms of definite character or personality, while pantheism is content with a view of God as impersonal.\" This is shown in the [[Jewish liturgy]], such as in the [[Adon Olam]] [[hymn]], which includes a \"confident affirmation\" that \"He is my God, my living God...Who hears and answers.\"<ref name=\"Samuel\">Samuel S. Cohon. ''What We Jews Believe'' (1931). [[Union of American Hebrew Congregations]].</ref> [[Edward Kessler]] writes that Hebrew Bible \"portrays an encounter with a God who cares passionately and who addresses humanity in the quiet moments of its existence.\"<ref name=\"EdwardKessler\">Edward Kessler, ''What Do Jews Believe?: The Customs and Culture of Modern Judaism'' (2007). Bloomsbury Publishing: pp. 42-44.</ref> [[List of Chief Rabbis of the United Hebrew Congregations|British chief rabbi]] [[Jonathan Sacks]] suggests that God \"is not distant in time or detached, but passionately engaged and present\".<ref name=\"EdwardKessler\"/>\n\nThe \"predicate 'personal' as applied to God\" does not necessarily mean that God is [[Incorporeality|corporeal]] or [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]], views that Jewish sages sometimes rejected; rather, \"personality\" refers not to physicality, but to \"inner essence, psychical, rational, and moral\".<ref name=\"Samuel\" /> However, other traditional Jewish texts, for example, the [[Shi'ur Qomah]] of the [[Merkabah mysticism|Heichalot literature]], describe the measurements of limbs and body parts of God. \n\nJews believe that \"God can be experienced\" but also that \"God cannot be understood,\" because \"God is utterly unlike humankind\" (as shown in God's response to Moses when Moses asked for God's name: \"[[I Am that I Am]]\"). Anthropomorphic statements about God \"are understood as linguistic metaphors, otherwise it would be impossible to talk about God at all\".<ref name=\"EdwardKessler\" />\n\nAccording to some speculations in traditional Judaism, people's actions do not have the ability to affect God positively or negatively.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The [[Book of Job]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] states: \"Gaze at the heavens and see, and view the skies, which are higher than you. If you sinned, how do you harm God, and if your transgressions are many, what do you do to God? If you are righteous, what do you give God? Or what does God take from your hand? Your wickedness [affects] a person like yourself, and your righteousness a child of humanity.\" However, a corpus of traditional [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] texts describe [[theurgic]] practices that manipulate the supernal realms, and [[Practical Kabbalah]] (Hebrew: קבלה מעשית‬) texts instruct adepts in the use of [[white magic]].\n\nA notion that God is in need of human beings has been propounded by [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]]. Because God is in search of people, God is accessible and available through time and place to whoever seeks Him, leading to a spiritual intensity for the individual as well. This accessibility leads to a God who is present, involved, near, intimate, and concerned for and vulnerable to what happens in this world.<ref>Abraham Joshua Heschel, ''God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism'' (New York: Farrar, Straus & Cudahy, 1955).</ref>\n\n=== Non-personal ===\nAlthough the dominant strain in Judaism is that God is personal, modern Jewish thinkers claim that there is an \"alternate stream of tradition exemplified by ... Maimonides\", who, along with several other Jewish philosophers, rejected the idea of a personal God.<ref name=\"EdwardKessler\" />\n\nModern Jewish thinkers who have rejected the idea of a personal God have sometimes affirmed that God is nature, the ethical ideal, or a force or process in the world.\n\n[[Baruch Spinoza|Baruch]] [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] offers a pantheist view of God. In his thought, God is everything and everything is God. Thus, there can be conceived no substance but God.<ref>Benedictus de Spinoza, ''The Ethics; Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect; Selected Letters'', trans. Samuel Shirley, 2nd ed. (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1992), 40.</ref> In this model, one can speak of God and nature interchangeably. Although Spinoza was excommunicated from the Jewish community of Amsterdam, Spinoza's concept of God was revived by later Jews, especially Israeli secular Zionists.<ref>Daniel B. Schwartz, The First Modern Jew: Spinoza and the History of an Image (Princeton University Press, 2012), ch. 5.</ref>\n\n[[Hermann Cohen]] rejected Spinoza's idea that God can be found in nature, but agreed that God was not a personal being. Rather, he saw God as an ideal, an archetype of morality.<ref name=\":0\">Hermann Cohen, ''Reason and Hope: Selections from the Jewish Writings of Hermann Cohen'', trans. Eva Jospe (New York,: Norton, 1971), 223.</ref> Not only can God not be identified with nature, but God is also incomparable to anything in the world.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is because God is “One,” unique and unlike anything else.<ref name=\":0\" /> One loves and worships God through living ethically and obeying His moral law: “love of God is love of morality.”<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSimilarly, for [[Emmanuel Levinas]], God is ethics, so one is brought closer to God when justice is rendered to the Other. This means that one experiences the presence of God through one’s relation to other people. To know God is to know what must be done, so it does not make sense to speak of God as what God is, but rather what God commands.<ref name=\":1\">Emmanuel Levinas, ''Difficult Freedom: Essays on Judaism'', trans. Sean Hand (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990), 223.</ref>\n\nFor [[Mordecai Kaplan]], the founder of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], God is not a person, but rather a force within the universe that is experienced; in fact, anytime something worthwhile is experienced, that is God.<ref>Alan Levenson, ''An Introduction to Modern Jewish Thinkers: From Spinoza to Soloveitchik'', 137.</ref> God is the sum of all natural processes that allow people to be self-fulfilling, the power that makes for salvation.<ref>Alan Levenson, ''An Introduction to Modern Jewish Thinkers: From Spinoza to Soloveitchik'', 138.</ref> Thus, Kaplan’s God is abstract, not carnate, and intangible. It is important to note that, in this model, God exists within this universe; for Kaplan, there is nothing supernatural or otherworldly. One loves this God by seeking out truth and goodness. Kaplan does not view God as a person but acknowledges that using personal God-language can help people feel connected to their heritage and can act as “an affirmation that life has value.”<ref>Mordecai Menahem Kaplan, ''The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion'' (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1994), 29.</ref>\n\nLikewise, Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], the founder of the [[Jewish Renewal]] movement, views God as a process. To aid in this transition in language, he uses the term “godding,” which encapsulates God as a process, as ''the'' process that the universe is doing, has been doing, and will continue to do.<ref>Zalman Schachter-Shalomi and Joel Segel, ''Jewish with Feeling: A Guide to Meaningful Jewish Practice'' (New York: Riverhead Books, 2005), 20.</ref> This term means that God is emerging, growing, adapting, and evolving with creation. Despite this, conventional God-language is still useful in nurturing spiritual experiences and can be a tool to relate to the infinite, although it should not be confused with the real thing.<ref>Zalman Schachter-Shalomi and Joel Segel, ''Jewish with Feeling: A Guide to Meaningful Jewish Practice'' (New York: Riverhead Books, 2005), 8.</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]]'s 2008 U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, Americans who identify as Jewish by religion are twice as likely to favor ideas of God as \"an impersonal force\" over the idea that \"God is a person with whom people can have a relationship\".<ref>http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/05/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf, p. 164</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Judaism|Religion}}\n* [[God in Abrahamic religions]]\n* [[Holocaust theology]]\n* [[Holy Spirit (Judaism)]]\n* [[Shekhinah]] (divine presence)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite web |title=The Personhood of God: Biblical Theology, Human Faith And the Divine Image |author=[[Yochanan Muffs]] |url=http://www.librarything.com/work/1583080 |publisher=Library Thing |work=LibraryThing.com}}\n\n{{Jews and Judaism}}\n{{Theology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:God In Judaism}}\n[[Category:Conceptions of God]]\n[[Category:Jewish theology]]\n[[Category:Yahweh]]",
