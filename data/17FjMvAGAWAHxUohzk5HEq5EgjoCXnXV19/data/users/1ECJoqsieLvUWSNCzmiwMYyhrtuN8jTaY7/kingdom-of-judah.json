At first, only the [[tribe of Judah]] remained loyal to the [[Davidic line|house of David]], but soon after the [[tribe of Benjamin]] joined Judah. The two kingdoms, Judah in the south and [[kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] in the north, coexisted uneasily after the split until the destruction of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] by [[Assyria]] in c. 722/721.\n\nThe major theme of the Hebrew Bible's narrative is the loyalty of Judah, and especially its kings, to [[Yahweh]], which it states is the God of [[Israelites|Israel]]. Accordingly, all the kings of Israel and almost all the kings of Judah were \"bad\", which in terms of Biblical narrative means that they failed to enforce [[monotheism]]. Of the \"good\" kings, [[Hezekiah]] (727–698 BCE) is noted for his efforts at stamping out [[idolatry]] (in this case, the worship of [[Baal]] and [[Asherah]], among other traditional Near Eastern divinities),<ref name=\"Borowski\">Oded Borowski, {{cite web|url=http://scholar.cc.emory.edu/scripts/ASOR/BA/Borowski.html |title=''Hezekiah's Reforms and the Revolt against Assyria'' |accessdate=2013-04-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970723115326/http://scholar.cc.emory.edu/scripts/ASOR/BA/Borowski.html |archivedate=July 23, 1997 |df= }}, Emory University, 1997</ref> but his successors, [[Manasseh of Judah]] (698–642 BCE) and Amon (642–640 BCE), revived idolatry, drawing down on the kingdom the anger of Yahweh. King [[Josiah]] (640–609 BCE) returned to the worship of Yahweh alone, but his efforts were too late and Israel's unfaithfulness caused God to permit the kingdom's destruction by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|Siege of Jerusalem (587 BCE)]].\n\nHowever it is now fairly well established among academic scholars that the Biblical narrative is not an accurate reflection of religious views in either Judah or particularly Israel during this period.<ref>{{Cite book |chapter=The Appearance of Pantheon in Judah |page= 27 |author= Lowell K.

[[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and Judah were in a state of war throughout [[Rehoboam]]'s seventeen-year reign. Rehoboam built elaborate defenses and strongholds, along with fortified cities. In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign, [[Shishak]], [[pharaoh]] of [[Egypt]], brought a huge army and took many cities. In the [[sack of Jerusalem (10th century BC)|sack of Jerusalem (10th century BCE)]], Rehoboam gave them all of the treasures out of the temple as a tribute and Judah became a vassal state of Egypt.\n\nRehoboam's son and successor, [[Abijah of Judah]] continued his father's efforts to bring Israel under his control. He fought the [[Battle of Mount Zemaraim]] against [[Jeroboam]] of Israel and was victorious with a heavy loss of life on the Israel side. According to the [[books of Chronicles]], Abijah and his people defeated them with a great slaughter, so that 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|13:17|HE}}</ref> after which Jeroboam posed little threat to Judah for the rest of his reign and the border of the [[tribe of Benjamin]] was restored to the original tribal border.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|13:20|HE}}</ref>\n\n[[Abijah]]'s son and successor, [[Asa of Judah]], maintained peace for the first 35 years of his reign,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|16:1|HE}}</ref> during which time he revamped and reinforced the fortresses originally built by his grandfather, Rehoboam. 2 Chronicles states that at the [[Battle of Zephath]], the Egyptian-backed chieftain [[Zerah]] the [[Ethiopia]]n and his million men and 300 chariots was defeated by Asa's 580,000 men in the Valley of Zephath near [[Maresha]].<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|14:9–15|HE}}</ref> The Bible does not state whether Zerah was a pharaoh or a general of the army. The Ethiopians were pursued all the way to [[Gerar]], in the coastal plain, where they stopped out of sheer exhaustion. The resulting peace kept Judah free from Egyptian incursions until the time of [[Josiah]] some centuries later.\n\nIn his 36th year, Asa was confronted by [[Baasha of Israel]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> who built a fortress at Ramah on the border, less than ten miles from Jerusalem. The result was that the capital was under pressure and the military situation was precarious. Asa took gold and silver from the Temple and sent them to [[Ben-Hadad I]], king of [[Aram-Damascus]], in exchange for the Damascene king canceling his peace treaty with Baasha. Ben-Hadad attacked Ijon, Dan, and many important cities of the [[tribe of Naphtali]], and Baasha was forced to withdraw from Ramah.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|16:2–6|HE}}</ref> Asa tore down the unfinished fortress and used its raw materials to fortify [[Geba (city)|Geba]] and [[Mizpah in Benjamin]] on his side of the border.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|16:1–7|HE}}</ref>\n\nAsa's successor, [[Jehoshaphat]], changed the policy towards Israel and instead pursued alliances and co-operation with the northern kingdom. The alliance with [[Ahab]] was based on marriage. This alliance led to disaster for the kingdom with the battle of [[Ramoth-Gilead]].<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|22:1–33|HE}}</ref> He then entered into an alliance with [[Ahaziah of Israel]] for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce with [[Ophir]]. But the fleet that was then equipped at [[Ezion-Geber]] was immediately wrecked. A new fleet was fitted out without the cooperation of the king of Israel, and although it was successful, the trade was not prosecuted.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Kings|20:35–37|HE}}; {{bibleverse|1|Kings|22:48–49|HE}}</ref> He subsequently joined [[Jehoram of Israel]] in a war against the [[Moab]]ites, who were under tribute to Israel. This war was successful, with the Moabites being subdued. However, on seeing [[Mesha]]'s act of offering his own son in a [[human sacrifice]] on the walls of [[Al-Karak|Kir-haresheth]] filled Jehoshaphat with horror and he withdrew and returned to his own land.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Kings|3:4–27|HE}}</ref>\n\n[[Jehoshaphat]]'s successor, [[Jehoram of Judah]] formed an alliance with Israel by marrying [[Athaliah]], the daughter of [[Ahab]]. Despite this alliance with the stronger northern kingdom, [[Jehoram of Judah|Jehoram]]'s rule of Judah was shaky. [[Edom]] revolted, and he was forced to acknowledge their independence. A raid by [[Philistines]], [[Arabs]] and Ethiopians looted the king's house and carried off all of his family except for his youngest son, [[Ahaziah of Judah]].\n\n=== Clash of empires ===\n[[File:Stamped-bulla seal-side.jpg|thumb|Stamped bulla of a servant of King Hezekiah used to seal a papyrus document]]\nAfter [[Hezekiah]] became sole ruler in c. 715 BCE, he formed alliances with [[Ashkelon]] and [[Egypt]], and made a stand against [[Assyria]] by refusing to pay tribute.<ref name=\"Peter J pp 255–256\">[[Peter J.

In this power vacuum, Judah was able to govern itself for the time being without foreign intervention. However, in the spring of 609 BCE, [[Pharaoh]] [[Necho II]] personally led a sizable army up to the [[Euphrates]] to aid the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].<ref name=\"Coogan261\">{{bibleref|2Kings|23:29|9}}\n* {{cite book |last=Coogan |first=Michael David |authorlink=Michael Coogan |title=The Oxford History of the Biblical World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFhvECwNQD0C&pg=PA261#v=onepage&q=josiah%20%22book%20of%20kings%22%20assyria&f=false |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195139372 |page=261}}</ref> Taking the coast route [[Via Maris]] into [[Syria]] at the head of a large army, Necho passed the low tracts of [[Philistia]] and [[Sharon plain|Sharon]]. However, the passage over the ridge of hills which shuts in on the south of the great [[Jezreel Valley]] was blocked by the Judean army led by Josiah, who may have considered that the Assyrians and Egyptians were weakened by the death of the pharaoh [[Psamtik I]] only a year earlier (610 BCE).<ref name=\"Coogan261\"/> Presumably in an attempt to help the Babylonians, Josiah attempted to block the advance at [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]], where a fierce [[battle of Megiddo (609 BC)|battle]] was fought and where Josiah was killed.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Kings|23:29|HE}}, {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|35:20–24|HE}}</ref> Necho then joined forces with the Assyrian [[Ashur-uballit II]] and together they crossed the Euphrates and lay siege to [[Harran]]. The combined forces failed to capture the city, and Necho retreated back to northern [[Syria]]. The event also marked the disintegration of the Assyrian Empire.\n\nOn his return march to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in 608 BCE, Necho found that [[Jehoahaz of Judah|Jehoahaz]] had been selected to succeed his father, Josiah.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Kings|23:31|HE}}</ref> Necho deposed Jehoahaz, who had been king for only three months, and replaced him with his older brother, [[Jehoiakim]]. Necho imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver (about 3{{fraction|3|4}} tons or about 3.4 metric tons) and a talent of gold (about {{convert|34|kg}}). Necho then took [[Jehoahaz of Judah|Jehoahaz]] back to Egypt as his prisoner,<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|36:1–4|HE}}</ref> never to return.\n\n[[Jehoiakim]] ruled originally as a vassal of the Egyptians, paying a heavy tribute. However, when the Egyptians were defeated by the Babylonians at [[Battle of Carchemish|Carchemish]] in 605 BCE, Jehoiakim changed allegiances, paying tribute to [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon]]. In 601 BCE, in the fourth year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar unsuccessfully attempted to invade [[Egypt]] and was repulsed with heavy losses. This failure led to numerous rebellions among the states of the [[Levant]] which owed allegiance to Babylon. Jehoiakim also stopped paying tribute to Nebuchadnezzar<ref>[http://www.drshirley.org/hist/hist05.html The Divided Monarchy] c. 931–586 BCE</ref> and took a pro-Egyptian position.
