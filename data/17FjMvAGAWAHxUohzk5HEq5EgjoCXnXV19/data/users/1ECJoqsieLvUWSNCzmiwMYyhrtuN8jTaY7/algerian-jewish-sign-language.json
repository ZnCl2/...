AJSL is therefore moribund, being used primarily for interaction between deaf immigrants and their hearing siblings and parents. It is thus hearing people who are preserving its use.\n\nLittle is known about its use in France.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jdcc.org/jewish-deaf-tidbits/documentation-of-algerian-jewish-sign-language JDCC News]\n\n[[Category:Village sign languages]]\n[[Category:Languages of Israel]]\n[[Category:Languages of France]]\n[[Category:Ghardaïa]]",
