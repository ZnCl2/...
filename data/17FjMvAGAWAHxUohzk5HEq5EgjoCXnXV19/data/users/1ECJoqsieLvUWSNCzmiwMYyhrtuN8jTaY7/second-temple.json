According to Jewish tradition, it replaced [[Solomon's Temple]] (the First Temple), which was destroyed by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in 586 BCE, when [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|Jerusalem was conquered]] and part of the population of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] was taken into [[Babylonian captivity|exile to Babylon]].\n\nThe Second Temple was originally a rather modest structure constructed by a number of Jewish exile groups returning to the [[Levant]] from [[Babylon]] under the [[Achaemenid]]-appointed governor [[Zerubbabel]]. However, during the reign of [[Herod the Great]], the Second Temple was completely refurbished, and the original structure was totally overhauled into the large and magnificent edifices and facades that are more recognizable. Much like the Babylonians destroyed the First Temple, the Romans [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|destroyed the Second Temple]] and Jerusalem in 70 CE as retaliation for [[First Jewish–Roman War|an ongoing Jewish revolt]].\n\n[[Jewish eschatology]] includes a belief that the Second Temple will be replaced by a future [[Third Temple]].\n\n==Biblical narrative==\n{{main|Second Temple period}}\n[[File:105.The Rebuilding of the Temple Is Begun.jpg|thumb|Rebuilding of the Temple (illustration by [[Gustave Doré]] from the 1866 ''La Sainte Bible'')]]\nThe accession of [[Cyrus the Great]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 559 BCE made the re-establishment of the city of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple possible.<ref name=\"Albright 1963\">{{cite book |title=The Biblical Period from Abraham to Ezra: An Historical Survey |last=Albright |first=William |authorlink=William F.

After a relatively brief halt due to opposition from peoples who had filled the vacuum during the Jewish captivity ({{Bibleref2|Ezra 4}}), work resumed c. 521 BCE under [[Darius I]] ({{Bibleref2|Ezra 5}}) and was completed during the sixth year of his reign (c. 516 BCE), with the temple dedication taking place the following year.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThese events represent the final section in the historical narrative of the [[Hebrew Bible]].<ref name=\"Albright 1963\"/>\n\nThe original core of the book of Nehemiah, the first-person memoir, may have been [[Ezra-Nehemiah|combined]] with the core of the [[Book of Ezra]] around 400 BCE. Further editing probably continued into the [[Second Temple period#Hellenistic era|Hellenistic era]].<ref>Paul Cartledge, Peter Garnsey, Erich S. Gruen (editors), ''Hellenistic Constructs: Essays In Culture, History, and Historiography'', p. 92 (University of California Press, 1997). {{ISBN|0-520-20676-2}}</ref>\n\nThe book tells how Nehemiah, at the court of the king in [[Susa]], is informed that Jerusalem is without walls and resolves to restore them. The king appoints him as governor of the province [[Yehud Medinata]] and he travels to Jerusalem. There he rebuilds the walls, despite the opposition of Israel's enemies, and reforms the community in conformity with the [[law of Moses]]. After 12 years in [[Jerusalem]], he returns to [[Susa]] but subsequently revisits Jerusalem. He finds that the Israelites have been [[backsliding]] and taking non-Jewish wives, and he stays in Jerusalem to enforce the Law.\n\nBased on the biblical account, after the return from Babylonian captivity, arrangements were immediately made to reorganize the desolated [[Yehud Province]] after the demise of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] seventy years earlier. The body of pilgrims, forming a band of 42,360,<ref>{{bibleverse|Ezra|2:65|HE}}</ref> having completed the long and dreary journey of some four months, from the banks of the [[Euphrates]] to Jerusalem, were animated in all their proceedings by a strong religious impulse, and therefore one of their first concerns was to restore their ancient house of worship by rebuilding their destroyed Temple<ref name=\"Temple, the Second\">{{Cite EBD|wstitle=Temple, the Second}}</ref> and reinstituting the sacrificial rituals known as the ''[[korbanot]]''.\n\nOn the invitation of [[Zerubbabel]], the governor, who showed them a remarkable example of liberality by contributing personally 1,000 golden [[Persian daric|daric]]s, besides other gifts, the people poured their gifts into the sacred treasury with great enthusiasm.<ref>{{bibleverse||Ezra|2|HE}}</ref> First they erected and dedicated the altar of God on the exact spot where it had formerly stood, and they then cleared away the charred heaps of debris which occupied the site of the old temple; and in the second month of the second year (535 BCE), amid great public excitement and rejoicing, the foundations of the Second Temple were laid. A wide interest was felt in this great movement, although it was regarded with mixed feelings by the spectators ({{bibleverse||Haggai|2:3|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Zechariah|4:10|HE}}).<ref name=\"Temple, the Second\"/>\n\nThe [[Samaritan]]s wanted to help with this work but Zerubbabel and the elders declined such cooperation, feeling that the Jews must build the Temple unaided. Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews. According to {{Bibleref2|Ezra 4:5}}, the Samaritans sought to \"frustrate their purpose\" and sent messengers to [[Ecbatana]] and Susa, with the result that the work was suspended.<ref name=\"Temple, the Second\"/>\n\nSeven years later, [[Cyrus the Great]], who allowed the Jews to [[Return to Zion|return]] to their homeland and rebuild the Temple, died ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|36:22–23|HE}}) and was succeeded by his son [[Cambyses]]. On his death, the \"false [[Smerdis]]\", an impostor, occupied the throne for some seven or eight months, and then [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] became king (522 BCE). In the second year of his rule the work of rebuilding the temple was resumed and carried forward to its completion ({{bibleverse||Ezra|5:6–6:15|HE}}), under the stimulus of the earnest counsels and admonitions of the prophets [[Haggai]] and [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]]. It was ready for consecration in the spring of 516 BCE, more than twenty years after the return from captivity. The Temple was completed on the third day of the month [[Adar]], in the sixth year of the reign of Darius, amid great rejoicings on the part of all the people ({{bibleverse||Ezra|6:15,16|HE}}), although it was evident that the Jews were no longer an independent people, but were subject to a foreign power. The [[Book of Haggai]] includes a prediction that the glory of the second temple would be greater than that of the first ({{bibleverse||Haggai|2:9|HE}}).<ref name=\"Temple, the Second\"/>\n\nSome of the original artifacts from the Temple of Solomon are not mentioned in the sources after its destruction in 597 BCE, and are presumed lost.

When the Second Temple in Jerusalem was looted and its religious services stopped, [[Judaism]] was effectively outlawed. In 167 BCE, [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] ordered an altar to [[Zeus]] erected in the Temple. He also banned [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision]] and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the Temple.<ref>[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0148:book=1:section=31 Flavius Josephus, The Wars of the Jews]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Jewish War'' i. 34</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Maccabean Revolt]] against the Seleucid empire, the Second Temple was rededicated and became the religious pillar of the Jewish [[Hasmonean kingdom]], as well as culturally associated with the Jewish holiday of [[Hanukkah]].\n\n==Hasmonean dynasty and Roman conquest==\nThere is some evidence from archaeology that further changes to the structure of the Temple and its surroundings were made during the Hasmonean rule. [[Salome Alexandra]], the queen of Hasmonean Kingdom appointed her elder son [[Hyrcanus II]] as the [[High Priest of Israel|high priest of Judaea]]. Her younger son [[Aristobulus II]] was determined to have the throne, and as soon as she died he seized the throne. Hyrcanus, who was in line to be the king, agreed to be contented with being the high priest. [[Antipater the Idumaean|Antipater]], the governor of Idumæa, encouraged Hyrcanus not to give up his throne. Eventually Hyrcanus fled to [[Aretas III]], king of the [[Nabateans]], and returned with an army to take back the throne. He defeated Aristobulus and besieged Jerusalem. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] general [[Pompey]], who was in Syria fighting against the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenians]] in the [[Third Mithridatic War]], sent his lieutenant to investigate the conflict in Judaea. Both Hyrcanus and Aristobulus appealed to him for support. Pompey was not diligent in making a decision about this which caused Aristobulus to march off. He was pursued by Pompey and surrendered but his followers closed Jerusalem to Pompey's forces. The Romans [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|besieged]] and took the city in 63 BCE. The priests continued with the religious practices inside the Temple during the siege. The temple was not looted or harmed by the Romans. Pompey himself, perhaps inadvertently, went into the [[Holy of Holies]] and the next day ordered the priests to repurify the Temple and resume the religious practices.<ref name= \"Lester2010\">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=i89-9fdNUcAC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20|title= An Introduction to Second Temple Judaism: History and Religion of the Jews in the Time of Nehemiah, the Maccabees, Hillel, and Jesus|author= [[Lester L.

An agreement was made between Herod and the Jewish religious authorities: the sacrificial rituals, called [[korbanot|offerings]], were to be continued unabated for the entire time of construction, and the Temple itself would be constructed by the priests. Later the Exodus 30:13 [[sanctuary shekel]] was reinstituted to support the temple as the [[temple tax]].\n\n===Platform===\n[[Moriah|Mt. Moriah]] had a plateau at the northern end, and steeply declined on the southern slope. It was Herod's plan that the entire mountain be turned into a giant square platform. The Temple Mount was originally intended to be 1600 feet wide by 900 feet broad by 9 stories high, with walls up to 16 feet thick, but had never been finished. To complete it, a trench was dug around the mountain, and huge stone \"bricks\" were laid.  Some of these weighed well over 100 tons, [[Western Stone|the largest]] measuring 44.6 feet by 11 feet by 16.5 feet and weighing approximately 567 to 628 tons,<ref>The History Channel cited the 16.5 depth 567 ton estimate in \"Lost Worlds of King Herod\"</ref><ref>Dan Bahat: Touching the Stones of our Heritage, Israeli ministry of Religious Affairs, 2002</ref> while most were in the range of 2.5 by 3.5 by 15 feet (approximately 28 tons). King Herod had architects from Greece, Rome and Egypt plan the construction. The blocks were presumably quarried by using pickaxes to create channels. Then they hammered in wooden beams and flushed them with water to force them out. Once they were removed, they were carved into precise squares and numbered at the quarry to show where they would be installed. The final carving would have been done by using harder stones to grind or chisel them to create precise joints. They would have been transported using oxen and specialized carts. Since the quarry was uphill from the temple they had gravity on their side but care needed to be taken to control the descent. Final installation would have been done using pulleys or [[Roman crane|cranes]]. Roman pulleys and cranes weren't strong enough to lift the blocks alone so they may have used multiple cranes and levers to position them.<ref>\"Modern Marvels: Bible tech\" History channel</ref> As the mountainside began to rise, the western side was carved away to a vertical wall and bricks were carved to create a virtual continuation of the brick face, which was continued for a while until the northern slope reached ground level. Part of the Antonian hill to the north of Moriah was annexed to the complex and the area between was filled up with landfill.\n\nThe project began with the building of giant underground vaults upon which the temple would be built so it could be larger than the small flat area on top of Mount Moriah. Ground level at the time was at least 20&nbsp;ft. (6m) below the current level, as can be seen by walking the [[Western Wall]] tunnels. Legend has it that the construction of the entire complex lasted only three years, but other sources such as [[Josephus]] say that it took far longer, although the Temple itself may have taken that long. During a Passover visit by Jesus the Jews replied that it had been under construction for 46 years.<ref>Gospel of John 2:20</ref> It is possible that the complex was only a few years completed when the future Emperor [[Titus]] destroyed the Temple in 70 CE.\n\n===Court of the Gentiles===\nThis area was primarily a bazaar, with vendors selling souvenirs, sacrificial animals, food, as well as currency changers, exchanging Roman for [[Tyrian shekel|Tyrian]] money because the Jews were not allowed to coin their own money and they viewed Roman currency as an abomination to the Lord,<ref>Beasley-Murray, G. (1999). Word biblical commentary: John (2 ed., Vol. 36). Nashville, Tennessee: Thomas Nelson.</ref> as also mentioned in the New Testament account of [[Jesus and the Money Changers]] when Jerusalem was packed with Jews who had come for Passover, perhaps numbering 300,000 to 400,000 [[pilgrims]].<ref>[[E.

Jewish males had the unique opportunity to be shown inside the temple itself.\n\nThe [[Kohanim|priests]], in their white linen robes and tubular hats, were everywhere, directing pilgrims and advising them on what kinds of sacrifices were to be performed.\n\nBehind them, as they entered the Court of the Gentiles from the south through the [[Huldah Gates]], was the Royal Porch, which contained a marketplace, administrative quarters, and a synagogue. On the upper floors, the [[Zugot|great Jewish sages]] held court, priests and [[Levites]] performed various chores, and from there, tourists were able to observe the events. The Royal Porch is widely accepted to be part of Herod's work; however, recent archaeological finds in the Western Wall tunnels suggest that it was built in the first century during the reign of Agripas, as opposed to the first century BCE,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/Article_eng.aspx?sec_id=25&subj_id=240&id=1882&hist=1|title=Israel Antiquities Authority|publisher=}}</ref> while the theory that Herod began the extension and the Royal Porch is based mainly on Josephus's possibly politically motivated claim. During Herod's reign the porch was not yet open to the public.\n\nTo the east of the court was [[Solomon's Porch]], and to the north, the ''soreg'', the \"middle wall of separation\",<ref>In verse 14 of {{bibleref2|Ephesians|2:11–18|9|Ephesians 2:11–18}}</ref> a stone wall separating the public area from the inner sanctuary where only Jews could enter, described as being 3 cubits high by Josephus (Wars 5.5.2 [3b] 6.2.4).\n\n===Pinnacle===\nThe accounts of [[Jesus|Jesus's]] [[Temptations of Christ|temptations]] in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]'s and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]'s gospels both suggest that the Second Temple had one or more [[pinnacle]]s ({{lang-gr|το πτερυγιον του ιερου}}):\n{{quote|Then he {{bracket|[[Satan]]}} brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, \"If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here.\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|4:9|NKJV}}</ref>}}\nThe Greek word used here is pterugion, which literally means a little wing, or by extension anything like a wing such as a battlement or parapet.<ref>Strong’s Concordance 4419</ref> The archaeologist Benjamin Mazar thought it referred to the southeast corner of the Temple overlooking the Kidron Valley.<ref>Benjamin Mazar,The Mountain of the Lord, Doubleday;1975, p 149</ref>\n\n===Inside the Soreg===\nAccording to Josephus, there were ten entrances into the inner courts, four on the south, four on the north, one on the east and one leading east to west from the Court of Women to the court of the Israelites, named the Nicanor Gate.<ref>Josephus, War 5.5.2; 198; m. Mid. 1.4</ref> <!-- The following text seems to have gotten scrambled--> The gates were: On the south side (going from west to east) the Fuel Gate, the Firstling Gate, the Water Gate. On the north side, from west to east, are the Jeconiah Gate, the Offering Gate, the Women's Gate and the Song Gate. On the Eastern side, the Nicanor gate, which is where most Jewish visitors entered. A few pieces of the Soreg have survived to the present day.\n\nWithin this area was the [[Court of the women|Court of the Women]], open to all Jews, male and female. Even a ritually unclean [[Kohen|Cohen]] could enter to perform various housekeeping duties. There was also a place for lepers (considered ritually unclean), as well as a ritual barbershop for [[Nazirites]]. In this, the largest of the temple courts, one could see constant dancing, singing and music.\n\nOnly men were allowed to enter the Court of the Israelites, where they could observe sacrifices of the high priest in the Court of the Priests. The Court of the Priests was reserved for Levite priests.\n\n===Temple sanctuary===\n[[File:The rock of the Dome of the Rock Corrected.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Foundation Stone]]'' under the Dome of the Rock, a possible historical location for the Kodesh Hakodashim]]\nBetween the entrance of the building and the curtain veiling the [[Kadosh Hakadashim|Holy of Holies]] were the famous vessels of the temple: the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], the incense-burning altar, and various other implements.\n\n==Pilgrimages==\n<gallery>\nFile:Reconstruction model of Ancient Jerusalem in Museum of David Castle.jpg|thumb|Proposed reconstruction of Robinson's Arch\nFile:Arch of Titus Menorah.png|thumb|left|Roman triumphal procession with spoils from the Temple, depicted on the inside wall of the [[Arch of Titus]] in [[Rome]]\nFile:Madaba map.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Madaba Map]] depiction of 6th-century [[Aelia Capitolina]] has the ''[[Cardo]] Maximus'', the town’s main street, beginning at the northern gate, today's [[Damascus Gate]], and traversing the city in a straight line from north to south to \"Nea Church\".\nFile:RobinsonsArchMay2009.jpg|thumb|[[Robinson's Arch]] – remains of the entrance built by Herod to the [[Royal Stoa (Jerusalem)|Royal Colonnade]]\nFile:TempleStepsMay2009.JPG|thumb|250px|Remnants of the 1st century Stairs of Ascent, discovered by archaeologist Benjamin Mazar, to the entrance of the Temple Courtyard.

They would check their animals, then visit a [[mikveh]], where they would [[Ritual purification|ritually cleanse and purify]] themselves. The pilgrims would then retrieve their sacrificial animals, and head to the Huldah gates. After ascending a staircase three stories in height, and passing through the gate, the pilgrims would find themselves in the Court of the Gentiles.\n\n==Destruction==\n[[File:Roberts Siege and Destruction of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege and Destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans (1850 painting by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]]).

The [[Arch of Titus]], in [[Rome]] and built to commemorate Titus's victory in [[Iudaea Province|Judea]], depicts a Roman [[Roman triumph|victory procession]] with soldiers carrying spoils from the Temple, including the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]. According to an inscription on the Colosseum, Emperor [[Vespasian]] built the Colosseum with war spoils in 79 CE—possibly from the spoils of the Second Temple.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1311985/Colosseum-built-with-loot-from-sack-of-Jerusalem-temple.html|title=Colosseum 'built with loot from sack of Jerusalem temple'|first=By Bruce Johnston in|last=Rome|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe sects of Judaism that had their base in the Temple dwindled in importance, including the [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)|priesthood]] and the [[Sadducees]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Alföldy|first=Géza |title=Eine Bauinschrift aus dem Colosseum |journal=[[Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik]] |year=1995|volume=109|pages=195–226 |jstor=20189648 }}</ref>\n\nThe destruction date according to the [[Hebrew calendar]] was the 9th of [[Av]], also known as [[Tisha B'Av]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/h/9av/oal/96779149.html?s=mpw|title=Tisha B'Av – Ninth of Av|last=Simmons|first=Shraga|authorlink=Shraga Simmons|accessdate=2013-05-20}}</ref> The Temple was on the site of what today is the [[Dome of the Rock]]. The gates let out close to [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] (which came much later).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Although Jews continued to inhabit the destroyed city, Emperor [[Hadrian]] established a new city called [[Aelia Capitolina]]. At the end of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in 135 CE, many of the Jewish communities were massacred and Jews were banned from living inside Jerusalem. A pagan [[Roman temple]] was set up on the former site of Herod's Temple.<ref name= \"Lester2010\"/>\n\n==Archaeology==\n{{refimprove|section|date=August 2018}}\nIn 1871, a hewn stone measuring 60 × 90&nbsp;cm. and engraved with Greek uncials was discovered near a court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and identified by [[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau]] as being the [[Temple Warning inscription]]. The stone inscription outlined the prohibition extended unto those who were not of the Jewish nation to proceed beyond the ''soreg'' separating the larger Court of the Gentiles and the inner courts. The inscription read in seven lines:\n{{poemquote|{{lang|grc|ΜΗΟΕΝΑΑΛΛΟΓΕΝΗΕΙΣΠΟ\nΡΕΥΕΣΟΑΙΕΝΤΟΣΤΟΥΠΕ\nΡΙΤΟΙΕΡΟΝΤΡΥΦΑΚΤΟΥΚΑΙ\nΠΕΡΙΒΟΛΟΥΟΣΔΑΝΛΗ\nΦΘΗΕΑΥΤΩΙΑΙΤΙΟΣΕΣ\nΤΑΙΔΙΑΤΟΕΞΑΚΟΛΟΥ\nΘΕΙΝΘΑΝΑΤΟΝ}}}}\nTranslation: \"Let no foreigner enter within the parapet and the partition which surrounds the Temple precincts. Anyone caught [violating] will be held accountable for his ensuing death.\" Today, the stone is preserved in Istanbul's Museum of Antiquities.\n\nIn 1936 a fragment of a similar Temple warning inscription was found.\n\nAfter 1967, archaeologists found that the wall extended all the way around the Temple Mount and is part of the city wall near the [[Lions' Gate]]. Thus, the Western Wall is not the only remaining part of the [[Temple Mount]]. Currently, Robinson's Arch (named after American [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]]) remains as the beginning of an arch that spanned the gap between the top of the platform and the higher ground farther away. This had been used by the priests as an entrance. Commoners had entered through the still-extant, but now plugged, gates on the southern side which led through [[colonnade]]s to the top of the platform. One of these colonnades is still extant and reachable through the Temple Mount. The [[Southern wall]] was designed as a grand entrance. Recent archeological digs have found thousands of ''[[mikveh]]s'' (ceremonial bathtubs) for the ritual purification of the worshipers, and a grand stairway leading to the now blocked entrance. Inside the walls, the platform was supported by a series of vaulted archways, now called [[Solomon's Stables]], which still exist and whose current renovation by the ''[[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|Waqf]]'' is extremely controversial. The temple was constructed of imported white marble that gleamed in the daylight.\n\nOn September 25, 2007, [[Yuval Baruch]], [[archaeologist]] with the [[Israeli Antiquities Authority]] announced the discovery of a quarry compound which may have provided King Herod with the stones to build his Temple on the [[Temple Mount]]. Coins, pottery and an iron stake found proved the date of the quarrying to be about 19 BCE. <!-- How? --> Archaeologist [[Ehud Netzer]] confirmed that the large outlines of the stone cuts is evidence that it was a massive public project worked by hundreds of slaves.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gaffney |first=Sean |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-09-24-1382898922_x.htm |title=USATODAY.com, Report: Herod's Temple quarry found |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2013-08-31}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Magdala stone]] is thought to be a representation of the Second Temple carved before its destruction in the year 70.<ref name=Kershner>{{cite news|last1=Kershner|first1=Isabel|title=A Carved Stone Block Upends Assumptions About Ancient Judaism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/world/middleeast/magdala-stone-israel-judaism.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news|accessdate=9 December 2015|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=8 December 2015}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Magdala Stone (4).jpg|Magdala Stone\nFile:Barkokhba-silver-tetradrachm.jpg|Bar Kokhba tetradracm showing the Jerusalem Temple façade 132–135 CE\nFile:Rom, Titusbogen, Triumphzug 3.jpg|Arch of Titus showing spoils of Jerusalem Temple\nFile:Ancient Jerusalem, A remnant of the temple walls.jpg|The upper corner of Herod's temple colonnade with ancient Hebrew inscription\nFile:Jerusalem Temple Warning Inscription.jpg|The Warning Inscription found in 1871\nFile:XV04 - Roma, Museo civiltà romana - Lapide del Tempio - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 12-Apr-2008.jpg|A copy of the inscription found in 1871\nFile:Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Archaeology WingDSCN5007.JPG|Fragment of Second Temple Warning\nFile:To the trumpeting place.jpg|The [[Trumpeting Place inscription]], a stone (2.43&nbsp;×&nbsp;1 [[Metre|m]]) with [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] inscription \"To the Trumpeting Place\" excavated by [[Benjamin Mazar]] at the southern foot of the [[Temple Mount]] is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.\n</gallery>\n\n==Second Temple Judaism==\n{{main|Second Temple Judaism}}\nThe period between the construction of the Second Temple in 515 BCE and its destruction by the Romans in 70 CE witnessed major historical upheavals and significant religious changes that would affect most subsequent [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] religions.
