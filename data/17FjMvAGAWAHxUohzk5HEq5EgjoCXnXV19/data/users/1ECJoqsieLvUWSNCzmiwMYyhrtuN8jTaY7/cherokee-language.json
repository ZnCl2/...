Linguists believe that the Cherokee people migrated to the southeast from the [[Great Lakes]] region{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} about three thousand years ago, bringing with them their language. Despite the three-thousand-year geographic separation, the Cherokee language today still shows some similarities to the languages spoken around the Great Lakes, such as [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], [[Onondaga language|Onondaga]], [[Seneca language|Seneca]], and [[Tuscarora language|Tuscarora]].\n\nSome researchers (such as Thomas Whyte) have suggested the homeland of the proto-Iroquoian language resides in Appalachia. Whyte contends, based on linguistic and molecular studies, that proto-Iroquoian speakers participated in cultural and economic exchanges along the north-south axis of the Appalachian Mountains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} The divergence of Southern Iroquoian (which Cherokee is the only known branch of) from the Northern Iroquoian languages occurred approximately 4,000-3,000 years ago as Late Archaic proto-Iroquoian speaking peoples became more sedentary with the advent of horticulture, advancement of lithic technologies and the emergence of social complexity in the Eastern Woodlands. In the subsequent millennia, the Northern Iroquoian and Southern Iroquoian would be separated by various Algonquin and Siouan speaking peoples as linguistic, religious, social and technological practices from the Algonquin to the north and east and the Siouans to the west from the Ohio Valley would come to be practiced by peoples in the Chesapeake region, as well as parts of the Carolinas.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cherokee Heritage Center - New Hope Church - Bible cover in Cherokee script (2015-05-27 14.09.44 by Wesley Fryer).jpg|thumb|Cherokee Heritage Center - New Hope Church - Bible cover in Cherokee script (2015-05-27 14.09.44 by Wesley Fryer)]]\n{{main|History of the Cherokee language}}\n{{see also|Cherokee history}}\n\n===Literacy===\n{{see also|Cherokee syllabary|Sequoyah}}\n[[File:Adams Corner - Kirche 7.jpg|thumb|left|Translation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] into the Cherokee language, 1856]]\n\nBefore the development of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] in the 1820s, Cherokee was a spoken language only. The Cherokee syllabary is a [[syllabary]] invented by [[Sequoyah]] to write the Cherokee language in the late 1810s and early 1820s. His creation of the syllabary is particularly noteworthy in that he could not previously read any script. Sequoyah had some contact with English literacy and the Roman alphabet through his proximity to [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|Fort Loundon]], where he engaged in trade with Europeans. He was exposed to English literacy through his white father. His limited understanding of the [[Roman alphabet]], including the ability to recognize the letters of his name, may have aided him in the creation of the Cherokee syllabary.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cushman|first=Ellen|year=2011|title=\"We're Taking the Genius of Sequoyah into This Century\": The Cherokee Syllabary, Peoplehood, and Perseverance|jstor=10.5749/wicazosareview.26.1.0067|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|volume=26|pages=72–75|doi=10.5749/wicazosareview.26.1.0067}}</ref> When developing the written language, Sequoyah first experimented with [[logogram]]s, but his system later developed into a syllabary.  In his system, each symbol represents a [[syllable]] rather than a single [[phoneme]]; the 85 (originally 86){{Sfn | Sturtevant | Fogelson | 2004 | p = 337}} characters in the Cherokee syllabary provide a suitable method to write Cherokee. Some symbols do resemble the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and even the [[Cyrillic script]]s' letters, but the sounds are completely different (for example, the sound /a/ is written with a letter that resembles Latin D).\n\nAround 1809, Sequoyah began work to create a system of writing for the Cherokee language.<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/science/23cherokee.html?ref=science | title=Carvings From Cherokee Script's Dawn | work=New York Times | date=June 22, 2009 | accessdate=June 23, 2009 | author=Wilford, John Noble}}</ref> At first he sought to create a [[Logogram|character for each word]] in the language.

Retrieved April 4, 2013.[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v008/v008p149.html]</ref>\n\nSequoyah did not succeed until he gave up trying to represent entire words and developed a symbol for each syllable in the language. After approximately a month, he had a system of 86 [[Grapheme|characters]], some of which were [[Latin script|Latin]] letters he obtained from a spelling book.<ref name=\"gc\"/> \"In their present form, many of the syllabary characters resemble Roman, [[Cyrillic]] or [[Greek letters]] or [[Arabic numerals]],\" says Janine Scancarelli, a scholar of Cherokee writing, \"but there is no apparent relationship between their sounds in other languages and in Cherokee.\"<ref name=nyt/>\n\nUnable to find adults willing to learn the syllabary, he taught it to his daughter, ''Ayokeh'' (also spelled Ayoka).<ref name=nyt/> Langguth says she was only six years old at the time.<ref name=\"Langguth\">Langguth, p. 71</ref> He traveled to the Indian Reserves in the [[Arkansaw Territory]] where some Cherokee had settled. When he tried to convince the local leaders of the syllabary's usefulness, they doubted him, believing that the symbols were merely ''[[ad hoc]]'' reminders. Sequoyah asked each to say a word, which he wrote down, and then called his daughter in to read the words back. This demonstration convinced the leaders to let him teach the syllabary to a few more people. This took several months, during which it was rumored that he might be using the students for sorcery. After completing the lessons, Sequoyah wrote a dictated letter to each student, and read a dictated response. This test convinced the western Cherokee that he had created a practical writing system.<ref name=\"boudinot\"/>\n\nWhen Sequoyah returned east, he brought a sealed envelope containing a written speech from one of the Arkansas Cherokee leaders. By reading this speech, he convinced the eastern Cherokee also to learn the system, after which it spread rapidly.<ref name=\"gc\"/><ref name=\"boudinot\"/> In 1825 the Cherokee Nation officially adopted the writing system. From 1828 to 1834, American missionaries assisted the Cherokee in using Sequoyah's syllabary to develop type characters and print the ''[[Cherokee Phoenix]]'', the first [[newspaper]] of the Cherokee Nation, with text in both Cherokee and English.<ref name=\"Sequoyah\">[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-618&sug=y \"Sequoyah\"], ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'', accessed January 3, 2009</ref>\n\nIn 1826, the Cherokee National Council commissioned George Lowrey and David Brown to translate and print eight copies of the laws of the Cherokee Nation in the new Cherokee language using Sequoyah's system.<ref name=\"Davis\"/>\n\nOnce [[Albert Gallatin]] saw a copy of Sequoyah's syllabary, he found the syllabary superior to the English alphabet. Even though the Cherokee student must learn 85 characters instead of 26, he can read immediately. The student could accomplish in a few weeks what students of English writing could learn in two years.<ref name=\"Langguth\" />\n\nIn 1824, the General Council of the Eastern Cherokee awarded Sequoyah a large silver medal in honor of the syllabary. According to Davis, one side of the medal bore his image surrounded by the inscription in English, \"Presented to George Gist by the General Council of the Cherokee for his ingenuity in the invention of the Cherokee Alphabet.\" The reverse side showed two long-stemmed pipes and the same inscription written in Cherokee. Supposedly, Sequoyah wore the medal throughout the rest of his life and it was buried with him.<ref name=Davis/>\n\nBy 1825, the Bible and numerous religious hymns and pamphlets, educational materials, legal documents and books were translated into the Cherokee language. Thousands of Cherokee became literate and the literacy rate for Cherokee in the syllabary was higher than that of whites in the [[English alphabet]].\n\nThough use of the Cherokee syllabary declined after many of the Cherokee were relocated to [[Indian Territory]], present day [[Oklahoma]], it has survived in private correspondence, renderings of the Bible, and descriptions of Indian medicine<ref name = britannica>{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/109503/Cherokee-language|title=Cherokee language|website= www.britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=May 22, 2014}}</ref> and now can be found in books and on the internet among other places.\n\nNearly two hundred years later, John Standingdeer Jr. figured out that Sequoyah's 85 characters could be divided into 16 basic sounds. He also developed computer software to help people learn the language.<ref name=Standingdeer/>\n\n==Geographic distribution==\nCherokee is the most populous [[Native American language]] spoken in the U.S. states of [[Oklahoma]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Arkansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Indiana]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], [[Maryland]], [[Texas]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Kentucky]].<ref name=states>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/05/language_map_what_s_the_most_popular_language_in_your_state.html|last=Blatt|first=Ben|title=Tagalog in California, Cherokee in Arkansas: What language does your state speak?|work=Data source: Census Bureau American Community Survey.

The Giduwa dialect (Eastern Band) and the Otali dialect (also called the Overhill dialect) spoken in Oklahoma. The Otali dialect has drifted significantly from Sequoyah's syllabary in the past 150 years, and many contracted and borrowed words have been adopted into the language. These noun and verb roots in Cherokee, however, can still be mapped to Sequoyah's syllabary. In modern times, there are more than 85 syllables in use by modern Cherokee speakers. Modern Cherokee speakers who speak Otali employ 122 distinct syllables in Oklahoma.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n== Current status ==\n{{main|Status of the Cherokee language}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 250\n| image1    = Swyddfa Bost Tahlequah.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma|Tahlequah]] is a city in [[Oklahoma]] where Cherokee is still predominantly spoken.\n| image2    = Kituwah Academy.png\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = A lesson at Kituwah Academy on the [[Qualla Boundary]] in [[North Carolina]].

Unlike most languages, the [[Cherokee]] inventory of consonants lacks the labial sounds ''p'', ''b'', ''f'', and ''v''. Cherokee does, however, have one [[labial consonant]] ''m'', but it is rare, appearing in no more than ten native words.<ref>{{cite book|last=King|first=Duane Harold|title=A Grammar and Dictionary of the Cherokee Language|year=1975|pages=16, 21}}</ref> In fact, the Lower dialect does not produce ''m'' at all. Instead, it uses ''w''.\n\nIn the case of ''p'', ''qw'' is often substituted, as in the name of the Cherokee [[:chr:|Wikipedia]], ''Wiɣi'''qw'''ejdiʃ''. Some words may contains sounds not reflected in the given phonology: for instance, the modern Oklahoma use of the loanword \"automobile\", with the {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/b/}} sounds of English.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nAs with many Iroquoian languages, Cherokee's phonetic inventory is small. The consonants for North Carolina Cherokee are given in the table below. The consonants of all Iroquoian languages pattern so that they may be grouped as (oral) obstruents, sibilants, laryngeals, and resonants ([[#refLounsbury1978|Lounsbury 1978]]:337). Obstruents are non-distinctively aspirated when they precede ''h''. There is some variation in how orthographies represent these allophones. The orthography used in the table represents the aspirated allophones as ''th'', ''kh'', and ''tsh''. Another common orthography represents the unaspirated allophones as ''d'', ''ɣ'', and ''dz'' and the aspirated allophones as ''t'', ''k'', and ''s'' ([[#refScancarelli2005|Scancarelli 2005]]:359–62).  The unaspirated plosives and affricate are optionally voiced intervocally. In other dialects, the affricate is a palatal (like ''ch'' in \"church\"), and a lateral affricate (like ''tl'' in \"atlas\") may also be present.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ '''<small>North Carolina Cherokee consonants</small>'''\n!\n!

As with all Iroquoian languages, this includes a nasalized vowel ([[#refLounsbury1978|Lounsbury 1978]]:337). In the case of Cherokee, the nasalized vowel is a [[schwa]], which most orthographies represent as ''v'' and is pronounced {{IPA|[ə]}} as \"e\" in unstressed \"banker\". Since it is nasal, it sounds rather like [[French language|French]] ''un''. Other vowels, when ending a word, are often also nasalized. Vowels can be short or long.<ref>Feeling, \"Dictionary,\" p. ix</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n! [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! [[Central vowel|Central]]\n!

Tone is poorly documented in North Carolina Cherokee. The syllabary, moreover, does not display tone, and real meaning discrepancies{{clarify|date=January 2013}} are rare within the native-language Cherokee-speaking community. The same goes for transliterated Cherokee (\"osiyo\", \"dohitsu\", etc.), which is rarely written with any tone markers, except in dictionaries. Native speakers can tell the difference between written tone-distinguished words by context.\n\n==== Tone inventory ====\nThe tone name in the left-hand column displays the labels most recently used in studies of the language.<ref name=\"Montgomery-Anderson, 2008, p. 49\"/> The second represents the tone in standardized [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text‐align: center\"\n|-\n! Tone Name\n! IPA\n|-\n| Low\n| {{IPA|˨}}\n|-\n| High\n| {{IPA|˦}}\n|-\n| Rising\n| {{IPA|˨˦}}\n|-\n| Falling\n| {{IPA|˥˩}}\n|-\n| Highfall\n| {{IPA|˥˧}}\n|-\n| Lowfall\n| {{IPA|˧˩}}\n|}\n\n==== Tone environments ====\nThe high and low tones can appear on both long and short vowels in Cherokee,<ref>Montgomery-Anderson, 2008, p. 50</ref> and remain at the same pitch throughout the duration of the vowel sound. Contour tones in Cherokee appear ''only'' in underlying long vowels.<ref>Montgomery-Anderson, 2008, p. 51</ref> At the ends of words in colloquial speech, there is a tendency to drop off a long vowel into a short vowel; this results in the highfall tone being produced as a high tone in faster speech.\n<ref>Montgomery-Anderson, 2008, p. 52</ref>\n\n==== Highfall ====\nHighfall has a unique grammatical usage, primarily appearing with adjectives and adverbials along with most nouns derived from verbs. It only appears in verbs subordinate to another element of the sentence. When a highfall appears on a verb it changes the verb's role in the sentence, typically to one of four main categories: agentive derivation, modal, object derivation, or subordination.<ref>Montgomery-Anderson, 2008, p. 54</ref>\n\n== Grammar ==\nCherokee, like many Native American languages, is [[polysynthetic]], meaning that many [[morphemes]] may be linked together to form a single word, which may be of great length. Cherokee [[verbs]], the most important word type, must contain as a minimum a [[pronoun|pronominal]] [[prefix]], a verb root, an [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] suffix, and a modal suffix.<ref name=\"Feeling et al., Verb p. 16\"/> For example, the verb form '''ge:ga''', \"I am going,\" has each of these elements:\n\n<blockquote style=\"background: white; \">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Verb form '''ge:ga'''\n|-\n| g-  || e: || -g || -a\n|-\n| PRONOMINAL PREFIX || <small>VERB ROOT</small> \"to go\" || <small>ASPECT SUFFIX</small> || <small>MODAL SUFFIX</small>\n|}\n</blockquote>\n\nThe pronominal prefix is g-, which indicates first person singular. The verb root is -e, \"to go.\" The aspect suffix that this verb employs for the present-tense stem is -g-. The present-tense modal suffix for regular verbs in Cherokee is -a.\n\nCherokee has 17 verb tenses and 10 persons.<ref name=Standingdeer/>\n\nThe following is a conjugation in the present tense of the verb to go.<ref name=\"Robinson, Conjugation p. 60\">Robinson, \"Conjugation\" p. 60</ref> Please note that there is no distinction between dual and plural in the 3rd person.\n\n<blockquote style=\"background: white;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Full conjugation of Root Verb'''-e-''' going\n|-\n| || Singular || Dual incl. || Dual excl. || Plural incl. || Plural excl.\n|-\n| 1st || {{lang|chr|ᎨᎦ}}<br/>'''{{lang|chr|gega}}'''<br/>I'm going || {{lang|chr|ᎢᏁᎦ}}<br/>'''{{lang|chr|inega}}'''<br/>We're going (you + I) || {{lang|chr|ᎣᏍᏕᎦ}}<br/>'''{{lang|chr|osdega}}'''<br/>We two are going (not you) || {{lang|chr|ᎢᏕᎦ}}<br/>'''{{lang|chr|idega}}'''<br/>We're all going (3+, including you) || {{lang|chr|ᎣᏤᎦ}}<br/>'''{{lang|chr|otsega}}'''<br/>We're all going (3+, not you)\n|-\n| 2nd ||{{lang|chr|ᎮᎦ}}<br/>'''{{lang|chr|hega}}'''<br/>You're going || colspan=\"2\" | {{lang|chr|ᏍᏕᎦ}}<br/>'''{{lang|chr|sdega}}'''<br/>You two are going || colspan=\"2\" | {{lang|chr|ᎢᏤᎦ}}<br/>'''{{lang|chr|itsega}}'''<br/>You're all going\n|-\n| 3rd ||{{lang|chr|ᎡᎦ}}<br/>'''{{lang|chr|ega}}'''<br/>She/he/it's going || colspan=\"4\" | {{lang|chr|ᎠᏁᎦ}}<br/>'''{{lang|chr|anega}}'''<br/>They are going\n|}\n</blockquote>\n\nThe translation uses the present progressive (\"at this time I am going\"). Cherokee differentiates between progressive (\"I am going\") and habitual (\"I go\") more than English does.\n\nThe forms {{lang|chr|ᎨᎪᎢ}}, {{lang|chr|ᎮᎪᎢ}}, {{lang|chr|ᎡᎪᎢ}} '''{{lang|chr|gegoi}}, {{lang|chr|hegoi}}, {{lang|chr|egoi}}''' represent \"I often/usually go\", \"you often/usually go\", and \"she/he/it often/usually goes\", respectively.<ref name=\"Robinson, Conjugation p. 60\"/>\n\nVerbs can also have prepronominal prefixes, reflexive prefixes, and derivative suffixes. Given all possible combinations of affixes, each regular verb can have 21,262 inflected forms.\n\nCherokee does not make gender distinctions. For example, {{lang|chr|ᎦᏬᏂᎭ}} ''{{lang|chr|gawoniha}}'' can mean either \"she is speaking\" or \"he is speaking.\"<ref>Feeling, \"Dictionary\" xiii</ref>\n\n=== Pronouns and pronominal prefixes ===\nLike many Native American languages, Cherokee has many pronominal prefixes that can index both subject and object. Pronominal prefixes always appear on verbs and can also appear on adjectives and nouns.<ref name=\"Montgomery-Anderson, 2008, p. 49\" /> There are two separate words which function as pronouns: ''aya'' \"I, me\" and ''nihi'' \"you\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Table of Cherokee first person pronominal prefixes\n|-\n!

Only around 20 common verbs require one of these classifiers (such as the equivalents of \"pick up\", \"put down\", \"remove\", \"wash\", \"hide\", \"eat\", \"drag\", \"have\", \"hold\", \"put in water\", \"put in fire\", \"hang up\", \"be placed\", \"pull along\").  The classifiers can be grouped into five categories:\n\n* Live\n* Flexible (most common)\n* Long (narrow, not flexible)\n* Indefinite (solid, heavy relative to size), also used as default category<ref>{{Cite book|title = A Grammar and Dictionary of the Cherokee Language|last = King|first = Duane|publisher = Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Georgia|year = 1975|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n* Liquid (or container of)\n\nExample:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conjugation of \"Hand him...\"\n|-\n!

Adjectives come before nouns, as in English. Demonstratives, such as {{lang|chr|ᎾᏍᎩ}} ''{{lang|chr|nasgi}}'' (\"that\") or {{lang|chr|ᎯᎠ}} ''{{lang|chr|hia}}'' (\"this\"), come at the beginning of noun phrases. Relative clauses follow noun phrases.<ref name=\"Feeling, Dictionary p. 353\">Feeling, \"Dictionary\" p. 353</ref> Adverbs precede the verbs that they are modifying. For example, \"she's speaking loudly\" is {{lang|chr|ᎠᏍᏓᏯ ᎦᏬᏂᎭ}} ''{{lang|chr|asdaya gawoniha}}'' (literally, \"loud she's-speaking\").<ref name=\"Feeling, Dictionary p. 353\"/>\n\nA Cherokee sentence may not have a verb as when two noun phrases form a sentence. In such a case, word order is flexible. For example, {{lang|chr|Ꮎ ᎠᏍᎦᏯ ᎠᎩᏙᏓ}} ''{{lang|chr|na asgaya agidoda}}'' (\"that man is my father\"). A noun phrase might be followed by an adjective, such as in {{lang|chr|ᎠᎩᏙᏓ ᎤᏔᎾ}} ''{{lang|chr|agidoga utana}}'' (\"my father is big\").<ref>Feeling, \"Dictionary\" p. 354</ref>\n\n== Orthography ==\n{{main|Cherokee syllabary}}\n[[File:Sequoyah.jpg|thumb|[[Sequoyah]], inventor of the Cherokee syllabary]]\n\nCherokee is written in an 85-character [[syllabary]] invented by [[Sequoyah]] (also known as Guest or George Gist). Many of the letters resemble the [[Latin script|Latin]] letters they derive from, but have completely unrelated sound values; Sequoyah had seen English, [[Hebrew]], and [[Greek language|Greek]] writing but did not know how to read them.<!-- In all known cases where a person invented a script after seeing phonetic writing, but without knowing how to write, the results have been syllabaries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} --><ref>Feeling, \"Dictionary\" xvii</ref>\n\nTwo other scripts used to write Cherokee are a simple Latin [[transliteration]] and a more precise system with [[Diacritic|diacritical marks]].<ref>Feeling et al., \"Verb\" pp. 1–2</ref>\n\n=== Description ===\nEach of the characters represents one syllable, as in the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''[[kana]]'' and the [[Bronze Age]] Greek [[Linear B]] writing systems.

Some characters represent two distinct phonetic values (actually heard as different syllables), while others often represent different forms of the same syllable.{{Sfn | Walker | Sarbaugh | 1993}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date = December 2012}}  Not all [[phoneme|phonemic]] distinctions of the spoken language are represented.  For example, while /d/ + vowel syllables are mostly differentiated from /t/+vowel by use of different graphs, syllables beginning with /g/ are all conflated with those beginning with /k/.  Also, long vowels are not ordinarily distinguished from short vowels, tones are not marked, and there is no regular rule for representing consonant clusters. However, in more recent technical literature, length of vowels can actually be indicated using a colon, and other disambiguation methods for consonants (somewhat like the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[dakuten]]) have been suggested. Six distinctive vowel qualities are represented in the Cherokee syllabary based on where they are pronounced in the mouth, including the high vowels ''i'' and ''u'', mid vowels ''e, v'', and ''o'', and low vowel ''a''. The syllabary also does not distinguish among syllables that end in vowels, ''h,'' or glottal stop.  For example, the single symbol, Ꮡ, is used to represent both  ''su'' as in ''su:dali'', meaning ''six'' (ᏑᏓᎵ), and ''suh'' as in ''suhdi,'' meaning 'fishhook' (ᏑᏗ). Therefore, there is no differentiation among the symbols used for syllables ending in a single vowel versus that vowel plus \"h.\" When consonants other than ''s, h,'' or glottal stop arise with other consonants in clusters, the appropriate consonant plus a \"dummy vowel\" is used. This dummy vowel is not pronounced and is either chosen arbitrarily or for etymological reasons (reflecting an underlying etymological vowel). For example, ᏧᎾᏍᏗ (tsu-na-s-di) represents the word ''ju:nsdi'', meaning 'small.' ''Ns'' in this case is the consonant cluster that requires the following dummy vowel, ''a''. ''Ns'' is written as ᎾᏍ /nas/. The vowel is included in the transliteration, but is not pronounced in the word (''ju:nsdi''). (The transliterated ''ts'' represents the affricate ''j'', as in other [[Iroquoian languages]] due to etymological reasons, cf. the [[Korean language|Korean]] letter [[ㅈ]]).{{Sfn | Scancarelli | 2005}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=December 2012}}  As with some other writing systems (like [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]), adult speakers can distinguish words by context.\n\n=== Transliteration issues ===\nSome Cherokee words pose a problem for transliteration software because they contain adjacent pairs of single letter symbols that (without special provisions) would be combined when doing the back conversion from Latin script to Cherokee. Here are a few examples:\n* ᎢᏣᎵᏍᎠᏁᏗ = ''itsalisanedi'' = ''i-tsa-li-s-a-ne-di''\n* ᎤᎵᎩᏳᏍᎠᏅᏁ = ''uligiyusanvne'' = ''u-li-gi-yu-s-a-nv-ne''\n* ᎤᏂᏰᏍᎢᏱ = ''uniyesiyi'' = ''u-ni-ye-s-i-yi''\n* ᎾᏍᎢᏯ = ''nasiya'' = ''na-s-i-ya''\nFor these examples, the back conversion is likely to join ''s-a'' as ''sa'' or ''s-i'' as ''si''. Transliterations sometimes insert an apostrophe to prevent this, producing ''itsalis'anedi'' (cf. [[Man'yoshu]]).\n\nOther Cherokee words contain character pairs that entail overlapping transliteration sequences. Examples:\n* ᏀᎾ transliterates as ''nahna'', yet so does ᎾᎿ. The former is ''nah-na'', the latter is ''na-hna''.\nIf the Latin script is parsed from left to right, longest match first, then without special provisions, the back conversion would be wrong for the latter. There are several similar examples involving these character combinations: ''naha nahe nahi naho nahu nahv''.\n\nA further problem encountered in transliterating Cherokee is that there are some pairs of different Cherokee words that transliterate to the same word in the Latin script. Here are some examples:\n* ᎠᏍᎡᏃ and ᎠᏎᏃ both transliterate to ''aseno''\n* ᎨᏍᎥᎢ and ᎨᏒᎢ both transliterate to ''gesvi''\nWithout special provision, a round trip conversion changes ᎠᏍᎡᏃ to ᎠᏎᏃ and changes ᎨᏍᎥᎢ to ᎨᏒᎢ.<ref group = \"lower-alpha\">This has been confirmed using the online transliteration service.</ref>\n\n===Unicode===\nCherokee was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in September, 1999 with the release of version 3.0.\n\n====Blocks====\n{{Main|Cherokee (Unicode block)|Cherokee Supplement}}\n\nThe main Unicode block for Cherokee is U+13A0–U+13FF.{{refn|group=note|The PDF Unicode chart shows the new-form of the letter ''do''.}} It contains the script’s upper-case syllables as well as six lower-case syllables.\n{{Unicode chart Cherokee}}\n\nThe rest of the lower-case syllables are encoded at U+AB70–ABBF.\n{{Unicode chart Cherokee Supplement}}\n\n====Fonts and digital platform support====\nA single Cherokee Unicode font, Plantagenet Cherokee, is supplied with [[macOS]], version 10.3 (Panther) and later.

Some good examples are {{lang|chr|ᏗᏘᏲᎯᎯ}} (''{{transl|chr|ditiyohihi}}'', \"he argues repeatedly and on purpose with a purpose\") corresponding to \"attorney\" and {{lang|chr|ᏗᏓᏂᏱᏍᎩ}} (''{{transl|chr|didaniyisgi}}'', \"the final catcher\" or \"he catches them finally and conclusively\") for \"policeman.\"<ref name=\"begin\">Holmes and Smith, p. vi</ref>\n\nOther words have been adopted from another language such as the English word ''gasoline'', which in Cherokee is {{lang|chr|ᎦᏐᎵᏁ}} (''{{transl|chr|gasoline}}''). Other words were adopted from the languages of tribes who settled in Oklahoma in the early 1900s.  One interesting and humorous example is the name of [[Nowata, Oklahoma]] deriving from ''nowata'', a Delaware word for \"welcome\" (more precisely the Delaware word is ''nuwita'' which can mean \"welcome\" or \"friend\" in the [[Delaware languages]]). The white settlers of the area used the name ''nowata'' for the township, and local Cherokee, being unaware that the word had its origins in the Delaware language, called the town {{lang|chr|ᎠᎹᏗᎧᏂᎬᎾᎬᎾ}} (''{{transl|chr|Amadikanigvnagvna}}'') which means \"the water is all gone gone from here\"&nbsp;– i.e. \"no water.\"<ref name=\"Holmes and Smith, p. vii\">Holmes and Smith, p. vii</ref>\n\nOther examples of adopted words are {{lang|chr|ᎧᏫ}} (''{{transl|chr|kawi}}'') for \"coffee\" and {{lang|chr|ᏩᏥ}} (''{{transl|chr|watsi}}'') for \"watch\"; which led to {{lang|chr|ᎤᏔᎾ ᏩᏥ}} (''utana watsi,'' \"big watch\") for ''clock''.<ref name=\"Holmes and Smith, p. vii\"/>\n\nMeaning expansion can be illustrated by the words for \"warm\" and \"cold\", which can be also extended to mean \"south\" and \"north\".  Around the time of the [[American Civil War]], they were further extended to US party labels, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], respectively.<ref name=\"Holmes and Smith, p. 43\">Holmes and Smith, p. 43</ref>\n\n==Samples==\nFrom the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:\n{|border=\"0\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:left; margin-bottom: 3em;\"\n|-\n!|Cherokee\n!|Translation\n!|Syllabary\n|-\n|''Nigada aniyvwi nigeguda'lvna ale''\n|All human beings are born free and\n|ᏂᎦᏓ ᎠᏂᏴᏫ ᏂᎨᎫᏓᎸᎾ ᎠᎴ\n|-\n| ''unihloyi unadehna duyukdv gesv'i.
