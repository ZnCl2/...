Basic Books, New York; 1972, p. 48.</ref> Notably, this concept of \"charity\" is different from the modern Western understanding of \"charity\", which is typically understood as a spontaneous act of goodwill and a marker of generosity, as ''tzedakah'' is rather an ethical obligation.  In [[Judaism]], ''tzedakah'' refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just, which Judaism emphasizes is an important part of living a spiritual life.  Thus, unlike voluntary [[philanthropy]], ''tzedakah'' is seen as a religious obligation that must be performed regardless of one's financial standing, and is considered mandatory even for those of limited financial means.  More broadly, ''tzedakah'' is considered to be one of the three main acts that can positively influence an unfavorable heavenly decree.\n\nThe word ''tzedakah'' is based on the Hebrew (צדק, ''Tzedek'') meaning ''[[righteousness]]'', ''[[Social justice|fairness]]'' or ''[[justice]]'', and is related to the Hebrew word ''[[Tzadik]]'', meaning ''righteous'' as an adjective (or ''righteous individual'' as a noun in the form of a [[Noun#Substantive as a word for noun|substantive]]).  Although the word appears 157 times in the [[Masoretic Text]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]], typically in relation to \"righteousness\" ''per se'', its use as a term for \"charity\" in the above sense is an adaptation of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] in [[Talmud]]ic times.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, [[Maimonides]] conceived of an eight-level hierarchy of ''tzedakah'', where the highest form is to give a gift, loan, or partnership that will result in the recipient becoming self-sufficient, instead of living upon others; in his view, the second highest form of ''tzedakah'' is to give donations anonymously to unknown recipients.\n\n==Precedents in ancient Israel==\n\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] teaches the obligation to aid those in need, but does not employ one single term for this obligation.<ref>Ronald L. Randle''The JPS guide to Jewish traditions'' Jewish Publication Society, 2004 p. 531 \"Tzedakah (hqdx) The Bible repeatedly stresses the obligation to aid those in need, but never designates a special term for this requirement. The Rabbis adopted the word \"tzedakah\" to apply to charity, primarily in the form ...\"</ref> The term ''tzedekah'' occurs 157 times in the [[Masoretic Text]], typically in relation to \"righteousness\" per se, usually in the singular, but sometimes in the plural ''tzedekot'', in relation to acts of charity.<ref>\"The word \"almsgiving\", however, is far from expressing the full meaning of the Hebrew ẓedaḳah, which is, charity in the spirit of uprightness or justice. According to the Mosaic conception, wealth is a loan from God, and the poor have a certain claim on the possessions of the rich; while the rich are positively enjoined to share God's bounties with the poor.\"{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kohler|first=Kaufmann|title=Alms|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1295-alms|work=1906 Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref> In the [[Septuagint]] this was sometimes translated ''eleemosyne'', \"almsgiving.\"<ref>As per [[Gesenius]] Lexicon; \"Deuterony 6:25 καὶ ἐλεημοσύνη ἔσται...\"</ref><ref>\"... derived from the Greek ἐλεημοσύνη (mercifulness), used by Greek-speaking Jews to denote almost exclusively the offering of charity to the needy, from a feeling of both compassion and righteousness (ẓedaḳah). (See [[LXX]]. (note: Septuagint) on Prov. xxi. 21, and Dan. iv. 24.)\"{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kohler|first=Kaufmann|title=Alms|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1295-alms|work=1906 Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==In rabbinical literature of the classical and Middle Ages==\n\nIn [[classical rabbinical literature]], it was argued that the Biblical regulations concerning left-overs only applied to corn fields, orchards, and vineyards, and not to vegetable gardens; the classical rabbinical writers were much stricter in regard to who could receive the remains. It was stated that the farmer was not permitted to benefit from the [[gleaning]]s, and was not permitted to discriminate among the poor, nor try to frighten them away with dogs or lions ([[Hullin]] 131a, [[Pe'ah]] 5:6)<ref>[[Maimonides]], ''Mishneh Torah'', 4:11</ref> the farmer was not even allowed to help one of the poor to gather the left-overs. However, it was also argued that the law was only applicable in [[Canaan]], (Jerusalem Talmud. [[Pe'ah]] 2:5) although many classical rabbinical writers who were based in [[Babylon]] observed the laws there ([[Hullin]] 134b)<ref>Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', 1:14</ref> it was also seen as only applying to Jewish paupers, but poor non-Jews were allowed to benefit for the sake of civil peace ([[Gittin]] 59b).\n\n[[Maimonides]] lists his Eight Levels of Giving, as written in the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', ''Hilkhot matanot aniyim'' (\"Laws about Giving to Poor People\"), Chapter 10:7–14:\n\n#Giving an interest-free loan to a person in need; forming a partnership with a person in need; giving a grant to a person in need; finding a job for a person in need, so long as that loan, grant, partnership, or job results in the person no longer living by relying upon others.\n#Giving tzedakah anonymously to an unknown recipient via a person (or public fund) which is trustworthy, wise, and can perform acts of tzedakah with your money in a most impeccable fashion.\n#Giving tzedakah anonymously to a known recipient.\n#Giving tzedakah publicly to an unknown recipient.\n#Giving tzedakah before being asked.\n#Giving adequately after being asked.\n#Giving willingly, but inadequately.\n#Giving \"in sadness\" (giving out of pity): It is thought that Maimonides was referring to giving because of the sad feelings one might have in seeing people in need (as opposed to giving because it is a religious obligation). Other translations say \"Giving unwillingly.\"\n\n==In practice{{anchor|Ma'aser kesafim}}==\n[[File:Jewish cemetery Otwock Karczew Anielin IMGP6721.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Tzedakah motif on a Jewish gravestone. Jewish cemetery in [[Otwock]] (Karczew-Anielin).]]\nIn practice, most Jews carry out ''tzedakah'' by donating a portion of their income to charitable institutions, or to needy people that they may encounter; the perception among many modern-day Jews is that if donation of this form is not possible, the obligation of ''tzedakah'' still requires that something be given. Traditional Jews commonly practice ''ma'sar kesafim,'' tithing 10% of their income to support those in need.\n\nSpecial acts of ''tzedakah'' are performed on significant days; at weddings, Jewish brides and bridegrooms would traditionally give to charity, to symbolise the sacred character of the marriage; at [[Passover]], a major holiday in Jewish tradition, it is traditional to be welcoming towards hungry strangers, and feed them at the table; at [[Purim]] it is considered obligatory for every Jew to [[Mishloach manot|give food to one other person, and gifts to at least two poor people]],<ref name=\"Esther 9:22\">{{cite web|url=http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3309.htm|title=Esther 9 / Hebrew - English Bible / Mechon-Mamre|work=mechon-mamre.org}}</ref> in an amount that would equate to a meal each, for the purpose of increasing the total happiness during [[Adar|the month]].\n\nAs for the more limited form of ''tzedakah'' expressed in the biblical laws, namely the leaving of ''[[gleaning]]s'' from certain crops, the [[Shulchan Aruch]] argues that during the exile Jewish farmers are not obliged to obey it.<ref>Shulchan Aruch, ''Yoreh De'ah'' 332:1</ref> Nevertheless, in modern [[Israel]], rabbis of Orthodox Judaism insist that Jews allow ''gleanings'' to be consumed by the poor and by strangers, and all crops (not just ''gleanings'') by anyone and everyone (free, not bought nor sold) during [[Shmita|sabbatical years]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Brackman|first=Rabbi Levi; Rivkah Lubitch|title=Shmita|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3445115,00.html |publisher=Ynetnews |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, one must be very careful about how one gives out tzedakah money. It is not sufficient to just give to anyone or any organization, rather, one must check the credentials and finances to be sure that your Tzedakah money will be used wisely, efficiently and effectively \"Do not steal from a poor person, for (s)he is poor,\" ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 22:22) and from [[Talmud]]ic-era commentaries including [[Numbers Rabba]] 5:2. It is taught that Tzedakah money was never yours to begin with; rather, it always belongs to God, who merely entrusts you with it so that you may use it properly. Hence it is your obligation to ensure that it is received by those deserving of it.\n\nThere are many examples of Tzedakah funds that operate according to Maimonides' principles above (particularly #2), including [[Hands on Tzedakah]] (working with nonprofits in the U.S. and in [[Israel]]), and Mitzvah Heroes Fund (working mainly with nonprofits in Israel). [[Paamonim]] is a nonprofit organization in Israel that operates according to Maimonides' first principle.\n\n[[Gaon of Vilna]] considered about giving Tzedaqah ''to all householders in our city with tax-benefit''.\n\n== Analogies in Islam ==\n\nThe term is similar with [[Sadaqah]] or [[Saddka]] (Arabic: صدقة ), an [[Islamic]] term meaning \"voluntary charity\";\nbut since Tzedakah means an obligatory due to pay for the poor, then its actual Arabic counterpart is \"[[Zakat]]\", not Sadqah. Only the financially capable Muslims have to do Zakat, it goes to seven or eight categories starting with the poor Muslims and heavily indebted ones, etc.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Tzedoko gelt.JPG|Tzedakah pouch and coins on fur-like padding\nFile:Kirkut Otwock 11.jpg|Tzedakah box on Jewish gravestone.
