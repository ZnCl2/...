The Nazis also killed millions of people belonging to other groups: Gypsies, the physically and mentally handicapped, Soviet prisoners of war, Polish and Soviet citizens, political prisoners, religious dissenters, and homosexuals. Can it be said that any of these groups were treated in the same way as the Jews and for the same reasons and hence deserve to be included in the history of the Holocaust? A positive answer to this question would require a broader definition of the Holocaust and acknowledging as many as 17,000,000 victims.

Following [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|rise to power]] in 1933, the government passed laws to exclude Jews from civil society, most prominently the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935. Starting in 1933, the Nazis built a network of [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in Germany for political opponents and people deemed \"undesirable\". After the [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, the regime set up [[Nazi ghettos|ghettos]] to segregate Jews. Over 42,000 camps, ghettos, and other detention sites were established.<ref name=42000facilities>[https://www.ushmm.org/research/publications/encyclopedia-camps-ghettos \"Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933–1945\"], United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</ref>\n\nThe deportation of Jews to the [[ghetto]]s culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the \"[[Final Solution|Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]\", discussed by senior Nazi officials at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in Berlin in January 1942. As German forces [[Operation Barbarossa|captured territories in the East]], all anti-Jewish measures were radicalized. Under the coordination of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], with directions from the highest leadership of the [[Nazi Party]], killings were committed within Germany itself, throughout [[German-occupied Europe]], and across all territories controlled by the [[Axis powers]]. Paramilitary [[death squads]] called ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' in cooperation with [[Security Division (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht police battalions]] and [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers|local collaborators]] murdered around 1.3 million Jews in mass shootings between 1941 and 1945.

The first refers to the persecution and murder of Jews by the Nazis and their collaborators between 1933 and 1945; this definition views the events of ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in Germany in 1938 as an early phase of the Holocaust. The second definition focuses on the systematic mass murder of Jews by the Nazis and their collaborators between 1941 and 1945; this acknowledges the shift in German policy in 1941 toward the extermination of the Jewish people. The third, and broadest, definition embraces the persecution and murder of several groups by the Nazis and their collaborators between 1933 and 1945; this includes all the Nazis' victims, but it fails, Gray writes, to acknowledge that only the Jewish people were singled out for annihilation.{{sfn|Gray|2015|p=8}} Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia, in ''The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust'' (2000), favour a definition that focuses on the Jews, [[Romani genocide|Roma]], and [[Aktion T4]] victims: \"The Holocaust—that is, Nazi genocide—was the systematic, state-sponsored murder of entire groups determined by heredity.

Many Germans did not accept that their country had been defeated, which gave birth to the [[stab-in-the-back myth]]. This insinuated that it was disloyal politicians, chiefly Jews and communists, who had orchestrated Germany's surrender. Inflaming the anti-Jewish sentiment was the apparent over-representation of Jews in the leadership of communist revolutionary governments in Europe, such as [[Ernst Toller]], head of a short-lived revolutionary government in Bavaria.
