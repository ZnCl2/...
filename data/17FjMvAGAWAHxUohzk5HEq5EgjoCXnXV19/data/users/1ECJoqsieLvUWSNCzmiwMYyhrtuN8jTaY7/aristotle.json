Along with [[Plato]], Aristotle is considered the \"Father of Western Philosophy\", which inherited almost its entire lexicon from his teachings, including problems and methods of inquiry, so influencing almost all forms of knowledge.\n\nLittle is known for certain about his life. His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined [[Plato's Academy]] in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ([[Circa|c.]] 347 BC).<ref name=IEP/> His writings cover many subjects – including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[biology]], [[zoology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], ethics, [[aesthetics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], theatre, music, [[rhetoric]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[economics]], [[politics]] and government&nbsp;– and constitute the first comprehensive system of [[Western philosophy]]. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip II of Macedon]], tutored [[Alexander the Great]] beginning in 343 BC.<ref name=\"philosophy1972\">Russell, Bertrand.

He established a library in the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books, which were [[papyrus]] [[scrolls]]. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of [[Platonism]], but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to [[empiricism]].{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=16}} He believed all concepts and knowledge were ultimately based on [[perception]]. Aristotle's views on [[natural science]]s represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.\n\nAristotle's views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]]. Some of Aristotle's [[zoology|zoological]] observations, such as on the [[Hectocotylus|hectocotyl (reproductive) arm]] of the [[octopus]], were disbelieved until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as [[Peter Abelard]] and [[John Buridan]]. [[Aristotelianism]] profoundly influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)|Islamic thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]], as well as [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as \"The First Teacher\". His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]].\n\nAll aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of academic study. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication.{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=9}} Aristotle has been depicted by major artists including [[Raphael]] and [[Rembrandt]]. [[Early Modern]] theories including [[William Harvey]]'s [[circulation of the blood]] and [[Galileo Galilei]]'s [[kinematics]] were developed in reaction to Aristotle's. In the 19th century, [[George Boole]] gave Aristotle's logic a mathematical foundation with his system of [[Boolean algebra|algebraic logic]]. In the 20th century, [[Martin Heidegger]] created a new interpretation of Aristotle's political philosophy, but elsewhere Aristotle was widely criticised, even ridiculed by thinkers such as the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] and the biologist [[Peter Medawar]].{{sfn|Leroi|2015|page=353}}<!--and see cited text below-->  More recently, Aristotle has again been taken seriously, such as in the thinking of [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], while [[Armand Marie Leroi]] has reconstructed [[Aristotle's biology]].

The term \"logic\" he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers.

Aristotle's [[ontology]] places the universal (''katholou'') in [[particular]]s (''kath' hekaston''), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate. This means that Aristotle's [[epistemology]] is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these.<ref name=SEParistotle-logic/> For Aristotle, \"form\" is still what [[phenomena]] are based on, but is \"instantiated\" in a particular substance.<ref name=SEPsubstuniv/> Aristotle uses [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from examples alongside [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], whereas Plato relies on deduction from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles.<ref name=SEParistotle-logic/>\n\nIn Aristotle's terminology, \"natural philosophy\" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as \"science\". Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term \"scientific method\". For Aristotle, \"all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.<ref name=\"SEP\"/>\n\n===Metaphysics===\n{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}\n\nAristotle coined the term \"metaphysics\". He also called it \"first philosophy\", and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative (''theoretikē'') philosophy which is \"theological\" and studies the divine. He wrote in his ''Metaphysics'' (1026a16):\n:if there were no other independent things besides the composite natural ones, the study of nature would be the primary kind of knowledge; but if there is some motionless independent thing, the knowledge of this precedes it and is first philosophy, and it is universal ''in just this way'', because it is first. And it belongs to this sort of philosophy to study being as being, both what it is and what belongs to it just by virtue of being.<ref>{{citation|author=Aristotle|title=Aristotle's ''Metaphysics''. A new translation by Joe Sachs|year=1999|page=111|publisher=Green Lion Press}}</ref>\n\n====Substance, potentiality and actuality====\n{{see|Hylomorphism|Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)}}\n\nAristotle examines the concepts of [[Substance theory|substance]] (''ousia'') and [[essence]] (''to ti ên einai'', \"the what it was to be\") in his ''Metaphysics'' (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called [[hylomorphism]]. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[Material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house, while the form of the substance is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1043a 10–30</ref><ref name=SEPactupote>{{cite SEP |url-id=aristotle-metaphysics/#ActuPote |title=Aristotle's Metaphysics |first=S. Marc |last=Cohen |date=2016}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to the change (''[[Potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' 319b–320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:\n\n# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;\n# locomotion, which is change in space; and\n# alteration, which is change in quality.\n\n[[File:Flute-player dolphin Alcesti Group MAN.jpg|thumb|Aristotle argued that a capability like playing the flute could be acquired – [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|the potential made actual]] – by learning.]]\n\nThe coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.<ref name=SEPactupote/>\n\n<blockquote>For that for the sake of which (''to hou heneka'') a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' IX 1050a 5–10</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, \"what is it that makes a man one\"? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same.<ref name=SEPactupote/><ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1045a–b</ref><ref name=SEPsubstdef>{{cite SEP |url-id=aristotle-metaphysics/#SubsDefi |title=Aristotle's Metaphysics: Substance and Definition |first=S.

For Aristotle, both matter and form belong to the individual thing ([[hylomorphism]]).]]\n{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}\n\nPlato argued that all things have a [[Theory of forms|universal form]], which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyse a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but \"good\" is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the world of forms, a place where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.<ref name=SEPsubstuniv>{{cite SEP |url-id=aristotle-metaphysics/#SubsUniv |title=Aristotle's Metaphysics: Substances and Universals |first=S.

It tells us what a thing is, that a thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation.

A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.<ref name=Lloyd1996fourcauses/>\n* The [[efficient cause]] is \"the primary source\", or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of \"cause\" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs.

Humans have a rational soul. The human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the ''[[Nous#Aristotle|nous]]'' (intellect) and ''logos'' (reason).{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=156–163}}\n\nFor Aristotle, the soul is the [[Hylomorphism#Body–soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).<ref>{{cite SEP|url-id=aristotle-psychology |title=Psychology |author=Shields, Christopher |date=2016}}</ref> In contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.<ref>{{cite book |author=Mason, Stephen F. |title=A History of the Sciences |publisher=Collier Books |date=1979 |isbn=9780020934004 |oclc=924760574 |page=45}}</ref> Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Guthrie, W. |title=A History of Greek Philosophy Vol. 1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2010 |page=348 |isbn=978-0521294201}}</ref>\n\n====Memory====\n\nAccording to Aristotle in ''On the Soul'', memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to distinguish between the internal \"appearance\" and an occurrence in the past.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloch |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QwTHng_5RqAC&pg=PR9&dq=Aristotle+on+Memory+and+Recollection#v=onepage&q=Aristotle%20on%20Memory%20and%20Recollection&f=false |title=Aristotle on Memory and Recollection |date=2007 |page=12 |isbn=978-90-04-16046-0 |ref=harv}}</ref> In other words, a memory is a mental picture ([[wikt:phantasm|phantasm]]) that can be recovered. Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian '[[common sense]]', and thinking.{{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=61}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Carruthers |first=Mary |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dntrAnqfIasC&pg=PR8&dq=The+book+of+memory:+the+study+of+memory+in+medieval+times#v=onepage&q=The%20book%20of%20memory%3A%20the%20study%20of%20memory%20in%20medieval%20times&f=false |title=The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture |date=2007 |page=16 |isbn=978-0-521-42973-3 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAristotle uses the term 'memory' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.{{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=25}}\n\nBecause Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To search for these impressions, people search the memory itself.<ref>{{cite book |last=Warren |first=Howard |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D4IXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA3&dq=The+history+of+the+association+of+psychology#v=onepage&q=The%20history%20of%20the%20association%20of%20psychology&f=false |title=A History of the Association Psychology |date=1921 |page=30 |oclc=21010604 <!--dlc--> |ref=harv}}</ref> Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. If the chain of \"images\" is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=25}} Recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression.{{sfn|Carruthers|2007|p=19}} Only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=296}}\n\n[[File:Aristotle Senses Perception Memory Dreams Action.svg|thumb|upright=2.3|Senses, perception, memory, dreams, action in Aristotle's psychology. Impressions are stored in the [[sensorium|seat of perception]], linked by his [[Laws of Association]] (similarity, contrast, and contiguity).]]\n\nAristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and contiguity, described in his [[Laws of Association]]. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=259}}\n\n====Dreams====\n{{see |Dream#Classical history}}\n\nAristotle describes sleep in ''On Sleep and Wakefulness''.<ref name=Dreaming>{{cite journal |last1=Holowchak |first1=Mark |title=Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out |journal=Ancient Philosophy |date=1996 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=405–23 |url=http://www.pdcnet.org/ancientphil/Ancient-Philosophy |doi=10.5840/ancientphil199616244}}</ref> Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses<ref name=Shute1941>{{cite book |last1=Shute |first1=Clarence |title=The Psychology of Aristotle: An Analysis of the Living Being |date=1941 |publisher=Columbia University Press |pages=115–18 |oclc=936606202 }}</ref> or of digestion,<ref name=Dreaming/> so it is vital to the body.<ref name=Shute1941/> While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire, which is the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep,<ref name=Shute1941/> albeit differently,<ref name=Dreaming/> unless they are weary.<ref name=Shute1941/>\n\nDreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner.<ref name=Shute1941/> Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then look away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression.<ref name=Dreaming/> When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored.<ref name=Shute1941/> However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences.<ref name=Dreaming/> So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience.<ref name=Modrak>{{cite journal |last1=Modrak |first1=Deborah |title=Dreams and Method in Aristotle |journal=Skepsis: A Journal for Philosophy and Interdisciplinary Research |date=2009 |volume=20 |pages=169–181}}</ref> During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person.<ref name=Dreaming/> This leads the person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in nature.<ref name=Dreaming/>\n\nOne component of Aristotle's theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences.<ref name=Webb>{{cite book |last1=Webb |first1=Wilse |title=Dreamtime and dreamwork: Decoding the language of the night |date=1990 |publisher=Jeremy P. Tarcher  |isbn= 978-0-87477-594-5 |pages=174–84}}</ref> Aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences.<ref name=\"Modrak\"/>\n\n==Practical philosophy==\n\nAristotle's practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics, politics, and rhetoric.<ref name=\"SEP\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" align=right style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|+ Virtues and their accompanying vices<ref name=IEP/>\n!

He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kraut |first1=Richard |title=Aristotle's Ethics |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/ |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=19 March 2018 |date=1 May 2001}}</ref>\n\nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the ''[[De Anima|psuchē]]'' (''soul'') in accordance with reason (''[[logos]]''). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity (the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency<ref name=IEP/>) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as \"happiness\" or sometimes \"well being\". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''ēthikē'' ''[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]''), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence.<ref>[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book I. See for example chapter 7 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1098a 1098a].</ref>\n\nAristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''[[phronesis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.<ref>[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book VI.</ref>\n\n===Politics===\n\n{{main|Politics (Aristotle)}}\n\nIn addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, \"for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part\".<ref>Politics 1253a19–24</ref> He also famously stated that \"man is by nature a political animal\" and also arguing that humanity's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality.<ref>{{cite book |author=Aristotle |others=Translated by Ernest Barker and revised with introduction and notes by R.

Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions as a political \"community\" or \"partnership\" (''koinōnia'')<!-- (1252a1) -->. The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability<!-- (1280b29–31) -->, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: \"The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together<!-- (1281a1–3) -->.\" This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of \"fear of violent death\" or its \"inconveniences.\"{{refn|For a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and ''Politics'' see Polanyi, Karl (1957) \"Aristotle Discovers the Economy\" in ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi'' ed.

For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity.

His response to criticisms of [[private property]], in [[Lionel Robbins]]'s view, anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists, as it related to the overall [[utility]] of social arrangements.<ref name=robbins2000/> Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from [[human nature]]. In ''Politics'', Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of [[money]].<ref name=robbins2000/> Money came into use because people became dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or [[silver]].<ref name=monroe1948>{{cite book |author=Aristotle |editor=Monroe, Arthur E. |title=Politics-Ethics, In Early Economic Thought: Selections from Economic Literature Prior to Adam Smith |date=1948 |publisher=Harvard University Press | pages=16–28}}</ref>\n\nAristotle's discussions on [[retail]] and [[interest]] was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a [[profit (economics)|profit]]. It thus uses goods as a means to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the money itself, and not from its use.<ref name=monroe1948/>\n\nAristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement. Money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them \"commensurable\".<ref name=monroe1948/> He goes to on state that money is also useful for future exchange, making it a sort of security. That is, \"if we do not want a thing now, we shall be able to get it when we do want it\".<ref name=monroe1948/>\n\n===Rhetoric and poetics===\n[[File:Bénigne Gagneraux, The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods'' (1784) by [[Bénigne Gagneraux]].

Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III</ref>\n\nWhile it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' originally comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' VI</ref> The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' XXVI</ref> Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Temple, Olivia; Temple, Robert (translators) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZB-rVxPvtPEC&pg=PR3&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=0_0 |title=The Complete Fables By Aesop |publisher=Penguin Classics |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-14-044649-4 |pages=Introduction, xi–xii}}</ref>\n\n===Views on women===\n{{main|Aristotle's views on women}}\n{{further|Aristotle's biology#Inheritance}}\n\nAristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element.

Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained \"Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?\"<ref>[[Plutarch]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/alexander*/3.html''Life of Alexander''], Part 1, 7:7.
