However the differences are minor compared with the commonalities.

[[Synagogue]]s may designate or employ a professional or lay ''[[hazzan]]'' (cantor) for the purpose of leading the congregation in prayer, especially on Shabbat or holidays.\n\n==Origin and history of Jewish prayer==\n\n===Biblical origin===\nAccording to the [[Talmud Bavli]] (tractate [[Taanit]] 2a), ''tefillah'' (\"prayer\") is a [[mitzvah|Biblical command]]: \"'You shall serve God with your whole heart.' ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|11:13|HE}}) What service is performed with the heart? This is tefillah.\" Prayer is therefore referred to as ''Avodah sheba-Lev'' (\"service that is in the heart\"). It is not time-dependent and is mandatory for both Jewish men and women.<ref name=\"AS-Prayer\"/> Mentioning ''tefillah'', the Talmud always refers to the ''[[Amidah]]'', that is also called ''[[Shemoneh Esreh]]''. The noted rabbi [[Maimonides]] (RaMBaM) likewise categorizes ''tefillah'' as a Biblical command of [[Written law]],<ref>[[Mishneh Torah]], Laws of Prayer 1:1.</ref> as the Babylon Talmud says. However, corresponding with the Jerusalem Talmud, the [[Maimonides|RaMBaM]] did hold that the number of ''tefillot'' (\"prayers\") and their times are not a Biblical command of Written law and that the forefathers did not institute such a [[Takkanah]], rather it was a rabbinical command ''[[De'oraita and derabanan|de-rabbanan]]'' (\"from our Rabbis\") based on a [[takkanah]] of the [[Anshei Knesset HaGedola]] (\"The Men of the Great Assembly\").<ref name=OU-Anshei/><ref name=\"Mishneh Torah, Laws of Prayer 1:4\"/>\n\n====Babylon Talmud====\nThe [[Oral Law#Oral law in Judaism|Oral law]], according to the [[Talmud Bavli]] (tractate Berachoth 26b) gives two reasons why there are three basic prayers:\n# According to Rabbi [[Jose b. Hanina]], each of the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarchs]] instituted one prayer: [[Abraham]] the morning, [[Isaac]] the afternoon and [[Jacob]] the evening prayers. This view is supported with Biblical quotes indicating that the Patriarchs prayed at the times mentioned. However, even according to this view, the exact times of when the services are held, and moreover the entire concept of a ''mussaf'' service, are still based on the sacrifices.\n# Each service was instituted parallel to a sacrificial act in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]: the morning ''Tamid'' [[korban|offering]], the afternoon ''Tamid'' offering, and the overnight burning of this last offering.\n\n====Jerusalem Talmud====\n[[File:Israel Meir Poupko, tefillin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Yisrael Meir Kagan|Rabbi Yisrael Meir HaCohen Kagan]]—the \"[[Chofetz Chaim]]\"—at prayer towards the end of his life.]]\nThe [[Oral Torah]], according to the [[Talmud yerushalmi]] (tractate Berachoth 4) states why there are three basic ''tefillot'' (\"prayers\") and who instituted them:\n* Rabbi Yehoshua said that the [[Anshei Knesset HaGedola]] (\"The Men of the Great Assembly\") learned and understood the beneficial concept of regular daily tefillot from the habit of the forefathers (''avoth'') Avraham, Isaac and Yaakov. Therefore, the Anshei Knesset HaGedola based their [[Takkanah]] that Jewish men were required to pray three times a day from hints to personal habits of the forefathers in the tanach.<ref name=BarHayim-Amidah>{{cite web|last1=Bar-Hayim|first1=Ha-Rav David|title=Parashath VaYera-Romanticism vs Realism : Bavli vs Yerushalmi|url=http://machonshilo.org/en/eng/home/34-featured/789-parashath-vayera-romanticism-vs-realism-bavli-vs-yerushalmi|website=machonshilo.org|publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=BarHaYim-YT>{{cite web|last1=Bar-Hayim|first1=Ha-Rav David|title=Parashath VaYera: Romanticism vs Realism : Bavli vs Yerushalmi|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPcvPmPtiYQ|website=youtube.com|publisher=Tora Nation Machon Shilo|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=BarHaYim-AvotPrayers>{{cite web|last1=Bar-Hayim|first1=Ha-Rav David|title=Parashath Chayei Sarah: Strolling in Nature, Meditating and Praying: Our Forefather Yitzchak|url=http://machonshilo.org/en/eng/home/34-featured/797-parashath-chayei-sarah-strolling-in-nature-meditating-and-praying-our-forefather-yitzchak|website=hmachonshilo.org|publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=GE-Brachoth4>{{cite book|last1=Gurevich|first1=Eliyahu|title=Tosefta berachot : translated into english with a commentary.|date=2010|publisher=Lulu Com|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0557389858|pages=115-|edition=Bertrams Print on Demand|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ronqNAPipaEC&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109&dq=Yerushalmi+Berachot+4&source=bl&ots=_2U7LNqPA6&sig=b6afQaXhPfdXgD4lTkSbc_6USIE&hl=de&sa=X&ei=4CfhVKLMDKX4yQPh5ICwDA&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=anshei&f=false|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nAdditional references in the [[Hebrew Bible]] have been interpreted to suggest that [[David|King David]] and the prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] prayed three times a day. In [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]], David states:\n{{quotation|Evening, morning, and noontime, I speak and moan, and [[God in Judaism|He]] hearkened to my voice.|{{bibleref|Psalm|55:18|JPR}}}}\nAs in the [[Book of Daniel]]:\n{{quotation|And Daniel, when he knew that a writ had been inscribed, came to his house, where there were open windows in his upper chamber, opposite Jerusalem, and three times a day he kneeled on his knees and prayed and offered thanks before his God just as he had done prior to this.|{{bibleref|Daniel|6:11|JPR}}}}\n\n[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] and [[Sefardic Judaism|Sefardic]] strands of Judaism regard ''[[halakha]]'' (the collective body of [[religious law]]s for Jews) as requiring Jewish men to say ''tefillot'' (\"prayers\") three times daily and four times daily on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and most [[Jewish holiday]]s, and five times on [[Yom Kippur]]. Some Jewish women from those movements regard the system of multiple daily prayer services as optional for them due to a need to be constantly taking care of small children, but—in accordance with halakha—still pray at least daily, without a specific time requirement.<ref>The daily ''tefillah'' (\"prayer\") is to fulfill the Biblical requirement based on Maimonides' view as above.</ref> Moreover, it is generally accepted by Orthodox, Modern Orthodox, and Sephardic religious authorities that women are exempt from the evening prayer.<ref>''Mishna Berurah, Laws of Evening Prayers''.</ref> [[Conservative Judaism]] regards the ''halakhic'' system of multiple daily services as mandatory. Since 2002, Jewish women from Conservative congregations have been regarded as having undertaken a communal obligation to pray the same prayers at the same times as men, with traditional communities and individual women permitted to opt out.<ref>[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf Rabbi David Fine, ''Women and the Minyan'', Rabbinical Assembly, 2002.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127133632/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf |date=27 November 2010 }}</ref> [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] congregations do not regard ''halakha'' as binding and hence regard appropriate prayer times as matters of personal spiritual decision rather than a matter of religious requirement.\n\n===Text and language===\nAccording to [[halakha]], all individual prayers and virtually all communal prayers may be said in any language that the person praying understands. For example, the ''[[Mishnah]]'' mentions that the ''[[Shema]]'' need not be said in Hebrew<ref>[[s:Mishnah/Seder Zeraim/Tractate Berakhot/Chapter 2/3|Berakhot 2:3]]</ref> A list of prayers that must be said in Hebrew is given in the Mishna,<ref>[[s:Mishnah/Seder Nashim/Tractate Sotah/Chapter 7/2|Sotah 7:2]]</ref> and among these only the [[Priestly Blessing]] is in use today, as the others are prayers that are to be said only in a [[Temple in Jerusalem]], by a [[Kohen|priest]], or by a reigning [[Jewish Messiah|King]].\n\nDespite this, the tradition of most [[Ashkenazi]] [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogues is to use Hebrew (usually [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]]) for all except a small number of prayers, including the [[Aramaic]] ''[[Kaddish]]'' (\"holy\"), and the notable [[God of Abraham|Gott Fun Avraham]], which was written in Yiddish. In other streams of Judaism there is considerable variability: [[Sephardic]] communities may use [[Ladino language|Ladino]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for many prayers; [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] synagogues tend to use the local language to a varying degree; and at some [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] synagogues almost the whole service may be in the local language.\n\nMaimonides (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Prayer 1:4) relates that until the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]], all Jews composed their own prayers. After the exile, however, the sages of the time (united in the [[Great Assembly]]) found the ability of the people insufficient to continue the practice, and they legendarily composed the main portions of the ''[[siddur]]'', such as the ''[[Amidah]]'', from which no fragments survived. The origins of modern Jewish prayer were established during the period of the [[Tannaim]], \"from their traditions, later committed to writing, we learn that the generation of rabbis active at the time of the destruction of the Second Temple (70 CE) gave Jewish prayer its structure and, in outline form at least, its contents.\"<ref name=\"Overview: History of Jewish Prayer\">{{cite web|title=Overview: History of Jewish Prayer|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ritual/Prayer/History.shtml?PRRI|accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref> This liturgy included the twice-daily recitation of the Shema, the [[Amidah]], or Shmoneh Esrei, including 18 blessings recited several times daily, and the [[Torah reading|public recitation of the Torah]] in installments.<ref name=\"Overview: History of Jewish Prayer\"/> The oldest prayer books date from the time of the [[Geonim]] of [[Babylonia]]; \"some were composed by respected rabbinic scholars at the request of far-flung communities seeking an authoritative text of the required prayers for daily use, Shabbat, and holidays.\"<ref name=\"Overview: History of Jewish Prayer\"/>\n\nThe language of the prayers, while clearly being from the Second Temple period, often employs Biblical idiom, and according to some authorities it should not contain rabbinic or Mishnaic idiom apart from in the sections of Mishnah that are featured (see Baer).\n\nOver the last two thousand years, the various branches of Judaism have resulted in small variations in the Rabbinic liturgy [[Minhag|customs]] among different Jewish communities, with each community having a slightly different [[Minhag#Nusach|Nusach]] (customary liturgy). The principal difference is between [[Ashkenazic]] and [[Sephardic]] customs, although there are other communities (e.g., [[Yemenite Jews]], [[Palestinian minhag|Eretz Yisrael]]), and rather recent liturgical inventions such as [[Hassidic]], [[Nusach Ari|Chabad]], [[Reform Judaism#Practice|Reform]] and other communities also have distinct customs, variations, and special prayers. The differences are quite minor compared with the commonalities. The idea that a Jew should not change his ''Nusach Tefillah'' and has to continue to pray in the way of his forefathers is an invented Halacha of the [[galut]] (''diaspora'',<ref name=liddell>{{LSJ|diaspora/|διασπορά|ref}}</ref> \"scattering, dispersion\").<ref name=\"MS-28October2014\">{{cite web|last1=Bar-Hayim|first1=David|title=Not Changing Nusach Tefillah - An Invented Halacha|url=http://machonshilo.org/en/eng/component/content/article/34-featured/787-not-changing-nusach-tefillah-an-invented-halacha|website=Machon Shilo|publisher=Machon Shilo|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref> According to [[halakha]], a Jew may change his ''nusach tefilla'' at any time, even on a daily basis.<ref name=\"MS-02November2010\">{{cite web|last1=Bar-Hayim|first1=David|title=What is the Proper Nusach Tefillah?|url=http://machonshilo.org/en/eng/list-audio-shiurim/42-nusachyisrael/432-tephillah-what-is-the-proper-nusah|website=Machon Shilo|publisher=Machon Shilo|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"RDBH-InterviewNT\">{{cite web|title=Not Changing Nusach Tefillah - An Invented Halacha- Interview with Rabbi David Bar-Hayim|url=http://mp3xyz.co/play/not-changing-nusach-tefillah-an-invented-halacha-interview-with-rabbi-david-barhayim/Wbg2ZnSbEic.html|website=supermp3song.net|publisher=mp3xyz.co|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The siddur===\n{{main article|Siddur}}\nThe earliest parts of Jewish prayer are the ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'' (\"Hear O Israel\") ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:4 ''et seq''), and the [[Priestly Blessing]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 6:24–26), which are in the [[Torah]]. A set of eighteen (currently nineteen) blessings called the ''Shemoneh Esreh'' or the ''[[Amidah]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \"standing [prayer]\"), is traditionally ascribed to the [[Great Assembly]] in the time of [[Ezra]], at the end of the Biblical period.\n\nThe name ''Shemoneh Esreh'', literally \"eighteen\", is an historical anachronism, since it now contains nineteen blessings. It was only near the end of the [[Second Temple]] period that the eighteen prayers of the weekday Amidah became standardized. Even at that time their precise wording and order was not yet fixed, and varied from locale to locale. It was not until several centuries later that the prayers began to be formally fixed. By the [[Middle Ages]] the texts of the prayers were nearly fixed, and in the form in which they are still used today.\n\nThe siddur was printed by [[Soncino family (printers)|Soncino]] in Italy as early as 1486, though a siddur was first mass-distributed only in 1865. The siddur began appearing in the [[vernacular]] as early as 1538. The first English [[translation]], by Gamaliel ben Pedahzur (a [[pseudonym]]), appeared in London in 1738; a different translation was released in the United States in 1837.<ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1176152818456 Power and Politics: Prayer books and resurrection | Jerusalem Post<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108185002/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1176152818456 |date=8 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\nReadings from the [[Torah]] (five books of Moses) and the [[Nevi'im]] (\"Prophets\") form part of the prayer services. To this framework various Jewish sages added, from time to time, various prayers, and, for festivals especially, numerous hymns.\n\nThe earliest existing codification of the prayerbook was drawn up by Rav [[Amram Gaon]] of Sura, Babylon, about 850 CE. Half a century later Rav [[Saadia Gaon]], also of Sura, composed a [[Siddur of Saadia Gaon|siddur]], in which the rubrical matter is in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. These were the basis of Simcha ben Samuel's [[Machzor Vitry]] (11th-century France), which was based on the ideas of his teacher, [[Rashi]]. Another formulation of the prayers was that appended by Maimonides to the laws of prayer in his [[Mishneh Torah]]: this forms the basis of the Yemenite liturgy, and has had some influence on other rites. From this point forward all Jewish prayerbooks had the same basic order and contents.\n\n==Denominational variations==\n[[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] services generally use the same basic format for services as in Orthodox Judaism with some doctrinal leniencies and some prayers in English. In practice there is wide variation among Conservative congregations. In traditionalist congregations the liturgy can be almost identical to that of [[Orthodox Judaism]], almost entirely in Hebrew (and Aramaic), with a few minor exceptions, including excision of a study session on Temple sacrifices, and modifications of prayers for the restoration of the [[Korban|sacrificial]] system. In more liberal Conservative synagogues there are greater changes to the service, with up to a third of the service in English; abbreviation or omission of many of the preparatory prayers; and replacement of some traditional prayers with more contemporary forms. There are some changes for doctrinal reasons, including [[egalitarian]] language, fewer references to restoring [[Korban|sacrifices]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], and an option to eliminate special roles for [[Kohen|Kohanim]] and [[Levite]]s.\n\nThe liturgies of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] are based on traditional elements, but contains language more reflective of liberal belief than the traditional liturgy. Doctrinal revisions generally include revising or omitting references to traditional doctrines such as bodily [[resurrection]], a personal [[Jewish Messiah]], and other elements of traditional [[Jewish eschatology]], Divine revelation of the [[Torah]] at [[Mount Sinai]], [[Jewish Angelarchy|angels]], conceptions of reward and punishment, and other personal miraculous and supernatural elements. Services are often from 40% to 90% in the vernacular.\n\n[[Reform Judaism]] has made greater alterations to the traditional service in accord with its more liberal [[theology]] including dropping references to traditional elements of [[Jewish eschatology]] such as a personal [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]], a bodily [[resurrection]] of the dead, and others. The Hebrew portion of the service is substantially abbreviated and modernized and modern prayers substituted for traditional ones. In addition, in keeping with their view that the laws of [[Shabbat]] (including a traditional prohibition on playing instruments) are inapplicable to modern circumstances, Reform services often play instrumental or recorded music with prayers on the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]. All Reform synagogues are [[Egalitarian]] with respect to gender roles.\n\n==Philosophy of prayer==\n[[File:Soldiertefillinkotel.JPG|thumb|right|An Israeli soldier lays [[tefillin]] at the Western Wall ([[Western Wall|Kotel]]) prior to prayer.]]\nIn [[Jewish philosophy]] and in [[Rabbinic literature]], it is noted that the Hebrew verb for prayer—''hitpallel'' התפלל—is in fact the [[reflexive verb|reflexive form]] of ''palal'' פלל, to judge. Thus, \"to pray\" conveys the notion of \"judging oneself\":<ref>This interpretation is [[Homily|homiletic]] rather than scholarly, as it is historically more likely that the root meaning of ''hitpallel'' is \"to seek judgement for oneself\", in other words to present a legal pleading.</ref> ultimately, the purpose of prayer—''[[tefilah]]'' תפלה—is to transform ourselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tilb.org/sermons/moskowitzhRH5767.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723193422/http://www.tilb.org/sermons/moskowitzhRH5767.html |archivedate=23 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/39928/jewish/The-Cosmology-of-the-Mitzvot.htm|title=The Cosmology of the Mitzvot|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThis [[etymology]] is consistent with the [[Divine simplicity#In Jewish thought|Jewish conception]] of [[divine simplicity]]. It is not God that changes through our prayer—Man does not influence God as a defendant influences a human judge who has emotions and is subject to change—rather it is man himself who is changed.<ref name=\"mesora.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mesora.org/prayer.html|title=Prayer|publisher=}}</ref> It is further consistent with [[Maimonides]]' [[Divine providence (Judaism)#Maimonides|view]] on [[Divine Providence]].

This approach was taken by [[Maimonides]] and the other medieval rationalists.\n\n===The educational approach===\nIn this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. This has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, [[Yehuda Halevy]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Joseph Dov Soloveitchik]]. This view is expressed by Rabbi [[Nosson Scherman]] in the overview to the [[Artscroll]] Siddur (p.&nbsp;XIII); note that Scherman goes on to also affirm the Kabbalistic view (see below).\n\n===Kabbalistic view===\n[[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) uses a series of kavanot, directions of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialogue with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalism ascribes a higher meaning to the purpose of prayer, which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.\n\nThis approach has been taken by the [[Chassidei Ashkenaz]] (German pietists of the Middle-Ages), the [[Zohar]], the [[Isaac Luria|Arizal's]] Kabbalist tradition, the [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|Ramchal]], most of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidism]], the [[Vilna Gaon]] and [[Jacob Emden]].\n\n==Methodology and terminology==\n\n===Terms for praying===\n''Daven'' is the originally exclusively Eastern Yiddish verb meaning \"pray\"; it is widely used by [[Ashkenazic]] [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]]. In [[Yinglish]], this has become the [[Anglicise]]d ''davening''.\n\nThe origin of the word is obscure, but is thought by some to have come from [[Arabic]] (from ''diwan'', a collection of poems or prayers), [[French language|French]] (from ''devoner'', 'to devote' or 'dedicate' or possibly from the French 'devant'- 'in front of' with the idea that the person praying is mindful of before whom they stand), [[Latin]] (from ''divin'', 'divine') or even [[English language|English]] (from ''dawn'').<ref name=\"OzTorah\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2007/10/where-does-daven-come-from-ask-the-rabbi/|title=OzTorah – Where does \"Daven\" come from – Ask the Rabbi|accessdate=2013-05-20|author=Rabbi Dr Raymond Apple}}</ref> Others believe that it derives from a [[Slavonic languages|Slavic]] word meaning \"to give\" ({{lang-ru|давать|davat'}}). Some claim that it originates from an Aramaic word, ''de'avuhon'' or ''d'avinun'', meaning 'of their/our forefathers', as the three prayers are said to have been invented by [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]. Another Aramaic derivation, proposed by Avigdor Chaikin, cites the Talmudic phrase, \"''ka davai lamizrach''\", 'gazing wistfully to the east' (Shab. 35a). Kevin A. Brook,<ref>''The Jews of Khazaria'', 2nd ed. Rowman & Littlefield 2006, p. 206</ref> cites Zeiden's suggestion<ref>Herbert Zeiden, \"Davenen: a Turkic Etymology\", Yiddish 10, nos. 2–3 (1996), pp. 96–97</ref> that the word ''daven'' comes from the Turkish root ''tabun-'' meaning 'to pray', and that in [[Kipchak Turkish]], the initial ''t'' morphs into ''d''.\n\nIn Western Yiddish, the term for ''pray'' is ''oren'', a word with clear roots in [[Romance languages]]—compare Spanish and Portuguese ''orar'' and Latin ''orare''.<ref name=\"Balashon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.balashon.com/2007/01/daven.html|title=Balashon – Hebrew Language Detective: daven|accessdate=2007-12-09|author=David Curwin}}</ref>\n\n===Minyan (quorum)===\n[[File:Givati at Western Wall.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the [[Israel Defense Forces]]' Givati Brigade pray the Evening Service ([[Ma'ariv]]) at the [[Western Wall]], October 2010.]]\n{{main article|Minyan}}\nIndividual prayer is considered acceptable, but prayer with a quorum of ten adults—a ''[[minyan]]''—is the most highly recommended form of prayer and is required for some prayers. An adult in this context means over the age of 12 or 13 ([[B'nai Mitzvah|''bat'' or ''bar mitzvah'']]). Judaism had originally counted only men in the ''minyan'' for formal prayer, on the basis that one does not count someone who is not obligated to participate. The rabbis had exempted women from almost all time-specific positive mitzvot (commandments), including those parts of the prayer that cannot be recited without a quorum, due to women in the past being bound up in an endless cycle of pregnancy, birthing and nursing from a very early age. Orthodox Judaism still follows this reasoning and excludes women from the minyan. Since 1973, [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] congregations have overwhelmingly become egalitarian and count women in the ''minyan''. A very small number of congregations that identify themselves as Conservative have resisted these changes and continue to exclude women from the minyan. Those Reform and Reconstructionist congregations that consider a ''minyan'' mandatory for communal prayer, count both men and women for a ''minyan''. All denominations of Judaism except for Orthodox Judaism ordain female rabbis and cantors.<ref>Jewish Women's Archive.

Retrieved 2015-05-07.</ref> In [[Orthodox Judaism]], according to some authorities, women can count in the ''minyan'' for certain specific prayers, such as the [[List of Jewish blessings|''Birchot HaGomel'']] blessing, which both men and women are obligated to say publicly.\n\n===Attire===\n* ''Head covering''. In most synagogues, it is considered a sign of respect for male attendees to wear a head covering, either a dress hat or a [[kippa]] (skull cap, plural ''kipot'' also known by the Yiddish term ''yarmulke''). It is common practice for both Jews and non-Jews who attend a synagogue to wear a head covering.<ref>[[International Council of Christians and Jews]], [http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?item=1152#scull%20cap Jewish-Christian Relations :: A glossary of terms used in the Christian-Jewish dialogue], \"Non-Jewish male visitors to the synagogue are offered skull caps at the entrance and are asked to wear them.\"</ref><ref>Rabbi Amy R. Scheinerman, [http://scheinerman.net/judaism/Synagogue/objects2.html#kippah What's What?], \"Non-Jews who are guests in a synagogue can cover their heads; it is a sign of respect and not at all inappropriate for people who are not Jewish.\"</ref> Some Conservative synagogues may also encourage (but rarely require) women to cover their heads. Many Reform and Progressive temples do not require people to cover their heads, although individual worshipers, both men and women, may choose to. Many Orthodox and some conservative men and women wear a head covering throughout their day, even when not attending religious services.\n* ''[[Tallit]]'' (prayer shawl) is traditionally worn during all morning services, during Aliyah to the Torah, as well as during all the services of [[Yom Kippur]]. During the daily afternoon and evening services, the ''hazzan'' alone wears a tallit. In Orthodox synagogues they are expected to be worn only by men who are halakhically Jewish and in Conservative synagogues they should be worn only by men and women who are halakhically Jewish. In most Orthodox [[Ashkenazi]] synagogues they are worn only by men who are or have been married.<ref>\n* [[Mordechai Becher]], ''Gateway to Judaism: The What, How, And Why of Jewish Life'', [[Mesorah Publications]], 2005, p. 328.\n* Joyce Eisenberg, Ellen Scolnic, ''Dictionary of Jewish Words'', [[Jewish Publication Society]], 2006, p. 166.</ref>\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|IDF soldier, [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon#Author|Asael lubotzky]] prays with tefillin.]]\n* ''[[Tefillin]]'' (phylacteries) are a set of small cubic leather boxes painted black, containing scrolls of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah. They are tied to the head and arm with leather straps dyed black, and worn by Jews only, during weekday morning prayers. In Orthodox synagogues they are expected to be worn only by men; in Conservative synagogues they are also worn by some women. The Karaite Jews, however, do not don tefillin.\n* ''[[Tzeniut]]'' (modesty) applies to men and women. When attending Orthodox synagogues, women will likely be expected to wear long sleeves (past the elbows), long skirts (past the knees), a high neckline (to the collar bone), and if married, to cover their hair with a wig, scarf, hat or a combination of the above. For men, short pants or sleeveless shirts are generally regarded as inappropriate. In some Conservative and Reform synagogues the dress code may be more lax, but still respectful.\n\n==Daily prayers==\n\n===Shacharit (morning prayers)===\n{{main article|Shacharit}}\nThe ''Shacharit'' (from ''shachar'', morning light) prayer is recited in the morning. ''Halacha'' limits parts of its recitation to the first three (Shema) or four (Amidah) hours of the day, where \"hours\" are 1/12 of daylight time, making these times dependent on the season.\n\nVarious prayers are said upon arising; the tallit katan (a garment with [[tzitzit]]) is donned at this time. The [[tallit]] (large prayer shawl) is donned before or during the actual prayer service, as are the [[tefillin]] (phylacteries); both are accompanied by blessings.\n\nThe service starts with the \"morning blessings\" (''birkot ha-shachar''), including blessings for the [[Torah]] (considered the most important ones). In Orthodox services this is followed by a series of readings from Biblical and rabbinic writings recalling the [[korban|offerings]] made in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The section concludes with the \"Rabbis' [[Kaddish]]\" (''kaddish de-rabbanan'').\n\nThe next section of morning prayers is called ''Pesukei D'Zimrah'' (\"verses of praise\"), containing several [[psalms]] (100 and 145–150), and prayers (such as ''yehi chevod'') made from a tapestry of Biblical verses, followed by the [[Exodus 15.1–15.18|Song at the Sea]] (Exodus, chapters {{bibleverse-nb||Ex|14|HE}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Ex|15|HE}}).\n\n''Barechu'', the formal public call to prayer, introduces a series of expanded blessings embracing the recitation of the ''[[Shema Yisrael|Shema]]''. This is followed by the core of the prayer service, the ''[[Amidah]]'' or ''Shemoneh Esreh'', a series of 19 blessings. The next part of the service, is ''[[Tachanun]]'', supplications, which is omitted on days with a festive character (and by Reform services usually entirely).\n\nOn Mondays and Thursdays a [[Torah reading]] service is inserted, and a longer version of Tachanun takes place.\n\nConcluding prayers (see [[Uva letzion]]) and [[Aleinu]] then follow, with the Kaddish of the mourners generally after Aleinu.\n\n===Mincha (afternoon prayers)===\n{{main article|Mincha}}\n''Mincha'' or ''Minha'' (derived from the flour offering that accompanied each sacrifice) may be recited from half an hour after ''halachic'' noontime. This earliest time is referred to as ''mincha gedola'' (the \"large mincha\"). There is, however, another time to daven mincha, which is then known as ''mincha ketana'' (2.5 ''halachic'' hours before nightfall<ref>On another view, before sunset</ref>). Ideally, one should complete the prayers before sunset, although many authorities permit reciting Mincha until nightfall. Mincha is allowed to be recited during any of the hours between mincha gedola and mincha ketana also.\n\n[[Sephardi]]m and [[Italian Jews]] start the Mincha prayers with [[Psalm 84]] and ''Korbanot'' ({{bibleverse||Numbers|28:1–8|HE}}), and usually continue with the ''Pittum hakketoret''. The opening section is concluded with {{bibleverse||Malachi|3:4|HE}}. Western Ashkenazim recite the ''Korbanot'' only.\n\n''Ashrei'', containing verses from [[Psalm]]s {{bibleverse-nb||Ps|84:5|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Ps|144:15|HE}} and the entire {{bibleverse||Psalm|145|HE}}, is recited, immediately followed by ''[[Chatzi Kaddish]]'' (half-Kaddish) and the ''Shemoneh Esreh'' (or [[Amidah]]). This is followed by ''[[Tachanun]]'', supplications, and then the full Kaddish. Sephardim insert Psalm {{bibleverse-nb||Ps|67|HE}} or {{bibleverse-nb||Ps|93|HE}}, followed by the Mourner's Kaddish. After this follows, in most modern rites, the ''[[Aleinu]]''. Ashkenazim then conclude with the Mourner's Kaddish. Service leaders often wear a tallit even on normal days, and must wear one during the [[Ta'anit|fast days]].\n\n[[Image:JaffaMaariv.jpg|thumb|[[Minyan]] Ma'ariv prayer in a Jaffa [[Tel Aviv]] flea-market shop]]\n\n===Ma'ariv/Arvit (evening prayers)===\n{{main article|Maariv}}\n\nIn many congregations, the afternoon and evening prayers are recited back-to-back on a working day, to save people having to attend synagogue twice.<ref>In strict law, one should only recite Mincha between sunset and nightfall if one recites Arvit after nightfall; conversely one should only recite Arvit between sunset and nightfall if one recites Mincha before sunset; in other words one should not take advantage of both flexibilities at once so as to combine the prayers. The prevailing practice, of doing exactly that, is regarded as an emergency measure. On yet another view, the disputed period is not that between sunset and nightfall but the last seasonally adjusted hour and a quarter before sunset.</ref> The [[Vilna Gaon]] discouraged this practice, and followers of his set of customs commonly wait until after nightfall to recite ''Ma'ariv'' (the name derives from the word \"nightfall\").<ref>One reason for this is that, while the prevailing practice may satisfy the law concerning the timing of Arvit in the sense of the evening Amidah, it means that the evening Shema is recited too early.</ref>\n\nThis service begins with the ''Barechu'', the formal public call to prayer, and ''Shema Yisrael'' embraced by two benedictions before and two after. [[Ashkenazi]]m outside of Israel (except [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] and followers of the [[Vilna Gaon]]) then add another blessing (''Baruch Adonai le-Olam''), which is made from a tapestry of biblical verses. (This prayer is also said by Baladi [[Yemenite Jews|Temanim]] in and out of Israel.) This is followed by the Half-Kaddish, and the ''Shemoneh Esreh'' (''Amidah''), bracketed with the full Kaddish. [[Sephardi]]m then say Psalm 121, say the Mourner's Kaddish, and repeat ''Barechu'' before concluding with the Aleinu. [[Ashkenazi]]m, in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], do neither say Psalm 121 nor repeat Barechu, but conclude with ''Aleinu'' followed by the Mourner's Kaddish (in Israel, Ashkenazim do repeat Barcheu after mourner's Kaddish).\n\n==Prayer on Shabbat (Sabbath)==\nOn the Sabbath, prayers are similar in structure to those on weekdays, although almost every part is lengthened. One exception in the ''[[Amidah]]'', the main prayer, which is ''abridged''. The first three and last three blessings are recited as usual, but the middle thirteen are replaced with a single blessing known as \"''sanctity of the day,''\" describing the Sabbath. Atypically, this middle blessing is different for each of the prayers.\n\n===Friday night===\n[[Shabbat]] services begin on Friday evening with the weekday Mincha (see above), followed in some communities by the [[Song of Songs]], and then in most communities by the ''Kabbalat Shabbat'', the mystical prelude to Shabbat services composed by 16th-century [[Kabbalists]]. This [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term literally means \"Receiving the Sabbath\". In many communities, the piyut ''[[Yedid Nefesh]]'' introduces the Kabbalat Shabbat prayers.\n\nKabbalat Shabbat is, except amongst many [[Italian Jews|Italian]] and [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]], composed of six psalms, {{bibleverse-nb||Ps|95|HE}} to {{bibleverse-nb||Ps|99|HE}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Ps|29|HE}}, representing the six week-days. Next comes the poem ''[[Lekha Dodi]]''. Composed by Rabbi [[Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz]] in the mid-16th century, it is based on the words of the [[Talmud]]ic sage Hanina: \"Come, let us go out to meet the Queen Sabbath\" (Talmud Shabbat 119a). Kabbalat Shabbat is concluded by {{bibleverse||Psalm|92|HE}} (the recital of which constitutes men's acceptance of the current Shabbat with all its obligations) and {{bibleverse||Psalm|93|HE}}. Many add a study section here, including ''Bameh Madlikin'' and ''Amar rabbi El'azar'' and the concluding ''Kaddish deRabbanan'' and is then followed by the Maariv service; other communities delay the study session until after Maariv. Still other customs add here a passage from the [[Zohar]]. In modern times the Kabbalat Shabbat has been set to music by many composers including: [[Robert Strassburg]].<ref>http://www.milkenarchive.org/artists/view/robert-strassburg/</ref>\n\nThe [[Shema Yisrael|Shema]] section of the Friday night service varies in some details from the weekday services—mainly in the different ending of the ''Hashkivenu'' prayer and the omission of ''Baruch Adonai le-Olam'' prayer in those traditions where this section is otherwise recited. In the [[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian rite]], there are also different versions of the ''Ma'ariv 'aravim'' prayer (beginning ''asher killah'' on Friday nights) and the ''Ahavat 'olam'' prayer.\n\nMost commemorate the Shabbat at this point with ''VeShameru'' ({{bibleverse||Exodus|31:16–17|HE}}). The custom to recite the biblical passage at this point has its origins in the Lurianic [[Kabbalah]], and does not appear before the 16th century. It is therefore absent in traditions and prayer books less influenced by the Kabbalah (such as the [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]] ''[[Baladi]]'' tradition), or those that opposed adding additional readings to the siddur based upon the Kabbalah (such as the [[Vilna Gaon]]).\n\nThe middle blessing of the ''[[Amidah]]'' (see above) discusses the conclusion of the Creation, quoting the relevant verses from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. This is then followed by the [[hazzan]]'s mini-repetition of the Amidah, ''Magen Avot'', a digest of the [[Seven-Faceted Blessing|seven benedictions]] (hence it's Hebrew name ''Achat Me'ein Sheva''). In some [[Ashkenazi]] [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogues the second chapter of [[Mishnah]] tractate Shabbat, ''Bameh Madlikin'', is read at this point, instead of earlier. [[Kiddush]] is recited in the synagogue in Ashkenazi and a few Sephardi communities. The service then follows with [[Aleinu]]. Most Sephardi and many Ashkenazi synagogues end with the singing of ''[[Yigdal]]'', a poetic adaptation of [[Maimonides]]' 13 principles of Jewish faith. Other Ashkenazi synagogues end with ''[[Adon Olam|Adon `olam]]'' instead.\n\n===Shacharit===\n{{main article|Shacharit}}\n[[Shabbat]] morning prayers commence as on week-days. Of the hymns, Psalm 100 (''Mizmor LeTodah'', the psalm for the Thanksgiving offering), is omitted because the ''todah'' or Thanksgiving [[korbanot|offering]] could not be offered on [[Shabbat]] in the days of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Its place is taken in the [[Ashkenazi]] tradition by Psalms {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|19|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|34|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|90|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|91|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|135|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|136|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|33|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|92|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|93|HE}}. [[Sephardi]]c Jews maintain a different order, add several psalms and two religious poems. The ''Nishmat'' prayer is recited at the end of the ''Pesukei D'Zimrah''. The blessings before ''Shema'' are expanded, and include the hymn ''El Adon'', which is often sung communally.\n\nThe intermediary benediction of the ''Shacharit [[Amidah]]'' begins with ''Yismach Moshe'' and discusses Moses' receiving of the Torah (which according to tradition took place on the morning of the Sabbath). [[Kedushah]], which is always recited during the [[Hazzan]]'s repetition of the third blessing, is significantly expanded. After the repetition is concluded, the Torah scroll is taken out of the Ark in a ritual much longer than the ritual during the week, and the [[Parsha|weekly portion]] is [[Torah reading|read]], followed by the ''[[haftarah]]''.\n\nAfter the [[Torah]] reading, three prayers for the community are recited. Two prayers starting with ''[[Yekum Purkan]]'', composed in Babylon in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], are similar to the subsequent ''Mi sheberakh'', a blessing for the leaders and patrons of the synagogue. The Sephardim omit much of the Yekum Purkan. Prayers are then recited (in some communities) for the government of the country, for peace, and for the State of [[Israel]].\n\nAfter these prayers, Ashrei is repeated and the Torah scroll is returned to the Ark in a procession through the Synagogue. Many congregations allow children to come to the front in order to kiss the scroll as it passes. In many Orthodox communities, the Rabbi (or a learned member of the congregation) delivers a sermon at this point, usually on the topic of the Torah reading.\n\n===Mussaf===<!-- This section is linked from [[Abba Arika]] -->\n{{main article|Mussaf}}\nThe ''Musaf'' service starts with the silent recitation of the ''[[Amidah]]''. The middle blessing includes the ''Tikanta Shabbat'' reading on the holiness of [[Shabbat]], and then by a reading from the biblical [[Book of Numbers]] about the sacrifices that used to be performed in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Next comes ''Yismechu'', \"They shall rejoice in Your sovereignty\", and ''Eloheynu'', \"Our God and God of our Ancestors, may you be pleased with our rest\" (which is recited during all ''[[Amidah]]''s of the Sabbath. [[Kedushah]] is greatly expanded.\n\nAfter the ''Amidah'' comes the full [[Kaddish]], followed by ''Ein keloheinu''. In [[Orthodox Judaism]] this is followed by a reading from the [[Talmud]] on the incense offering called Pittum Haketoreth and daily psalms that used to be recited in the Temple in Jerusalem. These readings are usually omitted by [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews, and are always omitted by [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] Jews.\n\nThe ''Musaf'' service culminates with the Rabbi's Kaddish, the ''[[Aleinu]]'', and then the Mourner's Kaddish. Some [[synagogue]]s conclude with the reading of ''An'im Zemirot'', \"The Hymn of Glory\", Mourner's Kaddish, the Psalm of the Day and either Adon Olam or Yigdal.\n\n===Mincha===\nMincha commences with ''Ashrei'' (see above) and the prayer [[Uva letzion]], after which the first section of the next [[Parsha|weekly portion]] is [[Torah reading|read from the Torah scroll]]. The ''Amidah'' follows the same pattern as the other Shabbat ''Amidah'' prayers, with the middle blessing starting ''Attah Echad''.\n\n===Ma'ariv===\nThe week-day Ma'ariv is recited on the evening immediately following Shabbat, concluding with ''Vihi No'am'', ''Ve-Yitten lekha'', and ''[[Havdalah]]''.\n\n==Special observances and circumstances==\n\n===Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur===\n{{Teshuva}}\nThe services for the [[High Holidays|Days of Awe]]—Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur—take on a solemn tone as befits these days. Traditional solemn tunes are used in the prayers.\n\nThe musaf service on Rosh Hashana has nine blessings; the three middle blessings include biblical verses attesting to sovereignty, remembrance and the [[shofar]], which is sounded 100 times during the service.\n\nYom Kippur is the only day in the year when there are five prayer services. The evening service, containing the Ma'ariv prayer, is widely known as \"[[Kol Nidrei]]\", the opening declaration made preceding the prayer. During the daytime, shacharit, musaf (which is recited on Shabbat and all festivals) and mincha are followed, as the sun begins to set, by [[Ne'ila]], which is recited just this once a year.\n\n===Pesach, Shavuot and Sukkot===\nThe services for the three festivals of [[Pesach]] (\"Passover\"), [[Shavuot]] (\"Feast of Weeks\" or \"Pentecost\"), and [[Sukkot]] (\"Feast of Tabernacles\") are alike, except for interpolated references and readings for each individual festival. The preliminaries and conclusions of the prayers are the same as on Shabbat. The Amidah on these festivals only contains seven benedictions, with ''Attah Bechartanu'' as the main one. [[Hallel]] (communal recitation of Psalms {{bibleverse-nb||Ps|113|HE}}-{{bibleverse-nb||Ps|118|HE}}) follows.\n\nThe Musaf service includes Umi-Penei Hata'enu, with reference to the special festival and [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] sacrifices on the occasion. A [[Priestly Blessing|blessing on the pulpit]] (\"dukhen\") is pronounced by the \"[[Kohen|kohanim]]\" (Jewish priests) during the Amidah. While this occurs daily in Israel and most Sephardic congregations, it occurs only on [[Pesach]], [[Shavuot]], [[Sukkot]], [[Rosh Hashanah]], and [[Yom Kippur]] in Ashkenazic congregations of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]]. (Those Ashkenazic congregations substitute a prayer recited by the [[hazzan]] after the Modim (\"Thanksgiving\") prayer) on week-days and Sabbath in commemoration of the priestly blessing.) (American Reform Jews omit the Musaf service.)\n\n===Missed prayer===\nIn the event one of the prayers was missed inadvertently, the Amidah prayer is said twice in the next service—a procedure known as ''tefillat tashlumin''.<ref>Brachot 26a</ref>\n\n==Related customs==\nMany Jews sway their body back and forth during prayer. This practice (referred to as ''[[Shuckling|shoklen]]'' in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]) is not mandatory, and in fact the [[kabbalah|kabbalist]] [[Isaac Luria]] felt that it should not be done. In contrast, the German Medieval authority ''[[Yaakov ben Moshe Levi Moelin|Maharil]]'' (Rabbi Jacob Molin) linked the practice to a statement in the [[Talmud]] that the Mishnaic sage [[Rabbi Akiva]] would sway so forcefully that he ended up at the other side of the room when praying (Talmud tractate Berachot).\n\nMany are accustomed to giving charity before, during (especially during [[Vayivarech David]]) or after prayer, in the hopes that this will make their prayer more likely to be heard.\n\n==Role of women==\nMen are obligated to perform public prayer three times a day with additional services on [[Jewish holidays]]. According to Jewish law, each prayer must be performed [[Zmanim|within specific time ranges (zmanim)]], based on the time that the communal [[Korban|sacrifice]] the prayer is named after would have been performed in the days of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].\n\nAccording to the [[Talmud]] women are generally exempted from obligations that have to be performed at a certain time. Orthodox authorities have generally interpreted this exemption due to women's higher spiritual level and therefore a lack of need to connect to God at specific times, since they are always connected to God. In accordance with the general exemption from time-bound obligations, most Orthodox authorities have exempted women from performing evening prayers ([[Maariv]]), but most believe that women are obligated to pray [[Shacharit]] and [[Mincha]], the morning and afternoon prayers, respectively, when possible. The morning and evening [[Shema Yisrael|Shema]] is required of all.\n\n[[Image:JerusalemWailingWall.jpg|thumb|left|Jewish women praying by the Western Wall, early 1900s]]\n[[Image:Women praying in the Western Wall tunnels by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Women praying in the [[Western Wall tunnel]] at the closest physical point to the [[Holy of Holies]]]]\n\nOrthodox authorities have been careful to note that although some women with small children have been exempted from praying at specific fixed times, they are not exempted from the obligation of prayer itself. The 19th-century [[posek]] [[Yechiel Michel Epstein]], author of the ''[[Arukh HaShulkhan]]'', notes: \"Even though the rabbis set prayer at fixed times in fixed language, it was not their intention to issue a leniency and exempt women from this ritual act\". Traditionally women were also reciting individual [[tkhine]] prayers in Yiddish.\n\nAuthorities have disagreed on the minimum amount that women's prayer should contain. Many Jewish women have relied on an idea expressed by(Ashkenazi) Rabbi [[Avraham Gombiner]] in his ''[[Magen Avraham]]'' commentary on the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'',<ref>[[Shulkhan Arukh]] section ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 106:2</ref> and more recently the ([[Sephardi]]) Rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]] (''Yabiah Omer'' vol. 6, 17), that women are only required to pray once a day, in any form they choose, so long as the prayer contains praise of (brakhot), requests to (bakashot), and thanks of (hodot) God.<ref>[http://www.nishmat.net/article.php?id=2&heading=0 Women's Issues:Women And Prayer When Time is Short] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012185958/http://www.nishmat.net/article.php?id=2&heading=0 |date=12 October 2008 }}, ''[[Nishmat]]''</ref> However, most Orthodox authorities agree that women are not completely exempt from time-bound prayer. The ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'' by Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]], an important code of [[Ashkenazi Judaism|Ashkenzic]] Jewish law, holds that the Men of the [[Great Assembly]] obligated women to say ''Shacharit'' (morning) and ''Minchah'' (afternoon) prayer services each day, \"just like men\". The ''Mishnah Berurah'' also states that although women are exempt from reciting the [[Shema Yisrael]], they should nevertheless say it anyway. Nonetheless, even the most liberal Orthodox authorities hold that women cannot count in a minyan for purposes of public prayer.\n\nThroughout [[Orthodox Judaism]], including its most liberal forms, men and women are required to sit in separate sections with a [[mechitza]] (partition) separating them. Historically, a learned woman in the ''weibershul'' (women's section or annex) of a synagogue took on the informal role of precentress or [[firzogerin]] for the women praying in parallel to the main service led in the men's section. Conservative/Masorti Judaism permits mixed seating (almost universally in the United States, but not in all countries). All Reform and Reconstructionist congregations have mixed seating.\n\n[[Haredi]] and much of [[Modern Orthodox]] Judaism has a blanket prohibition on women leading public congregational prayers. Conservative Judaism has developed a blanket justification for women leading all or virtually all such prayers, holding that although only obligated individuals can lead prayers and women were not traditionally obligated, Conservative Jewish women in modern times have as a collective whole voluntarily undertaken such an obligation.<ref>[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127133632/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf|date=27 November 2010}}</ref> Reform and Reconstructionist congregations permit women to perform all prayer roles because they do not regard [[halakha]] as binding.\n\nA small liberal wing within Modern Orthodox Judaism, particularly rabbis friendly to the [[Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance]] (JOFA), has begun re-examining the role of women in prayers based on an individual, case-by-case look at the historical role of specific prayers and services, doing so within classical ''halakhic'' interpretation. Accepting that where obligation exists only the obligated can lead, this small group has typically made three general arguments for expanded women's roles:\n{{clearleft}}\n# Because women were required to perform certain [[korbanot]] (sacrifices) in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], women today are required to perform, and hence can lead (and can count in the ''minyan'' for if required), the specific prayers substituting for these specific sacrifices. ''Birchat Hagomel'' falls in this category.\n# Because certain parts of the service were added after the [[Talmud]] defined mandatory services, such prayers are equally voluntary on everyone and hence can be led by women (and no ''minyan'' is required). ''Pseukei D'Zimrah'' in the morning and ''Kabbalat Shabbat'' on Friday nights fall in this category.\n# In cases where the Talmud indicates that women are generally qualified to lead certain services but do not do so because of the \"dignity of the congregation\", modern congregations are permitted to waive such dignity if they wish. Torah reading on Shabbat falls in this category. An argument that women are permitted to lead the services removing and replacing the Torah in the Ark on ''Shabbat'' extends from their ability to participate in Torah reading then.\n\nA very small number of Modern Orthodox congregations accept some such arguments, but very few Orthodox congregations or authorities accept all or even most of them. Many of those who do not accept this reasoning point to ''kol isha'', the tradition that prohibits a man from hearing a woman other than his wife or close blood relative sing. JOFA refers to congregations generally accepting such arguments as [[Partnership Minyan]]im. On Shabbat in a Partnership Minyan, women can typically lead ''Kabbalat Shabbat'', the ''P'seukei D'Zimrah'', the services for removing the Torah from and replacing it to the Ark, and Torah reading, as well as give a ''D'Var Torah'' or sermon.\n\nThe first Orthodox Jewish women's prayer group was created on the holiday of [[Simhat Torah]] at [[Lincoln Square Synagogue]] in Manhattan in the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/womens-tefillah-movement|title=Women's Tefillah Movement – Jewish Women's Archive|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Ephraim Mirvis]], an Orthodox rabbi who serves as the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, supports [[Shabbat]] prayer groups for Orthodox women, saying, \"Some of our congregations have women prayer groups for Friday night, some Saturday mornings. This is without women reading from the Torah. But for women to come together as a group to pray, this is a good thing.\"<ref>http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/122918/interview-rabbi-ephraim-mirvis</ref>\n\n==Role of minors==\nIn most divisions of [[Judaism]] boys prior to [[Bar Mitzvah]] cannot act as a [[Hazzan|Chazzen]] for prayer services that contain ''devarim sheb'kidusha'', i.e. [[Kaddish]], Barechu, the amida, etc., or receive an aliya or chant the [[Torah]] for the congregation. Since [[#Friday night services|Kabbalat Shabbat]] is just [[psalms]] and does not contain ''devarim sheb'kidusha'', it is possible for a boy under Bar Mitzvah to lead until Barechu of Ma'ariv. As well, the conclusion of the service on Shabbat and Chagim mat be led by children. Under the Moroccan, Yemenite, and Mizrachi customs, a boy under bar mitzvah may lead certain prayers, read the Torah, and have an aliyah.<ref>Epstein, Morris. ''All About Jewish Holidays and Customs''. Ktav Publishing House, 1959. p. 89</ref> It is customary among many Ashkenazim to have children sing \"Adon 'Olam\" after Mussaf and \"Yigdal\" after Shabat and Holiday Maariv. Among Sefardim, Mizrachim, Yemenites, and some Askenazim, a child leads the congregation in [[Kiryat Shema|Kriyat Shema]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings]]\n* [[Siddur]]\n* [[Shiva (Judaism)|Shiva]]\n* [[Shuckling]]\n* [[Carlebach minyan]]\n* [[Baladi-rite Prayer]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* ''To Pray As a Jew'', [[Hayim Halevy Donin]], Basic Books ({{ISBN|0-465-08633-0}})\n* ''Entering Jewish Prayer'', [[Reuven Hammer]] ({{ISBN|0-8052-1022-9}})\n* ''Kavvana: Directing the Heart in Jewish Prayer'', Seth Kadish, Jason Aronson Inc. 1997. {{ISBN|0-7657-5952-7}}.\n* ''Or Hadash: A Commentary on [[Siddur Sim Shalom]] for Shabbat and Festivals'', Reuven Hammer, The [[Rabbinical Assembly]] and the [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]]\n* [[Seligman Baer|S.
