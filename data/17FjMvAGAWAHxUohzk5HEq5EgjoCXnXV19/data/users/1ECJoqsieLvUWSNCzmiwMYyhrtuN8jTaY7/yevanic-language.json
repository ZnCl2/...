In: Encyclopedia Judaica. 1971:426</ref> The Romaniotes are a group of [[History of the Jews in Greece|Greek Jews]] whose presence in [[the Levant]] is documented since the [[Byzantine period]]. Its [[linguistics|linguistic]] lineage stems from the [[Jewish Koine Greek|Jewish Koine]] spoken primarily by [[Hellenistic Jews]] throughout the region, and includes [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] elements. It was mutually intelligible with the Greek dialects of the Christian population. The Romaniotes used the [[Hebrew alphabet]] to write Greek and Yevanic texts. Judaeo-Greek has had in its history different spoken variants depending on different eras, geographical and sociocultural backgrounds. The oldest [[Modern Greek]] text, has been found in the [[Cairo Geniza]] and is actually a Jewish translation of the book [[Ecclesiastes]] (Kohelet).<ref>Ernst Bremer, Susanne Röhl. Language of Religion, Language of the People: Medieval Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, pp. 30-35, Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 2006</ref>  \n\n==Origin of name==\nThe term ''Yevanic'' is an artificial creation  from the [[Biblical]] word ''Yāwān'' referring to the [[Greeks]] and the lands that the Greeks inhabited. The term is an overextension of the Greek word Ἰωνία ([[Ionia]] in English) from the (then) easternmost Greeks to all Greeks. The word for Greece in [[modern Israeli Hebrew]] is ''Yavan''; likewise, the word ''yevanit'' is used to refer to the modern Greek language in Hebrew.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\nA small number of [[Romaniote Jews]] in the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] have small knowledge of the Judaeo-Greek language.\nThe language is highly endangered and could completely die out. There are no preservation programs to promote or to revive the language.<ref>Vlachou, Evangelia, Papadopoulou, Chrysoula, Kotzoglou, Georgios.

After the arrival of Jewish refugees into these areas from the Iberian Peninsula, Northern Italy and Western Europe the greek-speaking Jewish communities began to almost disappear while integrating into the group of the newcomers which did not constituted in every area of their new homeland the majority.<ref>Bowman, Steven (1985). \"Language and Literature\".

A lot locales picked up on Judeo-Spanish language and customs, however some communities in Epirus, Thessaly, the Ionian Islands, Crete, Constantinople and Asia Minor kept the old, so-called \"Romaniote minhag\" and the Judaeo-Greek language. By the early 20th century, the Jews living in places such as [[Ioannina]], [[Arta (regional unit)|Arta]], [[Preveza]], and [[Chalkida]] still spoke a form of Greek that slightly differentiated the Greek of their Christian neighbors. These differences, semantically, do not go beyond phonetic, intonational, and lexical phenomena. It is different from other Jewish languages, in that there is no knowledge of any language fragmentation ever taking place.<ref>http://www.jewish-languages.org/judeo-greek.html</ref>\n\n==Current status==\n\nThe [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the Romaniote communities by the [[Ladino language|Ladino]]-speaking [[Sephardi]] Jews, the [[emigration]] of many of the Romaniotes to the United States and Israel, the murder of many of the Romaniotes during the [[Holocaust]] have been the main reasons of the decline of Judao-Greek. The survivors were too scant to continue an environment in which this language was dominant and more recent generations of the survivors have moved to new locations such as Greece, Israel, and The United States and now speak the respective languages of those countries; [[Standard Modern Greek]], [[Hebrew]], and [[English language|English]]  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projetaladin.org/holocaust/en/a-muslims-guide-to-judaism/jewish-culture/jewish-languages.html|title=Holocaust - Jewish languages|author=|date=|website=www.projetaladin.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref><ref>Bonfil, Robert (2011).

They were unaffected by [[Atticism]] and employed the current colloquial vernacular which they then transcribed in Hebrew letters. The Romaniots were Jews settled in the Eastern Roman Empire long before its division from its Western counterpart, and they were linguistically assimilated long before leaving the Levant after [[Hadrian]]'s decree against them and their religion. As a consequence, they spoke Greek, the language of the overwhelming majority of the populace in the beginning of the Byzantine era and that of the Greek élite thereafter, until the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Some communities in Northern Greece and Crete maintained their specific Romaniote practices since these communities were either geographically apart from the Sephardim or had different synagogues, and because their liturgies differed greatly.<ref>Zunz, Leopold \"Ritus. 1859. Eine Beschreibung synagogaler Riten\".</ref><ref> Luzzato, S. D. Introduction to the Mahzor Bene Roma, p. 34. 1966</ref> At the end of the 19th century, the Romaniote community of Greece made an effort to preserve the Romaniote liturgical heritage of Ioannina and Arta, by printing various liturgical texts in the Hebrew printing presses of Salonika.<ref name=\"Greece p. 40\">The Jewish Museum of Greece, The Jewish Community of Ioannina: The Memory of Artefacts, p. 40 (Booklet). 2017</ref>\n\n==Literature==\nThere is a small amount of literature in Yevanic dating from the early part of the modern period, the most extensive document being a translation of the [[Pentateuch]]. A polyglot edition of the [[Bible]] published in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] in 1547 has the Hebrew text in the middle of the page, with a Ladino ([[Judaeo-Spanish]]) translation on one side and a Yevanic translation on the other.<ref>Natalio Fernandez Marcos, ''The Septuagint in Context: Introduction to the Greek Versions of the Bible'' (2000) p 180. The Greek text is published in D. C. Hesseling, ''Les cinq livres de la Loi'' (1897).</ref>\nIn its context, this exceptional cultivation of the vernacular has its analogue in the choice of Hellenistic Greek by the translators of the [[Septuagint]] and in the [[New Testament]].<ref>Lockwood, W.
