This is more than the population of Ireland at its historical peak in the 1840s of 8.5 million. The poorest of them went to Great Britain, especially [[Liverpool]]; those who could afford it went further, including almost 5 million to the United States.<ref>[[J. Matthew Gallman]], ''Receiving Erin's Children: Philadelphia, Liverpool, and the Irish Famine Migration, 1845–1855'' (2000)</ref>\n\nAfter 1840, emigration from Ireland became a massive, relentless, and efficiently managed national enterprise.<ref>David Fitzpatrick, \"Emigration, 1801–70\", in ''A New History of Ireland, vol.

This had social and cultural consequences for the cultivation of the language abroad, including innovations in journalism. The language continues to be cultivated abroad by a small minority as a literary and social medium.<ref>The cultural and linguistic contexts are discussed in: Ó hAnnracháin, Stiofán (ed.), 1979.

Family and friends of emigrants would accompany them as far as the bridge before saying goodbye, while the emigrants would continue on to [[Derry Port]].]]\nThe term Irish diaspora is open to many interpretations. The [[diaspora]], broadly interpreted, contains all those known to have Irish ancestors, i.e., over 100 million people, which is more than fifteen times the population of the island of [[Ireland]], which was about 6.4 million in 2011. It has been argued the idea of an Irish diaspora, as distinct from the old identification of Irishness with Ireland itself, was influenced by the perceived advent of global mobility and modernity. Irishness could now be identified with dispersed individuals and groups of Irish descent. But many of those individuals were the product of complex ethnic intermarriage in America and elsewhere, complicating the idea of a single line of descent. \"Irishness\" might then rely primarily on individual identification with an Irish diaspora.<ref>Nash, Catherine (2008), ''Of Irish Descent: Origin Stories, Genealogy, and the Politics of Belonging'', Syracuse University Press, pp. 33–50. {{ISBN|9780815631590}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Government of Ireland]] defines the Irish diaspora as all persons of [[Irish nationality]] who habitually reside outside of the island of Ireland. This includes Irish citizens who have emigrated abroad and their children, who are Irish citizens by descent under [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Irish law]]. It also includes their grandchildren in cases where they were registered as Irish citizens in the [[Foreign Births Register]] held in every [[Irish diplomatic missions|Irish diplomatic mission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/moving-country/irish-citizenship/irish_citizenship_through_birth_or_descent|title=Irish Citizens Information Board|website=Citizensinformation.ie|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref> Under this legal definition, the Irish diaspora is considerably smaller—some 3 million persons, of whom 1.2 million are Irish-born emigrants. This is still a large ratio for any country.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n[[File:Road from Falcarragh SE to R251 - Stone monument - geograph.org.uk - 1185262.jpg|270px|thumb|A plaque commemorating ''The Bridge of Tears'', which reads, ''\"Fad leis seo a thagadh cairde agus lucht gaoil an té a bhí ag imeacht chun na coigrithe. B'anseo an scaradh. Seo Droichead na nDeor\"'' (Family and friends of the person leaving for foreign lands would come this far. Here was the separation. This is the Bridge of Tears).]]\nHowever, the usage of ''Irish diaspora'' is generally not limited by citizenship status, thus leading to an estimated (and fluctuating) membership of up to 80 million persons—the second and more emotive definition. The Irish Government acknowledged this interpretation—although it did not acknowledge any legal obligations to persons in this larger diaspora—when Article 2 of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was amended in 1998 to read ''\"[f]urthermore, the Irish nation cherishes its special affinity with people of Irish ancestry living abroad who share its cultural identity and heritage.\"''\n\nThe right to register as an Irish citizen terminates at the third generation (except as noted above). This contrasts with citizenship law in [[Italian nationality law|Italy]], [[Law of Return|Israel]], Japan and other countries which practice [[jus sanguinis]] or otherwise permit members of the diaspora to register as citizens.\n\nThere are people of Irish descent abroad (including [[Irish language|Irish speakers]]) who reject inclusion in an Irish \"diaspora\" and who designate their identity in other ways. They may see the diasporic label as something used by the Irish government for its own purposes.<ref>{{cite web|title='Diaspóra éigin,' ''An Lúibín''|date=22 May 2015|url=http://www.gaeilgesanastrail.com/newsletter-ir.php|quotation=\"Os a choinne sin, tig le daoine áirithe a rá gur de shliocht Éireannach iad ach nach daoine d'aon Diaspóra iad.

The [[Attacotti]], who were similarly recruited into the Roman army, may also have been Irish settlers in Britain (the movement between Ireland and the classical Britain may have been two-way as similarities between the Medieval accounts of [[Túathal Techtmar#Romans in Ireland?g|Túathal Teachtmar]] and archaeological evidence indicate that the Romans may have supported the invasion and conquest of Ireland by Irish exiles from Britain with the hopes of establishing a friendly ruler who could halt the raiding of Britain by the Irish. Some historians have also suggested that the [[Cruthin]] of the North of Ireland may have been [[Picts]].).<ref>''Tuathal Techtmar: A Myth or Ancient Literary Evidence for a Roman Invasion?'' By R. 8. Warner, The [[Ulster Museum]].</ref> Following the withdrawal of the Roman army, the Irish began increasing their footholds in Britain, with part of the north-West of the island annexed within the Irish kingdom of [[Dál Riata]]. In time, the Irish colonies became independent, merged with the [[Pict]]ish kingdom, and formed the basis of modern [[Scotland]].\n\nThe traditionally [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking areas of Scotland (the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands and Hebrides]]) are still referred to in the Gaelic language as ''a' Ghàidhealtachd'' (\"''the Gaeldom''\"). Irish monks, and the [[Celtic church]], pioneered a wave of Irish emigration into Great Britain, and continental Europe (and they were possibly the first inhabitants of the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Iceland]]).<ref>The 9th-century Irish monk and geographer [[Dicuil]] describes Iceland in his work [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Dicuil/De_mensura_orbis_terrae/text*.html ''Liber de Mensura Orbis Terrae''].</ref> Throughout early Medieval times Britain and continental Europe experienced Irish immigration of varying intensity, mostly from clerics and scholars who are collectively known as ''peregrini''.<ref name=\"On Google Books\"/> Irish emigration to western Europe, and especially to Great Britain, has continued at a greater or lesser pace since then. Today, the ethnic-Irish are the single largest minority group in both England and Scotland, most of whom eventually made it back to Ireland.\n\nThe dispersal of the Irish has been mainly to Britain or to countries colonised by Britain. England's political connection with Ireland began in 1155 when [[Pope Adrian IV]] issued a [[papal bull]] (known as ''[[Laudabiliter]]'') that gave [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] permission to invade Ireland as a means of strengthening the Papacy's control over the [[Celtic Christian|Irish Church]]. This was followed in 1169 by the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] led by the general [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]], a.k.a. ''Strongbow''.\n\nThe English Crown did not attempt to assert full control of the island until after [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s repudiation of [[Papacy|paprebelal]] authority over the [[Church in England]] and subsequent rebellion of the [[Earl of Kildare]] in Ireland in 1534 threatened English [[hegemony]] there. Until the break with [[Holy See|Rome]], it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere [[fiefdom]] to the English king, so in 1541 Henry VIII asserted England's claim to Ireland free from the Papal overlordship by proclaiming himself [[King of Ireland]].\n\nFollowing the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594 to 1603) political power rested in the hands of a [[Protestant Ascendancy]] minority and was marked by a Crown policy of [[Plantations of Ireland|plantation]], involving the arrival of thousands of English and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Protestant]] settlers, and the consequent displacement of the pre-plantation [[Catholicism in Ireland|Roman Catholic]] landholders. As the military and political defeat of [[Gaelic Ireland]] became more pronounced in the early seventeenth century, [[sectarian]] conflict became a recurrent theme in Irish history.\n\nRoman Catholics and members of [[Nonconformism|dissenting]] Protestant denominations suffered severe political and economic privations from [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]]. The [[Irish House of Commons|Irish Parliament]] was abolished in 1801 in the wake of the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|United Irishmen Rebellion]] and Ireland became an integral part of a new [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] under the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]].\n\nThe [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine of Ireland]] during the 1840s saw a significant number of people flee from the island to all over the world. Between 1841 and 1851 as a result of death and mass emigration (mainly to Great Britain and North America) Ireland's population fell by over 2 million. In [[Connacht]] alone the population fell by almost 30%.\n\n[[Robert E. Kennedy (University president)|Robert E. Kennedy]] explains, however, that the common argument of the mass emigration from Ireland being a \"flight from famine\" is not entirely correct: firstly, the Irish had been coming to build canals in Great Britain since the 18th century, and once conditions were better emigration did not slow down. After the famine was over the four following years produced more emigrants than during the four years of the blight. Kennedy argues that the famine was considered the final straw to convince people to move and that there were several other factors in the decision making.\n\nBy 1900 the population of Ireland was about half of its 1840 high and continued to fall during the 20th century.\n\nIrish people at home were facing discrimination from Great Britain based on the former's religion. Evictions only increased after the repeal of the British [[Corn Laws]] in 1846 and the new [[Encumbered Estates' Court|Encumbered Estates]] Act being passed in 1849 as well as the removal of existing civil rights. There had been agrarian terrorism against landlords which these new laws were implemented to stop the retribution. Any hope for change was squashed with the death of [[Daniel O'Connell]] in 1847, the political leader championing for Ireland, and the failed rising of the [[Young Ireland]]ers in 1848. More was to be gained by immigrating to America from Ireland and the [[California Gold Rush|1848 discovery of gold]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] lured away more.<ref>Kennedy, Robert E.

Ireland was a feudal [[Lordship of Ireland|Lordship]] of the [[List of English monarchs|Kings of England]] between 1171 and 1541; a [[Kingdom of Ireland|Kingdom]] in [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] between 1542 and 1801; and politically united with Great Britain as the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] between 1801 and 1922. Today, Ireland is divided between the [[Republic of Ireland]], and [[Northern Ireland]] which is part of the UK.\n\nToday, millions of residents of Great Britain are either from the island of Ireland or have Irish ancestry.

This is largely due to the flow of [[emigrants]] from Ireland during [[Great Famine (Ireland)|the Great Famine]] of 1845–1849. Many Irish servicemen, particularly sailors, settled in Britain: During the 18th and 19th century a third of the Army and Royal Navy were Irish. The Irish still represent the largest contingent of foreign volunteers to the British military, with more Irishmen serving in British uniforms than Irish ones.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Since the 1950s and 1960s in particular, the Irish have become assimilated into the British population. Emigration continued into the next century; over half a million Irish went to Britain in World War II to work in industry and serve in the [[British armed forces]]. In the post-war reconstruction era, the numbers of immigrants began to increase, many settling in the larger cities and towns of Britain. According to the 2001 census, around 850,000 people in Britain were born in Ireland.\n\nThe largest Irish communities in Britain are located predominantly in the cities and towns: in London, in particular [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] (which has one of the largest Irish-born communities outside Ireland) out to the west and north west of the city, in the large port cities such as [[Liverpool]] (which elected the first Irish Nationalist members of parliament), [[Glasgow]], [[Bristol]], [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] and [[Portsmouth]].

[[Brioc|Saint Brieuc]] founded the city that bears his name in [[Brittany]], [[Columbanus|Saint Colmán]] founded the great monastery of [[Bobbio]] in northern Italy and one of his monks was [[Saint Gall]] for whom the Swiss town of [[St. Gallen|St Gallen]] and [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Canton of St. Gallen|St Gallen]] are named.\n\nDuring the [[Counter-Reformation]], Irish religious and political links with Europe became stronger. An important centre of learning and training for Irish priests developed in [[Leuven]] (Lúbhan in Irish and ''Louvain'' historically in English) in the [[Duchy of Brabant]], now in [[Flanders]] (northern Belgium). The [[Flight of the Earls]], in 1607, led much of the Gaelic nobility to flee the country, and after the wars of the 17th century many others fled to Spain, France, Austria, and other Roman Catholic lands. The lords and their retainers and supporters joined the armies of these countries, and were known as the [[Flight of the Wild Geese|Wild Geese]]. Some of the lords and their descendants rose to high ranks in their adoptive countries, such as the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] general and politician [[Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetuan]], who became the [[president of the Government of Spain]] or the [[French people|French]] general and politician [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Duke of Magenta]], who became the [[president of the French Republic]]. The French [[Cognac]] [[brandy]] maker, [[Hennessy|James Hennessy and Co.]], is named for an Irishman. In Spain and its territories, many Irish descendants can be found with the name ''Obregón'' (''O'Brien'', [[Irish language|Irish]], ''Ó Briain''), including Madrid-born actress ''Ana Victoria García Obregón''.\n\nDuring the 20th century, certain Irish intellectuals made their homes in continental Europe, particularly [[James Joyce]], and later [[Samuel Beckett]] (who became a courier for the [[French Resistance]]). [[Eoin O'Duffy]] led a brigade of 700 Irish volunteers to fight for [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], and Frank Ryan led the Connolly column who fought on the opposite side, with the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] [[International Brigades]]. [[William Joyce]] became an [[English language|English-language]] propagandist for the [[Third Reich]], known colloquially as [[Lord Haw-Haw]].\n\n==Americas==\n\nWith its newly established trans-Atlantic empire, England needed labour. After the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], the Kingdom of England began to pacify Ireland through [[ethnic cleansing]], transporting large numbers of Irish, often forced into indentured servitude, to the New World. This increased following the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) and the [[Cromwellian invasion of Ireland]] (1649–1653). [[Cromwell]] took Irish land both to repay investors who had financed the invasion and as payment for his soldiers, and the ethnic Irish were ordered to move to [[Connaught]] or die. Between 1641 and 1652, over 550,000 Irish died from famine and other war-related causes. The Irish population of Ireland fell from 1,466,000 to 616,000. Between 1652 and 1659, 50,000 Irish men, women and children were sent to the West Indies, Virginia and Bermuda.\n\n===Argentina===\n{{Main|Irish settlement in Argentina}}\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, over 38,000 Irish immigrated to [[Argentina]].<ref name=\"Argentina\">{{cite web |url=http://www.westernpeople.ie/news/story.asp?j=36054 |title=Flying the Irish flag in Argentina |publisher=[[Western People]] |date=14 March 2008 |accessdate=4 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014183725/http://westernpeople.ie/news/story.asp?j=36054 |archive-date=14 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Very distinct Irish communities and schools existed until the Perón era in the 1950s.\n\nToday there are an estimated 1,000,000 people of Irish ancestry in Argentina,<ref name=\"Argentina\"/> approximately 15.5% of the Republic of Ireland's current population; however, these numbers may be far higher, given that many Irish newcomers declared themselves to be British, as Ireland at the time was still part of the United Kingdom and today their descendants integrated into Argentine society with mixed bloodlines.\n\nDespite the fact that Argentina was never the main destination for Irish emigrants it does form part of the Irish diaspora.

This was meant to pacify Ireland, easing English rule, and to clear land for settlement by English soldiers. The Puritan English government officials also expressed the opinion that they were saving the souls of the Roman Catholic Irish by settling them in Protestant territories where they would inevitably be converted to the true faith. Smaller numbers of Scottish prisoners were also sent to Bermuda following Cromwell's invasion of Scotland.\n\nRelations between the involuntary Irish immigrants and the local English population were strained. The Irish and Scots were ostracised by the English, ultimately intermarrying with Black and Native American minority groups to create a single demographic (''coloured'', which in Bermuda included anyone not able to be described as wholly of European ancestry. Today, the term has been replaced by ''Black'', in which wholly sub-Saharan African ancestry is erroneously implicit). The Irish quickly proved troublesome, and Bermudian slave owners were instructed ''that those that hath the Irish servants should take care that they straggle not night nor day as is too common with them''. In 1658, three Irishmen – John Shehan, David Laragen and Edmund Malony – were lashed for breaking [[curfew]] and being suspected of stealing a boat.  A Scottish indentured servant and three black slaves were also punished.<ref name=\"Packwood160\">{{cite book | last = Packwood | first = Cyril Outerbridge | title = Chained on the Rock | publisher = E.

Little survived of the non-English cultures. Catholicism was outlawed in Bermuda, as with the rest of English territory, and all islanders were required by law to attend services of the established [[Church of England]]. Some surnames that were common in Bermuda at this period, however, give lingering evidence of the Irish presence. By example, the area to the east of Bailey's Bay, in Hamilton Parish, is named ''Callan Glen'' for a Scottish-born shipwright, ''Claude MacCallan'', who settled in Bermuda after the vessel in which he was a passenger was wrecked off the North Shore in 1787. MacCallan swam to a rock from which he was rescued by a Bailey's Bay fisherman named ''Daniel Seon'' (''Sheehan''). A later Daniel Seon was appointed Clerk of the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]] and Prothonotary of the Court of General Assize in 1889 (he was also the Registrar of the Supreme Court, and died in 1909).\n\nIn 1803, Irish poet [[Thomas Moore]] arrived in Bermuda, having been appointed registrar to the [[Admiralty]] there. Robert Kennedy, born in [[Cultra]], [[County Down]], was the [[Government of Bermuda]]'s ''Colonial Secretary'', and was the acting [[Governor of Bermuda]] on three occasions (1829, 1830 and 1835–1836).<ref>Gentleman's Magazine. See ''American Vital Records from the Gentleman's Magazine, 1731-1868'', by David Dobson, Page 160.</ref> Irish prisoners were again sent to Bermuda in the 19th century, including participants in the ill-fated [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848]] and Nationalist journalist and politician [[John Mitchel]]. Alongside English convicts, they were used to build the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] on Ireland Island.<ref>[http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d7219230030099&sectionId=126 British military presence in Bermuda]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]'', 3 February 2007</ref> Conditions for the convicts were harsh, and discipline was draconian. In April, 1830, convict James Ryan was shot and killed during rioting of convicts on Ireland Island. Another five convicts were given death sentences for their parts in the riots, with those of the youngest three being commuted to transportation (to [[Australia]]) for life. In June, 1849, convict James [[Cronin]], on the hulk [[HMS Medway (1812)|Medway]] at Ireland Island, was placed in solitary confinement from the 25th to the 29th for fighting. On release, and being returned to work, he refused to be cross-ironed. He ran onto the breakwater, brandishing a poker threateningly. For this, he was ordered to receive punishment (presumably flogging) on Tuesday, 3 July 1849, with the other convicts aboard the hulk assembled behind a rail to witness. When ordered to strip, he hesitated. Thomas Cronin, his older brother, addressed him and, while brandishing a knife, rushed forward to the separating rail. He called out to the other prisoners in [[Irish language|Irish]] and many joined him in attempting to free the prisoner and attack the officers. The officers opened fire. Two men were killed and twelve wounded. Punishment of James Cronin was then carried out. Three-hundred men of the [[42nd Regiment of Foot]], in barracks on Ireland Island, responded to the scene under arms.<ref>''Bermuda Sampler 1815-1850'', by William Zuill. Publisher: The Bermuda Book Store. 1 January 1937</ref>\n \nAlthough the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (which had been banned in Bermuda, as in the rest of England, since settlement) began to operate openly in Bermuda in the 19th century, its priests were not permitted to conduct baptisms, weddings or funerals. As the most important British naval and military base in the Western Hemisphere following US independence, large numbers of Irish Roman Catholic soldiers served in the British Army's [[Bermuda Garrison]] (the Royal Navy had also benefitted from a shipload of Irish emigres wrecked on Bermuda, with most being recruited into the navy there). The first Roman Catholic services in Bermuda were conducted by British Army chaplains early in the 19th Century. Mount Saint Agnes Academy, a private school operated by the Roman Catholic Church of Bermuda, opened in 1890 at the behest of officers of the [[86th (Royal County Down) Regiment of Foot]] (which was posted to Bermuda from 1880 to 1883), who had requested from the [[Archbishop]] of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], a school for the children of Irish Roman Catholic soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bermuda-online.org/britarmy.htm|title=British Army in Bermuda from 1701 to 1977|first=Keith Archibald|last=Forbes|website=bermuda-online.org|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msa.bm/index.php/about-us/2011-05-06-15-24-05|title=Mount St. Agnes Academy website: History|website=Msa.bm|accessdate=11 January 2018}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nNot all Irish soldiers in Bermuda had happy lives there. Private Joseph McDaniel of the [[30th Regiment of Foot]] (who was born in the [[East Indies]] to an Irish father and a [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] mother) was convicted of the murder of Mary Swears in June, 1837, after he had been found with a self-inflicted wound and her lifeless body. Although he maintained his innocence throughout the trial, after his conviction he confessed that they had made a pact to die together. Although he had succeeded in killing her, he had failed to kill himself. He was put to death on Wednesday, 29 November 1837. Private Patrick Shea of the [[20th Regiment of Foot]] was sentenced to death in June, 1846, for discharging his weapon at Sergeant John Evans. His sentence was commuted to transportation (to [[Australia]]) for life. In October, 1841, [[County Carlow, Ireland|County Carlow]]-born Peter Doyle had also been transported to Australia for fourteen years for shooting at a picket.

Several prominent businesses in Bermuda have a clear Irish influence, such as the Irish Linen Shop, Tom Moore's Tavern and Flanagan's Irish Pub and Restaurant.\n\nA succession of Irish [[Masonic lodge]]s have existed in Bermuda, beginning with ''Military Lodge #192'', established by soldiers of the [[47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot|47th Regiment of Foot]], and operating in Bermuda from 1793 to 1801. This was an ambulatory or traveling lodge, as with other military lodges, moving with its members. Irish Lodges #220 (also a military travelling lodge) was active in Bermuda from 1856 to 1861, and Irish Lodge #209 was established in Bermuda in 1881. Minder Lodge #63 of the Irish Constitution was in Bermuda with the 20th Regiment of Foot from 1841 to 1847. The Hannibal Lodge #224 of the Irish Constitution was warranted in 1867, and still exists, meeting in the Masonic Hall on Old Maid's Lane, [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]]. Another Hannibal Chapter, #123 of the Irish Constitution, was chartered in 1877, but lasted only until 1911.<ref>[http://bermudafreemasons.org/history-of-irish-freemasonry-in-bermuda/ Website of Hannibal Lodge #224: ''History of Irish Freemasonry in Bermuda'']</ref>\n[[File:Ireland Island Woodcut.jpg|thumb|center|800px|An 1848 woodcut of [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|HMD Bermuda]], [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland Island]], Bermuda.]]\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Irish Canadians}}\n{{See also|Irish Quebecers|Irish Newfoundlanders}}\nThe 2006 census by Statcan, Canada's Official Statistical office revealed that the Irish were the 4th largest ethnic group with 4,354,155 Canadians with full or partial Irish descent or 14% of the nation's total population.<ref>Paul Magocsi, ed.

It is estimated that about 80% of Newfoundlanders have Irish ancestry on at least one side of their family tree. The family names, the predominant Roman Catholic religion, the prevalence of Irish music – even the accents of the people – are so reminiscent of rural Ireland that Irish author [[Tim Pat Coogan]] has described Newfoundland as ''\"the most Irish place in the world outside Ireland\"''.<ref name=\"Wherever Green Is Worn\">[[Tim Pat Coogan]], \"Wherever Green Is Worn: The Story of the Irish Diaspora\", Palgrave Macmillan, 2002.</ref> [[Newfoundland Irish]], the dialect of the [[Irish language]] specific to the island was widely spoken until the mid-20th century. It is very similar to the language heard in the southeast of Ireland centuries ago, due to mass emigration from the counties [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]], [[Waterford]], [[Wexford]], [[County Kerry]] and [[County Cork|Cork]].\n\n[[Saint John, New Brunswick]], claims the distinction of being Canada's most Irish city, according to census records. There have been Irish settlers in [[New Brunswick]] since at least the late 18th century, but during the peak of the [[Great Irish Famine]] (1845–1847), thousands of Irish emigrated through Partridge Island in the port of Saint John. Most of these Irish were Roman Catholic, who changed the complexion of the Loyalist city. A large, vibrant Irish community can also be found in the [[Miramichi Valley|Miramichi]] region of [[New Brunswick]].\n\n[[Guysborough County]], Nova Scotia has many rural Irish villages. Erinville (which means Irishville), Salmon River, Ogden, Bantry (named after [[Bantry Bay]], [[County Cork]], Ireland but now abandoned and grown up in trees) among others, where Irish last names are prevalent and the accent is reminiscent of the [[Irish people|Irish]] as well as the music, traditions, religion ([[Roman Catholic]]), and the love of Ireland itself. Some of the Irish counties from which these people arrived were [[County Kerry]] ([[Dingle Peninsula]]), [[County Cork]], and [[County Roscommon]], along with others.\n\nIn [[Antigonish County]], next to [[Guysborough County]] in Nova Scotia there are a few rural Irish villages despite the predominance of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] in most of that County. Some of these villages names are Ireland, Lochaber and Cloverville. [[Antigonish]] Town is a fairly even mix of Irish and Scottish, and the Irish presence contributes to Nova Scotia's [[Celts|Celtic]] cultural character. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n[[Quebec]] is also home to a large Irish community, especially in [[Montreal]], where the Irish [[shamrock]] is featured on the [[flag of Montreal|municipal flag]]. This is not a sign of homage to the Irish but of the conquest of French speaking Québec by British who use the symbols of France, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland bounded within the English [[St George's Cross|cross of St. George]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Notably, thousands of Irish emigrants during the Famine passed through [[Grosse Isle]] near Québec City, where many succumbed to [[typhus]]. Most of the Irish who settled near Québec City are now French speakers.\n\n[[Ontario]] has over 2 million people of Irish descent, who in greater numbers arrived in the 1820s and the decades that followed to work on colonial infrastructure and to settle land tracts in Upper Canada, the result today is a countryside speckled with the place names of Ireland. Ontario received a large number of those who landed in Quebec during the Famine years, many thousands died in Ontario's ports. Irish-born became the majority in [[Toronto]] by 1851.\n\n===Caribbean===\nFrom the 1620s, many of the Irish Roman Catholic merchant class in this period migrated voluntarily to the West Indies to avail of the business opportunities there occasioned by the trade in sugar, tobacco and cotton. They were followed by landless Irish indentured labourers, who were recruited to serve a landowner for a specified time before receiving freedom and land. The descendants of some Irish immigrants are known today in the West Indies as [[redlegs]]. Most descendants of these Irishmen moved off the islands as [[African slavery]] was implemented and blacks began to replace whites.

One of the most important industries of the island was the sugar industry. Among the successful businessmen in this industry were Miguel Conway, who owned a plantation in the town of [[Hatillo, Puerto Rico|Hatillo]] and Juan Nagle whose plantation was located in [[Río Piedras]]. General [[Alexander O'Reilly]], \"Father of the Puerto Rican Militia\", named Tomas O'Daly chief engineer of modernising the defences of San Juan, this included the fortress of [[Fort San Cristóbal (Puerto Rico)|San Cristóbal]].<ref name = \"Irish\"/> Tomas O'Daly and Miguel Kirwan were partners in the \"Hacienda San Patricio\", which they named after the [[patron saint]] of Ireland, [[Saint Patrick]]. A relative of O'Daly, [[Demetrio O'Daly]], succeeded Captain [[Ramon Power y Giralt]] as the island's delegate to the Spanish Courts. The plantation no longer exists, however the land in which the plantation was located is now a San Patricio suburb with a shopping mall by the same name. The Quinlan family established two plantations, one in the town of [[Toa Baja, Puerto Rico|Toa Baja]] and the other in [[Loíza, Puerto Rico|Loíza]].<ref>[http://www.rootsweb.com/~prsanjua/reme.htm Remembering the Past] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304084419/http://www.rootsweb.com/~prsanjua/reme.htm |date= 4 March 2007 }}</ref> Puerto Ricans of Irish descent were also instrumental in the development of the island's tobacco industry.

Many of them rose to prominent positions in the Spanish governments there. In the 1820s, some of them helped liberate the continent. [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] was the first [[President of Chile|Supreme director]] of [[Chile]]. When Chilean troops occupied [[Lima]] during the War of the Pacific in 1881, they put in charge certain [[Patricio Lynch]], whose grandfather came from Ireland to Argentina and then moved to Chile. Other Latin American countries that have Irish settlement include [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Colombia]].\n\n===Mexico===\n{{Main|Irish Mexican}}\nThe [[County Wexford]] born [[William Lamport]], better known to most Mexicans as Guillén de Lampart, was a precursor of the Independence movement and author of the first proclamation of independence in the New World. His statue stands today in the Crypt of Heroes beneath the Column of Independence in Mexico City.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAfter Lampart, the most famous Irishmen in Mexican history are probably \"Los Patricios\". Many communities also existed in [[Mexican Texas]] until the [[Texas Revolution|revolution]] there, when they sided with Roman Catholic Mexico against Protestant pro-US elements. The ''[[Saint Patrick's Battalion|Batallón de San Patricio]]'', a battalion of US troops who deserted and fought alongside the [[Mexican Army]] against the United States in the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–1848, is well known in [[History of Mexico|Mexican history]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n[[Álvaro Obregón]] (possibly O'Brian or O'Brien){{citation needed|date=February 2018}} was [[List of Presidents of Mexico|president of Mexico]] during 1920–24 and [[Ciudad Obregón|Obregón city]] and [[Ciudad Obregón International Airport|airport]] are named in his honour. Mexico also has a large number of people of Irish ancestry, among them the actor [[Anthony Quinn]]. There are monuments in Mexico City paying tribute to those Irish who fought for Mexico in the 19th century. There is a monument to Los Patricios in the fort of Churubusco. During the Potato Famine, thousands of Irish immigrants entered the country. Other Mexicans of Irish descent are: [[Romulo O'Farril]], [[Juan O'Gorman]], [[Edmundo O'Gorman]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Alejo Bay]] (Governor of the state of [[Sonora]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Irish Americans}}\n\nThe diaspora to the United States was immortalised in the words of many songs including the famous Irish [[ballad]], \"The Green Fields of America\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nSo pack up your sea-stores, consider no longer,\nTen dollars a week is not very bad pay,\nWith no taxes or tithes to devour up your wages,\nWhen you're on the green fields of Americay.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe experience of Irish immigrants in the United States has not always been harmonious. The US did not have a good relationship with most of the incoming Irish because of their Roman Catholic faith, as the majority of the population was Protestant and had been originally formed by offshoots of the Protestant faith, many of whom were from Northern Ireland (Ulster).<ref>Patricia I. Folan Sebben, \"U.S. Immigration Law, Irish Immigration and Diversity: Cead Mile Failte (A Thousand Times Welcome),\" in ''Georgetown Immigration Law Journal'', Vol. 6 Issue 4 (1992): 750</ref> So it came as no surprise that the federal government issued new immigration acts, adding to previous ones which limited Eastern European immigration, ones which limited the immigration of the Irish.<ref>Patricia I.

In modern times, in the United States, the Irish are largely perceived as hard workers. Most notably they are associated with the positions of police officer, [[firefighter]], [[Roman Catholic Church]] leaders and politicians in the larger [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] metropolitan areas. Irish Americans number over 35 million, making them the second largest reported ethnic group in the country, after [[German American]]s. Historically, large Irish American communities have been found in [[Philadelphia]]; Chicago; [[Boston]]; New York City; [[New York (state)|New York]]; Detroit; [[New England]]; [[Washington, DC]]; [[Baltimore]]; [[Pittsburgh]]; [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]; [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]; [[Broome County]]; [[Butte, Montana|Butte]]; [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]]; [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]]; [[Dublin, Ohio|Dublin]]; [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]; [[New Haven]]; [[Waterbury]]; [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]; [[New Orleans]]; [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]]; [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]]; [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]; [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]; [[Scranton]]; [[Wilkes-Barre]]; [[O'Fallon, Missouri|O'Fallon]]; [[Tampa]]; [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania|Hazleton]]; [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]; [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]]; Los Angeles; and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Many cities across the country have annual St Patrick's Day parades; [[Saint Patrick's Day#Parades|The nation's largest is in New York City]]—one of the world's largest parades. The parade in Boston is closely associated with [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|Evacuation Day]], when the British left Boston in 1776 during the [[American War of Independence]].\n\nBefore the [[Great Hunger]] (\"Irish Potato [[Famine]]\"), in which over a million died and more emigrated,<ref>{{Cite book|last=O'Hara|first=Megan|title=Irish Immigrants: 1840–1920|publisher=Capstone Press|year=2002|pages=6, 10|location=Mankato, MN|series=Blue Earth Books: Coming to America|isbn=978-0-7368-0795-1}}</ref> there had been the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] which had already resulted in significant emigration from Ireland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.emmigration.info/irish-immigration-to-america.htm|title=Irish Immigration to America: History for kids ***|website=Emmigration.info|access-date=2017-02-16}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'', in 1790 there were 400,000 Americans of Irish birth or ancestry out of a total white population of 3,100,000. Half of these Irish Americans were descended from Ulster people, and half were descended from the people of Connacht, Leinster and Munster.\n\nAccording to US Census figures from 2000, 41,000,000 Americans claim to be wholly or partly of Irish ancestry, a group that represents more than one in five white Americans.

While most of the early Irish came as traders, some also came as soldiers. However, the majority of these traders and soldiers were from the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. Prominent among them were the generals [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] (1769–1852) who became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in 1834 and his brother [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]] (1760–1842), who was [[Governor-General of India]] (1798–1805) and a great-great-great grandfather of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. Later in the Victorian period, many thinkers, philosophers and Irish nationalists from the Roman Catholic majority too made it to India, prominent among the nationalists being the theosophist [[Annie Besant]].\n\nIt is widely believed that there existed a secret alliance between the Irish and Indian independence movements. Some Indian intellectuals like [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[V. V. Giri]] were certainly inspired by Irish nationalists when they studied in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Indian revolutionary group known as the [[Bengal Volunteers]] took this name in emulation of the [[Irish Volunteers]].\n\n*[[Derek O'Brien (quizmaster)|Derek O'Brien]], quiz master turned MP in Indian state of [[West Bengal]].\n*[[Michael John O'Brian]] is an eminent Air Vice-Marshall of [[Pakistan Air Force]].\n\n==Australia==\n[[File:Australian Census 2011 demographic map - Australia by SLA - BCP field 1120 Irish Total Responses.svg|thumb|right|300px|People with Irish ancestry as a percentage of the population in Australia divided geographically by statistical local area, as of the 2011 census]]\n{{Main|Irish Australian}}\n'''Irish Australians''' form the second largest [[ethnic group]] in Australia, numbering 2,087,800 or 10.4 per cent of respondents in the 2011 Census.\n\nIt is not clear whether the Irish-born are considered \"[[Irish Australians]]\" or if the term only refers to their Australian-born descendants. The 2001 Census recorded 50,320 Irish-born in Australia, although this is a minimal figure as it only includes those who wrote in \"Ireland\" or \"Republic of Ireland\" as their country of birth. Responses which mentioned \"Northern Ireland\" as birthplace were coded as \"United Kingdom\". This interpretation may omit as few as 21,500 Irish-born present in the country, as many as 29,500, or possibly even more. Nevertheless, the number of persons born in Ireland, north and south, resident in Australia in 2001 may be confidently extrapolated at around 75,000.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAccording to the Irish [[Department of Foreign Affairs]] ''White Paper on Foreign Policy'', there were 213,000 Irish citizens living in Australia in 1997; nearly three times the number of Irish-born immigrants to the country. Most Irish Australians, however, do not have [[Irish nationality law|Irish citizenship]] and define their status in terms of self-perception, affection for Ireland and an attachment to [[Irish culture]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIrish settlers – both voluntary and forced – were crucial to the development of the Australian colonies from the earliest days of European settlement. The Irish first came over in large numbers as [[convicts]] (50,000 were transported between 1791 and 1867), to be used as free labour; even larger numbers of [[free settlers]] came during the 19th century, partly due to the [[Donegal Relief Fund]]. Irish immigrants accounted for one-quarter of Australia's overseas-born population in 1871. Their descendants played a definitive role in shaping Australian history, society and culture. It has been argued that the Irish language was the source of a significant number of words in [[Australian English]].<ref>See the discussion in Lonergan, Dymphna, ''Sounds Irish: The Irish Language in Australia'', Lythrum Press, 2004; {{ISBN|1 921013 00 1}}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Patrick O'Farrell]] noted in ''The Irish in Australia'' (1987) that the term \"Australia first\" became \"what amounted to the Australian Irish Catholic slogan\". These Australians of Irish background did not tend to regard Ireland as their \"mother country\" – primarily because few had a wish to return to a home they had left in search of a better life. Rather, they tended to identify themselves as Australians.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}<!-- EDIT NOTE: It is not clear what anti-Irish bias in Australia is being referenced (if any such reference exists) in the quote previously provided from Ned Kelly -->\n\nAccording to census data released by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] in 2004, Irish Australians are, by religion, 46.2% [[Roman Catholic]], 15.3% [[Anglican]], 13.5% other Christian denomination, 3.6% other religions, and 21.5% as \"No Religion\".

Both the Cape Colony and the [[Colony of Natal]] had Irish prime ministers: Sir [[Thomas Upington]], \"The [[Afrikaner]] from [[Cork (city)|Cork]]\"; and [[Albert Henry Hime|Sir Albert Hime]], from [[Kilcoole]] in [[County Wicklow]]. Irish Cape Governors included [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]], [[Du Pre Alexander, 2nd Earl of Caledon|Lord Caledon]] and [[Sir John Francis Cradock]].\n\nHenry Nourse, a shipowner at the Cape, brought out a small party of Irish settlers in 1818. In 1823, John Ingram brought out 146 Irish from Cork. Single Irish women were sent to the Cape on a few occasions. Twenty arrived in November 1849 and 46 arrived in March 1851. The majority arrived in November 1857 aboard the ''Lady Kennaway''. A large contingent of Irish troops fought in the [[Second Boer War|Anglo-Boer War]] on both sides and a few of them stayed in South Africa after the war. Others returned home but later came out to settle in South Africa with their families. Between 1902 and 1905, there were about 5,000 Irish immigrants. Places in South Africa named after Irish people include [[Upington, Northern Cape|Upington]], [[Porterville, Western Cape|Porterville]], [[Caledon, Western Cape|Caledon]], [[Cradock, Eastern Cape|Cradock]], [[Sir Lowry's Pass]], the Biggarsberg Mountains, [[Donnybrook, KwaZulu-Natal|Donnybrook]], [[Himeville]] and [[Belfast, Mpumalanga|Belfast]].\n\n==New Zealand==\n{{Main|Irish New Zealanders}}\nThe Diaspora population of Ireland also got a fresh start on the islands of [[New Zealand]] during the later half of the 19th century. The ideology of striking it rich in the gold mines caused many Irish people to flock to the docks; risking their lives on the long voyage to potential freedom and more importantly self-sufficiency. Most famous places including both [[Gabriel's Gully]] and [[Otago Gold Rush|Otago]] are examples of mining sites which, with the funding of large companies, allowed for the creation of wages and the appearance of mining towns. Women found jobs as housemaids cleaning the shacks of the single men at work thereby providing a second income to the Irish family household. The subsequent money accumulated with regards to this would allow for [[chain migration]] for the rest of the family left behind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunedinlibraries.govt.nz/kids/homework-zone/early-dunedin-and-otago/otago-gold-rush|title=Youth|first=Dunedin Public|last=Libraries|website=Dunedinlibraries.govt.nz|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Transition to New Zealand was made easier due to the overexposure that the Irish had previously had with colonialism. They ventured upwards to the British ports, settling temporarily to accumulate the necessary finances before moving onwards towards the banks of the far away island. In doing so, they not only exposed themselves to the form of British form of government but likewise to capitalism. This aided to further the simplicity of the transition for the dispersed population.<ref>Fraser, Lyndon. \"Structure and agency: Comparative perspectives on Catholic Irish experiences in New Zealand and the U.S\" (December 1995) Vol 14 No 2. pp 93.

By promising to pay for the passage of a family the government ensured that the island would be populated and a British colony would be formed. Free passage was installed for women first between the ages of 15-35, while males between the ages of 18–40 years of age would be promised a certain amount of acres of land upon arrival in the New World. This was attributed to the installment of the New Zealand Land act. To further aid with the financial burden, free passage to any immigrant was granted after 1874.<ref>\nCarthy, Angela. \"Personal letters and the Organization of Irish Migrants to and from New Zealand 1848-1925\"(May 2003) Vol. 33 no. 131 pp.&nbsp;303</ref>\n\nA final note with regards to importance of the Irish diaspora population in New Zealand deals with the diminished amount of prejudice present for the Roman Catholic population upon arrival. The lack of embedded hierarchy and social structure in the New World allowed for previous sectarian tensions to be dissolved. This can also be attributed to the sheer amount of distance between the respective religions due to the sparseness of the unpopulated area and the sheer size of the islands.<ref>Nolan, Melanie \"Kith, Kirk and the Working class of [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]]: A transfer of Ulster Scots culture to New Zealand\" vol 209 (2004) pp 21.</ref>\n\n== List of countries by population of Irish heritage ==\n:{{cleanup section|time=2015-10-07|reason=questionable pop. and % figures|date=October 2015}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=width:40% | Country || Population || % of country || Criterion\n|-\n| ''Irish in North America'' || || ||\n|-\n| {{flagicon|USA}} [[Irish American]] || align=\"right\" | 33,348,049 || align=\"right\" | 10.50%\n||\nSelf-identified \"Irish\"<br />33,348,049<ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk \"Selected Social Characteristics in the United States (DP02): 2013 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6gpGlyhlr?url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk |date=17 April 2016 }}</ref><br /><small>10.50% of the US population (2013)</small><br />Scotch-Irish Americans<br />27 to 30 million<ref name=\"BFFF\">James Webb, ''Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America'' (New York: Broadway Books, 2004), front flap: 'More than 27 million Americans today can trace their lineage to the Scots, whose bloodline was stained by centuries of continuous warfare along the border between England and Scotland, and later in the bitter settlements of England's Ulster Plantation in Northern Ireland.' {{ISBN|0-7679-1688-3}}</ref><ref name=\"Secret\">James Webb, [http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110005798 Secret GOP Weapon: The Scots Irish Vote], ''Wall Street Journal'' (23 October 2004).

The establishment of an 'Irish Episcopal Empire' involved three transnational entities – the British Empire, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Irish diaspora. Irish clergy, notably Cullen, made particular use of the reach of the British Empire to spread their influence. From the 1830s until his death in 1878, Cullen held several key positions near the top of the Irish hierarchy and influenced Rome's appointment of Irish bishops on four continents.<ref>Colin Barr, \"'Imperium in Imperio': Irish Episcopal Imperialism in the Nineteenth Century\", ''English Historical Review'' 2008 123(502): pp. 611–50.</ref>\n\nWalker (2007) compares Irish immigrant communities in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Great Britain respecting issues of identity and 'Irishness.' Religion remained the major cause of differentiation in all Irish diaspora communities and had the greatest impact on identity, followed by the nature and difficulty of socio-economic conditions faced in each new country and the strength of continued social and political links of Irish immigrants and their descendants with Ireland.\n\nIn the United States specifically, Irish immigrants were persecuted because of their religion. The Know Nothing Movement sprung up during the time of the Irish's arrival.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Maha|first=Sorin-Stefan|date=December 2011|title=The Migration of Europeans to the United States at the Middle of the 19th Century - the Irish and German Wave |journal=Centre for European Studies Working Papers |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=556–562 |url=http://www.ceswp.uaic.ro/articles/CESWP2011_III4_MAH.pdf |accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref> The Know Nothing Party was formed by Protestants and was the first political party in American history to push against Catholic immigration to the United States, particularly targeting Irish and German immigrants. The Know Nothings fought&nbsp; to limit immigration from traditional Catholic countries, prohibit non-English language speaking on US territory, and create a policy where you must spend 21 years in the US before gaining citizenship.<ref name=\":0\" /> The party faded out of existence relatively quickly, but they are a reminder of the persecution Irish immigrants faced. During the third and fourth waves of immigration, new arrivals faced similar discrimination and the now settled Irish would take part in this persecution of other groups.\n\nFrom the late 20th century onward, Irish identity abroad became increasingly cultural, non-denominational, and non-political, although many emigrants from Northern Ireland stood apart from this trend. However, Ireland as religious reference point is now increasingly significant in [[neopaganism|neopagan]] contexts.<ref>Catherine Maignant, \"Irish base, global religion: the Fellowship of Isis\". 262–280 in Olivia Cosgrove et al.
