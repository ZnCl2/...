Though generally taught and considered by speakers as a separate language, Lakota is mutually intelligible with the other two languages (such as [[Dakota language]]), and is considered by most linguists as one of the three major [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of the [[Sioux language]]. \n\nSpeakers of the Lakota language make up one of the largest [[Native American language]] speech communities in the United States, with approximately 2,000 speakers, who live mostly in the northern plains states of [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]].<ref name=\"ethnologue\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lkt |title=Lakota |last=Gordon |first=Raymond G., Jr. |year=2005 |website=Ethnologue: Languages of the World |edition=15th |publisher=SIL International |accessdate=2009-05-16 }}</ref> There is a Lakota language program online available for children to use.<ref name=\"lakhota.org\">{{cite web |title=Lakota Language Consortium |url=http://www.lakhota.org |accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref> There is also a Lakota Language Program with classes for children at Red Cloud Indian School.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redcloudschool.org/LLP|title=About the Lakota Language Program |publisher=Red Cloud Indian School |accessdate=28 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe language was first put into written form by European-American missionaries around 1840.

Lakota {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} are said to be [[open-mid vowel|more open]] than the corresponding cardinal vowels, perhaps closer to {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}}. Orthographically, the nasal vowels are written with a following {{angle bracket|ƞ}}, {{angle bracket|ŋ}}, or {{angle bracket|n}}; historically, these were written with [[ogonek]]s underneath, {{angle bracket|į ą ų}}.<ref>''Elementary Bilingual Dictionary English–Lakhóta Lakhóta–English'' (1976) CU Lakhóta Project University of Colorado</ref> No syllables end with consonantal {{IPA|/n/}}.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n! colspan=2|\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Central vowel|Central]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | [[Close vowel|Close/High]]\n! scope=\"row\" | oral\n| i\n| \n| u\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | nasal\n| ĩ\n| \n| ũ\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n! \n| e\n| \n| o\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | [[Open vowel|Open/Low]]\n! scope=\"row\" | oral\n| \n| a\n| \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | nasal\n| \n| ã\n| \n|}\n\nA neutral vowel ([[schwa]]) is [[epenthesis|automatically inserted]] between certain consonants, e.g. into the pairs {{angle bracket|gl}}, {{angle bracket|bl}} and {{angle bracket|gm}}.

(1996). [https://web.archive.org/web/20050405024744/http://lakxotaiyapi.freecyberzone.com/sk1uni.htm Sketch of Lakhota, a Siouan Language, Part I]. Handbook of North American Indians, Vol. 17 (Languages), pp. 440–482.</ref><ref name=\"lako04\"/> and in fast speech it is often realized as a [[voiced velar fricative]] {{IPA|[ɣ]}}. The voiceless aspirated plosives have two allophonic variants each: those with a delay in voicing {{IPA|([pʰ tʰ kʰ])}}, and those with velar friction {{IPA|([pˣ tˣ kˣ])}}, which occur before {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/ã/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/ĩ/}}, and {{IPA|/ũ/}} (thus, {{lang|lkt|lakhóta}}, {{IPA|/laˈkʰota/}} is phonetically {{IPA|[laˈkˣota]}}). For some speakers, there is a phonemic distinction between the two, and both occur before {{IPA|/e/}}. No such variation occurs for the affricate /tʃʰ/. Some orthographies mark this distinction; others do not. The uvular fricatives {{IPA|/χ/}} and {{IPA|/ʁ/}} are commonly spelled {{angle bracket|ȟ}} and {{angle bracket|ǧ}}.\n\nAll [[morpheme|monomorphemic]] words have one vowel which carries primary [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and has a higher tone than all other vowels in the word. This is generally the vowel of the second syllable of the word, but often the first syllable can be stressed, and occasionally other syllables as well. Stress is generally indicated with an acute accent: {{angle bracket|á}}, etc. Compound words will have stressed vowels in each component; proper spelling will write compounds with a hyphen. Thus {{lang|lkt|máza-ská}}, literally \"metal-white\", i.e. \"silver; money\" has two stressed vowels, the first ''a'' in each component. If it were written without the hyphen, as {{lang|lkt|mazaska}}, it would imply a single main stress.\n\n===Orthography===\nThe majority of educational institutions across Lakota country adopted the writing system of the ''New Lakota Dictionary'' as the standard orthography. It is used, among other places, at [[Sitting Bull College]], Oglala Lakota College, by all schools of the [[Standing Rock Sioux Tribe]], by the majority of teachers of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and in almost all schools on Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>. [[Sinte Gleska University]] is said to have been using an orthography developed by [[Albert White Hat]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Arlene B. Hirschfelder|title=Native Heritage: Personal Accounts by American Indians, 1790 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2OhBCKfo-sC|year=1995|publisher=VNR AG|isbn=978-0-02-860412-1}}</ref> but apart from one elementary level textbook, no literature, learning materials, or dictionaries have been developed with this orthography. The spelling system is not used by Sinte Gleska University language instructors during classes. Historically several orthographies as well as ''[[ad hoc]]'' spelling have been used to write the Lakota language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&LangID=3 |title=Language Materials Project: Lakota |publisher=UCLA |accessdate=23 Dec 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Powers |first=William K. |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/680162 |title=Comments on the Politics of Orthography |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=92 |year=1990 |page=496 |accessdate=23 Dec 2010|doi=10.1525/aa.1990.92.2.02a00190}}</ref><ref>Palmer, 2</ref> \n\nThe spelling system of the ''New Lakota Dictionary'' is presented below:\n\nThe vowels are ''a, e, i, o, u;'' nasal vowels are ''aŋ, iŋ, uŋ.'' [[Pitch accent]] is marked with an [[acute accent]]: á, é, í, ó, ú, áŋ, íŋ, úŋ on stressed vowels (which receive a higher tone than non-stressed ones)<ref>Cho, Taehong. \"Some phonological and phonetic aspects of stress and intonation in Lakhota: a preliminary report\", Published as a PDF at :[http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/linguistics/people/grads/taehong/Lakhota.pdf humnet.ucla.edu \"Lakhota\"], Linguistics, UCLA</ref>\n\nThe following consonants approximate their IPA values: ''b, g, h, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w, z''. ''Y'' has its English value of {{IPA|/j/}}. An apostrophe, ’, is used for [[glottal stop]].\n\nA [[caron]] is used for sounds which are not written with Latin letters in the IPA: ''č'' {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, ''ǧ'' {{IPA|/ʁ/}}, ''ȟ'' {{IPA|/χ/}}, ''š'' {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, ''ž'' {{IPA|/ʒ/}}. Aspirates are written with ''h'': ''čh, kh, ph, th,'' and velar frication with ''ȟ'': ''kȟ, pȟ, tȟ.'' Ejectives are written with an apostrophe: ''č’, ȟ’, k’, p’, s’, š’, t’&zwnj;''.\n\nThe spelling used in modern popular texts is often written without diacritics. Besides failing to mark stress, this also results in the confusion of numerous consonants: {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} are both written ''s'', {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/χ/}} are both written ''h'', and the aspirate stops are written like the unaspirates, as ''p, t, c, k''.\n\n====Alphabet====\n\nStandard Lakota Orthography, as used by the majority of schools, is in principle phonemic, which means that each character ([[grapheme]]) represents one distinctive sound ([[phoneme]]), except for the distinction between glottal and velar aspiration, which is treated phonetically.\n{{col-start}}{{col-2}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Lakota alphabet\n|-\n!Letter\n!Name of the letter\n!Usual phonetic value ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]])\n|-\n|'''A&nbsp;a'''\n|a\n|{{IPA|[a]}}\n|-\n|'''Aŋ&nbsp;aŋ'''\n|aŋ\n|{{IPA|[ə̃]}}\n|-\n|'''B&nbsp;b'''\n|be\n|{{IPA|[b]}}\n|-\n|'''Č&nbsp;č'''\n|ču\n|{{IPA|[tʃ]}}\n|-\n|'''Čh&nbsp;čh'''\n|čhi\n|{{IPA|[tʃʰ]}}\n|-\n|'''Č’&nbsp;č’'''\n|č’ó\n|{{IPA|[tʃʼ]}}\n|-\n|'''E&nbsp;e'''\n|e\n|{{IPA|[ɛ]}}\n|-\n|'''G&nbsp;g'''\n|gli\n|{{IPA|[ɡ]}}\n|-\n|'''Ǧ&nbsp;ǧ'''\n|ǧu\n|{{IPA|[ʁ] / [ʀ]}}\n|-\n|'''H&nbsp;h'''\n|ha\n|{{IPA|[h]}}\n|-\n|'''Ȟ&nbsp;ȟ'''\n|ȟe\n|{{IPA|[χ]}}\n|-\n|'''I&nbsp;i'''\n|i\n|{{IPA|[ɪ]}}\n|-\n|'''Iŋ&nbsp;iŋ'''\n|iŋ\n|{{IPA|[ɪ̃]}}\n|-\n|'''K&nbsp;k'''\n|ku\n|{{IPA|[k]}}\n|-\n|'''Kh&nbsp;kh'''\n|khi\n|{{IPA|[kʰ]}}\n|-\n|'''Kȟ&nbsp;kȟ'''\n|kȟa\n|{{IPA|[kˣ]}}\n|-\n|'''K’&nbsp;k’'''\n|k’o\n|{{IPA|[kʼ]}}\n|-\n|'''L&nbsp;l'''\n|la\n|{{IPA|[l]}}\n|-\n|'''M&nbsp;m'''\n|ma\n|{{IPA|[m]}}\n|-\n|'''N&nbsp;n'''\n|na\n|{{IPA|[n]}}\n|-\n|'''O&nbsp;o'''\n|o\n|{{IPA|[ɔ]}}\n|-\n|'''P&nbsp;p'''\n|pu\n|{{IPA|[p]}}\n|-\n|'''Ph&nbsp;ph'''\n|phi\n|{{IPA|[pʰ]}}\n|-\n|'''Pȟ&nbsp;pȟ'''\n|pȟa\n|{{IPA|[pˣ]}}\n|-\n|'''P’&nbsp;p’'''\n|p’o\n|{{IPA|[pʼ]}}\n|-\n|'''S&nbsp;s'''\n|sa\n|{{IPA|[s]}}\n|-\n|'''Š&nbsp;š'''\n|še\n|{{IPA|[ʃ]}}\n|-\n|'''T&nbsp;t'''\n|tu\n|{{IPA|[t]}}\n|-\n|'''Th&nbsp;th'''\n|thi\n|{{IPA|[tʰ]}}\n|-\n|'''Tȟ&nbsp;tȟ'''\n|tȟa\n|{{IPA|[tˣ]}}\n|-\n|'''T’&nbsp;t’'''\n|t’o\n|{{IPA|[tʼ]}}\n|-\n|'''U&nbsp;u'''\n|u\n|{{IPA|[ʊ]}}\n|-\n|'''Uŋ&nbsp;uŋ'''\n|uŋ\n|{{IPA|[ʊ̃]}}\n|-\n|'''W&nbsp;w'''\n|wa\n|{{IPA|[w]}}\n|-\n|'''Y&nbsp;y'''\n|ya\n|{{IPA|[j]}}\n|-\n|'''Z&nbsp;z'''\n|za\n|{{IPA|[z]}}\n|-\n|'''Ž&nbsp;ž'''\n|že\n|{{IPA|[ʒ]}}\n|-\n|'''’'''\n|khéze\n|{{IPA|[ʔ]}}\n|}{{col-end}}\n\nAll digraphs (i.e. characters created by two letters, such as kh, kȟ, k’) are treated as groups of individual letters in alphabetization. Thus for example the word {{lang|lkt|čhíŋ}} precedes {{lang|lkt|čónala}} in a dictionary.\n\n===Phonological processes===\n\nA common phonological process which occurs in rapid speech is ''vowel contraction'', which generally results from the loss of an intervocalic glide. Vowel contraction results in phonetic long vowels ([[phoneme|phonemically]] a sequence of two identical vowels), with falling pitch if the first underlying vowel is stressed, and rising pitch if the second underlying vowel is stressed: ''kê:'' (falling tone), \"he said that\", from {{lang|lkt|kéye}}; ''hǎ:pi'' (rising tone), \"clothing\", from {{lang|lkt|hayápi}}. If one of the vowels is nasalized, the resulting long vowel is also nasalized: ''čhaŋ̌:pi'', \"sugar\", from {{lang|lkt|čhaŋháŋpi}}.<ref name=\"rood96\" />\n\nWhen two vowels of unequal height contract, or when feature contrasts exist between the vowels and the glide, two new phonetic vowels, {{IPA|[æː]}} and {{IPA|[ɔː]}}, result:<ref name=\"rood96\" /> ''iyæ̂:'', \"he left for there\", from {{lang|lkt|iyáye}}; ''mitȟa:'', \"it's mine\", from {{lang|lkt|mitȟáwa}}.\n\nThe plural [[clitic|enclitic]] ''=pi'' is frequently changed in rapid speech when preceding the enclitics ''=kte'', ''=kiŋ'', ''=kštó'', or ''=na''. If the vowel preceding ''=pi'' is high/open, ''=pi'' becomes [u]; if the vowel is non-high (mid or closed), ''=pi'' becomes [o] (if the preceding vowel is nasalized, then the resulting vowel is also nasalized): ''hi=pi=kte'', \"they will arrive here\", [hiukte]; ''yatkáŋ=pi=na'', \"they drank it and...\", {{IPA|[jatkə̃õna]}}.<ref name=\"rood96\" />\n\nLakota also exhibits some traces of sound symbolism among fricatives, where the [[point of articulation]] changes to reflect intensity: {{lang|lkt|zí}}, \"it's yellow\", {{lang|lkt|ží}}, \"it's tawny\", {{lang|lkt|ǧí}}, \"it's brown\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Mithun |first=Marianne |year=2007 |title=The Languages of Native North America|location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=33}}</ref> (Compare with the similar examples in [[Mandan language#Vocabulary|Mandan]].)\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Word order===\n\nThe basic word order of Lakota is [[subject–object–verb]], although the order can be changed for expressive purposes (placing the object before the subject to bring the object into focus or placing the subject after the verb to emphasize its status as established information). It is [[adposition#Postpositions|postpositional]], with adpositions occurring after the head nouns: {{lang|lkt|mas'óphiye él}}, \"at the store\" (literally 'store at'); {{lang|lkt|2=thípi=kiŋ ókšaŋ}}, \"around the house\" (literally 'house=the around') (Rood and Taylor 1996).\n\nRood and Taylor (1996) suggest the following template for basic word order. Items in parenthesis are optional; only the verb is required. It is therefore possible to produce a grammatical sentence that contains only a verb.\n<blockquote>(interjection) (conjunction) (adverb(s)) (nominal) (nominal) (nominal) (adverb(s)) verb (enclitic(s)) (conjunction)</blockquote>\n\n===Interjections===\n\nWhen [[interjection]]s are used, they begin the sentence. A small number of interjections are used only by one gender, for instance the interjection expressing disbelief is {{lang|lkt|ečéš}} for women but {{lang|lkt|hóȟ}} for men; for calling attention women say {{lang|lkt|máŋ}} while men use {{lang|lkt|wáŋ}}. Most interjections, however, are used by both genders.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Conjunctions===\n\nIt is common for a sentence to begin with a conjunction. Both {{lang|lkt|čhaŋké}} and {{lang|lkt|yuŋkȟáŋ}} can be translated as ''and''; {{lang|lkt|k’éyaš}} is similar to English ''but''. Each of these conjunctions joins clauses. In addition, the conjunction {{lang|lkt|na}} joins nouns or phrases.\n\n===Adverbs and postpositions===\n\nLakota uses [[preposition and postposition|postpositions]], which are similar to English prepositions, but follow their noun complement. [[Adverb]]s or postpositional phrases can describe manner, location, or reason. There are also [[interrogative word|interrogative]] adverbs, which are used to form questions.\n\n====Synonymity in the postpositions {{lang|lkt|él}} and {{lang|lkt|ektá}}====\n\nTo the non-Lakota speaker, the postpositions {{lang|lkt|él}} and {{lang|lkt|ektá}} sound like they can be interchangeable, but although they are full synonyms of each other, they are used in different occasions. Semantically (word meaning), they are used as locational and directional tools. In the English language they can be compared to prepositions like \"at\", \"in\", and \"on\" (when used as locatives) on the one hand, and \"at\", \"in\", and \"on\" (when used as directionals), \"to\", \"into\", and \"onto\", on the other. (Pustet 2013)\n\nA pointer for when to use {{lang|lkt|él}} and when to use {{lang|lkt|ektá}} can be determined by the concepts of location  (motionless) or motion; and space vs. time. These features can produce four different combinations, also called semantic domains, which can be arranged as follows (Pustet 2013):\n\n# space / rest: \"in the house\" [thípi kiŋ él] (This sentence is only describing location of an object, no movement indicated)\n# space / motion: \"to the house [thípi kiŋ ektá] (This sentence is referring to movement of a subject, it is directional in nature)\n# time / rest: \"in the winter\" [waníyetu kiŋ él] (This sentence refers to a static moment in time, which happens to be during winter)\n# time / motion: \"in/towards the winter\" [waníyetu kiŋ ektá] (Pustet 2013) (This sentence is delegated to time, but time which is soon to change to another season)\n\nSummed up, when a context describes no motion, {{lang|lkt|él}} is the appropriate postposition; when in motion, {{lang|lkt|ektá}} is more appropriate. They are both used in matters of time and space.\n\n===Nouns and pronouns===\n\nAs mentioned above, [[noun phrase|nominals]] are optional in Lakota, but when nouns appear the basic word order is subject–object–verb. Pronouns are not common, but may be used [[contrast (linguistics)|contrastively]] or emphatically.\n\nLakota has four [[article (grammar)|articles]]: {{lang|lkt|waŋ}} is indefinite, similar to English ''a'' or ''an'', and {{lang|lkt|kiŋ}} is definite, similar to English ''the''. In addition, {{lang|lkt|waŋží}} is an indefinite article used with hypothetical or [[irrealis mood|irrealis]] objects, and {{lang|lkt|k’uŋ}} is a definite article used with nouns that have been mentioned previously.\n\n===Demonstratives===\n\nThere are also nine [[demonstrative]]s, which can function either as pronouns or as [[determiner (class)|determiners]].\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n| \n! colspan=3 | Distance from speaker\n|-\n| \n!'''near'''\n!'''neutral'''\n!'''far'''\n|-\n\n| '''singular''' || {{lang|lkt|lé}} || {{lang|lkt|hé}} || {{lang|lkt|ká}}\n|-\n| '''dual''' || {{lang|lkt|lenáos}}/<br/>{{lang|lkt|lenáyos}} || {{lang|lkt|henáos}}/<br/>{{lang|lkt|henáyos}} || {{lang|lkt|kanáos}}/<br/>{{lang|lkt|kanáyos}}\n|-\n| '''plural''' || {{lang|lkt|lená}} || {{lang|lkt|hená}} || {{lang|lkt|kaná}}\n|}\n\nThe demonstrative {{lang|lkt|hé}} is the most neutral. Once a noun has been located, either by pointing or by description, in space or in the listener’s mind, {{lang|lkt|hé}} can then be used. Before that, {{lang|lkt|lé}} or {{lang|lkt|ká}} is usually used to demonstrate exactly what is meant, although {{lang|lkt|hé}} may also be used while pointing.\n\n===Verbs===\n\nVerbs are the only word class that are obligatory in a Lakota sentence. Verbs can be active, naming an action, or [[Stative verb|stative]], describing a property. (Note that in English, such descriptions are usually made with [[adjective]]s.)\n\nVerbs are [[Inflection|inflected]] for first-, second- or third [[Grammatical person|person]], and for singular, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] or plural [[grammatical number]].\n\n===Morphology===\n\n====Verb inflection====\n\nThere are two paradigms for verb [[inflection]]. One set of [[morpheme]]s indicates the [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] of the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of active verbs. The other set of morphemes [[Agreement (linguistics)|agrees]] with the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of [[Transitive verb|transitive]] action verbs ''or'' the subject of stative verbs.<ref name=\"rood96\" />\n\nMost of the morphemes in each paradigm are prefixes, but plural subjects are marked with a suffix and third-person plural objects with an [[infix]].\n\nFirst person arguments may be singular, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], or plural; second or third person arguments may be singular or plural.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Subject of active verbs\n| \n|'''singular'''\n|'''dual'''\n|'''plural'''\n|-\n| '''first person''' || wa- || uŋ(k)- || uŋ(k)- … -pi\n|-\n| '''second person''' || ya- ||  || ya- … -pi\n|-\n| '''third person''' || ''[[Markedness|unmarked]]'' ||  || -pi\n|}\n\n'''Examples:''' ''máni'' \"He walks.\" ''mánipi'' \"They walk.\"\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Subject of stative verbs\n| \n|'''singular'''\n|'''dual'''\n|'''plural'''\n|-\n| '''first person''' || ma- || uŋ(k)- || uŋ(k)- … -pi\n|-\n| '''second person''' || ni- ||  || ni- … -pi\n|-\n| '''third person''' || ''unmarked'' ||  || -pi\n|}\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Object of transitive verbs\n| \n|'''singular'''\n|'''dual'''\n|'''plural'''\n|-\n| '''first person''' || ma- ||  || uŋ(k)- … -pi\n|-\n| '''second person''' || ni- ||  || ni- … -pi\n|-\n| '''third person''' || ''unmarked'' ||  || -wicha-\n|}\n\n'''Example:''' ''waŋwíčhayaŋke'' \"He looked at them\" from ''waŋyáŋkA'' \"to look at something/somebody\".\n\n'''Subject and object pronouns in one verb'''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><br/>\nIf both the subject and object need to be marked, two affixes occur on the verb. Below is a table illustrating this. Subject affixes are marked in ''italics'' and object affixes are marked in <u>underline</u>. Some affixes encompass both subject and object (such as ''čhi''- ...). The symbol '''∅''' indicates a lack of marking for a particular subject/object (as in the case of 3rd Person Singular forms).

In the last column, verbs which require ''uŋ(k)''- to be prefixed are more complex because of competing rules: ''uŋ(k)''- must be prefixed, but must also follow ''wičha''-. Most speakers resolve this issue by infixing ''wičhauŋ(k)'' after the initial vowel, then repeating the initial vowel again.\n'''Example:''' ''i'''wíčhauŋk'''iču'''pi''''' \"We took them\" from ''ičú'' \"to take something/somebody\".\n*<sup>5</sup> Since the suffix -''pi'' can appear only once in each verb, but may pluralize either subject or object (or both), some ambiguity exists in the forms: ''uŋ- ... -pi'', ''uŋni- ... -pi'', and ''uŋya-/uŋl-/uŋn- ... -pi''.\n\n====Enclitics====\n\nLakota has a number of [[enclitic]] [[Grammatical particle|particles]] which follow the verb, many of which differ depending on whether the speaker is male or female.\n\nSome enclitics indicate the aspect, mood, or number of the verb they follow. There are also various [[interrogative]] enclitics, which in addition to marking an utterance as a question show finer distinctions of meaning. For example, while ''he'' is the usual question-marking enclitic, ''huŋwó'' is used for [[rhetorical question]]s or in formal [[Public speaking|oratory]], and the [[dubitative mood|dubitative]] ''wa'' functions somewhat like a [[tag question]] in English (Rood and Taylor 1996; Buchel 1983). (See also the section below on men and women's speech.)\n\n=====Men's and women's speech=====\nA small number of enclitics (approximately eight) differ in form based on the gender of the speaker. ''Yeló'' (men) ''ye'' (women) mark mild assertions. ''Kštó'' (women only according to most sources) marks strong assertion. ''Yo'' (men) and ''ye'' (women) mark neutral commands, ''yetȟó'' (men) and ''nitȟó'' (women) mark familiar, and ''ye'' (both men and women) and ''na'' mark requests. ''He'' is used by both genders to mark direct questions, but men also use ''hųwó'' in more formal situations. ''So'' (men) and ''se'' (women) mark [[dubitative mood|dubitative]] questions (where the person being asked is not assumed to know the answer).\n\nWhile many [[First language|native speakers]] and [[Linguistics|linguists]] agree that certain enclitics are associated with particular [[gender]]s, such usage may not be exclusive. That is, individual men sometimes use enclitics associated with women, and vice versa (Trechter 1999).\n\n'''Examples of enclitic usage'''\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Enclitic'''\n|'''Meaning'''\n|'''Example'''<ref>{{cite book|last=Deloria |first=Ella |year=1932 |title=Dakota Texts|location=New York|publisher=G.E.

Compare these sentences.\n\n''Šúŋka kiŋ sápa čha waŋbláke.'' <br />\n''Šúŋka kiŋ sápe.'' <br />\n''Šúŋka kiŋ sápiŋ na tȟáŋka.''\n\nThe last vowel in the word \"''SápA''\" changed each time. This vowel change is called \"ablaut\". Words which undergo this change are referred to as A-words, since, in dictionary citations, they are written ending in either -A or -Aŋ. These words are never written with a final capital letter in actual texts. Derivatives of these words generally take the ablaut as well, however there are exceptions.\n\nThere are three forms for ablauted words: ''-a/-aŋ'', ''-e'', ''-iŋ''. These are referred to as a/aŋ-ablaut, e-ablaut, and iŋ-ablaut respectively. Some words are ablauted by some and not others, like \"gray\" ''hóta'' or ''hótA''. Ablaut always depends on what word follows the ablauted word.\n\n====A/aŋ-ablaut====\n\nThis is the basic form of the word, and is used everywhere in which the other forms are not utilized.\n\n====E-ablaut====\n\nThere are two cases in which e-ablaut is used.\n# Last word in the sentence\n# Followed by a word which triggers e-ablaut\n\n=====1. Last word in sentence=====\n;Examples\n\n:''Héčhiya yé'' He went there. (e-ablaut of the verb ''yÁ'')\n:''Yúte'' She ate it. (e-ablaut of the verb ''yútA'')\n:''Thípi kiŋ pahá akáŋl hé.'' The house stands on a cliff. (e-ablaut of the verb hÁŋ)\n\n=====2. Followed by a word which triggers e-ablaut=====\nThere are three classes of words which trigger e-ablaut\n\na) various enclitics, such as ''ȟča, ȟčiŋ, iŋčhéye, kačháš, kiló, kštó, któk, lakȟa, -la, láȟ, láȟčaka, ló, séčA, sékse, s’eléčheča, so, s’a, s’e, šaŋ, šni, uŋštó''<br />\nb) some conjunctions and articles, such as ''kiŋ, kiŋháŋ, k’éaš, k’uŋ, eháŋtaŋš''<br />\nc) some auxiliary verbs, such as ''kapíŋ, kiníča (kiníl), lakA (la), kúŋzA, phiča, ši, wačhíŋ, -yA, -khiyA''<br />\n\n;Examples\n\n:''Škáte šni.'' He did not play. (enclitic)\n:''Škáte s’a.'' He plays often. (enclitic)\n:''Škáte ló.'' He plays. (enclitic (marking assertion))\n:''Okȟáte eháŋtaŋš...'' If it is hot... (conjunctive)\n:''Sápe kiŋ'' The black one (definite article)\n:''Glé kúŋze.'' He pretended to go home. (auxiliary verb)\n:''Yatké-phiča.'' It is drinkable. (auxiliary verb)\n\n====Iŋ-ablaut====\n\nThe iŋ-ablaut (pronounced ''i'' by some) occurs only before the following words:\n\n''ktA'' (irrealis enclitic)<br />\n''yetȟó'' (familiar command enclitic)<br />\n''na, naháŋ'' (and)<br />\n''naíŋš'' (or, and or)<br />\n''yé'' (polite request or entreaty enclitic)\n\n;Examples\n\n:''Waŋyáŋkiŋ yetȟó.'' Take a look at this, real quick.\n:''Yíŋ kte.'' She will go.\n:''Skúyiŋ na wašté.'' It was sweet and good.\n:''Waŋyáŋkiŋ yé.'' Please, look at it.\n\n==Phrases==\n\n\"Háu kȟolá\", literally \"Hello, friend\", is the most common greeting, and was transformed into the generic motion picture American Indian \"[[How (greeting)|How]]!\", just as the traditional feathered headdress of the Teton was \"given\" to all movie Indians. As \"háu\" is the only word in Lakota which contains a [[diphthong]], /au/, it may be a loanword from a non-Siouan language.<ref name=\"rood96\" />\n\n\"Háu\" is spoken only by men; women use the greeting \"Háŋ\" or \"Háŋ kȟolá\".\n\nOther than using the word \"friend\", one often uses the word \"cousin\" or \"cross-cousin\" since everyone in the tribe was as family to each other. These words are very important to the speaker's tone of proper respect. The terms are as follow:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n\"Tȟaŋháŋši\" N - my male cross-cousin (man speaking, term of address)<br>\n\"Tȟaŋháŋšitku\" N - his male cross-cousin<br>\n\"TȟaŋháŋšiyA\" V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a male cross-cousin\n\n\"Haŋkáši\" N - my female cross-cousin (man speaking, term of address)<br>\n\"Haŋkášitku\" N - his female cross-cousin<br>\n\"HaŋkášiyA\" V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a female cross-cousin\n\n\"(S)čépȟaŋši\" N - my female cross-cousin (woman speaking, term of address)<br>\n\"(S)čépȟaŋšitku\" N - her female cross-cousin<br>\n\"(S)čépȟaŋšiyA\" V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a female cross-cousin\n\n\"šič'éši\" N - my male cross-cousin (woman speaking, term of address)<br>\n\"šič'éšitku\" N - her male cross-cousin<br>\n\"šič'éšiyA\" V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a male cross-cousin\n\n\"Hakátaku\" N - her brothers and male cross cousins, his sisters and female cross-cousins (i.e. relative requiring respect)<br>\n\"HakátayA\" V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a sibling or cross-cousin of the opposite sex\n\n==Learning Lakota: language revitalization efforts ==\n\nAssimilating indigenous tribes into the expanding American society of the late 19th and early 20th centuries depended on suppression or full eradication of each tribe's unique language as the central aspect of its culture. Government boarding schools that separated tribal children from their parents and relatives enforced this assimilation process by corporal punishment for speaking tribal languages (Powers). The Lakota language survived this suppression. \"Lakota persisted through the recognized natural immersion afforded by daily conversation in the home, the community at reservation-wide events, even in texts written in the form of letters to family and friends. people demonstrated their cultural resilience through the positive application of spoken and written Lakota.\" (Powers)\n\nEven so, employment opportunities were based on speaking English; a Lakota who was bilingual or spoke only English was more likely to be hired. (Powers)<ref name=\"Andrews\"/>\n\nSchools on the five Lakota reservation started offering Lakota language classes beginning in the early 1970s, but Lakota language instruction suffered very low quality primarily due to lack of linguistic and methodological background of the teachers. Positions of Lakota language teachers were filled with native Lakota speakers without teaching accreditation under the assumption that a native speaker is logically an effective teacher of the language. But for several decades Lakota instruction did not result in creating proficiency among graduates of reservation schools. Students and observers reported repeatedly that Lakota classes from elementary level all the way to college commonly involved mere rote memorization of isolated vocabulary items (usually the terms for colors, number and animals).\n\nIn the mid 70s the situation with Lakota language instruction improved on the Rosebud Reservation where the Lakota Language and Culture department was established at the Sinte Glešká University under the chairmanship of Ben Black Bear, Jr., who promoted standardization of orthography and curricula. He employed college level textbooks and orthography developed by the Colorado University Lakota Project (CULP). A few years later Black Bear was replaced as a chair of the department by Albert White Hat who discontinued the use of the consistent phonemic orthography and the Colorado University textbooks. In 1992 White Hat published an elementary level textbook and promoted it as the only teaching material for schools of all levels in Rosebud. White Hat established his own orthography, one that is very diacritic heavy and impractical. This had a detrimental impact on the quality of instruction in Rosebud and resulted in almost complete disintegration of Lakota language teaching infrastructure in Rosebud, because school boards and administrators gradually lost trust in the effectiveness of Lakota language teachers and classes. By 2015, only one Rosebud school offered Lakota language classes and there were only 2 Lakota language teachers.\n\nLakota language classes continued to be offered between 1970’s and 2000’s on other Lakota reservations (Pine Ridge, Cheyenne River and Standing Rock), but the three decades did not result in developing any proficiency among students. The situation started improving gradually in early 2000’s when teacher training started to be offered to Lakota language teachers and especially after 2006 when the Lakota Summer Institute was established by the Lakota Language Consortium and the Sitting Bull College on Standing Rock. The institute offers high quality training for Lakota language teachers, educating them in Lakota linguistics and language teaching methodology. Since 2008 the institute also started offering classes for Lakota language learners.\n\nBy 2015, there has been a major improvement of Lakota language proficiency levels among students of reservation schools. This was due to teacher training available through the Lakota Summer Institute and to the adoption of consistent phonemic orthography introduced in the New Lakota Dictionary (2008) and the Lakota Grammar Handbook (2016). This orthography and the effective teaching methods enabled teachers and students for the first time to teach and learn correct pronunciation. It has been reported repeatedly that students are increasingly able to have Lakota conversations with elders. Revitalization efforts were further strengthened by the establishment of several Lakota language immersion schools (such as the Language Nest in Standing Rock and the immersion school in Oglala, Pine Ridge).\n\nOne of the most influential and consistent figures of the Lakota Language Revitalization has been Ben Black Bear, Jr., who established the Lakota Language Department at the Sįté Glešká University in 1970's. Since 2009 he has been teaching Lakota at the Lakota Summer Institute at Sitting Bull College in Standing Rock. He has been a long term board member of the Lakota Language Consortium and he co-authored the Lakota Audio Series and the Lakota Grammar Handbook, which is the most accurate grammar of the language and probably the most detailed grammar ever written for a Native American language.<ref>''Lakota Grammar Handbook'' (2016)</ref>\n\nIn 2004 five Lakota tribes (Pine Ridge, Standing Rock, Rosebud, Cheyenne River and Lower Brule) united with second-language education professionals and academic linguists to form the Lakota Language Consortium,<ref name=\"lakhota.org\"/> to produce and implement a comprehensive educational effort to standardize and professionalize Lakota language teaching in tribal and neighboring public and parochial schools. This intertribal movement has resulted in sequenced textbooks, audio materials, reference books and professional teacher trainings that create a new Lakota-centered career path. In November 2012, the incoming president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, Bryan Brewer, announced that he intended \"to lead a Lakota Language Revitalization Initiative that will focus on the creation and operation of Lakota language immersion schools and identifying all fluent Lakota speakers.\"<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Cook\n| first = Andrea\n| title = Brewer pledges to preserve Lakota language\n| accessdate = 2012-11-20\n| date = 2012-11-16\n| url = http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/brewer-pledges-to-preserve-lakota-language/article_ae488230-138c-50e6-ab55-55976752169d.html\n}}</ref> A Lakota language immersion daycare center is scheduled to open at [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation|Pine Ridge]].<ref>{{Cite news\n |last        = Aaron Moselle\n |title       = Chestnut Hill native looks to revitalize \"eroded\" American Indian language\n |work        = NewsWorks, WHYY\n |accessdate  = 2012-11-29\n |date        = November 2012\n |url         = http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/item/47231\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130518165344/http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/item/47231\n |archivedate = 2013-05-18\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2012}}, Lakota [[Language immersion|immersion classes]] are provided for children in an experimental program at [[Sitting Bull College]] on the [[Standing Rock Reservation]], where children speak only Lakota for their first year (Powers).<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Donovan\n| first = Lauren\n| title = Learning Lakota, one word at a time\n| work = Bismarck Tribune\n| location = Bismarck, ND\n| accessdate = 2012-11-20\n| date = 2012-11-11\n| url = http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/learning-lakota-one-word-at-a-time/article_0352569a-2a97-11e2-9c5c-001a4bcf887a.html\n}}</ref> \n{{As of|2014}}, it is estimated that about five percent of children age four to six on [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] speak Lakota.<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Doering\n| first = Christopher\n| title = Indians press for funds to teach Native languages\n| work = Argus Leader\n| accessdate = 2014-06-28\n| date = 2014-06-19\n| url = http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2014/06/19/indians-press-funds-teach-native-languages/10833145/\n}}</ref>\n\nLakota speakers can upload photos with Lakota language audio descriptions at the ''LiveAndTell'' website.<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Glader\n| first = Paul\n| title = LiveAndTell, A Crowdsourced Quest To Save Native American Languages | work = Fast Company\n| accessdate = 2012-11-20\n| date = 2011-07-04\n| url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1764575/liveandtell-crowdsourced-quest-save-native-american-languages\n}}</ref><br />\n\n=== Lakota Language Education Program (LLEAP) ===\nIn 2011, Sitting Bull College (Fort Yates, North Dakota, Standing Rock) and the University of South Dakota began degree programs to create effective Lakota language teachers. By earning a Bachelor of Arts in Education at the University of South Dakota or a Bachelor of Science in Education at Sitting Bull College, students can major in \"Lakota Language Teaching and Learning\" as part of the Lakota Language Education Action Program, or LLEAP.\n\nLLEAP is a four-year program designed to create at least 30 new Lakota language teachers by 2014, and was funded by $2.4 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Education. At the end of the initial phase, SBC and USD will permanently offer the Lakota Language Teaching and Learning degree as part of their regular undergraduate Education curriculum. The current LLEAP students' tuition and expenses are covered by the grant from the U.S. Department of Education. LLEAP is the first program of its kind, offering courses to create effective teachers in order to save a Native American language from going extinct, and potentially educate the 120,000 prospective Lakota speakers in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Kimberlee | year = 2011 | title = Sitting Bull Offers New Lakota Curriculum | url = | journal = Tribal College Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 69–70 }}</ref>\n\n===Government support===\nIn 1990, Senator [[Daniel Inouye]] (D-HI) sponsored the Native American Languages Act in order to preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedoms of Native people in America to practice, develop and conduct business in their native language.
