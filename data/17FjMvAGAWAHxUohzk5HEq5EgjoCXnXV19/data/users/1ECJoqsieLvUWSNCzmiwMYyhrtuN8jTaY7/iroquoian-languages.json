They are historically grouped together, and geographically the Wenro's range on the eastern end of Lake Erie placed them between the two much larger confederations. To the east of the Wenro, beyond the [[Genesee Gorge]], were the lands of the Iroquois and southeast, beyond the headwaters of the [[Allegheny River]], lay the Susquehannocks.<ref name=\"AmHeritageBk\"/>  The Susquehannocks and Erie were militarily powerful and respected by neighboring tribes.<ref name=\"AmHeritageBk\"/> These groups were called ''Atiwandaronk,'' meaning 'they who understand the language' by the surviving Huron ([[Wyandot people]]). By 1660 all of these peoples but the Susquehannocks and Iroquois were defeated and scattered, migrating to form new tribes or to be adopted into others&mdash;the practice of adopting valiant enemies into the tribe was a common cultural tradition of the Iroquoian peoples.<ref name=\"AmHeritageBk\"/>\n\nThe group known as the [[Meherrin]] were neighbors to the Tuscarora and the Nottoway ([[#refBinford1967|Binford 1967]]) in the American South and may have spoken an Iroquoian language.
