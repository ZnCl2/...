Its status as a distinct language from the [[Georgian language]] is the subject of some debate.\n\nWith the exception of a significant number of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[loanword]]s, the language is reportedly largely mutually intelligible with [[Georgian language|Georgian]].\n\n==Distribution==\nJudaeo-Georgian has approximately 85,000 speakers.  These include 20,000 speakers in Georgia (1995 est.), and about 59,800 speakers in Israel (2000 est.).  The language has approximately 4,000 speakers in [[New York (state)|New York]] and undetermined numbers in other communities in [[Russia]], [[Belgium]], the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].\n\n==Status==\nJudaeo-Georgian is, like many [[Jewish languages]] spoken there, on the decline in [[Israel]].  Its status in Georgia itself is unchanged, except by the rapid decline in the size of the language community, due to emigration beginning in the 1970s, which has seen the departure of some 80% of the community.  Authoritative studies of its continued use by other expatriate communities of Georgian Jews have not been conducted.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://languageserver.uni-graz.at/ls/lang?id=3078 LanguageServer's Judaeo-Georgian page]\n\n{{Georgian language}}\n{{Jewish languages}}\n\n[[Category:Jewish languages]]\n[[Category:Jews and Judaism in Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Georgian-Jewish culture in the United States]]\n[[Category:Kartvelian languages]]\n[[Category:Languages of Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Languages of Russia]]\n[[Category:Georgian language]]",
