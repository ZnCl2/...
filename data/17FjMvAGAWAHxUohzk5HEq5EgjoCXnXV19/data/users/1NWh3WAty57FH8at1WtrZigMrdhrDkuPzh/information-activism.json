            "text": "An '''information activist''' is someone who works to make information available to the general population. According to Anthony Molaro, \"An information activist is a vigorous advocate of knowledge gained through study, communication, research or instruction\".<ref>Molaro, Anthony G. (2009). On my mind: Information Activist. ''American Libraries, 40''(12), 37.</ref>\n\n'''Information activism''' at [[library|libraries]] and among [[librarian]]s began in the 1960s, when many libraries advocated for the [[information right]]s of their clients. Their activism projects thereafter extended beyond library walls to advocate for issues such as [[tenant's rights|tenancy]] and [[labour rights]].<ref>Berry, John N. (1997). The Rebirth of Information Activism. ''Library Journal'', 122, 6.</ref> With the advent of new [[information technology|information technologies]] and the [[information explosion]] of the late 20th century, information activism expanded in scope to include people who utilize information in the service of advocacy. Tactical Technology Collective has proposed a definition of information activism as “the strategic and deliberate use of information within a campaign”<ref>Tactical Tech. \"Information Activism: Turning Information Into Action.\" [https://www.newtactics.org/information-activism-turning-information-action/information-activism-turning-information-action] ''New Tactics in Human Rights'', July 2009</ref> which specifically refers to the use of publicly available information in activist projects. Information activists take on many projects to work to remove barriers and provide access to knowledge for all people. \nInformation activism can take on many different forms and be used in many different fields including in librarianship, in archiving, and in activist projects.\n\n==In librarianship==\n\n[[Carla Hayden]] was quoted describing librarians of today as people \"who are activists, engaged in the social work aspect of librarianship ... Now we are fighters for freedom, and we cause trouble! We are not sitting quietly anymore.\"<ref>Orenstein, Catherine. [http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2349/Hayden-Carla-D.html Woman of the Year 2003: Carla Diane Hayden]. ''Ms. Magazine'', Winter 2003.</ref>\n\n===Library Juice Press===\n\nLibrary Juice Press is a publisher that specializes in theoretical and practical issues in librarianship from a critical perspective, for an audience of professional librarians and students of library science.<ref>\"About Us.\" Library Juice Press, LLC. http://libraryjuicepress.com/about.php.</ref> They began as the webzine and blog [http://libraryjuicepress.com/blog/ Library Juice] and still hold no affiliations to an academic institution.<ref>\"About Us.\" Litwin Books, LLC. http://litwinbooks.com/about.php</ref>  Some topics they investigate are: library philosophy, information policy, library activism, and in general anything that can be placed under the rubric of \"critical studies in librarianship.\"<ref>\"About Us.\" Library Juice Press, LLC. http://libraryjuicepress.com/about.php.</ref> <br />\nLibrary Juice Press is an imprint of Litwin Books, LLC.\n\n==In archiving==\n\n[[Interference Archive]] is a collectively-run archive in Brooklyn, New York that opened in December 2011.

Their two 10 Tactics campaigns are both a film and a project which aims to link the ways in which information and information technologies have been used in social movements. In particular, information is used to “monitor the state, corporations, and powerful social institutions,” hold them accountable, and promote local and global activism.<ref>\"About 10 Tactics Revisited.\" 10 Tactics Revisited. https://informationactivism.org/en#</ref> The Info Activism Camp exists as space to bring together activists from around the world to develop information activism techniques.<ref>\"The Idea.\" Evidence & Influence, Info-Activism Camp. https://camp2013.tacticaltech.org/idea</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Information criticism]]\n*[[Information wants to be free]]\n*[[Library and information science]]\n*[[Zine]]\n*[[Free culture movement]]\n*[[Freedom of information]]\n*[[Librarians Without Borders]]\n*[[Open data]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://lwb-online.org/ Librarians Without Borders]\n*[http://liswiki.org/wiki/Advocacy LIS Wiki]\n*[http://www.radicalreference.info/ Radical Reference]\n*[http://libraryjuicepress.com/index.php Library Juice Press]\n*[http://interferencearchive.org/ Interference Archive]\n*[https://www.tacticaltech.org/ Tactical Technology Collective]\n*[https://archive.informationactivism.org/en/about 10 Tactics: for turning information into action]\n*[https://informationactivism.org/en# 10 Tactics Revisited]\n*[https://camp2013.tacticaltech.org/idea Info Activism Camp 2013]\n\n[[Category:Library science]]\n[[Category:Access to Knowledge movement]]\n\n\n{{library-stub}}",
