A fully mesh network is where each node is connected to every other node in the network.]]\n\nA '''mesh network''' is a [[local network]] [[network topology|topology]] in which the infrastructure [[Node (networking)|node]]s (i.e. bridges, switches and other infrastructure devices) connect directly, dynamically and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data from/to clients. This lack of dependency on one node allows for every node to participate in the relay of information. Mesh networks dynamically self-organize and self-configure, which can reduce installation overhead. The ability to self-configure enables dynamic distribution of workloads, particularly in the event that a few nodes should fail. This in turn contributes to fault-tolerance and reduced maintenance costs.\n\nMesh topology may be contrasted with conventional [[Star network|star]]/[[Fat tree|tree]] local network topologies in which the bridges/switches are directly linked to only a small subset of other bridges/switches, and the links between these infrastructure neighbours are hierarchical. While star-and-tree topologies are very well established, highly standardized and vendor-neutral, vendors of mesh network devices have not yet all agreed on common standards, and interoperability between devices from different vendors is not yet assured.\n\n== Basic principles ==\nMesh networks can relay messages using either a [[Flooding (computer networking)|''flooding'']] technique or a ''routing'' technique. With [[routing]], the message is propagated along a path by ''hopping'' from node to node until it reaches its destination. To ensure that all its paths are available, the network must allow for continuous connections and must reconfigure itself around broken paths, using ''self-healing'' algorithms such as [[Shortest Path Bridging]]. Self-healing allows a routing-based network to operate when a node breaks down or when a connection becomes unreliable. As a result, the network is typically quite reliable, as there is often more than one path between a source and a destination in the network. Although mostly used in wireless situations, this concept can also apply to wired networks and to software interaction.\n\nA mesh network whose nodes are all connected to each other is a [[fully connected network]]. Fully connected wired networks have the advantages of security and reliability: problems in a cable affect only the two nodes attached to it. However, in such networks, the number of cables, and therefore the cost, goes up rapidly as the number of nodes increases.\n\n==Wired Mesh== \n[[Shortest path bridging]] allows [[ethernet switch]]es to be connected in a mesh topology, and it allows for all paths to be active.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.avaya.com/usa/about-avaya/newsroom/news-releases/2014/pr-140401 | title=Avaya Extends the Automated Campus to End the Network Waiting Game | date=1 April 2014 | publisher=Avaya | accessdate=18 April 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419153624/http://www.avaya.com/usa/about-avaya/newsroom/news-releases/2014/pr-140401 | archivedate=19 April 2014 | df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Shortest Path Bridging IEEE 802.1aq Overview|publisher = Huawei|author = Peter Ashwood-Smith|date = 24 February 2011|url = http://meetings.apnic.net/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/32007/APRICOT_SPB_Overview.pdf|accessdate = 11 May 2012|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130515115628/http://meetings.apnic.net/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/32007/APRICOT_SPB_Overview.pdf|archivedate = 15 May 2013|df = }}</ref>\n\n===Development history===\nWireless mesh radio networks were originally developed for military applications, such that every node could dynamically serve as a router for every other node. In that way, even in the event of a failure of some nodes, the remaining nodes could continue to communicate with each other, and, if necessary, to serve as uplinks for the other nodes.\n\nEarly wireless mesh network nodes had a single [[half-duplex]] radio that, at any one instant, could either transmit or receive, but not both at the same time. This was accompanied by the development of [[shared mesh]] networks. This was subsequently superseded by more complex radio hardware that could receive packets from an upstream node and transmit packets to a downstream node simultaneously (on a different frequency or a different CDMA channel). This allowed the development of [[switched mesh]] networks. As the size, cost, and power requirements of radios declined further, nodes could be cost-effectively equipped with multiple radios. This in turn permitted each radio to handle a different function, for instance one radio for client access, and another for backhaul services.\n\nWork in this field has been aided by the use of [[game theory]] methods to analyze strategies for the allocation of resources and routing of packets.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Huang |first2=D.

The Pentagon launched the DoD JTRS program in 1997, with an ambitious to use software to control radio functions - such as frequency, bandwidth, modulation and security previously baked into the hardware. This approach would allow the DoD to build a family of radios with a common software core, capable of handling functions that were previously split among separate hardware-based radios: VHF voice radios for infantry units; UHF voice radios for air-to-air and ground-to-air communications; long-range HF radios for ships and ground troops; and a wideband radio capable of transmitting data at megabit speeds across a battlefield.

An example is [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]], a standard that specifies a high-speed (up to 1 Gbit/s) [[local area network]] using existing home wiring ([[Power line communication|power lines]], phone lines and [[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cables]]). In noisy environments such as power lines (where signals can be heavily attenuated and corrupted by noise) it's common that mutual visibility between devices in a network is not complete. In those situations, one of the nodes has to act as a relay and forward messages between those nodes that cannot communicate directly, effectively creating a \"relaying\" network. In G.hn, relaying is performed at the [[Data Link Layer]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Information technology}}\n*[[:Category:Mesh networking|Category of mesh networking technologies]]\n*[[Bluetooth mesh networking]]\n*[[Wireless mesh network]]\n*[[Optical mesh network]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Mesh network}}\n<!--\nOnly links to sites that provide actual information about mesh networking.\nNo links to sites that primarily exist to sell products or services.\nplease read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links\n-->\n* [http://www.slideshare.net/DaCostaFrancis/battelle-aoa-evaluation-report-on-military-mesh-network-products Battelle Institute AoA] Comparative Ratings for popular mesh network providers, specific to mission critical military programs.  \n* [http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~rtm/roofnet-b.pdf Architecture and Evaluation of the MIT Roofnet Mesh Network] - Draft research paper describing the Roofnet project.\n* [http://www.wing-project.org WING Project] Wireless Mesh Network distribution based on the roofnet source code\n* [http://www.meshdynamics.com/documents/MDThirdGenerationMesh.pdf First, Second and Third Generation Mesh Architectures] History and evolution of Mesh Networking Architectures\n* [http://www.mit.edu/~medard/itmanet DARPA's ITMANET program and the FLoWS Project] Investigating Fundamental Performance Limits of MANETS\n* [http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/212 Robin Chase discusses Zipcar and Mesh networking] Robin Chase talks at the Ted conference about the future of mesh networking and eco-technology\n* [http://www.slideshare.net/DaCostaFrancis/military-defense-and-public-safety-mesh-networks Dynamic And Persistent Mesh Networks] Hybrid mesh networks for military, homeland security and public safety\n* [http://www.mesh-networks.org/ Mesh Networks Research Group] Projects and tutorials' compilation related to the Wireless Mesh Networks\n* [http://www.nyu.edu/its/pubs/architecture/kyriannis-tetrahedroncore.pdf Tetrahedron Core Network] Application of a tetrahedral structure to create a resilient partial-mesh 3-dimensional campus backbone data network\n* [http://code.google.com/p/phantom/ Phantom] anonymous, decentralized network, isolated from the Internet\n* [http://www.qaul.net/ Qaul Project] – Text messaging, file sharing and voice calls independent of Internet and cellular networks\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120131063052/http://wiki.projectmeshnet.org/Main_Page the free content wiki for project meshnet and supporting projects]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160505162010/http://www.broadband-hamnet.org/ Broadband-Hamnet] - Mesh networking application on 2.4Ghz spectrum for amateur radio\n* [http://aredn.org/ AREDN] - Amateur Radio Emergency Data network, a mesh networking application used for emergency data and information handling\n* [http://meshdynamics.com/documents/MeshDynamicsDisruptionTolerantNetworks.pdf Disruption Tolerant Mesh Networks] autonomous machine controller in mesh nodes operate despite loss of cloud connectivity.\n\n[[Category:Mesh networking| ]]\n[[Category:Network topology]]",
