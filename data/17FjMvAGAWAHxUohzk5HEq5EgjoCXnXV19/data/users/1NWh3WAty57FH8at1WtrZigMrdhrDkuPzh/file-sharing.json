File sharing may be achieved in a number of ways. Common methods of [[Computer data storage|storage]], [[Data transmission|transmission]] and dispersion include manual sharing utilizing removable media, centralized servers on [[computer network]]s, World Wide Web-based [[hyperlink]]ed documents, and the use of distributed [[peer-to-peer]] networking.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Peer-to-peer file sharing===\n[[Peer-to-peer file sharing]] is based on the [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) application architecture. [[Shared resource|Shared files]] on the computers of other [[User (system)|users]] are indexed on directory servers. P2P technology was used by popular services like [[Napster]], [[Spotify]], and [[Infinit (file transfer)|Infinit]]. The most popular protocol for P2P sharing is [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]].\n\n===File sync and sharing services===\n[[Cloud computing|Cloud-based]] [[file synchronization|file syncing and sharing]] services implement automated file transfers by updating files from a dedicated sharing directory on each user's networked devices. Files placed in this folder also are typically accessible through a website and mobile app, and can be easily shared with other users for viewing or collaboration. Such services have become popular via consumer-oriented [[file hosting service]]s such as [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] and [[Google Drive]].\n\n[[rsync]] is a more traditional program released in 1996 which synchronizes files on a direct machine-to-machine basis.\n\n[[Data synchronization]] in general can use other approaches to share files, such as [[distributed filesystem]]s, [[version control]], or [[Web mirror|mirrors]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|File sharing timeline}}\n<!-- pre-1999 -->Files were first exchanged on [[removable media]]. Computers were able to access remote files using [[filesystem]] mounting, [[bulletin board systems]] (1978), [[Usenet]] (1979), and [[FTP]] servers (1985). [[Internet Relay Chat]] (1988) and [[Hotline Communications|Hotline]] (1997) enabled users to communicate remotely through [[online chat|chat]] and to exchange files. The [[mp3]] encoding, which was standardized in 1991 and substantially reduced the size of [[Audio file format|audio files]], grew to widespread use in the late 1990s. In 1998, [[MP3.com]] and [[Audiogalaxy]] were established, the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] was unanimously passed, and the first [[Portable media player|mp3 player]] devices were launched.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn June 1999, [[Napster]] was released as an unstructured centralized peer-to-peer system,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KeIENcC2BPwC&pg=PA532&lpg=PA532&dq=napster+first#PPA532,M1 |title=Reliable distributed systems: technologies, Web services, and applications - Kenneth P.

It is generally credited as being the first peer-to-peer file sharing system.\n\n[[Gnutella]], [[eDonkey2000]], and [[Freenet]] were released in 2000, as MP3.com and Napster were facing litigation. [[Gnutella]], released in March, was the first decentralized file sharing network. In the gnutella network, all connecting software was considered equal, and therefore the network had no [[Single point of failure|central point of failure]]. In July, [[Freenet]] was released and became the first anonymity network. In September the [[eDonkey2000]] client and server software was released.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn 2001, [[Kazaa]] and [[Poisoned]] for the Mac was released. Its [[FastTrack]] network was distributed, though unlike gnutella, it assigned more traffic to 'supernodes' to increase routing efficiency. The network was proprietary and encrypted, and the Kazaa team made substantial efforts to keep other clients such as [[Morpheus (computer program)|Morpheus]] off of the FastTrack network.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn July 2001, Napster was sued by several recording companies and lost in [[A&M Records, Inc. v.

Until its decline in 2004, Kazaa was the most popular file sharing program despite bundled [[malware]] and legal battles in the Netherlands, Australia, and the United States. In 2002, a Tokyo district court ruling shut down File Rogue, and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) filed a lawsuit that effectively shut down Audiogalaxy.\n\n[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Demonstrators protesting [[The Pirate Bay raid]] in 2006]]\n\nFrom 2002 through 2003, a number of [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] services were established, including [[Suprnova.org]], [[isoHunt]], [[TorrentSpy]], and [[The Pirate Bay]]. In 2002, the RIAA was filing lawsuits against Kazaa users. As a result of such lawsuits, many universities added file sharing regulations in their school administrative codes (though some students managed to circumvent them during after school hours). With the shutdown of eDonkey in 2005, eMule became the dominant client of the eDonkey network. In 2006, police raids took down the [[Razorback2]] eDonkey server and temporarily took down [[The Pirate Bay]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn 2009, the [[Pirate Bay trial]] ended in a guilty verdict for the primary founders of the tracker. The decision was appealed, leading to a second guilty verdict in November 2010. In October 2010, Limewire was forced to shut down following a court order in [[Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC]] but the gnutella network remains active through open source clients like [[Frostwire]] and [[gtk-gnutella]]. Furthermore, multi-protocol file sharing software such as [[MLDonkey]] and [[Shareaza]] adapted in order to support all the major file sharing protocols, so users no longer had to install and configure multiple file sharing programs.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nOn January 19, 2012, the [[United States Department of Justice]] shut down the popular domain of [[Megaupload]] (established 2005).

Content in the [[public domain]] can be freely shared. Even works covered by [[copyright]] can be shared under certain circumstances.
