In 19 of these countries the freedom of information legislation also applied to private bodies.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=211 & 223|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> Access to information was increasingly recognised as a prerequisite for transparency and accountability of governments, as facilitating consumers' ability to make informed choices, and as safeguarding citizens against mismanagement and corruption.

Privatisation and de-regulation saw banks, telecommunications companies, hospitals and universities being run by private entities, leading to demands for the extension of freedom of information legislation to cover private bodies.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=222|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Government bodies ===\nAs of 2006, 70 countries had comprehensive freedom of information legislation for public bodies, nearly half of which had been enacted in the past 10 years. Such legislation was pending in a further 50 countries.<ref name=\"Mazhar Siraj 2010 213\"/>\n\n=== Private bodies ===\nAs of 2006, the following 19 countries had freedom of information legislation that extended to government bodies and private bodies: [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Angola]], [[Armenia]], [[Colombia]], the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Panama]], [[Poland]], [[Peru]], [[South Africa]], [[Turkey]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Slovakia]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. The degree to which private bodies are covered under freedom of information legislation varies, in Angola, Armenia and Peru the legislation only applies to private companies that perform what are considered to be public functions. In the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Finland, Trinidad and Tobago, Slovakia, Poland and Iceland private bodies that receive public funding are subject to freedom of information legislation. Freedom of information legislation in Estonia, France and UK covers private bodies in certain sectors.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=223|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> In South Africa the access provisions of the Promotion of Access to Information Act have been used by individuals to establish why their loan application has been denied.

Access to information became regarded as a basic consumer right, and preventive disclosure, i.e. the disclosure of information on threats to human lives, health and safety, began to be emphasized.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=[[Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences]]|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=216|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==== Investors ====\nSecretive decision making by company directors and corporate scandal led to freedom of information legislation to be published for the benefits of investors. Such legislation was first adopted in Britain in the early 20th century, and later in North America and other countries.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=216–217|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> Disclosure regimes for the benefit of investors regained attention at the beginning of the 21st century as a number of corporate scandals were linked to accounting fraud and company director secrecy.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=219|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> Starting with Enron, the subsequent scandals involving [[Worldcom]], [[Tyco International|Tyco]], [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]] and [[Global Crossing]] prompted the [[US Congress]] to impose new information disclosure obligations on companies with the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] 2002.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=220|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Internet and information technology==\nFreedom of information (or information freedom) also refers to the protection of the right to [[freedom of expression]] with regard to the [[Internet]] and [[information technology]]. Freedom of information may also concern [[censorship]] in an information technology context, i.e. the ability to access [[Web content]], without [[censorship]] or [[digital rights|restrictions]].\n\n=== The Information Society and freedom of expression ===\nThe [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 reaffirms [[democracy]] and the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms. The Declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of the right to [[freedom of expression]] for the \"[[information society|Information Society]]\" in stating:\n<blockquote>We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the [[information society|Information Society]], and as outlined in Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], that everyone has the right to [[Freedom of speech|freedom of opinion and expression]]; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits the Information Society offers.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Klang | first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age | year = 2005| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=USksfqPjwhUC&dq=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights&cad=0| publisher = Routledge |page=1 }}</ref>  \n</blockquote>\n\nThe 2004 WSIS Declaration of Principles also acknowledged that \"it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources and technologies for criminal and terrorist purposes, while respecting human rights\".<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Klang | first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age | year = 2005| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=USksfqPjwhUC&dq=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights&cad=0| publisher = Routledge |page=2 }}</ref> Wolfgang Benedek comments that the WSIS Declaration only contains a number of references to human rights and does not spell out any procedures or mechanism to assure that human rights are considered in practice.<ref>{{cite book |title=Internet Governance and the Information Society |last=Benedek |first=Wolfgang |author2=Veronika  Bauer |author3=Matthias Kettemann  |year=2008 |publisher= Eleven International Publishing |location= |isbn=90-77596-56-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ie7Yqiw85TcC&vq=%22Internet+Bill+of+rights%22&dq=%22digital+rights%22+%22human+rights%22&cad=0 |page=36 }}</ref>\n\n=== Hacktivismo ===\n{{main|Hacktivismo}}\nThe [[digital rights]] group [[Hacktivismo]], founded in 1999, argues that access to information is a basic [[human right]]. The group's beliefs are described fully in the \"Hacktivismo Declaration\" which calls for the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) to be applied to the [[Internet]]. The Declaration recalls the duty of member states to the ICCPR to protect the right to [[freedom of expression]] with regard to the internet and in this context freedom of information.<ref name=autogenerated1>http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/declaration.html</ref> The Hacktivismo Declaration recognises \"the importance to fight against human rights abuses with respect to reasonable access to information on the Internet\" and calls upon the [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] community to \"study ways and means of circumventing state sponsored [[censorship]] of the internet\" and \"implement technologies to challenge information rights violations\". The Hacktivismo Declaration does, however, recognise that the right to [[freedom of expression]] is subject to limitations, stating \"we recognised the right of governments to forbid the publication of properly categorized [[state secrets]], [[child pornography]], and matters related to personal [[privacy]] and [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]], among other accepted restrictions.\" However, the Hacktivismo Declaration states \"but we oppose the use of state power to control access to the works of critics, [[intellectuals]], [[artists]], or religious figures.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n=== Global Network Initiative ===\nOn October 29, 2008 the [[Global Network Initiative]] (GNI) was founded upon its \"Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy\". The Initiative was launched in the 60th Anniversary year of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for [[human rights]] on [[freedom of expression]] and [[privacy]] set out in the UDHR, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR).<ref>[http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php Global Network Initiative, FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309234331/http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php |date=2009-03-09 }}</ref> Participants in the Initiative include the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], other major companies, human rights NGOs, investors, and academics.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/29/global20097.htm Internet Rights Protection Initiative Launches]\n</ref><ref>[http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/participants/index.php Global Network Initiative, Participants]</ref>\n\nAccording to reports [[Cisco Systems]] was invited to the initial discussions but didn't take part in the initiative. [[Harrington Investments]], which proposed that Cisco establish a human rights board, has dismissed the GNI as a voluntary code of conduct not having any impact. Chief executive John Harrington called the GNI \"meaningless noise\" and instead calls for bylaws to be introduced that force boards of directors to accept human rights responsibilities.<ref name=\"Glanville\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/17/censorship-internet |title=The big business of net censorship |last=Glanville  |first=Jo |date=17 November 2008 |publisher= The Guardian | location=London}}</ref>\n\n=== Internet censorship ===\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Internet police officer chacha.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Internet [[police officer]] [[Jingjing and Chacha|Chacha]], one of the [[cartoon]] [[mascots]] of the Internet Surveillance Division of the Public Security Bureau in [[Shenzhen]], [[China]].]] -->\n{{main|Internet censorship}}\nJo Glanville, editor of the [[Index on Censorship]], states that \"the internet has been a revolution for censorship as much as for free speech\".<ref name=\"Glanville\"/> The concept of freedom of information has emerged in response to state sponsored censorship, monitoring and surveillance of the internet.

The explosion of so much technology has brought information ethics to a forefront in ethical considerations.  Information transmission and literacy are essential concerns in establishing an ethical foundation that promotes fair, equitable, and responsible practices. Information ethics broadly examines issues related to ownership, access, privacy, security, and community.  It is also concerned with relational issues such as \"the relationship between information and the good of society, the relationship between information providers and the consumers of information\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Library and Information Center Management|last=Moran|first=Barbara A.|last2=Stueart|first2=Robert D.|last3=Morner|first3=Claudia J.|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=2013|isbn=|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=321|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nInformation technology affects common issues such as copyright protection, intellectual freedom, accountability, privacy, and security.

Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.\n\nPeers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts.<ref>Rüdiger Schollmeier, ''A Definition of Peer-to-Peer Networking for the Classification of Peer-to-Peer Architectures and Applications'', Proceedings of the First International Conference on Peer-to-Peer Computing, IEEE (2002).</ref>  Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional [[client-server]] model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided. Emerging collaborative P2P systems are going beyond the era of peers doing similar things while sharing resources, and are looking for diverse peers that can bring in unique resources and capabilities to a [[virtual community]] thereby empowering it to engage in greater tasks beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers, yet that are beneficial to all the peers.<ref name=CP2P>{{cite journal|last=Bandara|first=H.

The peer-to-peer movement allowed millions of Internet users to connect \"directly, forming groups and collaborating to become user-created search engines, virtual supercomputers, and filesystems.\" <ref name=\"Oram, A. 2001\">Oram, A.

The early Internet was more open than present day, where two machines connected to the Internet could send packets to each other without firewalls and other security measures.<ref name=\"Oram, A. 2001\" /> This contrasts to the [[broadcasting]]-like structure of the web as it has developed over the years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/1996/ppf.html |title=The World Wide Web: Past, Present and Future |first=Tim |last=Berners-Lee |date=August 1996 |accessdate=5 November 2011}} Is This \"Peer-to-Peer\" About?

Springer Berlin Heidelberg.</ref>  As a precursor to the Internet, [[Arpanet|ARPANET]] was a successful client-server network where \"every participating node could request and serve content.\"  However, [[Arpanet|ARPANET]] was not self-organized, and it lacked the ability to \"provide any means for context or content-based routing beyond 'simple' address-based routing.\"<ref name=\"Steinmetz, R. 2005 pp. 9-16\">Steinmetz, R., & Wehrle, K. (2005). 2. What Is This \"Peer-to-Peer\" About? (pp. 9-16). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.</ref>\n\nTherefore, a distributed messaging system that is often likened as an early peer-to-peer architecture was established: [[Usenet|USENET]]. [[Usenet|USENET]] was developed in 1979 and is a system that enforces a [[Decentralized computing|decentralized model]] of control. The basic model is a client-server model from the user or client perspective that offers a self-organizing approach to newsgroup servers.\nHowever, [[news server]]s communicate with one another as peers to propagate [[Usenet|Usenet news]] articles over the entire group of network servers. The same consideration applies to [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] email in the sense that the core email-relaying network of [[mail transfer agent]]s has a peer-to-peer character, while the periphery of [[e-mail client]]s and their direct connections is strictly a client-server relationship.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn May 1999, with millions more people on the Internet, [[Shawn Fanning]] introduced the music and file-sharing application called Napster.<ref name=\"Steinmetz, R. 2005 pp. 9-16\"/> Napster was the beginning of peer-to-peer networks, as we know them today, where \"participating users establish a virtual network, entirely independent from the physical network, without having to obey any administrative authorities or restrictions.\"<ref name=\"Steinmetz, R. 2005 pp. 9-16\" />\n\n==Architecture==\nA peer-to-peer network is designed around the notion of equal ''[[Peer group (computer networking)|peer]]'' nodes simultaneously functioning as both \"clients\" and \"servers\" to the other nodes on the network. This model of network arrangement differs from the [[client–server]] model where communication is usually to and from a central server. A typical example of a file transfer that uses the client-server model is the [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) service in which the client and server programs are distinct: the clients initiate the transfer, and the servers satisfy these requests.\n\n===Routing and resource discovery===\nPeer-to-peer networks generally implement some form of virtual [[overlay network]] on top of the physical network topology, where the nodes in the overlay form a [[subset]] of the nodes in the physical network. Data is still exchanged directly over the underlying [[TCP/IP]] network, but at the [[application layer]] peers are able to communicate with each other directly, via the logical overlay links (each of which corresponds to a path through the underlying physical network). Overlays are used for indexing and peer discovery, and make the P2P system independent from the physical network topology. Based on how the nodes are linked to each other within the overlay network, and how resources are indexed and located, we can classify networks as ''unstructured'' or ''structured'' (or as a hybrid between the two).<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Ahson |editor-first=Syed A. |editor2-last=Ilyas |editor2-first=Mohammad |title=SIP Handbook: Services, Technologies, and Security of Session Initiation Protocol |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2008 |isbn=9781420066043 |page=204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CKzPq3-wVdcC&pg=PA204}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Zhu |editor-first=Ce |title=Streaming Media Architectures: Techniques and Applications: Recent Advances |publisher=IGI Global |year=2010 |isbn=9781616928339 |page=265 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb4dWYVJ_8AC&pg=PA265 |display-editors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Kamel |first=Mina |chapter=Optimal Topology Design for Overlay Networks |editor-last=Akyildiz |editor-first=Ian F. |title=Networking 2007: Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks, Wireless Networks, Next Generation Internet: 6th International IFIP-TC6 Networking Conference, Atlanta, GA, USA, May 14-18, 2007 Proceedings|publisher=Springer |year=2007 |isbn=9783540726050 |page=714 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4V2G7yPLIAC&pg=PA714 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n====Unstructured networks====\n[[File:Unstructured peer-to-peer network diagram.png|thumb|right|300px|Overlay network diagram for an '''unstructured P2P network''', illustrating the ad hoc nature of the connections between nodes]]\n''Unstructured peer-to-peer networks'' do not impose a particular structure on the overlay network by design, but rather are formed by nodes that randomly form connections to each other.<ref>{{cite book |last=Filali |first=Imen |chapter=A Survey of Structured P2P Systems for RDF Data Storage and Retrieval |editor-last=Hameurlain |editor-first=Abdelkader |title=Transactions on Large-Scale Data- and Knowledge-Centered Systems III: Special Issue on Data and Knowledge Management in Grid and PSP Systems |publisher=Springer |year=2011 |isbn=9783642230738|page=21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjQr7BHtbCoC&pg=PA21 |display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}</ref> ([[Gnutella]], [[Gossip protocol|Gossip]], and [[Kazaa]] are examples of unstructured P2P protocols).<ref>{{cite book |last=Zulhasnine |first=Mohammed |chapter=P2P Streaming Over Cellular Networks: Issues, Challenges, and Opportunities |editor=Pathan |title=Building Next-Generation Converged Networks: Theory and Practice |publisher=CRC Press |year=2013 |isbn=9781466507616 |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tr5PGJk-swIC&pg=PA99 |display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n\nBecause there is no structure globally imposed upon them, unstructured networks are easy to build and allow for localized optimizations to different regions of the overlay.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chervenak |first=Ann |last2=Bharathi |first2=Shishir |chapter=Peer-to-peer Approaches to Grid Resource Discovery |editor-last=Danelutto |editor-first=Marco |title=Making Grids Work: Proceedings of the CoreGRID Workshop on Programming Models Grid and P2P System Architecture Grid Systems, Tools and Environments 12-13 June 2007, Heraklion, Crete, Greece|publisher=Springer |year=2008 |isbn=9780387784489 |page=67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=adN0pm_BBuYC&pg=PA67 |display-editors=etal}}</ref> Also, because the role of all peers in the network is the same, unstructured networks are highly robust in the face of high rates of \"churn\"—that is, when large numbers of peers are frequently joining and leaving the network.<ref name=\"Jin-Unstructured-2010\">{{cite book |last=Jin |first=Xing |last2=Chan |first2=S.-H.

In particular, when a peer wants to find a desired piece of data in the network, the search query must be flooded through the network to find as many peers as possible that share the data. Flooding causes a very high amount of signaling traffic in the network, uses more [[Cpu|CPU]]/memory (by requiring every peer to process all search queries), and does not ensure that search queries will always be resolved. Furthermore, since there is no [[correlation]] between a peer and the content managed by it, there is no guarantee that flooding will find a peer that has the desired data. Popular content is likely to be available at several peers and any peer searching for it is likely to find the same thing. But if a peer is looking for rare data shared by only a few other peers, then it is highly unlikely that search will be successful.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shen |first=Xuemin |last2=Yu |first2=Heather |last3=Buford |first3=John |last4=Akon |first4=Mursalin |title=Handbook of Peer-to-Peer Networking |publisher=Springer|edition=1st |year=2009 |location=New York |page=118 |isbn=0-387-09750-3}}</ref>\n\n====Structured networks====\n[[File:Structured (DHT) peer-to-peer network diagram.png|thumb|right|300px|Overlay network diagram for a '''structured P2P network''', using a [[distributed hash table]] (DHT) to identify and locate nodes/resources]]\n\nIn ''structured peer-to-peer networks'' the overlay is organized into a specific topology, and the protocol ensures that any node can efficiently<ref>Typically approximating [[Big O notation|O(log N)]], where N is the number of nodes in the P2P system{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}</ref> search the network for a file/resource, even if the resource is extremely rare.\n\nThe most common type of structured P2P networks implement a [[distributed hash table]] (DHT),<ref>Other design choices include overlay rings and d-Torus.

There are a variety of hybrid models, all of which make trade-offs between the centralized functionality provided by a structured server/client network and the node equality afforded by the pure peer-to-peer unstructured networks. Currently, hybrid models have better performance than either pure unstructured networks or pure structured networks because certain functions, such as searching, do require a centralized functionality but benefit from the decentralized aggregation of nodes provided by unstructured networks.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yang |first1=Beverly |last2=Garcia-Molina |first2=Hector |year=2001 |title=Comparing Hybrid Peer-to-Peer Systems |journal=Very Large Data Bases |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~byang/pubs/hybridp2p_long.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Security and trust===\nPeer-to-peer systems pose unique challenges from a [[computer security]] perspective.\n\nLike any other form of [[software]], P2P applications can contain [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]].

In both cases, the top three most common types of malware accounted for the large majority of cases (99% in Limewire, and 65% in OpenFT). Another study analyzing traffic on the [[Kazaa]] network found that 15% of the 500,000 file sample taken were infected by one or more of the 365 different [[computer viruses]] that were tested for.<ref>{{cite book |last=Goebel |first=Jan |chapter=Measurement and Analysis of Autonomous Spreading Malware in a University Environment |editor-last=Hämmerli |editor-first=Bernhard Markus |editor2-last=Sommer |editor2-first=Robin |title=Detection of Intrusions and Malware, and Vulnerability Assessment: 4th International Conference, DIMVA 2007 Lucerne, Switzerland, July 12-13, 2007 Proceedings |publisher=Springer |year=2007 |isbn=9783540736134 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M0PfEaVa9QIC&pg=PA112 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nCorrupted data can also be distributed on P2P networks by modifying files that are already being shared on the network. For example, on the [[FastTrack]] network, the [[RIAA]] managed to introduce faked chunks into downloads and downloaded files (mostly [[MP3]] files). Files infected with the RIAA virus were unusable afterwards and contained malicious code. The RIAA is also known to have uploaded fake music and movies to P2P networks in order to deter illegal file sharing.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/04/business/04MUSI.html |title=Software Bullet Is Sought to Kill Musical Piracy |last=Sorkin |first=Andrew Ross |date=4 May 2003 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> Consequently, the P2P networks of today have seen an enormous increase of their security and file verification mechanisms.

If one peer on the network fails to function properly, the whole network is not compromised or damaged. In contrast, in a typical client–server architecture, clients share only their demands with the system, but not their resources. In this case, as more clients join the system, fewer resources are available to serve each client, and if the central server fails, the entire network is taken down.\n\n===Distributed storage and search===\n[[File:Yacy-resultados.png|thumb|right|300px|Search results for the query \"[[software libre]]\", using [[YaCy]] a free [[distributed search engine]] that runs on a peer-to-peer network instead making requests to centralized index servers (like [[Google]], [[Yahoo]], and other corporate search engines)]]\nThere are both advantages and disadvantages in P2P networks related to the topic of data [[backup]], recovery, and availability. In a centralized network, the system administrators are the only forces controlling the availability of files being shared. If the administrators decide to no longer distribute a file, they simply have to remove it from their servers, and it will no longer be available to users. Along with leaving the users powerless in deciding what is distributed throughout the community, this makes the entire system vulnerable to threats and requests from the government and other large forces. For example, [[YouTube]] has been pressured by the RIAA, MPAA, and entertainment industry to filter out copyrighted content. Although server-client networks are able to monitor and manage content availability, they can have more stability in the availability of the content they choose to host. A client should not have trouble accessing obscure content that is being shared on a stable centralized network. P2P networks, however, are more unreliable in sharing unpopular files because sharing files in a P2P network requires that at least one node in the network has the requested data, and that node must be able to connect to the node requesting the data. This requirement is occasionally hard to meet because users may delete or stop sharing data at any point.<ref>{{cite journal |year=2003 |title=Looking up data in P2P systems |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=43–48 |publisher= |doi=10.1145/606272.606299 |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://www.nms.lcs.mit.edu/papers/p43-balakrishnan.pdf |accessdate=8 October 2013|last1=Balakrishnan |first1=Hari |last2=Kaashoek |first2=M.

Unpopular files will eventually disappear and become unavailable as more people stop sharing them. Popular files, however, will be highly and easily distributed. Popular files on a P2P network actually have more stability and availability than files on central networks. In a centralized network, a simple loss of connection between the server and clients is enough to cause a failure, but in P2P networks, the connections between every node must be lost in order to cause a data sharing failure. In a centralized system, the administrators are responsible for all data recovery and backups, while in P2P systems, each node requires its own backup system. Because of the lack of central authority in P2P networks, forces such as the recording industry, RIAA, MPAA, and the government are unable to delete or stop the sharing of content on P2P systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.p2pnews.net/2012/06/14/art-thou-a-peer/ |title=Art thou a Peer? |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=14 June 2012 |website=www.p2pnews.net |publisher= |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006022409/http://www.p2pnews.net/2012/06/14/art-thou-a-peer/ |archivedate=6 October 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n{{Prose|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Content delivery===\nIn P2P networks, clients both provide and use resources.

To establish criminal liability for the copyright infringement on peer-to-peer systems, the government must prove that the defendant infringed a copyright willingly for the purpose of personal financial gain or commercial advantage.<ref>Majoras, D.

Controversies have developed over the concern of illegitimate use of peer-to-peer networks regarding public safety and national security. When a file is downloaded through a peer-to-peer network, it is impossible to know who created the file or what users are connected to the network at a given time. Trustworthiness of sources is a potential security threat that can be seen with peer-to-peer systems.<ref>The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, (2008). Peer-to-peer network.

Internet service providers ([[Internet service provider|ISPs]]) have been known to throttle P2P file-sharing traffic due to its high-[[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] usage.<ref name=\"newteevee.com\">Janko Roettgers, 5 Ways to Test Whether your ISP throttles P2P, http://newteevee.com/2008/04/02/5-ways-to-test-if-your-isp-throttles-p2p/</ref> Compared to Web browsing, e-mail or many other uses of the internet, where data is only transferred in short intervals and relative small quantities, P2P file-sharing often consists of relatively heavy bandwidth usage due to ongoing file transfers and swarm/network coordination packets. In October 2007, [[Comcast]], one of the largest broadband Internet providers in the United States, started blocking P2P applications such as [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]. Their rationale was that P2P is mostly used to share illegal content, and their infrastructure is not designed for continuous, high-bandwidth traffic. Critics point out that P2P networking has legitimate legal uses, and that this is another way that large providers are trying to control use and content on the Internet, and direct people towards a [[client-server]]-based application architecture. The client-server model provides financial barriers-to-entry to small publishers and individuals, and can be less efficient for sharing large files. As a reaction to this [[bandwidth throttling]], several P2P applications started implementing protocol obfuscation, such as the [[BitTorrent protocol encryption]]. Techniques for achieving \"protocol obfuscation\" involves removing otherwise easily identifiable properties of protocols, such as deterministic byte sequences and packet sizes, by making the data look as if it were random.<ref name=\"breaking\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iis.se/docs/hjelmvik_breaking.pdf |format=PDF |title=Breaking and Improving Protocol Obfuscation |last1=Hjelmvik |first1=Erik |last2=John |first2=Wolfgang |date=2010-07-27 |issn=1652-926X }}</ref> The ISP's solution to the high bandwidth is [[P2P caching]], where an ISP stores the part of files most accessed by P2P clients in order to save access to the Internet.\n\n==Current research==\nResearchers have used computer simulations to aid in understanding and evaluating the complex behaviors of individuals within the network. \"Networking research often relies on simulation in order to test and evaluate new ideas.

Moreover, the number of valid private keys is so vast that it is extremely unlikely someone will compute a key-pair that is already in use and has funds. The vast number of valid private keys makes it unfeasible that brute force could be used for that.
