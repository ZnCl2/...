            "text": "\"'''Information wants to be free'''\" is an expression that means that people should be able to access information freely. It is often used by technology activists to criticize laws that limit transparency and general access to information. People who criticize [[Intellectual property#Criticisms|Intellectual Property]] law say the system of such government granted monopolies conflicts with the development of a public domain of information. The expression is often credited to [[Stewart Brand]], who was recorded saying it at a hackers conference in 1984.<ref name=\"R.

The right information in the right place just changes your life.  On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time.  So you have these two fighting against each other.<ref name = \"clarke\">{{citation | first = Roger | last = Clarke | title = Information Wants to be Free | url = http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/IWtbF.html}}.</ref>}}\n\nBrand's conference remarks are transcribed in the ''[[Whole Earth Review]]'' (May 1985, p.&nbsp;49) and a later form appears in his ''The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at MIT'':<ref>{{citation | authorlink = Stewart Brand | first = Stewart | last = Brand | title = The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at MIT | publisher = Viking Penguin | year = 1987 | ISBN = 0-14-009701-5 | page = 202}}.</ref>\n\n{{quote |Information Wants To Be Free.  Information also wants to be expensive.  ...That tension will not go away.<ref name=\"clarke\"/>}}\n\nAccording to historian Adrian Johns, the slogan expresses a view that had already been articulated in the mid-20th century by [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Michael Polanyi]] and [[Arnold Plant]], who advocated for the free communication of scientific knowledge, and specifically criticized the [[patent]] system. <ref>{{citation | last = Johns | first = Adrian | title = Piracy. The Intellectual Property Wars from Gutenberg to Gates | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | year = 2009 | ISBN = 978-0-226-40118-8 | page = 429 | quote = We still live amid the legacies of these mid-century debates about science and society. We inherit their terms, and the culture of science that shapes our world is the one left to us by them. If we think ‘information wants to be free,’ then we voice a sentiment championed by Wiener, Polanyi and Plant}}</ref>\n\n==''Gratis'' versus ''Libre''==\n{{Main|Gratis versus Libre}}\nThe various forms of the original statement are ambiguous: the slogan can be used to argue the benefits of propertied information, of liberated, free, and open information, or of both. It can be taken amorally as an expression of a fact of information-science: once information has passed to a new location outside of the source's control there is no way of ensuring it is not propagated further, and therefore will naturally tend towards a state where that information is widely distributed.  Much of its force is due to the [[pathetic fallacy|anthropomorphic metaphor]] that imputes desire to information.  In 1990 [[Richard Stallman]] restated the concept normatively, without the anthropomorphization:\n\n{{quote|I believe that all generally useful information should be free. By 'free' I am not referring to price, but rather to the freedom to copy the information and to adapt it to one's own uses... When information is generally useful, redistributing it makes humanity wealthier no matter who is distributing and no matter who is receiving.<ref name =\"denning\">{{citation | authorlink = Dorothy E.

The construction of the statement takes its meaning beyond the simple judgmental observation, \"Information ''should'' be free\" by acknowledging that the internal force or [[entelechy]] of information and knowledge makes it essentially incompatible with notions of [[proprietary software]], copyrights, patents, [[subscription service]]s, etc. They believe that information is dynamic, ever-growing and evolving and cannot be contained within (any) [[ideological]] structure.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAccording to this philosophy, [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]], [[Software cracking|cracker]]s, and [[phreaker]]s are liberators of information which is being held hostage by agents demanding money for its release. Other participants in this network include [[Cypherpunk|cypherpunks]] who educate people to use [[public-key cryptography]] to protect the privacy of their messages from corporate or governmental snooping and [[programmer]]s who write free software and [[open source]] [[code]]. Still others create [[Free-Net]]s allowing users to gain access to computer resources for which they would otherwise need an account. They might also break copyright law  by swapping music, movies, or other copyrighted materials over the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[Chelsea Manning]] is alleged to have said \"Information should be free\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/06/wikileaks-chat/ |title=‘I Can’t Believe What I’m Confessing to You’: The Wikileaks Chats |author=KEVIN POULSEN AND KIM ZETTER |work=Wired.com |date=6 October 2013 |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref> to [[Adrian Lamo]] when explaining a rationale for US government documents to be released to [[WikiLeaks]].
