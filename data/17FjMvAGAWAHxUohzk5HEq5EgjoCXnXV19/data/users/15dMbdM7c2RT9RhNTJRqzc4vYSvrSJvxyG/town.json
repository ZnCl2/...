Towns are generally larger than [[village]]s but smaller than [[city|cities]], though the criteria which constitute them vary considerably in different parts of the [[world]].\n\n== Origin and use ==\nThe word '''town''' shares an origin with the [[German language|German]] word ''Zaun'', the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''tuin'', and the [[Old Norse]] ''tun''. The German word ''Zaun'' comes closest to the original meaning of the word: a [[fence]] of any material. An early borrowing from [[Proto-Celtic language|Celtic]] *dunom (cf. [[Old Irish]] dun, [[Welsh language|Welsh]] din \"fortress, fortified place, camp,\" dinas \"city\").\n\nIn English and Dutch, the meaning of the word took on the sense of the space which these fences enclosed. In England, a town was a small community that could not afford or was not allowed to build walls or other larger fortifications, and built a [[palisade]] or stockade instead.  In the Netherlands, this space was a garden, more specifically those of the wealthy, which had a high fence or a wall around them (like the garden of palace [[Het Loo Palace|Het Loo]] in [[Apeldoorn]], which was the example for the privy garden of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] at [[Hampton Court]]). In Old Norse ''tun'' means a (grassy) place between farmhouses, and is still used in a similar meaning in modern Norwegian.\n\nIn [[Old English]] and Early and Middle [[Scots language|Scots]], the word ''ton'', ''toun'', etc. could refer to kinds of settlements as diverse as agricultural estates and holdings, partly picking up the Norse sense (as in the Scots word ''[[fermtoun]]'') at one end of the scale, to fortified municipality at the other. If there was any distinction between ''toun'' (fortified municipality) and ''burgh'' (unfortified municipality) as claimed by some{{Who|date=March 2011}}, it did not last in practice as ''burghs'' and ''touns'' developed. For example, \"Edina Burgh\" or \"Edinburgh\" (called a city today) was built around a fort and eventually came to have a defensive wall.\n\nIn some cases, \"town\" is an alternate name for \"city\" or \"village\" (especially a larger village). Sometimes, the word \"town\" is short for \"township\". In general, today towns can be differentiated from [[township]]s, [[village]]s, or [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s on the basis of their economic character, in that most of a town's population will tend to derive their living from manufacturing [[industry]], [[commerce]], and [[public service]]s rather than [[primary industry]] such as [[agriculture]] or related activities.\n\nA place's population size is not a reliable determinant of urban character. In many areas of the world, as in [[India]] at least until recent times, a large village might contain several times as many people as a small town. In the [[United Kingdom]], there are historical cities [[List of urban areas in England by population|that are far smaller]] than the larger towns.\n\nThe modern phenomenon of extensive [[suburb]]an growth, satellite urban development, and migration of city-dwellers to villages have further complicated the definition of towns, creating communities urban in their economic and cultural characteristics but lacking other characteristics of urban localities.\n\nSome forms of non-rural settlement, such as temporary [[mining]] locations, may be clearly non-rural, but have at best a questionable claim to be called a town.\n\nTowns often exist as distinct governmental units, with legally defined borders and some or all of the appurtenances of local government (e.g., a [[police]] force). In the United States these are referred to as \"incorporated towns\". In other cases the town lacks its own governance and is said to be \"unincorporated\". Note that the existence of an unincorporated town may be legally set forth through other means, as through zoning districts. In the case of some [[planned community|planned communities]], the town exists legally in the form of covenants on the properties within the town. The [[United States Census]] identifies many [[census-designated place]]s (CDPs) by the names of unincorporated towns which lie within them; however, those CDPs typically include [[rural]] and [[suburb]]an areas and even surrounding villages and other towns.\n\nThe distinction between a town and a city similarly depends on the approach: a city may strictly be an administrative entity which has been granted that designation by law, but in informal usage, the term is also used to denote an urban locality of a particular size or importance: whereas a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] city may have possessed as few as 10,000 inhabitants, today some{{who|date=November 2014}} consider an urban place of fewer than 100,000 as a town, even though there are many officially designated cities that are much smaller than that.\n\n== Age of towns scheme ==\nAustralian geographer [[Thomas Griffith Taylor]] proposed a classification of towns based on their age and pattern of [[land use]]. He identified five types of town:<ref>Goodall, B. (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.</ref>\n\n* ''Infantile towns'', with no clear [[zoning]]\n* ''Juvenile towns'', which have developed an area of [[Retailing|shop]]s\n* ''Adolescent towns'', where [[factory|factories]] have started to appear\n* ''Early mature towns'', with a separate area of [[social class|high-class]] [[house|housing]]\n* ''Mature towns'', with defined [[industry|industrial]], [[commerce|commercial]] and various types of [[residential area]]\n\n== By country ==\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nIn [[Afghanistan]], towns and cities are known as ''shār'' ([[Dari language|Dari]]: شهر, [[Pashto]]: ښار)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:687.raverty|title=A dictionary of the Puk'hto, Pus'hto, or language of the Afghans|website=dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref>. As the country is an historically rural society with few larger settlements, with major cities never holding more than a few hundred thousand inhabitants before the 2000s, the lingual tradition of the country does not discriminate between towns and cities.\n\n=== Albania ===\nIn [[Albania]] \"qytezë\" means town, which is very similar with the word for city (''\"qytet\"''). Although there is no official use of the term for any settlement. \nIn [[albanian language|Albanian]] \"qytezë\" means \"small city\" or \"new city\", while in ancient times \"small residential center within the walls of a castle\".\n\n=== Arab ===\nThe center is a population group, larger than a village, and smaller than a city.\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn [[Australia]], towns or \"urban centre localities\" are commonly understood to be those centers of population not formally declared to be cities and having a population in excess of about 200 people.<ref>\"The Australian\", December 13, 2012</ref>  Centers too small to be called towns are generally understood to be a [[Township#Australia|township]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn addition, some local government entities are officially styled as towns in [[Queensland]], [[Western Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]], and before the statewide amalgamations of the 1990s in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] some local government entities were styled as towns, but now towns are only [[Suburbs and localities (Australia)|localities]] that contain an urban centre with a population greater than 200.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Austria ===\n\nThe [[Austria]]n legal system does not distinguish between villages, towns, and cities. The country is partitioned into 2098 municipalities ({{lang-de|Gemeinden}}) of fundamentally equal rank. Larger municipalities are designated as market towns ({{lang-de|Marktgemeinden}}) or cities (''Städte''), but these distinctions are purely symbolic and do not confer additional legal responsibilities. There is a number of smaller communities that are labelled cities because they used to be regional population centers in the distant past. The city of [[Rattenberg]] for example has about 400 inhabitants. The city of [[Hardegg]] has about 1200 inhabitants, although the historic city core − Hardegg proper without what used to be the surrounding hamlets − is home to just 80 souls.\n\nThere are no unincorporated areas.\n\nOf the 201 cities in Austria, 15 are [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory cities]] (''Statutarstädte''). A statutory city is a city that is vested, in addition to its purview as a municipality, with the duties of a [[district (Austria)|district administrative authority]]. The status does not come with any additional autonomy: district administrative authorities are essentially just service centers that citizens use to interact with the national government, for example to apply for driver licenses or passports. The national government generally uses the provinces to run these points of contact on its behalf; in the case of statutory cities, the municipality gets to step up.\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Bulgaria}}\n\nBulgarians do not, in general, differentiate between 'city' and 'town'. However, in everyday language and media the terms \"large towns\" and \"small towns\" are in use. Usually \"large towns\" refers to Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna and Burgas or sometimes to all 28 oblast cities.\nIn [[Bulgaria]] the [[Council of Ministers of Bulgaria|Council of Ministers]] defines what constitutes a settlement, while the [[President of Bulgaria]] grants each settlement its title. In 2005 the requirement that villages that wish to classify themselves as town must have a social and technical infrastructure, as well as a population of no fewer than 3500 people. For resort settlements the requirements are lower with the population needing to be no fewer than 1000 people but infrastructure requirements remain.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{Main|List of towns in Canada|Municipal government in Canada}}\nThe legal definition of a town in [[Canada]] varies by [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province or territory]], as each has jurisdiction over defining and legislating towns, cities and other types of municipal organization within its own boundaries.\n\nThe province of [[Quebec]] is unique in that it makes no distinction under law between towns and cities. There is no intermediate level in French between ''village'' and ''ville'' (''municipality'' is an administrative term usually applied to a legal, not geographical entity), so both are combined under the single legal status of ''[[ville]]''. While an informal preference may exist among English speakers as to whether any individual ''ville'' is commonly referred to as a city or as a town, no distinction and no objective legal criteria exist to make such a distinction under law.\n\n=== Chile ===\nIn [[Chile]], towns (Spanish: ''pueblos'') are defined by the National Statistics Institute (INE) as an urban entity with a population from 2001 to 5000 or an area with a population from 1001 to 2000 and an established economic activity.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nIn the Czech Republic, the word ''město'' (city) is used for very wide variety of municipalities, ranging from [[Prague]], the largest and capital city with approximately 1.2 million inhabitants, to the smallest, [[Přebuz]], with just 74 inhabitants.  Technically, a municipality must have at least 3,000 inhabitants to be granted the ''město'' title, although many smaller municipalities,  especially some former mining towns, retain the title ''město'' for historic reasons.  Currently, approximately 192 of the 592 ''města'' have less than 3,000 inhabitants.\n\nSome municipalities have been amalgamated together, such that the whole is considered as a ''město''.\n\n[[Statutory city (Czech Republic)|Statutory cities]] (''statutární město''), which are defined by law no. 128/2000 Coll.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-128 |title=Consolidated version of Law no. 128/200 Coll |publisher=Zakonyprolidi.cz |date=2000-05-15 |accessdate=2018-04-18}}</ref> can define their own self-governing municipal districts.. There are 25 such cities, in addition to [[Prague]], which is a ''de facto'' statutory city.\n\nIn 2006, the legal concept of a town (''[[městys]]'', or formerly ''městečko'') was reintroduced. Currently, around 213 municipalities hold the title ''městys''.\n\nMunicipalities which do not qualify as a ''město'' or a ''městys'' default to the title of ''obec'' (a municipality) or, unofficially, a ''vesnice'' (village), even though they may consist of one or more villages.\n\n=== Denmark ===\nIn [[Denmark]], in many contexts no distinction is made between \"city\", \"town\" and \"village\"; all three translate as \"by\". In more specific use, for small villages and [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]] the word \"landsby\" (meaning \"country town\") is used, while the Danish equivalent of English \"city\" is \"storby\" (meaning \"large town\"). For formal purposes, [[urban area]]s having at least 200 inhabitants are counted as \"by\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/Vejviser/dokumentation/Varedeklarationer/emnegruppe/emne.aspx?sysrid=000766 |title=Byopgørelsen pr. 1. januar – Varedeklaration – Danmarks Statistik |publisher=Dst.dk |date=2005-03-22 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>\n\nHistorically some towns held various privileges, the most important of which was the right to hold market. They were administered separately from the rural areas in both fiscal, military and legal matters. Such towns are known as \"købstad\" (roughly the same meaning as \"borough\" albeit deriving from a different etymology) and they retain the exclusive right to the title even after the last vestiges of their privileges vanished through the reform of the local administration carried through in 1970.\n\n===Estonia===\nIn [[Estonia]], there is no distinction between a town and a city as the word ''linn'' is used for both bigger and smaller settlements, which are bigger than villages and boroughs. There are 30 [[Municipalities of Estonia|municipal towns]] (''omavalitsuslik linn'') in Estonia and a [[List of cities and towns in Estonia|further 17 towns]], which have merged with a municipal parish (''vallasisene linn'').\n\n[[File:Salins les Bains 2.JPG|thumb|The town of [[Salins-les-Bains]], [[France]]]]\n\n=== France ===\nFrom an administrative standpoint, the smallest level of local authorities are all called [[Communes of France|\"communes\"]]. However, some laws do treat these authorities differently based on the population and different rules apply to the three big cities [[Paris]], [[Lyon]] and [[Marseille]]. For historical reasons, six communes in the [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]] département exist as independent entities despite having no inhabitant at all.\n\nFor statistical purposes, the national statistical institute ([[INSEE]]) operates a distinction between urban areas with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants and bigger communes, the latter being called \"villes\". Smaller settlements are usually called \"villages\". The French term for \"town\" is \"[[:fr:Bourg|bourg]]\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}  but in fact, the French laws do not really distinguish between towns and cities which are all commonly called \"villes\".\n\n[[File:Putbus (2011-05-21) 14.JPG|thumb|[[Putbus]] on [[Rügen|Rügen Island]], Germany]]\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Germany}}\n\n[[Germany|Germans]] do not, in general, differentiate between 'city' and 'town'. The German word for both is ''Stadt'' as it is in many other languages that do not make any difference between the Anglo-Saxon concepts. However, the International Statistics Conference of 1887 defined different sizes of ''Stadt'', based on their population size, as follows: ''Landstadt'' (\"country town\"; under 5,000), ''Kleinstadt'' (\"small town\"; 5,000 to under 20,000), ''Mittelstadt'' (\"middle town\"; between 20,000 and 100,000) and ''Großstadt'' (\"large town\"; over 100,000).<ref>Universität Dortmund: [http://www.raumplanung.uni-dortmund.de/srp/web/dokumente/downloads/64_SRPapers%20Nr.1.pdf Kleine und mittlere Städte – Blaupausen der Großstadt?], Dokumentation des Expertenkolloquiums am 29. April 2004 in Dortmund</ref> The term ''Großstadt'' may be translated as \"city\". In addition, Germans may speak of ''Millionenstadt'', a city with over one million inhabitants (such as [[Munich]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Berlin]]).\n\nIn Germany also the historical importance, the centrality and the population density of an urban place might be taken as characteristics of a 'city'. Many settlements became a ''Stadt'' by being awarded a [[Town privileges|''Stadtrecht'']] in medieval times already. The word for a 'village', as a smaller settlement, is ''Dorf''. The current local government organization is subject to state law of a [[States of Germany|state]] and the related denomination of a specific settlement may differ from its common designation (e.g. Samtgemeinde – a legal term in Lower Saxony for a group of villages [Dorf, pl. Dörfer] with common local government, united from single municipalities [Gemeinde, pl. Gemeinden]).\n\nDesignations in different states are as diverse as for example in Australian States and Territories and differ from state to state. In some German states, the words ''Markt'' (\"market\"), ''Marktflecken'' (both used in southern Germany) or ''Flecken'' (\"spot\"; northern Germany e.g. in [[Lower Saxony]]) designate a town-like residential community between ''Gemeinde'' and ''Stadt'' with special importance to its outer conurbation area. Historically those had ''Marktrecht'' (market right) but not full town privileges; see [[Market town]].\n\n=== Greece and Cyprus ===\nIn written speech, [[Greeks]] use the word πόλη (póli) to express 'city' and the word κωμόπολη (komópoli) to express 'town', both with a feminine [[grammatical gender]]. For Greeks, a town (komópoli) is a human settlement with a population of 2,000–9,999. If a settlement has a lower population, it is considered a [[village]] (''χωριό'', chorjó). For the cities, Greeks, use the word 'póli', whereas for bigger cities with a population above 1 million, they usually use another name, ''μητρόπολη''  (mitrópoli), in English [[Metropolis]]. In the Greek speaking world (Greece and Cyprus) only [[Athens]] and [[Salonica]] can be described as \"metropoleis\".\n\nIn spoken speech, Greeks use the word for village to refer both to villages and towns and the word for city to refer to both cities and metropoleis.\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Hong Kong#Towns|l1=List of cities and towns in Hong Kong}}\n[[File:ShatinTownHall 20070529.jpg|thumb|Nearly every town in Hong Kong has its own town hall. The picture shows the [[Sha Tin Town Hall]] in the town of [[Sha Tin]].]]\n\n[[Hong Kong]] started developing new towns in the 1950s, to accommodate exponential population increase. The very first new towns included [[Tsuen Wan New Town|Tsuen Wan]] and [[Kwun Tong]]. In the late 1960s and the 1970s, another stage of new town developments was launched. Nine new towns have been developed so far. Land use is carefully planned and development provides plenty of room for public housing projects. Rail transport is usually available at a later stage. The first towns are [[Sha Tin New Town|Sha Tin]], [[Tsuen Wan New Town|Tsuen Wan]], [[Tuen Mun New Town|Tuen Mun]] and [[Tseung Kwan O]]. [[Tuen Mun New Town|Tuen Mun]] was intended to be self-reliant, but was not successful and turned into a [[bedroom community]] like the other new towns. More recent developments are [[Tin Shui Wai New Town|Tin Shui Wai]] and [[North Lantau New Town|North Lantau (Tung Chung-Tai Ho)]].\n\n=== Hungary ===\nIn [[Hungary]] there is no official distinction between a city and a town (the word for both in Hungarian is: város). Nevertheless, the expressions formed by adding the adjectives \"kis\" (small) and \"nagy\" (large) to the beginning of the root word (e.g. \"nagyváros\") have been normalized to differentiate between cities and towns (towns being smaller, therefore bearing the name \"kisváros\".) In Hungary, a village can gain the status of \"város\" (town), if it meets a set of diverse conditions for quality of life and development of certain public services and utilities (e.g. having a local secondary school or installing full-area sewage collection pipe network). Every year the Minister of Internal Affairs selects candidates from a committee-screened list of applicants, whom the President of Republic usually affirms by issuing a bill of town's rank to them. Since being a town carries extra fiscal support from the government, many relatively small villages try to win the status of \"városi rang\" nowadays.\n\nBefore the [[fall of communism]] in 1990, Hungarian villages with fewer than 10,000 residents were not allowed to become towns. Recently some settlements as small as 2,500 souls have received the rank of town (e.g. Visegrád, Zalakaros or Gönc) and meeting the conditions of development is often disregarded to quickly elevate larger villages into towns. As of middle 2013, there are 346 towns in Hungary, encompassing some 69% of the entire population.\n\nTowns of more than 50,000 people are able to gain the status of \"megyei jogú város\" (town with the rights of a [[county]]), which allows them to maintain a higher degree of [[Public service|services]]. (There are a few exceptions, when towns of fewer than 50,000 people gained the status: [[Érd]], [[Hódmezővásárhely]], [[Salgótarján]] and [[Szekszárd]])<ref>[http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/idoszaki/regiok/veszpremmjv10.pdf Megyei jogú városok] – essay of [[Hungarian Central Statistical Office]] (Hungarian, July 2012)</ref> As of middle 2013, there are only 23 such towns in Hungary.<ref>[http://www.terport.hu/telepulesek/telepulestipusok/megyei-jogu-varosok/magyarorszag-megyei-jogu-varosai \"Magyarország megyei jogú városai\"] – list of Hungarian town with the rights of a county on \"Térport\" related webpage of Ministry of National Development (Hungarian, access date: May 4, 2013.)</ref>\n\n=== Iceland ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Iceland}}\n\n=== Ireland ===\n{{Main|List of populated places in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\nThe '''Local Government act 2001''' provides that from January 1, 2002 (section 10 subsection (3)\n''Within the county in which they are situated and of which they form part, there continue to be such other local government areas as are set out in Schedule 6 which – (a) in the case of the areas set out in Chapter 1 of Part 1 of that Schedule, shall be known as boroughs, and – (b) in the case of the areas set out in Chapter 2 of Part 1 and Part 2 of that Schedule, shall be known as towns, and in this Act a reference to a town shall include a reference to a borough.''\n\nThese provisions affect the replacement of the boroughs, Towns and urban districts which existed before then. Similar reforms in the nomenclature of local authorities ( but not their functions) are effected by section 11 part 17 of the act includes provision (section 185(2))\n''Qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census or such other figure as the Minister may from time to time prescribe by regulations, and not having a [[town council]], may make a proposal in accordance with paragraph (b) for the establishment of such a council''\nand contains provisions enabling the establishment of new town councils and provisions enabling the dissolution of existing or new town councils in certain circumstances\n\nThe reference to ''town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census'' hands much of the power relating to defining what is in fact a town over to the Central Statistics Office and their criteria are published as part of each census.\n\n;Planning and Development Act 2000\nAnother reference to the Census and its role in determining what is or is not a town for some administrative purpose is in the Planning and Development act 2000 (part II chapter I which provides for Local area plans)\n\n''A local area plan shall be made in respect of an area which —(i) is designated as a town in the most recent census of population, other than a town designated as a suburb or environs in that census, (ii) has a population in excess of 2,000, and (iii) is situated within the functional area of a planning authority which is a county council.''\n\n;Central Statistics Office criteria\nThese are set out in full at [http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census_2006_Appendices.pdf 2006 Census Appendices].\n\nIn short they speak of \"towns with legally defined boundaries\" ( i.e. those established by the Local Government Act 2001) and the remaining 664 as \"census towns\", defined by themselves since 1971 as ''a cluster of 50 or more occupied dwellings in which within a distance of 800 meters there is a nucleus of 30 occupied houses on both sides of the road or twenty occupied houses on one side of the road'' there is also a ''200 meter criterion'' for determining whether a house is part of a census town.\n\n=== India ===\n[[File:One of the high streets in Paravur.jpg|right|thumb|A street in [[Paravur, Kollam|Paravur]] town, India]]\nThe [[2011 Census of India]] defines towns of two types: statutory town and [[census town]]. Statutory town is defined as all places with a [[municipality]], [[Municipal corporation|corporation]], [[Cantonment Board|cantonment board]] or notified town area committee. Census towns are defined as places that satisfy the following criteria:\n# Minimum population of 5,000\n# At least 75% of male working population engaged in non-agricultural pursuits\n# Density of population at least 400/km<sup>2</sup>. (1,000 per sq. mile).\n\nAll the statutory towns, census towns and [[out growth]]s are considered as urban settlements, as opposed to rural areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Some Concepts and Definitions|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/kerala/13-concept-34.pdf|publisher=Census of India|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Iran ===\nIn contemporary [[Persian language|Persian]] texts, no distinction is made between \"city\" and \"town\"; both translate as \"Shahr\" (شهر). In older Persian texts (until the first half of the 20th century), the Arabic word \"Qasabeh\" (قصبه) was used for a town. However, in recent 50 years, this word has become obsolete.\n\nThere is a word in Persian which is used for special sort of satellite townships and city neighborhoods. It is ''Shahrak'' (شهرک), (lit.: small city).\nAnother smaller type of town or [[neighborhood]] in a big city is called ''Kuy'' (کوی). ''Shahrak'' and ''Kuy'' each have their different legal definitions.\nLarge cities such as [[Tehran]], [[Mashhad]], [[Isfahan]], [[Tabriz]], etc. which have millions of populations are referred to as ''Kalan-shahr''کلان‌شهر ([[metropole]]).\n\nThe pace in which different large villages have gained city status in [[Iran]] shows a dramatic increase in the last two decades.\n\nBigger cities and towns usually are centers of a [[township]] (in Persian: ''Shahrestan'' (شهرستان). Shahrestan itself is a subdivision of ''Ostan'' استان (Province).\n\n=== Israel ===\n[[Modern Hebrew]] does provide a word for the concept of a town: ''Ayara'' (עיירה), derived from ''Ir'' (עיר), the biblical word for \"city\". However, the term \"Ayara\" is normally used only to describe towns in foreign countries, i.e. urban areas of limited population, particularly when the speaker is attempting to evoke nostalgic or romantic attitudes. The term is also used to describe a [[Shtetl]], a pre-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] [[Eastern Europe]]an Jewish town.\n\nWithin Israel, established urban areas are always referred to as cities (with one notable exception explained below) regardless of their actual size. Israeli law does not define any nomenclature for distinction between urban areas based on size or any other factor – meaning that all urban settlements in Israel are legally referred to as \"cities\".\n\nThe exception to the above is the term ''Ayeret Pituakh'' (עיירת פיתוח, lit. \"Development Town\") which is applied to certain cities in Israel based on the reasons for their establishment. These cities, created during the earlier decades of Israeli independence (1950s and 1960s, generally), were designed primarily to serve as commercial and transportation hubs, connecting smaller agricultural settlements in the northern and southern regions of the country (the \"Periphery\") to the major urban areas of the coastal and central regions. Some of these \"development towns\" have since grown to a comparatively large size, and yet are still referred to as \"development towns\", particularly when the speaker wishes to emphasize their (often low) socio-economic status. Nonetheless, they are rarely (if ever) referred to simply as \"towns\"; when referring to one directly, it will be either be called a \"development town\" or a \"city\", depending on context.\n\n=== Italy ===\nAlthough Italian provides different words for city (''città''), town (''paese'') and village (''villaggio'', old-fashioned, or ''[[frazione]]'', most common), no legal definitions exist as to how settlements must be classified. Administratively, both towns and cities are ruled as [[comuni]]/[[comune]]s, while villages might be subdivisions of the former. \nGenerally, in everyday's speech, a town is larger or more populated than a village and smaller than a city. Various cities and towns together may form a metropolitan area (''area metropolitana''). A city, can also be a culturally, economically or politically prominent community with respect to surrounding towns. Moreover, a city can be such by [[President of Italy|Presidential]] decree. A town, in contrast, can be an inhabited place which would elsewhere be styled a city, but has not received any official recognition.\nRemarkable exceptions do exist: for instance, [[Bassano del Grappa]], was given the status of \"città\" in 1760 by [[Francesco Loredan]]'s [[Doge|dogal]] decree and has since then carried this title. Also, the Italian word for town (''paese'' with lowercase P) must not be confused with the Italian word for country/nation (''Paese'' usually with uppercase P).\n\n=== Japan ===\nIn Japan city status (''[[Cities of Japan|shi]]'') was traditionally reserved for only a few particularly large settlements. Over time however the necessary conditions to be a city have been watered down and today the only loose rules that apply are having a population over 50,000 and over 60% of the population in a \"city centre\". In recent times many small villages and towns have merged in order to form a city despite seeming geographically to be just a collection of villages.\n\nThe distinction between towns (''[[Towns of Japan|machi/chō]]'') and villages (''[[Villages of Japan|mura/son]]'') is largely unwritten and purely one of population size when the settlement was founded with villages having under 10,000 and towns 10,000–50,000.\n\n=== Korea ===\n{{main|Eup (administrative division)}}\nIn both of South Korea and North Korea, towns are called ''[[Eup (administrative division)|eup]]'' (''읍'').\n\n=== Latvia ===\nIn [[Latvia]], towns and cities are indiscriminately called ''pilsēta'' in singular form. The name is a [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of two Latvian words: ''pils'' (castle) and ''sēta'' (fence), making it very obvious what is meant by the word – what is situated between the castle and the castle fence. However, a city can be called ''lielpilsēta'' in reference to its size. A village is called ''ciemats'' or ''ciems'' in Latvian.\n\n=== Lithuania ===\n{{main|List of towns in Lithuania}}\nIn [[Lithuania]]n,  a city is called ''[[:lt:miestas|miestas]]'', a town is called ''[[:lt:miestelis|miestelis]]'' (literally \"small ''miestas''). [[Metropolis]] is called ''[[:lt:didmiestis|didmiestis]]'' (literally \"big ''miestas'').\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nBefore 1848 there was a legal distinction between stad and non-stad parts of the country, but the word no longer has any legal significance. About 220 places got \"stadsrechten\" (city rights) and are still so called for historical and traditional reasons, though the word is also used for large urban areas that never got such rights. Because of this, in the [[Netherlands]], no distinction is made between \"city\" and \"town\"; both translate as \"stad\". A hamlet (\"gehucht\") usually has fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, a village (\"dorp\") ranges from 1,000 up to 25,000 inhabitants, and anything above the latter can call itself either village or city, mostly depending on historic reasons or size of the place. As an example: a large city like [[The Hague]] never gained city rights, but because of its size - more than half a million inhabitants - it is regarded as such. [[Staverden]], with only 40 inhabitants would be a hamlet, but because of city rights it may call itself a city.\n\nFor statistical reasons, the Netherlands has three sorts of cities:\n* \"kleine stad\" (small-sized cities): 50,000 — 99,999 inhabitants\n* \"middelgrote stad\" (medium-sized cities): 100,000 — 249,999 inhabitants\n* \"grote stad\" (big, or large cities): 250,000 and more\n\nOnly [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] and [[Utrecht]] are regarded as \"grote stad\".\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nIn [[New Zealand]], a town is a built-up area that is not large enough to be considered a city. Historically, this definition corresponded to a population of between approximately 1,000 and 20,000. Towns have no independent legal existence, being administered simply as built-up parts of districts, or, in some cases, of cities.\n\nNew Zealand's towns vary greatly in size and importance, ranging from small rural service centres to significant regional centres such as [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] and [[Taupo]]. Typically, once a town reaches a population of somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 people, it will begin to be informally regarded as a city. One who regards a settlement as too small to be a town will typically call it a \"township\" or \"village.\"\n\n=== Norway ===\nIn [[Norway]], \"city\" and \"town\" both translate to \"[[By (city or town)|by]]\", even if a city may be referred to as \"storby\" (\"large town\"). They will all be part of and administered as a \"[[Municipalities of Norway|kommune]]\" (\"[[municipality]]\")\n\nIn the nordic countries a minimum of 200 people need to reside in the same geographic area, and in Norway the spacing between houses can in general not be further apart than 50 meters, if the settlement is to receive \"Town status\".\n\nNorway has had inland the northernmost city in the world: Hammerfest. Now the record is held by New Ålesund on the norwegian island Svalbard\n\n=== Philippines ===\n{{Main|List of cities and municipalities in the Philippines|Municipalities of the Philippines}}\nIn the [[Philippines]], the local official equivalent of the town is the [[Philippine municipality|municipality]] (Filipino ''bayan''). Every municipality, or town, in the country has a mayor and a vice mayor as well as local town officials. Philippine towns are composed of a number of villages and communities called ''[[barangays]]'' with one (or a few cluster of) ''barangay''(s) serving as the town center or ''[[poblacion]]'', and are juridically separate from [[Philippine city|cities]], which are typically larger and more populous (some smaller and less populated) than, and which political and economic status are above that of, towns.\n\nUnique in Philippine towns is that they have fixed budget, population and land requirements to become as such, i.e. from a ''barangay'', or a cluster of such, to a town, or to become cities, i.e. from town to a city. Respectively, examples of these are the town of [[Braulio E. Dujali, Davao del Norte|B.E. Dujali]] in [[Davao del Norte]] province, which was formed in 1998 from a cluster of 5 ''barangays'', and the city of [[El Salvador, Misamis Oriental|El Salvador]], which was converted from a town to a city in 2007. Each town in the Philippines was classified by its [[Municipalities of the Philippines#Income classification|annual income and budget]].\n\n=== Poland ===\n[[File:Zamość. Ratusz..jpg|thumb|right|[[Zamość]] in [[Poland]] is an example of a [[utopia]]n [[ideal town]]. It was declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1992]]\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Poland}}\n\nSimilarly to Germany and Sweden, in [[Poland]] there is no linguistic distinction between a city and a town. The word for both is ''Miasto'', as a form of settlement distinct from following: village (wieś), hamlet (przysiółek), settlement (osada), or colony (kolonia).  Town status is conferred by administrative decree, new towns are announced by the Government in a separate Bill effective from the first day of the year. Some settlements tend to remain villages even though they have a larger population than many smaller towns. Town may be called in diminutive way as \"Miasteczko\", what is colloquially used for localities with a few thousand residents. Such localities have usually a '''Mayor''' (Burmistrz) as a chief of town council.\n\nCities are the biggest localities, generally must be bigger than 100 thousand of residents, they are ruled by '''President''' (Prezydent) as a chief of City Council. There are bare a few (mainly historic or political) exemptions which have allowed towns lesser than 100 thousand of people, to obtain President title for their Mayors, and to become recognized as Cities that way. Just to name a few: [[Bolesławiec]], [[Gniezno]], [[Zamość]].\n\n=== Portugal ===\nLike other Iberian cultures, in [[Portugal]] there is a traditional distinction between towns (''[[:pt:Vila|vilas]]'') and cities (''[[:pt:Cidade|cidades]]''). Similarly, although these areas are not defined under the constitution, and have no political function (with associated organs), they are defined by law,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.povt.qren.pt/tempfiles/20080213151143moptc.pdf |title=Law n.º 11/82 (Lei das designações e determinação de categoria das povoações), of June, 2nd |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100608050009/http%3A//www.povt.qren.pt/tempfiles/20080213151143moptc.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-08 |df= }}</ref> and a town must have:\n* at least 3,000 inhabitants\n* at least half of these services: health unit, pharmacy, cultural centre, public transportation network, post office, commercial food and drinking establishments, primary school and/or bank office\nIn this context, the town or city is subordinate to the local authority ([[freguesia|civil parish]] or [[concelho|municipality]], in comparison to the North American context, where they have political functions. In special cases, some [[village]]s may be granted the status of town if they possess historical, cultural or architectonic importance.\n\nThe Portuguese urban settlements [[heraldry]] reflects the difference between towns and cities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/pt-_m.html#rules |title=Flags of the World |publisher=Crwflags.com |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref> with the [[coat of arms]] of a town bearing a crown with 4 towers, while the coat of arms of a city bears a crown with 5 towers. This difference between towns and cities is still in use in other Portuguese speaking countries, but in Brazil is no longer in use.\n\n=== Romania ===\n{{Main|List of cities and towns in Romania}}\n\nIn [[Romania]] there is no official distinction between a city and a town (the word for both in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is: ''oraş''). Cities and towns in Romania can have the status either of ''oraş'' [[municipiu]], conferred to large urban areas, or only ''oraş'' to smaller urban localities. Some settlements remain villages ([[Communes of Romania|communes]]) even though they have a larger population than other smaller towns.\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{Main|Types of inhabited localities in Russia}}\n\n[[File:moscow reutov.jpg|thumb|The town of [[Reutov]] is separated from the city of [[Moscow]] just by the [[Moscow Ring Road|MKAD]] highway]]\n\nUnlike [[English language|English]], the [[Russian language]] does not distinguish the terms \"city\" and \"town\"—both are translated as \"{{lang|ru|город}}\" (''gorod'').  Occasionally the term \"{{lang|ru|город}}\" is applied to [[urban-type settlement]]s as well, even though the status of those is not the same as that of a city/town proper.\n\nIn Russia, the criteria an inhabited locality needs to meet in order to be granted city/town (''gorod'') status vary in different [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]]. In general, to qualify for this status, an inhabited locality should have more than 12,000 inhabitants and the occupation of no less than 85% of inhabitants must be other than agriculture. However, inhabited localities which were previously granted the city/town status but no longer meet the criteria can still retain the status for historical reasons.\n\n===South Africa===\nIn South Africa the [[Afrikaans]] term \"[[Dorp (town)|Dorp]]\" is used interchangeably with the English equivalent of \"Town\". A \"town\" is a settlement that has a size that is smaller than that of a city.\n\n=== Spain ===\nIn [[Spain]], the equivalent of town would be ''villa,'' a population unit between a village (''pueblo)'' and a city ''(ciudad)'', and is not defined by the number of inhabitants, but by some historical rights and privileges dating from the Middle Ages, such as the right to hold a market or fair. For instance, while [[Madrid]] is technically a ''villa'', [[Barcelona]], with a smaller population, is known as a city.\n\n=== Sweden ===\n[[File:Övre Finngränd 7 Sta Maria 29 Visby Gotland.jpg|thumbnail|[[Visby]] is one of the most well-preserved former [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities in Sweden. Today it is the seat of [[Gotland Municipality]].]]\n{{See also|Stad (Sweden)|Köping}}\n\nThe [[Swedish language]] does not differentiate between towns and cities in the English sense of the words; both words are commonly translated as ''stad'', a term which has no legal significance today. The term ''tätort'' is used for an [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]] or a locality, which however is a statistical rather than an administrative concept and encompasses densely settled villages with only 200 inhabitants as well as the major cities. The word ''[[köping]]'' corresponds to an English ''[[market town]]'' ''(chipping)'' or German ''[[wikt:Markt|Markt]]'' but is mainly of historical significance, as the term is not used today and only survives in some [[toponym]]s. Some towns with names ending in ''-köping'' are cities with over 100 000 inhabitants today, e.g. [[Linköping]].\n\nBefore 1971, 132 larger [[Municipality|municipalities]] in [[Sweden]] enjoyed special royal charters as ''[[Stad (Sweden)|stad]]'' instead of ''[[kommun]]'' (which is similar to a US [[County (United States)|county]]). However, since 1971 all municipalities are officially defined as ''kommun'', thus making no legal difference between, for instance, [[Stockholm]] and a small countryside municipality. Every urban area that was a ''stad'' before 1971 is still often referred to as a ''stad'' in daily speech. Since the 1980s, 14 of these municipalities brand themselves as ''stad'' again, although this has no legal or administrative significance, as they still have refer to themselves as ''kommun'' in all legal documentation.\n\nFor statistical purposes, [[Statistics Sweden]] officially defines a ''stad'' as an [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]] of at least 10,000 inhabitants. In the [[Swedish language]] the term for a major city is ''storstad'' (literally \"big town\"), but there is no clear definition as to when a ''stad'' should be called a ''storstad''. Most Swedes would only call [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]] and [[Malmö]] ''storstäder'', i.e. \"major cities\", although [[Uppsala]] fulfills the definition of \"municipality with a population that exceeds 200 000 inhabitants\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/statistik/BE/LE0102/2002A01/LE0102_2002A01_BR_12_BE51ST0307.pdf |title=10 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-04-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Ukraine ===\n[[File:Богородчани, 4 державна пожежно-рятувальна частина у ДСНС України, 2.jpg|thumb|Fire station in town of [[Bohorodchany]]]]\nIn Ukraine the term ''town'' (''містечко'', ''mistechko'') existed from the Medieval period until 1925, when it was replaced by the [[Soviet regime]] with ''[[urban type settlement]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160829023834/http://ukrlit.org/slovnyk/%D0%BC%D1%96%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%BE Mistechko]. Public electronic dictionary of Ukrainian language (ukrlit.org)</ref> Historically, town in the Ukrainian lands was a smaller populated place that was chartered under the [[German town law]] and had a market square (see [[Market town]]). \nToday informally, town is also referred to [[City of district significance (Ukraine)|cities of district significance]], cities with small population, and former Jewish [[shtetl]]s.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{Main|City status in the United Kingdom}}\n\n==== England and Wales ====\n{{Main|List of urban areas in England by population|list of urban areas in Wales by population}}\n\n[[File:Rugby town centre.jpg|thumb|left|A traditional English town centre at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]]]\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]], a ''town'' traditionally was a settlement which had a charter to hold a [[Market (place)|market]] or [[fair]] and therefore became a \"[[market town]]\". Market towns were distinguished from villages in that they were the economic hub of a surrounding area, and were usually larger and had more facilities.\n\nIn parallel with popular usage, however, there are many technical and official definitions of what constitutes a town, to which various interested parties cling.\n\nIn modern official usage the term ''town'' is employed either for old market towns, or for settlements which have a [[town council]], or for settlements which elsewhere would be classed a city, but which do not have [[City status in the United Kingdom|the legal right]] to call themselves such. Any parish council can decide to describe itself as a town council, but this will usually only apply to the smallest \"towns\" (because larger towns will be larger than a single civil parish).\n\nNot all settlements which are commonly described as towns have a \"Town Council\" or \"Borough Council\". In fact, because of many successive changes to the structure of local government, there are now few large towns which are represented by a body closely related to their historic borough council. These days, a smaller town will usually be part of a local authority which covers several towns. And where a larger town '''is''' the seat of a local authority, the authority will usually cover a much wider area than the town itself (either a large rural hinterland, or several other, smaller towns).\n\nAdditionally, there are \"[[new town]]s\" which were created during the 20th century, such as [[Basildon]], [[Redditch]] and [[Telford]]. [[Milton Keynes]] was designed to be a \"new city\" but legally it is still a town despite its size.\n\nSome settlements which describe themselves as towns (e.g. [[Shipston-on-Stour]], [[Warwickshire]]) are smaller than some large villages (e.g. [[Kidlington]], [[Oxfordshire]]).\n\nThe status of a ''city'' is reserved for places that have [[Letters Patent]] entitling them to the name, historically associated with the possession of a cathedral. Some large municipalities (such as [[Northampton]] and [[Bournemouth]]) are legally [[borough]]s but not cities, whereas some cities are quite small — such as [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] or [[St David's]]. The city of [[Brighton and Hove]] was created from the two former towns and some surrounding villages, and within the city the correct term for the former distinct entities is somewhat unclear.\n\n[[File:Windhill.jpg|thumb|[[Bishop's Stortford]]]]\n\nIt appears that a city may become a town, though perhaps only through administrative error: [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester (Kent)]] has been a city for centuries but, when in 1998 the [[Medway]] district was created, a bureaucratic blunder meant that Rochester lost its official [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] and is now technically a town.\n\nIt is often thought that towns with [[cathedral|bishops' seats]] rank automatically as cities: however, [[Chelmsford]] was a town until 5 June 2012 despite being the seat of the [[diocese of Chelmsford]], created in 1914. [[St Asaph]], which is the seat of the [[diocese of St Asaph]], only became a city on 1 June 2012 though the diocese was founded in the mid sixth century. In reality, the pre-qualification of having a cathedral of the established [[Church of England]], and the formerly established [[Church in Wales]] or [[Church of Ireland]], ceased to apply from 1888.\n\nThe word ''town'' can also be used as a general term for urban areas, including cities and in a few cases, districts within cities. In this usage, a city is a type of town; a large one, with a certain status. For example, central [[Greater London]] is sometimes referred to colloquially as \"London town\". (The \"[[City of London]]\" is the historical nucleus, informally known as the \"Square Mile\", and is administratively separate from the rest of Greater London, while the [[City of Westminster]] is also technically a city and is also a [[London borough]].) [[Camden Town]] and [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] are districts of London, as [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] is a district of [[Edinburgh]] – actually the Georgian centre.\n\n==== Scotland ====\n{{Main|List of burghs in Scotland|List of towns and cities in Scotland by population}}\n\nA ''town'' in [[Scotland]] has no specific legal meaning and (especially in areas which were or are still [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking) can refer to a mere collection of buildings (e.g. a ''farm-town'' or in [[Scots language|Scots]] ''ferm-toun''), not all of which might be inhabited, or to an inhabited area of any size which is not otherwise described in terms such as [[city]], [[burgh]], etc. Many locations of greatly different size will be encountered with a name ending with ''-town'', ''-ton'', ''-toun'' etc. (or beginning with the Gaelic equivalent ''baile'' etc.).\n\nA [[burgh]] (pronounced ''burruh'') is the [[Scots language|Scots']] term for a town or a municipality. They were highly [[Autonomous area|autonomous]] units of [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] from at least the 12th century until their abolition in 1975, when a new [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|regional structure of local government]] was introduced across the country. Usually based upon a town, they had a [[municipal corporation]] and certain rights, such as a degree of [[self-governance]] and representation in the sovereign [[Parliament of Scotland]] adjourned in 1707.\n\nThe term no longer describes units of local government although various claims are made from time to time that the legislation used was not competent to change the status of the Royal Burghs described below. The status is now chiefly ceremonial but various functions have been inherited by current Councils (e.g. the application of various endowments providing for public benefit) which might only apply within the area previously served by a burgh; in consequence a burgh can still exist (if only as a defined geographical area) and might still be signed as such by the current local authority. It should be noted that the word 'burgh' is generally not used as a synonym for 'town' or 'city' in everyday speech, but is reserved mostly for government and administrative purposes.\n\nHistorically, the most important burghs were [[royal burgh]]s, followed by [[burgh of regality|burghs of regality]] and [[burgh of barony|burghs of barony]]. Some newer settlements were only designated as [[police burgh]]s from the 19th century onward, a classification which also applies to most of the older burghs.\n\n=== United States ===\n[[File:Wyatt-indiana-from-above.jpg|thumb|The tiny farming community of [[Wyatt, Indiana]]]]\n\nSince the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] largely leaves local-government organization to the individual [[U.S. state]]s, the definition (if any) of \"town\" varies widely from state to state.  In some states, the term \"town\" refers to an area of population distinct from others in some meaningful dimension, typically population or type of government. The characteristic that distinguishes a town from another type of populated place &mdash; a city, borough, village, or [[Civil township|township]], for example &mdash; differs from state to state. In some states, a town is an incorporated [[municipality]]; that is, one with a [[charter]] received from the state, similar to a city (see [[incorporated town]]), while in others, a town is unincorporated. In some instances, the term \"town\" refers to a small incorporated municipality of less than a population threshold specified by state statute, while in others a town can be significantly larger. Some states do not use the term \"town\" at all, while in others the term has no official meaning and is used informally to refer to a populated place, of any size, whether incorporated or unincorporated. In still other states, the words \"town\" and \"city\" are legally interchangeable.\n\nSmall town life has been a major theme in American literature, especially stories of rejection by young people leaving for the metropolis.<ref>Miles Orvell, ''The Death and Life of Main Street: Small Towns in American Memory, Space, and Community'' (University of North Carolina Press; 2012)</ref>\n\nSince the use of the term varies considerably by state, individual usages are presented in the following sections:\n\n====Alabama====\nIn [[Alabama]], the legal use of the terms \"town\" and \"city\" is based on population.  A municipality with a population of 2,000 or more is a city, while less than 2,000 is a town (Code of Alabama 1975, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130616104014/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/11-40-6.htm Section 11-40-6]).  For legislative purposes, municipalities are divided into eight classes based on population.  Class 8 includes all towns, plus cities with populations of less than 6,000 (Code of Alabama 1975, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130616104906/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/11-40-12.htm Section 11-40-12]).\n\n====Arizona====\n\nIn [[Arizona]], the terms \"town\" and \"city\" are largely interchangeable. A community may incorporate under either a town or a city organization with no regard to population or other restrictions according to Arizona law (see Arizona Revised Statutes, Title 9). Cities may function under slightly differing governmental systems, such as the option to organize a district system for city governments, but largely retain the same powers as towns. Arizona law also allows for the consolidation of neighboring towns and the unification of a city and a town, but makes no provision for the joining of two adjacent cities.\n\n====California====\nIn [[California]], the words \"town\" and \"city\" are synonymous by law (see Cal. Govt. Code Secs. 34500–34504). There are two types of cities in California: charter and general law. Cities organized as charter cities derive their authority from a charter that they draft and file with the state, and which, among other things, states the municipality's name as \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name).\" Government Code Sections 34500–34504 applies to cities organized as general law cities, which differ from charter cities in that they do not have charters but instead operate with the powers conferred them by the pertinent sections of the Government Code. Like charter cities, general law cities may incorporate as \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name).\"\n\nSome cities change their minds as to how they want to be called. The sign in front of the municipal offices in [[Los Gatos, California]], for example, reads \"City of Los Gatos\", but the words engraved on the building above the front entrance when the city hall was built read \"Town of Los Gatos.\" There are also signs at the municipal corporation limit, some of which welcome visitors to the \"City of Los Gatos\" while older, adjacent signs welcome people to the \"Town of Los Gatos.\" Meanwhile, the village does not exist in California as a municipal corporation. Instead, the word \"town\" is commonly used to indicate any unincorporated community that might otherwise be known as an unincorporated village. Additionally, some people may still use the word \"town\" as shorthand for \"township\", which is not an incorporated municipality but an administrative division of a county.\n\n====Hawaii====\n\nThe [[Hawaii]]an Island of [[Oahu]] has various communities that may be referred to as towns. However, the entire island is lumped as a single incorporated city, the City and County of [[Honolulu]]. The towns on Oahu are merely unincorporated [[census-designated place]]s.\n\n====Illinois====\nIn [[Illinois]], the word \"town\" has been used both to denote a subdivision of a county called a township,<ref>See the Township Code, 60 ILCS 1 et seq.</ref> and to denote a form of municipality similar to a [[village]], in that it is generally governed by a president and trustees rather than a mayor.<ref>See ''Phillips v. Town of Scales Mound'', 195 Ill. 353, 357, 63 N.E. 180 (1902)</ref> In some areas a \"Town\" may be incorporated legally as a Village (meaning it has at large Trustees) or a City (meaning it has aldermen from districts) and absorb the duties of the Township it is coterminous with (maintenance of birth records, certain welfare items). [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Berwyn, Illinois|Berwyn]] and [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]] are examples of Towns in this manner. Under the current Illinois Municipal Code, an incorporated or unincorporated town may choose to incorporate as a city or as a village, but other forms of incorporation are no longer allowed.<ref>''See generally'' Article 2 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/2‑1‑1 et seq.</ref>\n\n====Louisiana====\nIn [[Louisiana]] a \"town\" is defined as being a municipal government having a population of 1,001 to 4,999 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/gc021x2.pdf |title=Individual State Descriptions: 2002 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-04-18}}</ref>\n\n====Maryland====\n\nWhile a \"town\" is generally considered a smaller entity than a \"city\", the two terms are legally interchangeable in Maryland.  The only exception may be the [[Independent city]] of [[Baltimore]], which is a special case, as it was created by the [[Constitution of Maryland]].\n\n====Nevada====\n\nIn [[Nevada]], a town has a form of government, but is not considered to be incorporated. It generally provides a limited range of services, such as [[land use planning]] and recreation, while leaving most services to the county. Many communities have found this \"semi-incorporated\" status attractive; the state has only 20 incorporated [[List of cities in Nevada|cities]], and towns as large as [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]] (186,020 in 2000 Census), home of the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. Most [[county seat]]s are also towns, not cities.\n\n====New England====\n{{Main|New England town}}\n\nIn the six [[New England]] states, a [[New England town|town]] is a municipality and a more important unit than the [[county]]. In [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]] and 7 out of 14 counties in [[Massachusetts]], in fact, counties only exist as map divisions and have no legal functions; in the other three states, counties are primarily judicial districts, with other functions primarily in [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]], and [[Vermont]]. In all six, towns perform functions that in most states would be county functions. The defining feature of a New England town, as opposed to a city, is that a [[town meeting]] and a [[board of selectmen]] serve as the main form of government for a town, while cities are run by a mayor and a city council. For example, [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] is a town, even though it is fairly urban, because of its form of government.\n\n====New Jersey====\n{{Main|Town (New Jersey)}}\n\nA \"town\" in the context of New Jerseyan local government refers to one of five types and one of eleven forms of municipal government. While Town is often used as a shorthand to refer to a Township, the two are not the same. The Town Act of 1895 allowed any municipality or area with a population exceeding 5,000 to become a Town through a petition and referendum process. Under the 1895 Act, a newly incorporated town was divided into at least three wards, with two councilmen per ward serving staggered two-year terms, and one councilman at large, who also served a two-year term. The councilman at large served as chairman of the town council. The Town Act of 1988 completely revised the Town form of government and applied to all towns incorporated under the Town Act of 1895 and to those incorporated by a special charter granted by the Legislature prior to 1875.\n\nUnder the 1988 Act, the mayor is also the councilman at large, serving a term of two years, unless increased to three years by a petition and referendum process. The Council under the Town Act of 1988 consists of eight members serving staggered two-year terms with two elected from each of four wards. One councilman from each ward is up for election each year. Towns with different structures predating the 1988 Act may retain those features unless changed by a petition and referendum process. Two new provisions were added in 1991 to the statutes governing towns, First, a petition and referendum process was created whereby the voters can require that the mayor and town council be elected to four-year terms of office. The second new provision defines the election procedure in towns with wards. The mayor in a town chairs the town council and heads the municipal government. The mayor may both vote on legislation before council and veto ordinances. A veto may be overridden by a vote of two-thirds of all the members of the council. The council may enact an ordinance to delegate all or a portion of the executive responsibilities of the town to a municipal administrator. Fifteen New Jersey municipalities currently have a type of Town, nine of which operate under the town form of government.\n\n====New York====\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of New York#Town}}\nIn [[Administrative divisions of New York|New York]], a town is similarly a division of the county, but with less importance than in New England. Of some importance, a town provides a closer level of governance than its enclosing county, providing almost all municipal services to unincorporated communities, called [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlets]], and selected services to incorporated areas, called [[Village (New York)|villages]]. In New York, a town typically contains a number of such hamlets and villages. However, due to their independent nature, incorporated villages may exist in two towns or even two counties (example: [[Almond (village), New York]]). Everyone in New York who does not live on an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] reservation or a city lives in a town and possibly in one of the town's hamlets or villages. (There are no towns in the five counties – also known as [[Boroughs (New York City)|boroughs]] – that make up [[New York City]].) What is a \"town\" in New York is called a [[wiktionary:Township|township]] in some other states.\n\n====North Carolina====\nIn [[North Carolina]], all cities, towns, and villages are incorporated as [[List of municipalities in North Carolina|municipalities]]. According to the North Carolina League of Municipalities,<ref>North Carolina League of Municipalities: How Municipalities Work.  Web page.  Accessed February 14, 2012. http://www.nclm.org/resource-center/Pages/How-Municipalities-Work.aspx</ref> there is no legal distinction among a city, town, or village—it is a matter of preference of the local government.  Some North Carolina cities have populations as small as 1,000 residents, while some towns, such as [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], have populations of greater than 100,000.\n\n====Pennsylvania====\nIn [[Pennsylvania]], only one municipality is incorporated as a \"town\": [[Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania|Bloomsburg]]. Most of the rest of the state is incorporated as townships (there are also boroughs and cities), which function in much the same way as the towns of New York or New England, although they may have different forms of government.\n\n====Texas====\nIn [[Texas]], although some municipalities refer to themselves as \"towns\" or \"villages\", these names have no specific designation in Texas law; legally all incorporated places are considered [[List of municipalities in Texas|cities]].\n\n====Utah====\n{{see also|List of cities and towns in Utah}}\nIn [[Utah]], the legal use of the terms \"town\" and \"city\" is based on population. A municipality with a population of 1,000 or more is a city, while less than 1,000 is a town. In addition, cities are divided into five separate classes based on population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE10/htm/10_02_030100.htm|title=Utah Code, Title 10, Chapter 2, Section 301|publisher=Utah State Legislature|accessdate=May 11, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808233054/http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE10/htm/10_02_030100.htm|archivedate=August 8, 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n====Virginia====\n{{main|Administrative divisions of Virginia#Towns}}\nIn [[Virginia]], a town is an incorporated municipality similar to a city (though with a smaller required minimum population).  But while cities are by Virginia law independent of counties, towns are contained within counties.<ref>{{cite web  |author=[http://cfs.gmu.edu/bio/grymes_c.html Charles A. Grymes]  |url=http://virginiaplaces.org/vagupnova/countytowncity.html  |title=County vs. Town vs. City in Virginia  |accessdate=2011-05-31  |quote=Cities own and maintain their roads, while Virginia counties (except for Arlington and Henrico) rely upon [[Virginia Department of Transportation|VDOT]] for road maintenance. Cities get a fixed allocation of state funding for building and maintaining those roads, while counties must compete with each other and other VDOT priorities for a substantial portion of their road budget. Cities have been granted more authorities, such as the right of city councils to issue bonds to build roads without a voter referendum (counties must get voter approval in a referendum before issuing road bonds)... In Virginia, towns have distinct boundaries, established by the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]] or by courts guided by laws passed by the legislature. Towns are *not* independent from counties; residents of towns are still residents of the county in which the town is located. For example, residents of the four towns of [[Haymarket, Virginia|Haymarket]], [[Quantico, Virginia|Quantico]], [[Dumfries, Virginia|Dumfries]], and [[Occoquan, Virginia|Occoquan]] are also residents of [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]]. They pay both town and county property taxes, and town residents get to vote for a town council/mayor.  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620092601/http://virginiaplaces.org/vagupnova/countytowncity.html  |archivedate=2010-06-20  |df=  }}</ref>\n\n====Washington====\n{{Further|City government in Washington (state)}}\nA town in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] is a municipality that has a population of less than 1,500 at incorporation, however an existing town can reorganize as a code city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrsc.org/subjects/governance/locgov31.aspx |title=Classification of Washington Cities |publisher=Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington |accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref> Town government authority is limited relative to [[city (Washington)|cities]], the other main classification of municipalities in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrsc.org/subjects/management/forms/townandcodecity.aspx |title=A Comparison of the Powers of a Town and a Noncharter Code City |publisher=Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington |accessdate=December 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725204227/http://www.mrsc.org/Subjects/Management/forms/townandcodecity.aspx |archivedate=July 25, 2008 |df= }}</ref> {{As of|2012}}, most municipalities in Washington are cities. (See [[List of towns in Washington]].)\n\n====Wisconsin====\n{{main|Administrative divisions of Wisconsin}}\n[[Wisconsin]] has Towns which are areas outside of incorporated cities and villages. These Towns retain the name of the Civil Township from which they evolved and are often the same name as a neighboring City. Some Towns, especially those in urban areas, have services similar to those of incorporated Cities, such as police departments. These Towns will from time to time incorporate into Cities, such as [[Fox Crossing, Wisconsin|Fox Crossing]] in 2016 from the former town of [[Menasha (town), Wisconsin|Menasha]].<ref>http://www.town-menasha.com/town-of-menasha-incorporation-update/</ref> Often this is to protect against being annexed into neighboring cities and villages.\n\n====Wyoming====\n[[Wyoming]] statute indicates towns are incorporated municipalities with populations of less than 4,000. Municipalities of 4,000 or more residents are considered \"first-class cities\".\n\n=== Vietnam ===\nIn Vietnam, a [[District-level town (Vietnam)|district-level town]] ({{lang-vi|thị xã}}) is the second subdivision, below a province (''tỉnh'') or municipality (''thành phố trực thuộc trung ương'').
