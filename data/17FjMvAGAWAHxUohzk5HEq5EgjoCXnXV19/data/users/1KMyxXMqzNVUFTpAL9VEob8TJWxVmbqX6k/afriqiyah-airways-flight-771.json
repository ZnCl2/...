reported that preliminary investigations were complete. There was no evidence of any technical problems nor was there any fuel shortage. No technical or medical problems had been reported by the crew and they had not requested any assistance.<ref name=AH42b63b20/> Due to the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the investigation was being hampered, with the [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]] unable to get any response from the LYCAA. The data from the Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder had been extracted, and the results given to the LYCAA.\n\nOn 28 February 2013, the [[Libyan Civil Aviation Authority]] announced that they had determined that the cause of the crash was pilot error. [[Crew resource management]] lacked/was insufficient, [[Sensory illusions in aviation|sensory illusions]] and the first officer inputs to the aircraft [[Side-stick|side stick]] were a contributing factor in the crash. Also fatigue could have played a role in the accident.\n\nThe final report stated that the accident resulted from the pilots’ lack of a common action plan during the approach, the final approach being continued below the Minimum Decision Altitude without ground visual reference being acquired, the inappropriate application of flight control inputs during the go-around and after the activation of the Terrain Awareness and Warning System, and the flight crew’s lack of monitoring and controlling of the flight path.<ref name=Final>{{cite web |url=https://aviation-safety.net/investigation/reports/771/FINAL_5A-ONG-1.pdf |title=Final Report of AFRIQIYAH AIRWAYS Aircraft Airbus A320-232, 5A-ONG Crash Occurred at Tripoli (LIBYA) on 12/05/2010 |publisher=Libyan Civil Aviation Authority |date=February 2013 |accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Accident description ===\nThe flight crew did not acquire any visual ground references before the approach was started. The aircraft started its final descent for landing too early. The aircraft had descended to 280 feet above ground when the [[terrain awareness and warning system]] sounded in the cockpit. The captain ordered a [[go-around]] and the [[autopilot]] was turned off. The first officer put the nose of the aircraft up for 4 seconds and the thrust levers were set to go-around power. The aircraft pitched up to 12.3° nose up and the flight crew raised the landing gear and flaps. Shortly thereafter the co-pilot started making nose down inputs which caused the aircraft to pitch-attitude to reduce to 3.5° nose down. (The co-pilot could have been focused on the aircraft's speed, rather than its altitude.) The go-around pitch attitude was not maintained and the instructions from the flight director were not followed. (The report says that fatigue could have played a role in causing the first officer to focus solely on the airspeed.) The captain and the first officer were making inputs to the aircraft's side stick at the same time (although the dual inputs were not sufficient to trigger a dual-input warning). This action appears to be intended to provide assistance by the captain to fly the aircraft. This action led to confusion on who was flying the aircraft. The [[ground proximity warning system]] sounded as the aircraft lost more height and the co-pilot responded with a sharp nose-down input. Then the captain took control of the aircraft without warning, via the side stick priority button and maintained the nose-down input, while the first officer was simultaneously pulling back on his own side stick. Two seconds before impact with the ground the aircraft was at 180 feet. The captain was also pulling his side stick fully back, suggesting both pilots were aware of the aircraft's impending collision with the ground. However, the captain then pushed his control stick forward, causing the aircraft to descend again. Two seconds later, the aircraft crashed into the ground at high speed and exploded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/illusion-and-dual-control-led-to-afriqiyah-a330-crash-382873/|title=Illusion and dual control led to Afriqiyah A330 crash |work=[[Flightglobal]]|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.ly/finalReport/FINAL_5A-ONG-4.pdf|title=Final Report of AFRIQIYAH Airways Aircraft Airbus A330-202, 5A-ONG Crash Occurred at Tripoli (LIBYA) on 12/05/2010|work=[[Libyan Civil Aviation Authority]]|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reactions==\nAfriqiyah Airways issued a statement saying that relatives of the victims who wished to visit Libya would be transported and accommodated at Afriqiyah's expense.
