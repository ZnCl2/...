Also shown are its two real roots and global minimum over the same interval.]]\nIn mathematics, the '''graph''' of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' is, formally, the set of all [[ordered pair]]s {{nowrap|(''x'', ''f''(''x''))}}, and, in practice, the graphical representation of this set. If the function input ''x'' is a [[real number]], the graph is a [[two-dimensional graph]], and, for a [[continuous function]], is a [[curve]]. If the function input ''x'' is an ordered pair {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>)}} of real numbers, the graph is the collection of all [[ordered triple]]s {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>))}}, and for a continuous function is a [[Surface (topology)|surface]].\n\nThe concept of the graph of a function is generalized to the graph of a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]. \nTo test whether a graph of a relation represents a function of the first variable ''x'', one uses the [[vertical line test]]. To test whether a graph represents a function of the second variable ''y'', one uses the [[horizontal line test]]. If the function has an inverse, the graph of the inverse can be found by reflecting the graph of the original function over the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''}}.\n\nIn [[science]], [[engineering]], [[technology]], [[finance]], and other areas, graphs are tools used for many purposes. In the simplest case one variable is plotted as a function of another, typically using [[Rectangular coordinate system|rectangular axes]]; see ''[[Plot (graphics)]]'' for details.\n\nIn the modern [[foundations of mathematics]], and, typically, in [[set theory]], a function and its graph are the same thing.<ref name=\"Pinter2014\">{{cite book|author=Charles C Pinter|title=A Book of Set Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUT_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA49|year=2014|origyear=1971|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-79549-2|pages=49}}</ref> However, the concept of function is aimed to formalize the intuitive notion of \"mapping\", which is not directly apparent on the graph. Therefore, reasoning about functions is generally easier if a function is distinguished from its graphs, and if the graph is viewed as a graphical representation of the function. \n[[File:F(x) = x^3 − 9x.PNG|right|thumb|250px| Graph of the function {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>3</sup> − 9''x''}}]]\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Functions of one variable ===\n\n[[File:Three-dimensional graph.png|right|thumb|250px|Graph of the [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'', ''y'') = sin(''x''<sup>2</sup>) · cos(''y''<sup>2</sup>)}}.]]\n\nThe graph of the function.\n: <math>f(x)=\n        \\begin{cases}\n              a, & \\text{if }x=1, \\\\ d, & \\text{if }x=2, \\\\ c, & \\text{if }x=3, \n        \\end{cases}\n  </math>\nis\n: <math> \\{ (1,a), (2,d), (3,c) \\}. \\, </math>\n\nThe graph of the cubic polynomial on the [[real line]]\n\n: <math>f(x) = x^3 - 9x \\, </math>\n\nis\n\n: <math> \\{ (x, x^3 - 9x) : x \\text{ is a real number} \\}. \\, </math>\n\nIf this set is plotted on a Cartesian plane, the result is a curve (see figure).\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Functions of two variables ===\n\n[[File:F(x,y)=−((cosx)^2 + (cosy)^2)^2.PNG|thumb|250px|Plot of the graph of {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'', ''y'') = −(cos(''x''<sup>2</sup>) + cos(''y''<sup>2</sup>))<sup>2</sup>}}, also showing its gradient projected on the bottom plane.]]\n\nThe graph of the [[trigonometric function]]\n\n: <math> f(x,y) = \\sin(x^2)\\cos(y^2) \\, </math>\n\nis\n\n: <math> \\{ (x, y, \\sin(x^2) \\cos(y^2)) : x \\text{ and } y \\text{ are real numbers} \\}. </math>\n\nIf this set is plotted on a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions|three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system]], the result is a surface (see figure).\n\nOftentimes it is helpful to show with the graph, the gradient of the function and several level curves. The level curves can be mapped on the function surface or can be projected on the bottom plane.  The second figure shows such a drawing of the graph of the function:\n\n: <math> f(x,y) = -(\\cos(x^2) + \\cos(y^2))^2 \\, </math>\n\n=== Normal to a graph ===\nGiven a function ''f'' of ''n'' variables:  <math> x_1, \\dotsc, x_n </math>, the [[normal (geometry)|normal]] to the graph is\n\n: <math>(\\nabla f, -1) </math>\n\n(up to multiplication by a constant). This is seen by considering the graph as a [[level set]] of the function <math>g(x,z) = f(x) - z</math>, and using that <math>\\nabla g </math> is normal to the level sets.\n\n== Generalizations ==\n\nThe graph of a function is contained in a [[Cartesian product]] of sets. An X–Y plane is a cartesian product of two lines, called X and Y, while a cylinder is a cartesian product of a line and a circle, whose height, radius, and angle assign precise locations of the points. [[Fibre bundle]]s are not Cartesian products, but appear to be up close. There is a corresponding notion of a graph on a fibre bundle called a [[Section (fiber bundle)|section]].\n\n== Tools for plotting function graphs ==\n\n=== Hardware ===\n\n* [[Graphing calculator]]\n* [[Oscilloscope]]\n\n=== Software ===\nSee [[List of graphing software]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{colbegin||25em}}\n* [[Asymptote]]\n* [[Chart]]\n* [[Concave function]]\n* [[Convex function]]\n* [[Contour line|Contour plot]]\n* [[Critical point (mathematics)|Critical point]]\n* [[Derivative]]\n* [[Epigraph (mathematics)|Epigraph]]\n* [[Slope]]\n* [[Stationary point]]\n* [[Tetraview]]\n* [[Vertical translation]]\n* [[y-intercept]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Function plots}}\n* [http://pedritoclavito.netau.net/graphics2/graph.html Graph of function, derivative and antiderivative plotter]\n* Weisstein, Eric W. \"[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FunctionGraph.html Function Graph].\" From MathWorld—A Wolfram Web Resource.\n{{Visualization}}\n\n[[Category:Charts]]\n[[Category:Functions and mappings]]",
