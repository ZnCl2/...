This concept first arose in [[calculus]], and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of [[order theory]].\n\n== Monotonicity in calculus and analysis ==\nIn [[calculus]], a function <math>f</math> defined on a [[subset]] of the [[real numbers]] with real values is called '''monotonic''' if and only if it is either entirely non-increasing, or entirely non-decreasing. <ref name=\":1\" />That is, as per Fig. 1, a function that increases monotonically does not exclusively have to increase, it simply must not decrease.\n\nA function is called '''monotonically increasing''' (also '''increasing''' or '''non-decreasing'''<ref name=\":0\" />), if for all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> such that <math>x \\leq y</math> one has  <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) \\leq f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>, so <math>f</math> preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called '''monotonically decreasing''' (also '''decreasing''' or '''non-increasing'''<ref name=\":0\" />) if, whenever <math>x \\leq y</math>, then <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) \\geq f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>, so it ''reverses'' the order (see Figure 2).\n\nIf the order <math>\\leq</math> in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order <math><</math>, then one obtains a stronger requirement. A function with this property is called '''strictly increasing'''<ref name=\":0\" />. Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called '''strictly decreasing'''<ref name=\":0\" />.  Functions that are strictly increasing or decreasing are [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]] (because for <math>x</math> not equal to <math>y</math>, either <math>x < y</math> or <math>x > y</math> and so, by monotonicity, either <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) < f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math> or <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right) > f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>, thus <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right)</math> is not equal to <math>f\\!\\left(y\\right)</math>.)\n\nWhen functions between discrete sets are considered in [[combinatorics]], it is not always obvious that \"increasing\" and \"decreasing\" are taken to include the possibility of repeating the same value at successive arguments, so one finds the terms '''weakly increasing''' and '''weakly decreasing''' to stress this possibility.\n\nThe terms \"non-decreasing\" and \"non-increasing\" should not be confused with the (much weaker) negative qualifications \"not decreasing\" and \"not increasing\". For example, the function of figure 3 first falls, then rises, then falls again. It is therefore not decreasing and not increasing, but it is neither non-decreasing nor non-increasing.\n\nA function <math>f\\!\\left(x\\right)</math> is said to be '''absolutely monotonic''' over an interval <math>\\left(a, b\\right)</math> if the derivatives of all orders of <math>f</math> are [[nonnegative]] or all [[nonpositive]] at all points on the interval.\n\n=== Monotonic transformation ===\n\nThe term '''monotonic transformation''' (or '''monotone transformation''') can also possibly cause some confusion because it refers to a transformation by a strictly increasing function. This is the case in economics with respect to the ordinal properties of a [[utility function]] being preserved across a monotonic transform (see also [[monotone preferences]]).<ref>See the section on Cardinal Versus Ordinal Utility in {{harvtxt|Simon|Blume|1994}}.</ref> In this context, what we are calling a \"monotonic transformation\" is, more accurately, called a \"positive monotonic transformation\", in order to distinguish it from a “negative monotonic transformation,” which reverses the order of the numbers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Varian |first=Hal R. |title=Intermediate Microeconomics |edition=8th |year=2010 |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |page=56 |isbn=9780393934243}}</ref>\n\n=== Some basic applications and results ===\nThe following properties are true for a monotonic function <math>f\\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}</math>:\n*<math>f</math> has [[limit of a function|limits]] from the right and from the left at every point of its [[Domain of a function|domain]];\n*<math>f</math> has a limit at positive or negative infinity (&thinsp;<math>\\pm\\infty</math>&thinsp;) of either a real number, <math>\\infty</math>, or <math>\\left(-\\infty\\right)</math>.\n*<math>f</math> can only have [[jump discontinuity|jump discontinuities]];\n*<math>f</math> can only have [[countable|countably]] many [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuities]] in its domain.  The discontinuities, however, do not necessarily consist of isolated points and may even be dense in an interval (''a'',''b'').\n\nThese properties are the reason why monotonic functions are useful in technical work in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Two facts about these functions are:\n*if <math>f</math> is a monotonic function defined on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] <math>I</math>, then <math>f</math> is [[derivative|differentiable]] [[almost everywhere]] on <math>I</math>, i.e. the set <math>\\left\\{x : x \\in I\\right\\}</math> of numbers <math>x</math> in <math>I</math> such that <math>f</math> is not differentiable in <math>x</math> has [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue]] [[measure zero]]. In addition, this result cannot be improved to countable: see [[Cantor function]].\n*if <math>f</math> is a monotonic function defined on an interval <math>\\left[a, b\\right]</math>, then <math>f</math> is [[Riemann integral|Riemann integrable]].\n\nAn important application of monotonic functions is in [[probability theory]]. If <math>X</math> is a [[random variable]], its [[cumulative distribution function]] <math>F_X\\!\\left(x\\right) = \\text{Prob}\\!\\left(X \\leq x\\right)</math> is a monotonically increasing function.\n\nA function is ''[[unimodal function|unimodal]]'' if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the ''[[Mode (statistics)|mode]]'') and then monotonically decreasing.\n\nWhen <math>f</math> is a ''strictly monotonic'' function, then <math>f</math> is [[injective]] on its domain, and if <math>T</math> is the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of <math>f</math>, then there is an [[inverse function]] on <math>T</math> for <math>f</math>.\n\n== Monotonicity in topology ==\n\nA map ''<math>f: X \\rightarrow Y</math>'' is said to be '''monotone''' if each of its fibers is connected i.e. for each element ''<math>y</math>'' in <math>Y</math> the (possibly empty) set <math>f^{-1}(y)</math> is connected.\n\n== Monotonicity in functional analysis ==\n\nIn [[functional analysis]] on a [[topological vector space]] <math>X</math>, a (possibly non-linear) operator <math>T: X \\rightarrow X^*</math> is said to be a '''monotone operator''' if\n\n:<math>(Tu - Tv, u - v) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall u,v \\in X.</math>\n\n[[Kachurovskii's theorem]] shows that [[convex function]]s on [[Banach space]]s have monotonic operators as their derivatives.\n\nA subset <math>G</math> of <math>X \\times X^*</math> is said to be a '''monotone set''' if for every pair <math>[u_1, w_1]</math> and <math>[u_2, w_2]</math> in <math>G</math>,\n\n:<math>(w_1 - w_2, u_1 - u_2) \\geq 0.</math>\n\n<math>G</math> is said to be '''maximal monotone''' if it is maximal among all monotone sets in the sense of set inclusion.  The graph of a monotone operator <math>G(T)</math> is a monotone set. A monotone operator is said to be '''maximal monotone''' if its graph is a '''maximal monotone set'''.\n\n== Monotonicity in order theory ==\n\nOrder theory deals with arbitrary [[partially ordered set]]s and [[preorder|preordered sets]] in addition to real numbers. The above definition of monotonicity is relevant in these cases as well. However, the terms \"increasing\" and \"decreasing\" are avoided, since their conventional pictorial representation does not apply to orders that are not [[total order|total]]. Furthermore, the [[strict order|strict]] relations < and > are of little use in many non-total orders and hence no additional terminology is introduced for them.\n\nA monotone function is also called '''isotone''', or '''{{visible anchor|order-preserving}}'''. The [[duality (order theory)|dual]] notion is often called '''antitone''', '''anti-monotone''', or '''order-reversing'''. Hence, an antitone function ''f'' satisfies the property\n\n: ''x'' ≤ ''y'' implies ''f''(''x'') ≥ ''f''(''y''),\n\nfor all ''x'' and ''y'' in its domain. The composite of two monotone mappings is also monotone.\n\nA [[constant function]] is both monotone and antitone; conversely, if ''f'' is both monotone and antitone, and if the domain of ''f'' is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], then ''f'' must be constant.\n\nMonotone functions are central in order theory. They appear in most articles on the subject and examples from special applications are found in these places. Some notable special monotone functions are [[order embedding]]s (functions for which ''x'' ≤ ''y'' [[if and only if]] ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''f''(''y'')) and [[order isomorphism]]s ([[surjective]] order embeddings).\n\n== Monotonicity in the context of search algorithms ==\nIn the context of [[search algorithm]]s monotonicity (also called consistency) is a condition applied to [[heuristic function]]s.  A heuristic ''h(n)'' is monotonic if, for every node ''n'' and every successor ''n''' of ''n'' generated by any action ''a'', the estimated cost of reaching the goal from ''n'' is no greater than the step cost of getting to '' n' '' plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from '' n' '',\n\n:<math>h(n) \\leq c(n, a, n') + h(n').</math>\n\nThis is a form of [[triangle inequality]], with ''n'', ''n''', and the goal ''G<sub>n</sub>'' closest to ''n''.  Because every monotonic heuristic is also [[admissible heuristic|admissible]], monotonicity is a stricter requirement than admissibility.  Some [[heuristic algorithm]]s such as [[A*]] can be proven [[asymptotically optimal algorithm|optimal]] provided that the heuristic they use is monotonic.<ref>Conditions for optimality:  Admissibility and consistency pg. 94-95 {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2010}}.</ref>\n\n== Boolean functions ==\nIn [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], a monotonic function is one such that for all ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''b''<sub>''i''</sub> in {0,1}, if ''a''<sub>1</sub> ≤ ''b''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub> ≤ ''b''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> ≤ ''b''<sub>''n''</sub> (i.e. the Cartesian product {0, 1}<sup>''n''</sup> is ordered [[Coordinatewise order|coordinatewise]]), then f(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) ≤ f(''b''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''b''<sub>''n''</sub>). In other words, a Boolean function is monotonic if, for every combination of inputs, switching one of the inputs from false to true can only cause the output to switch from false to true and not from true to false. Graphically, this means that a Boolean function is monotonic when in its [[Hasse diagram]] ([[Duality (mathematics)#Dimension-reversing dualities|dual]] of its [[Venn diagram]]), there is no 1 connected to a higher 0.\n\nThe monotonic Boolean functions are precisely those that can be defined by an expression combining the inputs (which may appear more than once) using only the operators ''[[logical conjunction|and]]'' and ''[[logical disjunction|or]]'' (in particular ''[[negation|not]]'' is forbidden). For instance \"at least two of ''a'',''b'',''c'' hold\" is a monotonic function of ''a'',''b'',''c'', since it can be written for instance as ((''a'' and ''b'') or (''a'' and ''c'') or (''b'' and ''c'')).\n\nThe number of such functions on ''n'' variables is known as the [[Dedekind number]] of ''n''.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Monotone cubic interpolation]]\n* [[Pseudo-monotone operator]]\n* [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] - measure of how monotonic a set of data\n* [[Total monotonicity]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book\n | last = Bartle\n | first = Robert G.\n | title = The elements of real analysis\n | edition = second\n | year = 1976\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Grätzer\n | first = George\n | title = Lattice theory: first concepts and distributive lattices\n | year = 1971\n | isbn = 0-7167-0442-0\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last       = Pemberton\n | first      = Malcolm\n |author2=Rau, Nicholas\n | title      = Mathematics for economists: an introductory textbook\n | publisher  = Manchester University Press\n | year       = 2001\n | pages      =\n | isbn       = 0-7190-3341-1\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|author1=Renardy, Michael  |author2=Rogers, Robert C.\n |lastauthoramp=yes |    title = An introduction to partial differential equations\n|   series = Texts in Applied Mathematics 13\n|  edition = Second\n|publisher = Springer-Verlag\n| location = New York\n|     year = 2004\n|    pages = 356\n|       isbn = 0-387-00444-0\n}}\n*{{cite book\n |author1=Riesz, Frigyes  |author2=Béla Szőkefalvi-Nagy\n  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Functional Analysis\n | year = 1990\n| publisher = Courier Dover Publications\n| isbn = 978-0-486-66289-3\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last=Russell |first=Stuart J. |last2=Norvig |first2=Peter |ref=harv\n | title = Artificial Intelligence:  A Modern Approach\n | year = 2010\n | edition = 3rd\n | publisher = Prentice Hall\n | publication-place = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey\n | isbn = 978-0-13-604259-4\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Simon |first=Carl P. |first2=Lawrence |last2=Blume |ref=harv\n | title = Mathematics for Economists\n | edition = first\n | date = April 1994\n | isbn = 978-0-393-95733-4\n}} (Definition 9.31)\n\n== External links ==\n* {{springer|title=Monotone function|id=p/m064830}}\n* [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ConvergenceOfAMonotonicSequence/ Convergence of a Monotonic Sequence] by Anik Debnath and Thomas Roxlo (The Harker School), [[Wolfram Demonstrations Project]].\n* {{MathWorld |title=Monotonic Function |id=MonotonicFunction}}\n\n[[Category:Functional analysis]]\n[[Category:Order theory]]\n[[Category:Real analysis]]\n[[Category:Types of functions]]",
