The adjective ''real'' in this context was introduced in the 17th century by [[René Descartes]], who distinguished between real and [[imaginary number|imaginary]] [[Zero of a function|roots]] of [[polynomial]]s.\n\nThe real numbers include all the [[rational number]]s, such as the [[integer]] −5 and the [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] 4/3, and all the [[irrational number]]s, such as {{sqrt|2}} (1.41421356..., the [[square root of 2]], an irrational [[algebraic number]]).  Included within the irrationals are the [[transcendental number]]s, such as [[pi|{{pi}}]] (3.14159265...). Real numbers can be thought of as points on an infinitely long [[line (geometry)|line]] called the [[number line]] or [[real line]], where the points corresponding to [[integer]]s are equally spaced. Any real number can be determined by a possibly infinite [[decimal representation]], such as that of 8.632, where each consecutive digit is measured in units one tenth the size of the previous one. The [[real line]] can be thought of as a part of the [[complex plane]], and [[complex number]]s include real numbers.\n\n[[File:Real number line.svg|thumb|center|350px|Real numbers can be thought of as points on an infinitely long [[number line]]]]\n\nThese descriptions of the real numbers are not sufficiently rigorous by the modern standards of pure mathematics. The discovery of a suitably rigorous definition of the real numbers&nbsp;– indeed, the realization that a better definition was needed&nbsp;– was one of the most important developments of 19th&nbsp;century mathematics. The current standard axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique [[complete metric space|complete]] [[total order|totally ordered]] [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{nowrap|('''ℝ''' ; + ; · ; <),}} [[up to]] an [[isomorphism]],{{efn|More precisely, given two complete totally ordered fields, there is a ''unique'' isomorphism between them. This implies that the identity is the unique field automorphism of the reals that is compatible with the ordering.}} whereas popular constructive definitions of real numbers include declaring them as [[equivalence class]]es of [[Cauchy sequence]]s of rational numbers, [[Dedekind cut]]s, or infinite [[decimal representation]]s, together with precise interpretations for the arithmetic operations and the order relation. All these definitions satisfy the axiomatic definition and are thus equivalent.\n\nThe reals are [[uncountable set|uncountable]]; that is: while both the set of all [[natural number]]s and the set of all real numbers are [[infinite set]]s, there can be no [[one-to-one function]] from the real numbers to the natural numbers: the [[cardinality]] of the set of all real numbers (denoted <math>\\mathfrak c</math> and called [[cardinality of the continuum]]) is strictly greater than the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers (denoted <math>\\aleph_0</math> [[aleph number#Aleph-naught|'aleph-naught']]). The statement that there is no subset of the reals with cardinality strictly greater than <math>\\aleph_0</math> and strictly smaller than <math>\\mathfrak c</math> is known as the [[continuum hypothesis]] (CH). It is known to be neither provable nor refutable using the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] including the [[axiom of choice]] (ZFC), the standard foundation of modern mathematics, in the sense that some models of ZFC satisfy CH, while others violate it.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Number-systems.svg|thumb|Real numbers (ℝ) include the [[rational numbers]] (ℚ), which include the [[integer]]s (ℤ), which include the natural numbers (ℕ)]]\n\n[[Fraction (mathematics)#Common, vulgar, or simple fractions|Simple fractions]] were used by the [[History of Egypt|Egyptians]] around 1000&nbsp;BC; the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] \"[[Sulba Sutras]]\" (\"The rules of chords\") in, {{nowrap|{{abbr|c.|circa}} 600 BC}}, include what may be the first \"use\" of [[irrational number]]s.

The first rigorous definition was given by [[Georg Cantor]] in 1871. In 1874, he showed that the set of all real numbers is [[uncountable|uncountably infinite]] but the set of all [[algebraic number]]s is [[countable|countably infinite]]. Contrary to widely held beliefs, his first method was not his famous [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]], which he published in 1891. See [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]].\n\n== Definition ==\n{{Main|Construction of the real numbers}}\n\nThe real number system <math>(\\mathbb R ; + ; \\cdot ; <)</math> can be defined [[Axiomatic system|axiomatically]] up to an [[isomorphism]], which is described hereafter. There are also many ways to construct \"the\" real number system, for example, starting from natural numbers, then defining rational numbers algebraically, and finally defining real numbers as equivalence classes of their [[Cauchy sequence]]s or as [[Dedekind cut]]s, which are certain subsets of rational numbers. Another possibility is to start from some rigorous axiomatization of Euclidean geometry (Hilbert, Tarski, etc.) and then define the real number system geometrically. From the [[Structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)|structuralist]] point of view all these constructions are on equal footing.\n\n=== Axiomatic approach ===\n\nLet ℝ denote the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all real numbers. Then:\n* The set ℝ is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], meaning that [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] are defined and have the usual properties.\n* The field ℝ is [[ordered field|ordered]], meaning that there is a [[total order]] ≥ such that, for all real numbers ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'':\n** if ''x'' ≥ ''y'' then ''x'' + ''z'' ≥ ''y'' + ''z'';\n** if ''x'' ≥ 0 and ''y'' ≥ 0 then ''xy'' ≥ 0.\n* The order is [[Dedekind completion|Dedekind-complete]]; that is: every [[empty set|non-empty]] subset ''S'' of ℝ with an [[upper bound]] in ℝ has a [[supremum|least upper bound]] (also called supremum) in ℝ.\n\nThe last property is what differentiates the reals from the [[rational number|rationals]]. For example, the set of rationals with square less than 2 has a rational upper bound (e.g., 1.5) but no rational least upper bound, because the [[square root]] of 2 is not rational.\n\nThese properties imply [[Archimedean property]] (which is not implied by other definitions of completeness). That is, the set of [[integer]]s is not upper-bounded in the reals. In fact, if this were false, then the integers would have a least upper bound ''N''; then, ''N'' – 1 would not be an upper bound, and there would be an integer ''n'' such that {{nowrap|''n'' > ''N'' – 1}}, and thus {{nowrap|''n'' + 1 > ''N''}}, which is a contradiction with the upper-bound property of ''N''.\n\nThe real numbers are uniquely specified by the above properties. More precisely, given any two Dedekind-complete ordered fields ℝ<sub>1</sub> and ℝ<sub>2</sub>, there exists a unique field [[isomorphism]] from ℝ<sub>1</sub> to ℝ<sub>2</sub>, allowing us to think of them as essentially the same mathematical object.\n\nFor another axiomatization of ℝ, see [[Tarski's axiomatization of the reals]].\n\n=== Construction from the rational numbers ===\n\nThe real numbers can be constructed as a [[Complete metric space|completion]] of the rational numbers in such a way that a sequence defined by a decimal or binary expansion like (3; 3.1; 3.14; 3.141; 3.1415; ...) [[Limit of a sequence|converges]] to a unique real number, in this case {{pi}}. For details and other constructions of real numbers, see [[construction of the real numbers]].\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== Basic properties ===\n\nA real number may be either [[rational number|rational]] or [[irrational number|irrational]]; either [[algebraic number|algebraic]] or [[transcendental number|transcendental]]; and either [[positive number|positive]], [[negative number|negative]], or [[0 (number)|zero]]. Real numbers are used to measure [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. They may be expressed by [[decimal representation]]s that have an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the decimal point; these are often represented in the same form as 324.823122147...  The [[Ellipsis#In mathematical notation|ellipsis]] (three dots) indicates that there would still be more digits to come.\n\nMore formally, the real numbers have the two basic properties of being an [[ordered field]], and having the [[least upper bound axiom|least upper bound]] property. The first says that real numbers comprise a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], with addition and multiplication as well as division by non-zero numbers, which can be [[total order|totally ordered]] on a number line in a way compatible with addition and multiplication. The second says that, if a non-empty set of real numbers has an [[Upper and lower bounds|upper bound]], then it has a real [[supremum|least upper bound]]. The second condition distinguishes the real numbers from the rational numbers: for example, the set of rational numbers whose square is less than 2 is a set with an upper bound (e.g. 1.5) but no (rational) least upper bound: hence the rational numbers do not satisfy the least upper bound property.\n\n=== Completeness ===\n{{Main|Completeness of the real numbers}}\n\nA main reason for using real numbers is that the reals contain all [[limit (mathematics)|limits]]. More precisely, a sequence of real numbers has a limit, which is a real number, if (and only if) its elements eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to each other.\nThis is formally defined in the following, and means that the reals are [[completeness (topology)|complete]] (in the sense of [[metric space]]s or [[uniform space]]s, which is a different sense than the Dedekind completeness of the order in the previous section). :\n\nA [[sequence]] (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) of real numbers is called a ''[[Cauchy sequence]]'' if for any {{nowrap|ε > 0}} there exists an integer ''N'' (possibly depending on ε) such that the [[distance]] {{nowrap|{{!}}''x<sub>n</sub>'' − ''x<sub>m</sub>''{{!}}}} is less than ε for all ''n'' and ''m'' that are both greater than ''N''. This definition, originally provided by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]], formalizes the fact that the ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to each other.\n\nA sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) ''converges to the limit'' ''x'' if its elements eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to ''x'', that is, if for any {{nowrap|ε > 0}} there exists an integer ''N'' (possibly depending on ε) such that the distance {{nowrap|{{!}}''x<sub>n</sub>'' − ''x''{{!}}}} is less than ε for ''n'' greater than ''N''.\n\nEvery convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence, and the converse is true for real numbers, and this means that the [[topological space]] of the real numbers is complete.\n\nThe set of rational numbers is not complete. For example, the sequence (1; 1.4; 1.41; 1.414; 1.4142; 1.41421; ...), where each term adds a digit of the decimal expansion of the positive [[square root]] of 2, is Cauchy but it does not converge to a rational number (in the real numbers, in contrast, it converges to the positive [[square root]] of 2).\n\nThe completeness property of the reals is the basis on which [[calculus]], and, more generally [[mathematical analysis]] are built. In particular, the test that a sequence is a Cauchy sequence allows proving that a sequence has a limit, without computing it, and even without knowing it.\n\nFor example, the standard series of the [[exponential function]]\n:<math>e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\n\nconverges to a real number for every ''x'', because the sums\n:<math>\\sum_{n=N}^{M} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\n\ncan be made arbitrarily small (independently of ''M'') by choosing ''N'' sufficiently large. This proves that the sequence is Cauchy, and thus converges, showing that <math>e^x</math> is well defined for every ''x''.\n\n=== \"The complete ordered field\" ===\n\nThe real numbers are often described as \"the complete ordered field\", a phrase that can be interpreted in several ways.\n\nFirst, an order can be [[complete lattice|lattice-complete]]. It is easy to see that no ordered field can be lattice-complete, because it can have no largest element (given any element ''z'', {{nowrap|''z'' + 1}} is larger), so this is not the sense that is meant.\n\nAdditionally, an order can be [[Dedekind completion|Dedekind-complete]], as defined in the section '''Axioms'''. The uniqueness result at the end of that section justifies using the word \"the\" in the phrase \"complete ordered field\" when this is the sense of \"complete\" that is meant. This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from Dedekind cuts, since that construction starts from an ordered field (the rationals) and then forms the Dedekind-completion of it in a standard way.\n\nThese two notions of completeness ignore the field structure. However, an [[ordered group]] (in this case, the additive group of the field) defines a [[uniform space|uniform]] structure, and uniform structures have a notion of [[completeness (topology)]]; the description in the previous section '''Completeness''' is a special case. (We refer to the notion of completeness in uniform spaces rather than the related and better known notion for [[metric space]]s, since the definition of metric space relies on already having a characterization of the real numbers.) It is not true that '''R''' is the ''only'' uniformly complete ordered field, but it is the only uniformly complete ''[[Archimedean field]]'', and indeed one often hears the phrase \"complete Archimedean field\" instead of \"complete ordered field\". Every uniformly complete Archimedean field must also be Dedekind-complete (and vice versa), justifying using \"the\" in the phrase \"the complete Archimedean field\". This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from Cauchy sequences (the construction carried out in full in this article), since it starts with an Archimedean field (the rationals) and forms the uniform completion of it in a standard way.\n\nBut the original use of the phrase \"complete Archimedean field\" was by [[David Hilbert]], who meant still something else by it. He meant that the real numbers form the ''largest'' Archimedean field in the sense that every other Archimedean field is a subfield of '''R'''. Thus '''R''' is \"complete\" in the sense that nothing further can be added to it without making it no longer an Archimedean field. This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from [[surreal number]]s, since that construction starts with a proper class that contains every ordered field (the surreals) and then selects from it the largest Archimedean subfield.\n\n=== Advanced properties ===\n{{See also|Real line}}\n\nThe reals are [[uncountable]]; that is: there are strictly more real numbers than [[natural number]]s, even though both sets are [[Infinite set|infinite]]. In fact, the [[cardinality of the continuum|cardinality of the reals]] equals that of the set of subsets (i.e. the power set) of the natural numbers, and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] states that the latter set's cardinality is strictly greater than the cardinality of '''N'''. Since the set of [[algebraic number]]s is countable, [[almost all]] real numbers are [[transcendental number|transcendental]]. The non-existence of a subset of the reals with cardinality strictly between that of the integers and the reals is known as the [[continuum hypothesis]]. The continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor be disproved; it is [[logical independence|independent]] from the [[axiomatic set theory|axioms of set theory]].\n\nAs a topological space, the real numbers are [[separable space|separable]]. This is because the set of rationals, which is countable, is dense in the real numbers. The irrational numbers are also dense in the real numbers, however they are uncountable and have the same cardinality as the reals.\n\nThe real numbers form a [[metric space]]: the distance between ''x'' and ''y'' is defined as the [[absolute value]] {{nowrap|{{!}}''x'' − ''y''{{!}}}}. By virtue of being a [[total order|totally ordered]] set, they also carry an [[order topology]]; the [[topology]] arising from the metric and the one arising from the order are identical, but yield different presentations for the topology&nbsp;– in the order topology as ordered intervals, in the metric topology as epsilon-balls. The Dedekind cuts construction uses the order topology presentation, while the Cauchy sequences construction uses the metric topology presentation. The reals are a [[contractible]] (hence [[connected space|connected]] and [[simply connected]]), [[separable space|separable]] and [[complete space|complete]] metric space of [[Hausdorff dimension]]&nbsp;1. The real numbers are [[local compactness|locally compact]] but not [[compact space|compact]]. There are various properties that uniquely specify them; for instance, all unbounded, connected, and separable [[total order|order topologies]] are necessarily [[homeomorphic]] to the reals.\n\nEvery nonnegative real number has a [[square root]] in '''R''', although no negative number does. This shows that the order on '''R''' is determined by its algebraic structure. Also, every polynomial of odd degree admits at least one real root: these two properties make '''R''' the premier example of a [[real closed field]]. Proving this is the first half of one proof of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]].\n\nThe reals carry a canonical [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]], the [[Lebesgue measure]], which is the [[Haar measure]] on their structure as a [[topological group]] normalized such that the [[unit interval]] [0;1] has measure 1. There exist sets of real numbers that are not Lebesgue measurable, e.g. [[Vitali set]]s.\n\nThe supremum axiom of the reals refers to subsets of the reals and is therefore a second-order logical statement. It is not possible to characterize the reals with [[first-order logic]] alone: the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] implies that there exists a countable dense subset of the real numbers satisfying exactly the same sentences in first-order logic as the real numbers themselves. The set of [[hyperreal number]]s <!-- is equal in cardinality to '''R''' and also -->satisfies the same first order sentences as '''R'''. Ordered fields that satisfy the same first-order sentences as '''R''' are called [[nonstandard model]]s of '''R'''. This is what makes [[nonstandard analysis]] work; by proving a first-order statement in some nonstandard model (which may be easier than proving it in '''R'''), we know that the same statement must also be true of '''R'''.\n\nThe [[field (mathematics)|field]] '''R''' of real numbers is an [[extension field]] of the field '''Q''' of rational numbers, and '''R''' can therefore be seen as a [[vector space]] over '''Q'''. [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the [[axiom of choice]] guarantees the existence of a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of this vector space: there exists a set ''B'' of real numbers such that every real number can be written uniquely as a finite [[linear combination]] of elements of this set, using rational coefficients only, and such that no element of ''B'' is a rational linear combination of the others. However, this existence theorem is purely theoretical, as such a base has never been explicitly described.\n\nThe [[well-ordering theorem]] implies that the real numbers can be [[well-order]]ed if the axiom of choice is assumed: there exists a [[total order]] on '''R''' with the property that every [[empty set|non-empty]] [[subset]] of '''R''' has a [[least element]] in this ordering. (The standard ordering ≤ of the real numbers is not a well-ordering since e.g. an [[open interval]] does not contain a least element in this ordering.) Again, the existence of such a well-ordering is purely theoretical, as it has not been explicitly described. If [[V=L]] is assumed in addition to the axioms of ZF, a well ordering of the real numbers can be shown to be explicitly definable by a formula.<ref>{{citation |last=Moschovakis |first=Yiannis N. |title=Descriptive set theory |work=Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics |volume=100 |publisher=North-Holland Publishing Co. |location=Amsterdam - New York |year=1980 |pages=xii, 637 |isbn=0-444-85305-7}}, chapter V.</ref>\n\n== Applications and connections to other areas ==\n\n=== Real numbers and logic ===\n\nThe real numbers are most often formalized using the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel]] axiomatization of set theory, but some mathematicians study the real numbers with other logical foundations of mathematics.

In this approach, infinitesimals are (non-\"standard\") elements of the set of the real numbers (rather than being elements of an extension thereof, as in Robinson's theory).\n\nThe [[continuum hypothesis]] posits that the cardinality of the set of the real numbers is <math>\\aleph_1</math>; i.e. the smallest infinite [[cardinal number]] after <math>\\aleph_0</math>, the cardinality of the integers.

In fact, the fundamental physical theories such as [[classical mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[general relativity]] and the [[standard model]] are described using mathematical structures, typically [[smooth manifolds]] or [[Hilbert spaces]], that are based on the real numbers, although actual measurements of physical quantities are of finite [[accuracy and precision]].\n\n=== In computation ===\n\nWith some [[Symbolic computation|exceptions]], most calculators do not operate on real numbers.

Moreover, the equality of two computable numbers is an [[undecidable problem]]. Some [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivists]] accept the existence of only those reals that are computable. The set of [[definable number]]s is broader, but still only countable.\n\n=== \"Reals\" in set theory ===\n\nIn [[set theory]], specifically [[descriptive set theory]], the [[Baire space (set theory)|Baire space]] is used as a surrogate for the real numbers since the latter have some topological properties (connectedness) that are a technical inconvenience. Elements of Baire space are referred to as \"reals\".\n\n== Vocabulary and notation ==\n\nMathematicians use the symbol '''R''', or, alternatively, ℝ, the [[R|letter \"R\"]] in [[blackboard bold]] (encoded in [[Unicode]] as {{unichar|211D|DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL R|html=}}), to represent the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all real numbers. As this set is naturally endowed with the structure of a [[field (mathematics)|field]], the expression ''field of real numbers'' is frequently used when its algebraic properties are under consideration.\n\nThe sets of positive real numbers and negative real numbers are often noted '''R'''<sup>+</sup> and '''R'''<sup>−</sup>,<ref name=Schumacher96>{{harvnb|Schumacher|1996|loc=pp. 114-115}}</ref> respectively; '''R'''<sub>+</sub> and '''R'''<sub>−</sub> are also used.<ref name=\"nombres-reels-ens-paris\">[[École Normale Supérieure]] of [[Paris]], [http://culturemath.ens.fr/maths/pdf/logique/reels.pdf “{{lang|fr|Nombres réels}}” (“Real numbers”)], p. 6</ref> The non-negative real numbers can be noted '''R'''<sub>≥0</sub> but one often sees this set noted '''R'''<sup>+</sup> ∪ {0}.<ref name=Schumacher96 /> In French mathematics, the ''positive real numbers'' and ''negative real numbers'' commonly include [[zero]], and these sets are noted respectively ℝ<sub>+</sub> and ℝ<sub>−</sub>.<ref name=\"nombres-reels-ens-paris\"/> In this understanding, the respective sets without zero are called strictly positive real numbers and strictly negative real numbers, and are noted ℝ<sub>+</sub>* and ℝ<sub>−</sub>*.<ref name=\"nombres-reels-ens-paris\"/>\n\nThe notation '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> refers to the [[cartesian product]] of ''n'' copies of '''R''', which is an ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[vector space]] over the field of the real numbers; this vector space may be identified to the ''n''-[[dimension]]al space of [[Euclidean geometry]] as soon as a [[coordinate system]] has been chosen in the latter. For example, a value from '''R'''<sup>3</sup> consists of three real numbers and specifies the [[coordinates]] of a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in 3‑dimensional space.\n\nIn mathematics, ''real'' is used as an adjective, meaning that the underlying field is the field of the real numbers (or ''the real field''). For example, ''real [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]'', ''real [[polynomial]]'' and ''real [[Lie algebra]]''. The word is also used as a [[noun]], meaning a real number (as in \"the set of all reals\").\n\n== Generalizations and extensions ==\n\nThe real numbers can be generalized and extended in several different directions:\n* The [[complex number]]s contain solutions to all [[polynomial]] equations and hence are an [[algebraically closed field]] unlike the real numbers. However, the complex numbers are not an [[ordered field]].\n* The [[affinely extended real number system]] adds two elements +∞ and −∞. It is a [[compact space]]. It is no longer a field, or even an additive group, but it still has a [[total order]]; moreover, it is a [[complete lattice]].\n* The [[real projective line]] adds only one value ∞. It is also a compact space. Again, it is no longer a field, or even an additive group. However, it allows division of a non-zero element by zero. It has [[cyclic order]] described by a [[separation relation]].\n* The [[Long line (topology)|long real line]] pastes together ℵ<sub>1</sub>* + ℵ<sub>1</sub> copies of the real line plus a single point (here ℵ<sub>1</sub>* denotes the reversed ordering of ℵ<sub>1</sub>) to create an ordered set that is \"locally\" identical to the real numbers, but somehow longer; for instance, there is an order-preserving embedding of ℵ<sub>1</sub> in the long real line but not in the real numbers. The long real line is the largest ordered set that is complete and locally Archimedean. As with the previous two examples, this set is no longer a field or additive group.\n* Ordered fields extending the reals are the [[hyperreal number]]s and the [[surreal number]]s; both of them contain [[infinitesimal]] and infinitely large numbers and are therefore [[non-Archimedean ordered field]]s.\n* [[Self-adjoint operator]]s on a [[Hilbert space]] (for example, self-adjoint square complex [[matrix (math)|matrices]]) generalize the reals in many respects: they can be ordered (though not totally ordered), they are complete, all their [[eigenvector|eigenvalues]] are real and they form a real [[associative algebra]]. [[Positive-definite]] operators correspond to the positive reals and [[normal operator]]s correspond to the complex numbers.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Mathematics|Algebra|Number theory|Analysis}}\n* [[Continued fraction]]\n* [[Real analysis]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* [[Georg Cantor]], 1874, \"{{lang|de|Über eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen}}\", ''{{lang|de|Journal für die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik}}'', volume 77, pages 258&ndash;262.\n* [[Solomon Feferman]], 1989, ''The Number Systems: Foundations of Algebra and Analysis'', AMS Chelsea, {{isbn|0-8218-2915-7}}.\n* Robert Katz, 1964, ''Axiomatic Analysis'', D.
