Proportionality [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]s are written within the image: {{math|sin ''θ''}}, {{math|cos ''θ''}}, {{math|tan ''θ''}}, where {{mvar|θ}} is the common measure of five acute angles.]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''trigonometric functions''' (also called '''circular functions''', '''angle functions''' or '''goniometric functions'''<ref name=\"Klein_1924\"/><ref name=\"Klein_2004\"/>) are [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of an [[angle]]. They relate the angles of a [[triangle]] to the lengths of its sides. Trigonometric functions are important in the study of triangles and modeling periodic phenomena, among many other applications.\n\nThe most familiar trigonometric functions are the [[sine]], [[#cosine|cosine]], and [[#tangent|tangent]]. In the context of the standard [[unit circle]] (a circle with [[radius]] 1 unit), where a triangle is formed by a ray starting at the origin and making some angle with the {{mvar|x}}-axis, the sine of the angle gives the length of the {{mvar|y}}-component (the opposite to the angle or the rise) of the triangle, the cosine gives the length of the {{mvar|x}}-component (the adjacent of the angle or the run), and the tangent function gives the slope ({{mvar|y}}-component divided by the {{mvar|x}}-component). More precise definitions are detailed below. Trigonometric functions are commonly defined as [[ratio]]s of two sides of a right triangle containing the angle, and can equivalently be defined as the lengths of various line segments from a [[unit circle]]. More modern definitions express them as [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] or as solutions of certain [[differential equation]]s, allowing their extension to arbitrary positive and negative values and even to [[complex number]]s.\n\nTrigonometric functions have a wide range of uses including computing unknown lengths and angles in triangles (often right triangles).  In this use, trigonometric functions are used, for instance, in navigation, engineering, and physics. A common use in elementary physics is resolving a [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] into [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] coordinates. The sine and cosine functions are also commonly used to model [[periodic function]] phenomena such as [[sound]] and light waves, the position and velocity of harmonic oscillators, sunlight intensity and day length, and average temperature variations through the year.\n\nIn modern usage, there are six basic trigonometric functions, tabulated here with equations that relate them to one another. Especially with the last four, these relations are often taken as the ''definitions'' of those functions, but one can define them equally well geometrically, or by other means, and then derive these relations.\n\n==Right-angled triangle definitions==\n[[File:Trigonometry triangle.svg|right|200px|A right triangle always includes a 90° ({{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} radians) angle, here labeled ''C''. Angles ''A'' and ''B'' may vary. Trigonometric functions specify the relationships among side lengths and interior angles of a right triangle.]]\n[[File:Periodic sine.PNG|thumb|'''Top:''' Trigonometric function {{math|sin ''θ''}} for selected angles {{math|''θ''}}, {{math|π − ''θ''}}, {{math|π + ''θ''}}, and {{math|2π − ''θ''}} in the four quadrants.<br>'''Bottom:''' Graph of sine function versus angle. Angles from the top panel are identified.]]\n\nThe notion that there should be some standard correspondence between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the angles of the triangle comes as soon as one recognizes that [[similarity (geometry)|similar triangles]] maintain the same ratios between their sides. That is, for any similar triangle the ratio of the [[hypotenuse]] (for example) and another of the sides remains the same. If the hypotenuse is twice as long, so are the sides. It is these ratios that the trigonometric functions express.\n\nTo define the trigonometric functions for the angle ''A'', start with any right triangle that contains the angle ''A''. The three sides of the triangle are named as follows:\n* The ''hypotenuse'' is the side opposite the right angle, in this case side&nbsp;'''{{mvar|h}}'''. The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right-angled triangle.\n* The ''opposite side'' is the side opposite to the angle we are interested in (angle ''A''), in this case side&nbsp;'''{{mvar|a}}'''.\n* The ''adjacent side'' is the side having both the angles of interest (angle ''A'' and right-angle ''C''), in this case side&nbsp;'''{{mvar|b}}'''.\n\nIn ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]], according to the [[triangle postulate]], the inside angles of every triangle total 180[[degree (angle)|°]] ({{pi}} [[radian]]s). Therefore, in a right-angled triangle, the two non-right angles total 90° ({{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} radians), so each of these angles must be in the range of {{math|(0, {{sfrac|{{Pi}}|2}})}} as expressed in interval notation. The following definitions apply to angles in this {{math|0 – {{sfrac|{{Pi}}|2}}}} range. They can be extended to the full set of real arguments by using the [[Unit circle#Trigonometric functions on the unit circle|unit circle]], or by requiring certain symmetries and that they be [[periodic function]]s. For example, the figure shows {{math|sin(''θ'')}} for angles {{mvar|θ}}, {{math|{{pi}} − ''θ''}}, {{math|{{pi}} + ''θ''}}, and {{math|2{{pi}} − ''θ''}} depicted on the unit circle (top) and as a graph (bottom). The value of the sine repeats itself apart from sign in all four quadrants, and if the range of {{mvar|θ}} is extended to additional rotations, this behavior repeats periodically with a period 2{{pi}}.\n\nThe trigonometric functions are summarized in the following table and described in more detail below. The angle {{mvar|θ}} is the angle between the hypotenuse and the adjacent line&nbsp;– the angle at ''A'' in the accompanying diagram.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Function\n! Abbreviation\n!

The word comes from the Latin ''sinus'' for gulf or bay,<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, sine, ''n.''<sup>2</sup></ref> since, given a unit circle, it is the side of the triangle on which the angle ''opens''. In our case:\n\n:<math>\\sin A = \\frac {\\textrm{opposite}} {\\textrm{hypotenuse}}</math>\n\n[[File:Sine cosine one period.svg|right|thumb|An illustration of the relationship between sine and its out-of-[[phase (waves)|phase]] complement, cosine.

In our case:\n\n:<math>\\cos A = \\frac {\\textrm{adjacent}} {\\textrm{hypotenuse}}</math>\n\n{{anchor|tangent|tan}}The '''tangent''' of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side: so called because it can be represented as a line segment [[Tangent line|tangent]] to the circle, that is the line that touches the circle, from Latin ''linea tangens'' or touching line (cf. ''tangere'', to touch).<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, tangent, ''adj. and n.''</ref> In our case:\n:<math>\\tan A = \\frac {\\textrm{opposite}} {\\textrm{adjacent}}</math>\n\nTangent may also be represented in terms of sine and cosine, that is:\n:<math>\\tan A = \\frac {\\sin A} {\\cos A} = \\frac {\\frac {\\textrm{opposite}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}}}{\\frac {\\textrm{adjacent}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}}} = \\frac {\\textrm{opposite}}{\\textrm{adjacent}}</math>\n\nThese ratios do not depend on the size of the particular right triangle chosen, as long as the focus angle is equal, since all such triangles are [[similarity (geometry)|similar]].\n\nThe acronyms \"SOH-CAH-TOA\" (\"soak-a-toe\", \"sock-a-toa\", \"so-kah-toa\") and \"OHSAHCOAT\" are commonly used [[Mnemonics in trigonometry|trigonometric mnemonics for these ratios]].\n\n===Cosecant, secant, and cotangent===\nThe remaining three functions are best defined using the above three functions, and can be considered their [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s.\n\n{{anchor|cosecant|csc}}The '''cosecant''' (''secant complement'', Latin: ''cosecans'', ''secans complementi''), csc(''A'') or cosec(''A''), is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of sin(''A''); i.e. the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the opposite side; so called because it is the secant of the complementary or co-angle:\n\n:<math>\\csc A = \\frac {1}{\\sin A} = \\frac {\\textrm{hypotenuse}} {\\textrm{opposite}} = \\frac {h} {a}. </math>\n\n{{anchor|secant|sec}}The '''secant''' sec(''A'') is the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of cos(''A''); i.e. the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the adjacent side:\n\n:<math>\\sec A = \\frac {1}{\\cos A} = \\frac {\\textrm{hypotenuse}} {\\textrm{adjacent}} = \\frac {h} {b}. </math>\n\nIt is so called because it represents the line that ''cuts'' the circle (from Latin: ''secare'', to cut).<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, secant, ''adj.'' and ''n.''</ref>\n\n{{anchor|cotangent|cot}}The '''cotangent''' (''tangent complement'', Latin: ''cotangens'', ''tangens complementi''), cot(''A''), ctg(''A'') or ctn(''A''), is the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of tan(''A''); i.e. the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the opposite side; so called because it is the tangent of the complementary or co-angle:\n:<math>\\cot A = \\frac {1}{\\tan A} = \\frac {\\textrm{adjacent}} {\\textrm{opposite}} = \\frac {b} {a}. </math>\n\n===Mnemonics===\nEquivalent to the right-triangle definitions, the trigonometric functions can also be defined in terms of the ''rise'', ''run'', and ''[[slope]]'' of a line segment relative to horizontal. The slope is commonly taught as \"rise over run\" or {{sfrac|rise|run}}. The three main trigonometric functions are commonly taught in the order sine, cosine, tangent. With a line segment length of 1 (as in a [[unit circle]]), the following [[mnemonic device]]s show the correspondence of definitions:\n\n# \"Sine is first, rise is first\" meaning that Sine takes the angle of the line segment and tells its vertical rise when the length of the line is 1.\n# \"Cosine is second, run is second\" meaning that Cosine takes the angle of the line segment and tells its horizontal run when the length of the line is 1.\n# \"Tangent combines the rise and run\" meaning that Tangent takes the angle of the line segment and tells its slope; or alternatively, tells the vertical rise when the line segment's horizontal run is 1.\n\nThis shows the main use of tangent and arctangent: converting between the two ways of telling the slant of a line, ''i.e.'', angles and slopes. (The arctangent or \"inverse tangent\" is not to be confused with the ''cotangent'', which is cosine divided by sine.)\n\nWhile the length of the line segment makes no difference for the slope (the slope does not depend on the length of the slanted line), it does affect rise and run. To adjust and find the actual rise and run when the line does not have a length of 1, just multiply the sine and cosine by the line length. For instance, if the line segment has length 5, the run at an angle of 7° is 5&nbsp;cos(7°)\n\n==Unit-circle definitions==\n[[File:Unit Circle Definitions of Six Trigonometric Functions.png|thumb|300x300px|In this illustration, the six trigonometric functions of an arbitrary angle θ are represented as [[Cartesian coordinates]] of points related to the [[unit circle]].

While [[#Right-angled triangle definitions|right-angled triangle definitions]] permit the definition of the trigonometric functions for angles between 0 and <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> [[radian]]s, the unit circle definition extends the definitions of the trigonometric functions to all positive and negative arguments.\n\nGiven an arbitrary angle {{mvar|θ}}, let us rotate the positive half of the {{mvar|x}}-axis by this angle around the center {{mvar|O}} of the unit circle, which is also the origin of the coordinates. If <math>\\theta>0,</math> the half-axis is rotated [[counterclockwise]], and if <math>\\theta<0,</math> it is rotated clockwise. The rotated half-axis intersects the unit circle, the line {{math|1=''x'' = 1}}, and the line {{math|1=''y'' = 1}} at points {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|B}} and {{mvar|C}} respectively (see the figure).

The same is true for the four other trigonometric functions. However, a rotation of an angle of <math>\\pi</math> does not change {{mvar|B}} or {{mvar|C}}.

These values of the sine and the cosine may thus be constructed by [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|ruler and compass]].\n\nFor an angle of an integer number of degrees, the sine and the cosine may be expressed in terms of [[square root]]s and the [[cube root]] of a non-real [[complex number]]. [[Galois theory]] allows to prove that, if the angle is not a multiple of 3°, non-real cube roots are unavoidable.\n\nFor an angle which, measured in degrees, is a [[rational number]], the sine and the cosine are [[algebraic number]]s, which may be expressed in terms of [[nth root|{{mvar|n}}th roots]]. This results from the fact that the [[Galois group]]s of the [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s are [[cyclic group|cyclic]].\n\nFor an angle which, measured in degrees, is not a rational number, then either the angle or both the sine and the cosine are [[transcendental number]]s. This is a corollary of [[Baker's theorem]], proved in 1966.\n\n===Explicit values===\n{{main article|Trigonometric constants expressed in real radicals}}\nAlgebraic expressions for 15°, 18°, 36°, 54°, 72° and 75° are as follows:\n\n:<math>\\sin 15^\\circ = \\cos 75^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt6-\\sqrt2}{4}\\,\\!</math>\n:<math>\\sin 18^\\circ = \\cos 72^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt5-1}{4}</math>\n:<math>\\sin 36^\\circ = \\cos 54^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{10-2\\sqrt{5}}}{4}</math>\n:<math>\\sin 54^\\circ = \\cos 36^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt5+1}{4}\\,\\!</math>\n:<math>\\sin 72^\\circ = \\cos 18^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{10+2\\sqrt{5}}}{4}</math>\n:<math>\\sin 75^\\circ = \\cos 15^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt6+\\sqrt2}{4}.\\,</math>\n\nFrom these, the algebraic expressions for all multiples of 3° can be computed.

Within the 2-dimensional [[function space]] {{mvar|V}} consisting of all solutions of this equation,\n* the sine function is the unique solution satisfying the initial condition <math>\\left( y'(0), y(0) \\right) = (1, 0)\\,</math> and\n* the cosine function is the unique solution satisfying the initial condition <math>\\left( y'(0), y(0) \\right) = (0, 1)\\,</math>.\n\nSince the sine and cosine functions are linearly independent, together they form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of {{mvar|V}}. This method of defining the sine and cosine functions is essentially equivalent to using Euler's formula. (See [[linear differential equation]].) It turns out that this differential equation can be used not only to define the sine and cosine functions but also to prove the [[List of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identities]] for the sine and cosine functions.\n\nFurther, the observation that sine and cosine satisfies {{math|''y''″ {{=}} −''y''}} means that they are [[eigenfunction]]s of the second-derivative operator.\n\nThe tangent function is the unique solution of the nonlinear differential equation\n: <math>y' = 1 + y^2\\,</math>\nsatisfying the initial condition {{math|''y''(0) {{=}} 0}}. There is a very interesting visual proof that the tangent function satisfies this differential equation.<ref name=\"Needham\"/>\n\n===The significance of radians===\nRadians specify an angle by measuring the length around the path of the unit circle and constitute a special argument to the sine and cosine functions. In particular, only sines and cosines that map radians to ratios satisfy the differential equations that classically describe them. If an argument to sine or cosine in radians is scaled by frequency,\n\n: <math>f(x) = \\sin(kx), \\,</math>\n\nthen the derivatives will scale by amplitude.\n\n: <math>f'(x) = k\\cos(kx). \\,</math>\n\nHere, {{mvar|k}} is a constant that represents a mapping between units.

Among the most frequently used is the '''Pythagorean identity''', which states that for any angle, the square of the sine plus the square of the cosine is 1. This is easy to see by studying a right triangle of hypotenuse 1 and applying the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. In symbolic form, the Pythagorean identity is written\n\n:<math>\\sin^2 x  + \\cos^2 x  = 1  </math>\n\nwhich is standard shorthand notation for\n\n:<math>(\\sin x)^2  + (\\cos x)^2  = 1 .</math>\n\nOther key relationships are the '''sum and difference formulas''', which give the sine and cosine of the sum and difference of two angles in terms of sines and cosines of the angles themselves. These can be derived geometrically, using arguments that date to [[Ptolemy]]. One can also produce them algebraically using [[Euler's formula]].\n; Sum\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sin\\left(x+y\\right)&=\\sin x \\cos y + \\cos x \\sin y,\\\\\n\\cos\\left(x+y\\right)&=\\cos x \\cos y - \\sin x \\sin y,\n\\end{align}</math>\n; Difference\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sin\\left(x-y\\right)&=\\sin x \\cos y - \\cos x \\sin y, \\\\\n\\cos\\left(x-y\\right)&=\\cos x \\cos y + \\sin x \\sin y. \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThese in turn lead to the following three-angle formulae:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sin\\left(x+y+z\\right)&=\\sin x \\cos y \\cos z + \\sin y \\cos z \\cos x + \\sin z \\cos y \\cos x - \\sin x \\sin y \\sin z, \\\\\n\\cos\\left(x+y+z\\right)&=\\cos x \\cos y \\cos z - \\cos x \\sin y \\sin z - \\cos y \\sin x \\sin z - \\cos z \\sin x \\sin y, \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhen the two angles are equal, the sum formulas reduce to simpler equations known as the '''double-angle formulae'''.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sin\\left(2x\\right) &= 2 \\sin x \\cos x, \\\\\n\\cos\\left(2x\\right) &= \\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x = 2 \\cos^2 x - 1 = 1 - 2 \\sin^2 x. \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhen three angles are equal, the three-angle formulae simplify to\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sin(3x) &= 3 \\sin x - 4 \\sin^3 x . \\\\\n\\cos(3x) &= 4 \\cos^3 x - 3 \\cos x . \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThese identities can also be used to derive the [[product-to-sum identities]] that were used in antiquity to transform the product of two numbers into a sum of numbers and greatly speed operations, much like the [[logarithm|logarithm function]].\n\n===Calculus===\nFor [[integral]]s and [[derivative]]s of trigonometric functions, see the relevant sections of [[Differentiation of trigonometric functions]], [[Lists of integrals]] and [[List of integrals of trigonometric functions]]. Below is the list of the derivatives and integrals of the six basic trigonometric functions.

Taking as given these formulas, one can prove that only two [[real analysis|real function]]s satisfy those conditions. Symbolically, we say that there exists exactly one pair of real functions&nbsp;– sin and cos&nbsp;– such that for all real numbers {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, the following equation holds:<ref name=\"Kannappan_2009\"/>\n\n: <math>\\cos(x- y) = \\cos x\\cos y + \\sin x\\sin y\\,</math>\n\nwith the added condition that\n\n: <math>0 < x\\cos x < \\sin x < x\\hbox{ for }0 < x < 1.\\,</math>\n\nOther derivations, starting from other functional equations, are also possible, and such derivations can be extended to the complex numbers.\nAs an example, this derivation can be used to define [[trigonometry in Galois fields]].\n\n==Computation==\nThe computation of trigonometric functions is a complicated subject, which can today be avoided by most people because of the widespread availability of [[computer]]s and [[scientific calculator]]s that provide built-in trigonometric functions for any angle. This section, however, describes details of their computation in three important contexts: the historical use of trigonometric tables, the modern techniques used by computers, and a few \"important\" angles where simple exact values are easily found.\n\nThe first step in computing any trigonometric function is range reduction—reducing the given angle to a \"reduced angle\" inside a small range of angles, say 0 to {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, using the periodicity and symmetries of the trigonometric functions.\n\n{{Main article|Generating trigonometric tables}}\n\nPrior to computers, people typically evaluated trigonometric functions by [[interpolation|interpolating]] from a detailed table of their values, calculated to many [[significant figures]]. Such tables have been available for as long as trigonometric functions have been described (see [[#History|History]] below), and were typically generated by repeated application of the half-angle and angle-addition [[List of trigonometric identities|identities]] starting from a known value (such as sin({{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}})&nbsp;=&nbsp;1).\n\nModern computers use a variety of techniques.<ref>Kantabutra.</ref> One common method, especially on higher-end processors with [[floating point]] units, is to combine a [[polynomial]] or [[rational function|rational]] [[approximation theory|approximation]] (such as [[Approximation theory|Chebyshev approximation]], best uniform approximation, and [[Padé approximant|Padé approximation]], and typically for higher or variable precisions, [[Taylor series|Taylor]] and [[Laurent series]]) with range reduction and a [[lookup table|table lookup]]—they first look up the closest angle in a small table, and then use the polynomial to compute the correction.<ref>However, doing that while maintaining precision is nontrivial, and methods like [[Gal's accurate tables]], Cody and Waite reduction, and Payne and Hanek reduction algorithms can be used.</ref> Devices that lack [[Arithmetic logic unit|hardware multipliers]] often use an algorithm called [[CORDIC]] (as well as related techniques), which uses only addition, subtraction, [[bitwise operation|bitshift]], and [[lookup table|table lookup]]. These methods are commonly implemented in [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] [[floating-point unit]]s for performance reasons.\n\nFor very high precision calculations, when series expansion convergence becomes too slow, trigonometric functions can be approximated by the [[arithmetic-geometric mean]], which itself approximates the trigonometric function by the ([[complex number|complex]]) [[elliptic integral]].<ref name=\"Brent_1976\"/>\n\n{{Main article|Exact trigonometric constants}}\n\nFinally, for some simple angles, the values can be easily computed by hand using the [[Pythagorean theorem]], as in the following examples. For example, the sine, cosine and tangent of any integer multiple of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|60}} [[radian]]s (3°) can be found [[Exact trigonometric constants|exactly by hand]].\n\nConsider a right triangle where the two other angles are equal, and therefore are both {{sfrac|{{pi}}|4}} radians (45°). Then the length of side {{mvar|b}} and the length of side {{mvar|a}} are equal; we can choose {{math|1=''a'' = ''b'' = 1}}. The values of sine, cosine and tangent of an angle of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|4}} radians (45°) can then be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n:<math>c = \\sqrt { a^2+b^2 } = \\sqrt2\\,.</math>\n\nTherefore:\n\n:<math>\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\sin 45^\\circ = \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{4}= \\cos 45^\\circ = {1 \\over \\sqrt2} = {\\sqrt2 \\over 2},\\,</math>\n\n:<math>\\tan \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\tan 45^\\circ = { {\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{4} } \\over {\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{4} } }= {1 \\over \\sqrt2} \\cdot {\\sqrt2 \\over 1} = {\\sqrt2 \\over \\sqrt2} = 1. \\,</math>\n[[File:Equiv triangle trig functions.svg|thumb|Computing trigonometric functions from an equilateral triangle]]\nTo determine the trigonometric functions for angles of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}} radians (60°) and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|6}} radians (30°), we start with an equilateral triangle of side length 1. All its angles are {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}} radians (60°). By dividing it into two, we obtain a right triangle with {{sfrac|{{pi}}|6}} radians (30°) and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}} radians (60°) angles. For this triangle, the shortest side is {{sfrac|1|2}}, the next largest side is {{sfrac|{{sqrt|3}}|2}} and the hypotenuse is 1.

Therefore, to define an inverse function we must restrict their domains so that the trigonometric function is [[bijection|bijective]]. In the following, the functions on the left are ''defined'' by the equation on the right; these are not proved identities. The principal inverses are usually defined as:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{rrc}\n \\text{Function} & \\text{Definition} & \\text{Value Field}\n \\\\\n \\hline\n \\arcsin x = y &\n \\sin y = x &\n -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\le y \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\\\\n \\arccos x = y &\n \\cos y = x &\n 0 \\le y \\le \\pi \\\\\n \\arctan x = y &\n \\tan y = x &\n -\\frac{\\pi}{2} < y < \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\\\\n \\arccot x = y &\n \\cot y = x &\n 0 < y < \\pi \\\\\n \\arcsec x = y &\n \\sec y = x &\n 0 \\le y \\le \\pi,\\, y \\ne \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\\\\n \\arccsc x = y &\n \\csc y = x &\n -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\le y \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2},\\, y \\ne 0\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nThe notations sin<sup>−1</sup> and cos<sup>−1</sup> are often used for arcsin and arccos, etc. When this notation is used, the inverse functions could be confused with the multiplicative inverses of the functions. The notation using the \"arc-\" prefix avoids such confusion, though \"arcsec\" for arcsecant can be confused with \"[[arcsecond]]\".\n\nJust like the sine and cosine, the inverse trigonometric functions can also be defined in terms of infinite series. For example,\n:<math>\n\\arcsin z = z + \\left( \\frac {1} {2} \\right) \\frac {z^3} {3} + \\left( \\frac {1 \\cdot 3} {2 \\cdot 4} \\right) \\frac {z^5} {5} + \\left( \\frac{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5} {2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 } \\right) \\frac{z^7} {7} + \\cdots\\,.</math>\nThese functions may also be defined by proving that they are antiderivatives of other functions. The arcsine, for example, can be written as the following integral:\n\n:<math>\n\\arcsin z =\n\\int_0^z \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\\,dx, \\quad |z| < 1.\n</math>\n\nAnalogous formulas for the other functions can be found at [[inverse trigonometric functions]]. Using the [[complex logarithm]], one can generalize all these functions to complex arguments:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\arcsin z &= -i \\log \\left( i z + \\sqrt{1 - z^2} \\right), \\, \\\\\n\\arccos z &= -i \\log \\left( z + \\sqrt{z^2 - 1}\\right), \\, \\\\\n\\arctan z &= \\frac12i \\log\\left(\\frac{1-iz}{1+iz}\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n<!-- (note: these should probably be presented as definite integrals, removing the ambiguity of the constant) -->\n\n===Connection to the inner product===\nIn an [[inner product space]], the angle between two non-zero vectors is defined to be\n:<math>\\operatorname{angle}(x,y) = \\arccos \\frac{\\langle x, y \\rangle}{\\|x\\| \\cdot \\|y\\|}.</math>\n\n==Properties and applications==\n{{Main article|Uses of trigonometry}}\n\nThe trigonometric functions, as the name suggests, are of crucial importance in [[trigonometry]], mainly because of the following two results.\n\n===Law of sines===\nThe '''[[law of sines]]''' states that for an arbitrary triangle with sides {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} and angles opposite those sides {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|B}} and {{mvar|C}}:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\sin A}{a} = \\frac{\\sin B}{b} = \\frac{\\sin C}{c} = \\frac{2\\Delta}{abc},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|Δ}} is the area of the triangle,\nor, equivalently,\n\n:<math>\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} = 2R,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|R}} is the triangle's [[circumscribed circle|circumradius]].\n\n[[File:Lissajous curve 5by4.svg|thumb|right|A [[Lissajous curve]], a figure formed with a trigonometry-based function.]]\n\nIt can be proven by dividing the triangle into two right ones and using the above definition of sine. The law of sines is useful for computing the lengths of the unknown sides in a triangle if two angles and one side are known. This is a common situation occurring in ''[[triangulation]]'', a technique to determine unknown distances by measuring two angles and an accessible enclosed distance.\n\n===Law of cosines===\nThe '''[[law of cosines]]''' (also known as the cosine formula or cosine rule) is an extension of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:\n\n:<math>c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\\cos C, \\, </math>\nor equivalently,\n:<math>\\cos C=\\frac{a^2+b^2-c^2}{2ab}.</math>\n\nIn this formula the angle at {{mvar|C}} is opposite to the side&nbsp;{{mvar|c}}. This theorem can be proven by dividing the triangle into two right ones and using the [[Pythagorean theorem]].\n\nThe law of cosines can be used to determine a side of a triangle if two sides and the angle between them are known.  It can also be used to find the cosines of an angle (and consequently the angles themselves) if the lengths of all the sides are known.\n\n===Law of tangents===\n{{main article|Law of tangents}}\nThe following all form the law of tangents<ref name=\"Allen_1976\"/>\n\n: <math>\n\\frac{\\tan \\dfrac{A-B}{2 }}{\\tan \\dfrac{A+B}{2 } } = \\frac{a-b}{a+b}\\,; \\qquad\n\\frac{\\tan \\dfrac{A-C}{2 }}{\\tan \\dfrac{A+C}{2 } } = \\frac{a-c}{a+c}\\,; \\qquad\n\\frac{\\tan \\dfrac{B-C}{2 }}{\\tan \\dfrac{B+C}{2 } } = \\frac{b-c}{b+c}</math>\n\nThe explanation of the formulae in words would be cumbersome, but the patterns of sums and differences, for the lengths and corresponding opposite angles, are apparent in the theorem.\n\n===Law of cotangents===\n{{main article|Law of cotangents}}\nIf\n\n: <math> \\zeta = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{s} (s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\\ </math> (the radius of the inscribed circle for the triangle)\n\nand\n\n: <math> s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2 }\\ </math> (the semi-perimeter for the triangle),\n\nthen the following all form the law of cotangents<ref name=\"Allen_1976\"/>\n\n: <math>\n\\cot{ \\frac{A}{2 }} = \\frac{s-a}{\\zeta }\\,; \\qquad\n\\cot{ \\frac{B}{2 }} = \\frac{s-b}{\\zeta }\\,; \\qquad\n\\cot{ \\frac{C}{2 }} = \\frac{s-c}{\\zeta }</math>\n\nIt follows that\n\n: <math> \\frac{\\cot \\dfrac{A}{2}}{s-a} = \\frac{\\cot \\dfrac{B}{2}}{s-b} = \\frac{\\cot \\dfrac{C}{2}}{s-c}. </math>\n\nIn words the theorem is: the cotangent of a half-angle equals the ratio of the semi-perimeter minus the opposite side to the said angle, to the inradius for the triangle.\n\n===Periodic functions===\n[[File:Synthesis square.gif|thumb|340px|right|An animation of the [[additive synthesis]] of a [[square wave]] with an increasing number of harmonics]]\n[[File:Sawtooth Fourier Animation.gif|thumb|280px|Sinusoidal basis functions (bottom) can form a sawtooth wave (top) when added. All the basis functions have nodes at the nodes of the sawtooth, and all but the fundamental ({{math|1=''k'' = 1}}) have additional nodes. The oscillation seen about the sawtooth when {{mvar|k}} is large is called the [[Gibbs phenomenon]]]]\n\nThe trigonometric functions are also important in physics. The sine and the cosine functions, for example, are used to describe [[simple harmonic motion]], which models many natural phenomena, such as the movement of a mass attached to a spring and, for small angles, the pendular motion of a mass hanging by a string. The sine and cosine functions are one-dimensional projections of [[uniform circular motion]].\n\nTrigonometric functions also prove to be useful in the study of general [[periodic function]]s. The characteristic wave patterns of periodic functions are useful for modeling recurring phenomena such as sound or light [[wave]]s.<ref name=\"Farlow_1993\"/>\n\nUnder rather general conditions, a periodic function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} can be expressed as a sum of sine waves or cosine waves in a [[Fourier series]].<ref name=\"Folland_1992\"/> Denoting the sine or cosine [[basis functions]] by {{mvar|φ<sub>k</sub>}}, the expansion of the periodic function {{math|''f''(''t'')}} takes the form:\n\n:<math>f(t) = \\sum _{k=1}^\\infty c_k \\varphi_k(t). </math>\n\nFor example, the [[square wave]] can be written as the [[Fourier series]]\n\n:<math> f_\\text{square}(t) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty {\\sin \\big( (2k-1)t \\big) \\over 2k-1}.</math>\n\nIn the animation of a square wave at top right it can be seen that just a few terms already produce a fairly good approximation. The superposition of several terms in the expansion of a [[sawtooth wave]] are shown underneath.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of trigonometric functions}}\nWhile the early study of trigonometry can be traced to antiquity, the trigonometric functions as they are in use today were developed in the medieval period. The [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] function was discovered by [[Hipparchus]] of [[İznik|Nicaea]] (180–125&nbsp;BC) and [[Ptolemy]] of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]] (90–165&nbsp;AD).\n\nThe functions sine and cosine can be traced to the [[Jyā, koti-jyā and utkrama-jyā|''jyā'' and ''koti-jyā'']] functions used in [[Gupta period]] [[Indian astronomy]] (''[[Aryabhatiya]]'', ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]''), via translation from Sanskrit to Arabic and then from Arabic to Latin.<ref name=\"Boyer_1991\"/>\n\nAll six trigonometric functions in current use were known in [[Islamic mathematics]] by the 9th century, as was the law of sines, used in [[solving triangles]].<ref name=\"Gingerich_1986\"/> [[al-Khwārizmī]] produced tables of sines, cosines and tangents.\nThey were studied by authors including [[Omar Khayyám]], [[Bhāskara II]], [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]] (14th century), [[Ulugh Beg]] (14th century), [[Regiomontanus]] (1464), [[Georg Joachim Rheticus|Rheticus]], and Rheticus' student [[Valentinus Otho]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\n[[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] (c. 1400) made early strides in the [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] of trigonometric functions in terms of [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]].<ref name=\"mact-biog\"/>\n\nThe terms ''tangent'' and ''secant'' were first introduced in 1583 by the Danish mathematician [[Thomas Fincke]] in his book ''Geometria rotundi''.<ref name=\"Fincke\"/>\n\nThe first published use of the abbreviations ''sin'', ''cos'', and ''tan'' is by the 16th century French mathematician [[Albert Girard]].\n\nIn a paper published in 1682, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] proved that {{math|sin ''x''}} is not an [[algebraic function]] of {{mvar|x}}.<ref name=\"Bourbaki_1994\"/>\n\n[[Leonhard Euler]]'s ''Introductio in analysin infinitorum'' (1748) was mostly responsible for establishing the analytic treatment of trigonometric functions in Europe, also defining them as infinite series and presenting \"[[Euler's formula]]\", as well as the near-modern abbreviations ''sin., cos., tang., cot., sec.,'' and ''cosec.''<ref name=\"Boyer_1991\"/>\n\nA few functions were common historically, but are now seldom used, such as the [[chord (geometry)|chord]] ({{math|1=crd(''θ'') = 2 sin({{sfrac|''θ''|2}})}}), the [[versine]] ({{math|1=versin(''θ'') = 1 − cos(''θ'') = 2 sin<sup>2</sup>({{sfrac|''θ''|2}})}}) (which appeared in the earliest tables<ref name=\"Boyer_1991\"/>), the [[coversine]] ({{math|1=coversin(''θ'') = 1 − sin(''θ'') = versin({{sfrac|π|2}}-''θ'')}}), the [[haversine]] ({{math|1=haversin(''θ'') = {{sfrac|1|2}}versin(''θ'') = sin<sup>2</sup>({{sfrac|''θ''|2}})}}),<ref>{{harvtxt|Nielsen|1966|pp=xxiii–xxiv}}</ref> the [[exsecant]] ({{math|1=exsec(''θ'') = sec(''θ'') − 1}}) and the [[excosecant]] ({{math|1=excsc(''θ'') = exsec({{sfrac|π|2}} − ''θ'') = csc(''θ'') − 1}}). Many more relations between these functions are listed in the article about [[List of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identities]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''sine'' derives<ref>The anglicized form is first recorded in 1593 in [[Thomas Fale]]'s ''Horologiographia, the Art of Dialling''.</ref> from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:sinus|sinus]]'', meaning \"bend; bay\", and more specifically \"the hanging fold of the upper part of a [[toga]]\", \"the bosom of a garment\", which was chosen as the translation of what was interpreted as the Arabic word ''jaib'', meaning \"pocket\" or \"fold\" in the twelfth-century translations of works by [[Al-Battani]] and [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|al-Khwārizmī]] into [[Medieval Latin]].<ref>Various sources credit the first use of ''sinus'' to either \n* [[Plato Tiburtinus]]'s 1116 translation of the ''Astronomy'' of [[Al-Battani]]\n* [[Gerard of Cremona]]'s translation of the ''Algebra'' of [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|al-Khwārizmī]]\n* [[Robert of Chester]]'s 1145 translation of the tables of al-Khwārizmī\nSee Merlet, [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-2204-2_16#page-1 ''A Note on the History of the Trigonometric Functions''] in Ceccarelli (ed.), ''International Symposium on History of Machines and Mechanisms'', Springer, 2004<br>See Maor (1998), chapter 3, for an earlier etymology crediting Gerard.<br>See {{cite book |last=Katx |first=Victor |date=July 2008 |title=A history of mathematics |edition=3rd |location=Boston |publisher=[[Pearson (publisher)|Pearson]] |page=210 (sidebar) |isbn= 978-0321387004 |language=English }}</ref>\nThe choice was based on a misreading of the Arabic written form ''j-y-b'' ({{lang|ar|[[:wikt:جيب|جيب]]}}), which itself originated as a [[transliteration]] from Sanskrit ''{{IAST|jīvā}}'', which along with its synonym ''{{IAST|jyā}}''  (the standard Sanskrit term for the sine) translates to \"bowstring\", being in turn adopted from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[Chord (geometry)|χορδή]]}} \"string\".<ref name=\"Plofker_2009\"/>\n\nThe word ''tangent'' comes from Latin ''tangens'' meaning \"touching\", since the line ''touches'' the circle of unit radius, whereas ''secant'' stems from Latin ''secans''—\"cutting\"—since the line ''cuts'' the circle.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>\n\nThe prefix \"[[co (function prefix)|co-]]\" (in \"cosine\", \"cotangent\", \"cosecant\") is found in [[Edmund Gunter]]'s ''Canon triangulorum'' (1620), which defines the ''cosinus'' as an abbreviation for the ''sinus complementi'' (sine of the [[complementary angle]]) and proceeds to define the ''cotangens'' similarly.<ref name=\"Gunter_1620\"/><ref name=\"Roegel_2010\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[All Students Take Calculus]] — a mnemonic for recalling the signs of trigonometric functions in a particular quadrant of a Cartesian plane\n* [[Aryabhata's sine table]]\n* [[Bhaskara I's sine approximation formula]]\n* [[Generalized trigonometry]]\n* [[Generating trigonometric tables]]\n* [[Hyperbolic function]]\n* [[List of periodic functions]]\n* [[List of trigonometric identities]]\n* [[Madhava series]]\n* [[Madhava's sine table]]\n* [[Polar sine]] — a generalization to vertex angles\n* [[Proofs of trigonometric identities]]\n* [[Versine]] — for several less used trigonometric functions\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Klein_1924\">{{cite book |title=Elementarmathematik vom höheren Standpunkt aus: Arithmetik, Algebra, Analysis |volume=1 |author-first=Christian Felix |author-last=Klein |author-link=Christian Felix Klein |date=1924<!-- 1927 --> |orig-year=1902<!-- 1908 --> |edition=3rd |publisher=[[J.
