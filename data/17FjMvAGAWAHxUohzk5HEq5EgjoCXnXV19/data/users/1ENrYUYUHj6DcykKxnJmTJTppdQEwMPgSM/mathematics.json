The specialization restricting the meaning of \"science\" to ''[[natural science]]'' follows the rise of [[Baconian method|Baconian science]], which contrasted \"natural science\" to [[scholasticism]], the [[Organon|Aristotelean method]] of inquiring from [[first principles]]. The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as [[biology]], [[chemistry]], or [[physics]]. [[Albert Einstein]] stated that \"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\"<ref name=certain>Einstein, p. 28.

Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the [[deductive reasoning|exploration of the logical consequences]] of assumptions. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of [[conjecture]]s in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. [[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.\n\nThe opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians{{Who|date=August 2009}} feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others{{Who|date=August 2009}} feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science). It is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of ''Science and Mathematics'', indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n==Inspiration, pure and applied mathematics, and aesthetics==\n{{main|Mathematical beauty}}\n\n{{multiple image\n|footer = [[Isaac Newton]] (left) and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (right), developers of infinitesimal calculus\n|total_width = 330\n|width1 = 407\n|height1 = 559\n|image1 = GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg\n|alt1 = Isaac Newton\n|width2 = 316\n|height2 = 400\n|image2 = Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz.jpg\n|alt2 = Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz}}\nMathematics arises from many different kinds of problems.

There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G.H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mathematician's Apology |author=Hardy, G.H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1940 |isbn=0-521-42706-1}}</ref> Mathematicians often strive to find proofs that are particularly elegant, proofs from \"The Book\" of God according to [[Paul Erdős]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy |author1=Gold, Bonnie |author2=Simons, Rogers A. |publisher=MAA |year=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Proofs from ''The Book'' |last1=Aigner |first1=Martin |last2=Ziegler |first2=Günter&nbsp;M. |authorlink2=Günter M.

Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to [[Barbara Oakley]], this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more ''abstract'' and more ''encrypted'' than those of natural language.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: \"Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language.\"</ref> Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as ''cow'') with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: \"What do I mean by abstractness? You can point to a real live ''cow'' chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters ''c–o–w'' on the page. But you can't point to a real live ''plus sign'' that the symbol '+' is modeled after – the idea underlying the plus sign is more ''abstract''.\"</ref> Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: \"By ''encryptedness'', I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition.\"</ref>\n\n[[Language of mathematics|Mathematical language]] can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as ''or'' and ''only'', have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[Field (mathematics)|field]]'' refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]'' that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as ''iff'' for \"[[if and only if]]\" belong to [[mathematical jargon]]. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as \"rigor\".\n\n[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken \"[[theorem]]s\", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.{{efn|See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof.}} The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th&nbsp;century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics<!--This part needs improvement |>>-->. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.<ref>Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, {{isbn|0-7167-1953-3}}. p. 4 \"A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly\", (in reference to the Haken–Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).</ref>\n\n[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were \"self-evident truths\", but that conception is problematic.<ref>\"The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil.\" [[Bertrand Russell]] (1919), ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', New York and London, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html p. 71.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620162751/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html |date=June 20, 2015 }}</ref> At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.<ref>Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, {{isbn|0-486-61630-4}}. p. 1, \"Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects.\"</ref>\n\n==Fields of mathematics==\n{{see also|Areas of mathematics|Glossary of areas of mathematics}}\n[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|An [[abacus]], a simple calculating tool used since ancient times]]\nMathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to [[mathematical logic|logic]], to [[set theory]] ([[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences ([[applied mathematics]]), and more recently to the rigorous study of [[uncertainty]]. While some areas might seem unrelated, the [[Langlands program]] has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].\n\n===Foundations and philosophy===\nIn order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. [[Category theory]], which deals in an abstract way with [[mathematical structure]]s and relationships between them, is still in development. The phrase \"crisis of foundations\" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.<ref>Luke Howard Hodgkin & Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.</ref> Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer–Hilbert controversy]].\n\nMathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any effective [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as well as to [[category theory]]. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a [[MRDP theorem#Further applications|consequence of the MRDP theorem]].\n\n[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model&nbsp;– the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the \"[[P = NP problem|{{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} '''NP'''?}}]]\" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5Qj76uCbF?url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org</ref> Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].\n\n:{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|<math>p \\Rightarrow q </math>|| [[File:Venn A intersect B.svg|128px]] || [[File:Commutative diagram for morphism.svg|96px]] || [[File:DFAexample.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Mathematical logic]] || [[Set theory]] || [[Category theory]] || [[Theory of computation]]\n|}\n\n===Pure mathematics===\n====Quantity====\n{{Main|Arithmetic}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->\nThe study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s (\"whole numbers\") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in [[arithmetic]]. The deeper properties of integers are studied in [[number theory]], from which come such popular results as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The [[twin prime]] conjecture and [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are two unsolved problems in number theory.\n\nAs the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a [[subset]] of the [[rational number]]s (\"[[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]\"). These, in turn, are contained within the [[real number]]s, which are used to represent [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. Real numbers are generalized to [[complex number]]s. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the [[transfinite number]]s, which formalize the concept of \"[[infinity]]\". According to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the [[cardinal number]]s. These include the [[aleph number]]s, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.\n\n:{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"20\"\n|<math>1, 2, 3,\\ldots</math> || <math>\\ldots,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\,\\ldots</math> || <math> -2, \\frac{2}{3}, 1.21</math> || <math>-e, \\sqrt{2}, 3, \\pi</math> || <math>2, i, -2+3i, 2e^{i\\frac{4\\pi}{3}}</math>\n|-\n|[[Natural number]]s|| [[Integer]]s || [[Rational number]]s || [[Real number]]s || [[Complex number]]s\n|}\n\n====Structure====\n{{Main|Algebra}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->\nMany mathematical objects, such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]].\n\nBy its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.\n\n:{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|<math>\\begin{matrix} (1,2,3) & (1,3,2) \\\\ (2,1,3) & (2,3,1) \\\\ (3,1,2) & (3,2,1) \\end{matrix}</math> || [[File:Elliptic curve simple.svg|96px]] || [[File:Rubik's cube.svg|96px]] || [[File:Group diagdram D6.svg|96px]] || [[File:Lattice of the divisibility of 60.svg|96px]] || [[File:Braid-modular-group-cover.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Combinatorics]] || [[Number theory]] || [[Group theory]] || [[Graph theory]] || [[Order theory]] || [[Algebra]]\n|}\n\n====Space====\n{{Main|Geometry}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->\nThe study of space originates with [[geometry]]&nbsp;– in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]], which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Convex geometry|Convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] were developed to solve problems in [[geometry of numbers|number theory]] and [[functional analysis]] but now are pursued with an eye on applications in [[convex optimization|optimization]] and [[computational geometry|computer science]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincaré conjecture]], and the still unsolved areas of the [[Hodge conjecture]]. Other results in geometry and topology, including the [[four color theorem]] and [[Kepler conjecture]], have been proved only with the help of computers.\n\n:{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|[[File:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem.svg|96px]] || [[File:Sinusvåg 400px.png|96px]] || [[File:Hyperbolic triangle.svg|96px]] || [[File:Torus.png|96px]] || [[File:Mandel zoom 07 satellite.jpg|96px]] || [[File:Measure illustration.png|70px]]\n|-\n|[[Geometry]] || [[Trigonometry]] || [[Differential geometry]] || [[Topology]] || [[Fractal|Fractal geometry]] || [[Measure theory]]\n|}\n\n====Change====\n{{Main|Calculus}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->\nUnderstanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[Space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.\n\n{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"20\"\n|-\n|[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|96px]] || [[File:Vector field.svg|96px]] || [[File:Navier Stokes Laminar.svg|96px]] || [[File:Limitcycle.svg|96px]] || [[File:Lorenz attractor.svg|96px]] || [[File:Conformal grid after Möbius transformation.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Calculus]] || [[Vector calculus]]|| [[Differential equation]]s || [[Dynamical system]]s || [[Chaos theory]] || [[Complex analysis]]\n|}\n\n===Applied mathematics===\n{{Main|Applied mathematics}}\n[[Applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, \"applied mathematics\" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized knowledge. The term ''applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the \"formulation, study, and use of mathematical models\" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.\n\nIn the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in [[pure mathematics]].\n\n====Statistics and other decision sciences====\n{{Main|Statistics}}\nApplied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) \"create data that makes sense\" with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]];<ref>[[C.R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|981-02-3111-3}}</ref> the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians \"make sense of the data\" using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]]&nbsp;– with [[model selection]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].{{efn|Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists.

The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.\n\nThe [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was instituted in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.\n\nA famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called \"[[Hilbert's problems]]\", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the \"[[Millennium Prize Problems]]\", was published in 2000. A solution to each of these problems carries a $1&nbsp;million reward, and only one (the [[Riemann hypothesis]]) is duplicated in Hilbert's problems.\n<!--<<<\n==Common misconceptions==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}\n{{Original research|date=August 2009}}\nMathematics is not a closed intellectual system, in which everything has already been worked out.
