The [[graph of a function|graph]] of such a function of one variable is a nonvertical line. {{mvar|''a''}} is frequently referred to as the slope of the line, and {{mvar|''b''}} as the intercept.\n\nFor a function <math>f(x_1, \\ldots, x_k)</math> of any finite number of [[independent variable]]s, the general formula is\n:<math>f(x_1, \\ldots, x_k) = b + a_1 x_1 + \\ldots + a_k x_k</math>,\nand the graph is a [[hyperplane]] of dimension {{nowrap|''k''}}.\n\nA [[constant function]] is also considered linear in this context, as it is a polynomial of degree zero or is the zero polynomial. Its graph, when there is only one independent variable, is a horizontal line.\n\nIn this context, the other meaning (a linear map) may be referred to as a [[homogeneous function|homogeneous]] linear function or a [[linear form]].  In the context of linear algebra, this meaning (polynomial functions of degree 0 or 1) is a special kind of [[affine map]].\n\n== As a linear map ==\n{{main article|Linear map}}\n[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|thumb|The [[integral]] of a function is a linear map from the vector space of integrable functions to the real numbers.]]\n\nIn linear algebra, a linear function is a map ''f'' between two [[vector space]]s that preserves [[vector addition]] and [[scalar multiplication]]:\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}) = f(\\mathbf{x}) + f(\\mathbf{y}) </math>\n:<math>f(a\\mathbf{x}) = af(\\mathbf{x}). </math>\nHere {{math|''a''}} denotes a constant belonging to some [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''K''}} of [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s (for example, the [[real number]]s) and {{math|'''x'''}} and {{math|'''y'''}} are elements of a [[vector space]], which might be {{math|''K''}} itself.\n\nSome authors use \"linear function\" only for linear maps that take values in the scalar field;<ref>Gelfand 1961</ref> these are also called [[linear functional]]s.\n\nThe \"linear functions\" of calculus qualify as \"linear maps\" when (and only when) <math>f([0,\\ldots,0]) = 0</math>, or, equivalently, when the constant <math>b = 0</math>.  Geometrically, the graph of the function must pass through the origin.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Homogeneous function]]\n* [[Nonlinear system]]\n* [[Piecewise linear function]]\n* [[Linear interpolation]]\n* [[Discontinuous linear map]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n* Izrail Moiseevich Gelfand (1961), ''Lectures on Linear Algebra'', Interscience Publishers, Inc., New York.
