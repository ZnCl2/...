Like the natural numbers, {{math|'''Z'''}} is [[Countable set|countably infinite]].\n\nThe integers form the smallest [[Group (mathematics)|group]] and the smallest [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] containing the [[natural number]]s. In [[algebraic number theory]], the integers are sometimes called '''rational integers''' to distinguish them from the more general [[algebraic integer]]s. In fact, the (rational) integers are the algebraic integers that are also [[rational number]]s.\n\n==Symbol==\n\nThe symbol {{math|'''Z'''}} can be annotated to denote various sets, with varying usage amongst different authors: {{math|'''Z'''<sup>+</sup>}}, {{math|'''Z'''<sub>+</sub>}} or {{math|'''Z'''<sup>></sup>}} for the positive integers, {{math|'''Z'''<sup>≥</sup>}} for non-negative integers, {{math|'''Z'''<sup>≠</sup>}} for non-zero integers. Some authors use {{math|'''Z'''<sup>*</sup>}} for non-zero integers, others use it for non-negative integers, or for {{math|{–1, 1}{{void}}}}. Additionally, {{math|'''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is used to denote either the set of [[integers modulo n|integers modulo {{math|''p''}}]], i.e., a set of [[congruence relation|congruence classes]] of integers, or the set of [[p-adic integer|{{math|''p''}}-adic integers]].\n<ref name=edexcelc1>Keith Pledger and Dave Wilkins, \"Edexcel AS and A Level Modular Mathematics: Core Mathematics 1\" Pearson 2008</ref>\n<ref>LK Turner, FJ BUdden, D Knighton, \"Advanced Mathematics\", Book 2, Longman 1975.</ref>  \n<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Z-Star.html</ref>\n\n== Algebraic properties ==\n[[File:Number-line.svg|right|thumb|300px|Integers can be thought of as discrete, equally spaced points on an infinitely long [[number line]]. In the above, non-[[Sign (mathematics)#Terminology for signs|negative]] integers are shown in purple and negative integers in red.]]\n\nLike the [[natural numbers]], {{math|'''Z'''}} is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the [[binary operation|operations]] of addition and [[multiplication]], that is, the sum and product of any two integers is an integer. However, with the inclusion of the negative natural numbers, and, importantly,&nbsp;{{num|0}}, {{math|'''Z'''}} (unlike the natural numbers) is also closed under [[subtraction]]. The integers form a [[unital ring]] which is the most basic one, in the following sense: for any unital ring, there is a unique [[ring homomorphism]] from the integers into this ring. This [[universal property]], namely to be an [[initial object]] in the [[category of rings]], characterizes the ring&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}}.\n\n{{math|'''Z'''}} is not closed under [[division (mathematics)|division]], since the quotient of two integers (e.g.,&nbsp;1 divided by&nbsp;2), need not be an integer. Although the natural numbers are closed under [[exponentiation]], the integers are not (since the result can be a fraction when the exponent is negative).\n\nThe following lists some of the basic properties of addition and multiplication for any integers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}}.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Properties of addition and multiplication on integers\n!\n!scope=\"col\" |Addition \n!scope=\"col\" |Multiplication\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Closure (mathematics)|Closure]]: \n|{{math|''a'' + ''b''}}{{pad|1em}}is an integer \n|{{math|''a'' × ''b''}}{{pad|1em}}is an integer\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Associativity]]: \n|{{math|''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}\n|{{math|''a'' × (''b'' × ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' × ''b'') × ''c''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Commutativity]]: \n|{{math|''a'' + ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' + ''a''}}\n|{{math|''a'' × ''b'' {{=}} ''b'' × ''a''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Existence of an [[identity element]]: \n|{{math|''a'' + 0 {{=}} ''a''}} \n|{{math|''a'' × 1 {{=}} ''a''}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Existence of [[inverse element]]s: \n|{{math|''a'' + (−''a'') {{=}} 0}} \n|The only invertible rational integers (called units) are {{math|−1}} and&nbsp;{{math|1}}.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |[[Distributivity]]: \n|colspan=2 align=center |{{math|''a'' × (''b'' + ''c'') {{=}} (''a'' × ''b'') + (''a'' × ''c'')}}{{pad|1em}}and{{pad|1em}}{{math|(''a'' + ''b'') × ''c'' {{=}} (''a'' × ''c'') + (''b'' × ''c'')}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |No [[zero divisor]]s: \n| || | If {{math|''a'' × ''b'' {{=}} 0}}, then {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''b'' {{=}} 0}} (or both)\n|}\n\nIn the language of [[abstract algebra]], the first five properties listed above for addition say that {{math|'''Z'''}} under addition is an [[abelian group]]. As a group under addition, {{math|'''Z'''}} is a [[cyclic group]], since every non-zero integer can be written as a finite sum {{nowrap|1 + 1 + … + 1}} or {{nowrap|(−1) + (−1) + … + (−1)}}. In fact, {{math|'''Z'''}} under addition is the ''only'' infinite cyclic group, in the sense that any infinite cyclic group is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to {{math|'''Z'''}}.\n\nThe first four properties listed above for multiplication say that {{math|'''Z'''}} under multiplication is a [[commutative monoid]]. However, not every integer has a multiplicative inverse; e.g., there is no integer {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|2''x'' {{=}} 1,}} because the left hand side is even, while the right hand side is odd. This means that {{math|'''Z'''}} under multiplication is not a group.\n\nAll the rules from the above property table, except for the last, taken together say that {{math|'''Z'''}} together with addition and multiplication is a [[commutative ring]] with [[multiplicative identity|unity]]. It is the prototype of all objects of such [[algebraic structure]]. Only those [[equality (mathematics)|equalities]] of [[algebraic expression|expressions]] are true in&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}} [[for all]] values of variables, which are true in any unital commutative ring. Note that certain non-zero integers map to [[additive identity|zero]] in certain rings.\n\nThe lack of [[zero divisor]]s in the integers (last property in the table) means that the commutative ring&nbsp;{{math|'''Z'''}} is an [[integral domain]].\n\nThe lack of multiplicative inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that {{math|'''Z'''}} is not closed under division, means that {{math|'''Z'''}} is ''not'' a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. The smallest field containing the integers as a [[subring]] is the field of [[rational number]]s. The process of constructing the rationals from the integers can be mimicked to form the [[field of fractions]] of any integral domain. And back, starting from an [[algebraic number field]] (an extension of rational numbers), its [[ring of integers]] can be extracted, which includes {{math|'''Z'''}} as its [[subring]].\n\nMoreover, {{math|'''Z'''}} is a [[principal ideal]].<ref>{{citation | last=Serge|first = Lang |authorlink=Serge Lang |title = Algebra |edition=3rd| publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-201-55540-9|pp =86–87}}</ref>\n\nAlthough ordinary division is not defined on {{math|'''Z'''}}, the division \"with remainder\" is defined on them. It is called [[Euclidean division]] and possesses the following important property: that is, given two integers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} with {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}}, there exist unique integers {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''r''}} such that {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''q'' × ''b'' + ''r''}} and {{math|0 ≤ ''r'' <  {{!}}&thinsp;''b''&thinsp;{{!}}}}, where {{math|{{!}}&thinsp;''b''&thinsp;{{!}}}} denotes the [[absolute value]] of {{math|''b''}}. The integer {{math|''q''}} is called the ''quotient'' and {{math|''r''}} is called the ''[[remainder]]'' of the division of {{math|''a''}} by {{math|''b''}}. The [[Euclidean algorithm]] for computing [[greatest common divisor]]s works by a sequence of Euclidean divisions.\n\nAgain, in the language of abstract algebra, the above says that '''Z''' is a [[Euclidean domain]]. This implies that {{math|'''Z'''}} is a [[principal ideal domain]] and any positive integer can be written as the products of [[prime number|primes]] in an essentially unique way. This is the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].\n\n==Order-theoretic properties==\n{{math|'''Z'''}} is a [[total order|totally ordered set]] without upper or lower bound. The ordering of {{math|'''Z'''}} is given by:\n{{math|:… −3 < −2 < −1 < 0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < …}}\nAn integer is ''positive'' if it is greater than zero and ''negative'' if it is less than zero. Zero is defined as neither negative nor positive.\n\nThe ordering of integers is compatible with the algebraic operations in the following way:\n#if {{math|''a'' < ''b''}} and {{math|''c'' < ''d''}}, then {{math|''a'' + ''c'' < ''b'' + ''d''}}\n#if {{math|''a'' < ''b''}} and {{math|0 < ''c''}}, then {{math|''ac'' < ''bc''}}.\n\nIt follows that {{math|'''Z'''}} together with the above ordering is an [[ordered ring]].\n\nThe integers are the only nontrivial totally ordered abelian group whose positive elements are [[well-ordered]].<ref>{{citation|title=Modern Algebra|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first=Seth|last=Warner|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=2012|isbn=9780486137094|at=Theorem 20.14, p.&nbsp;185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqHDAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA185}}.</ref> This is equivalent to the statement that any [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[valuation ring]] is either a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] or a [[discrete valuation ring]].\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Relative numbers representation.svg|thumb|alt=Representation of equivalence classes for the numbers −5 to 5\n|Red points represent ordered pairs of [[natural number]]s. Linked red points are equivalence classes representing the blue integers at the end of the line.|upright=2]]\nIn elementary school teaching, integers are often intuitively defined as the (positive) natural numbers,  [[zero]], and the negations of the natural numbers. However, this style of definition leads to many different cases (each arithmetic operation needs to be defined on each combination of types of integer) and makes it tedious to prove that these operations obey the laws of arithmetic.<ref>{{citation|title=Number Systems and the Foundations of Analysis|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first=Elliott|last=Mendelson|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2008|isbn=9780486457925|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3domViIV7HMC&pg=PA86}}.</ref> Therefore, in modern set-theoretic mathematics a more abstract construction,<ref>Ivorra Castillo: ''Álgebra''</ref> which allows one to define the arithmetical operations without any case distinction, is often used instead.<ref>{{citation|title=Learning to Teach Number: A Handbook for Students and Teachers in the Primary School|series=The Stanley Thornes Teaching Primary Maths Series|first=Len|last=Frobisher|publisher=Nelson Thornes|year=1999|isbn=9780748735150|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwJQIt4jQHUC&pg=PA126}}.</ref> The integers can thus be formally constructed as the [[equivalence class]]es of [[ordered pair]]s of [[natural number]]s {{math|(''a'',''b'')}}.<ref name=\"Campbell-1970-p83\">{{cite book |author=Campbell, Howard E. |title=The structure of arithmetic |publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts |year=1970 |isbn=0-390-16895-5 |page=83}}</ref>\n\nThe intuition is that {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} stands for the result of subtracting {{math|''b''}} from {{math|''a''}}.<ref name=\"Campbell-1970-p83\"/> To confirm our expectation that {{nowrap|1 − 2}} and {{nowrap|4 − 5}} denote the same number, we define an [[equivalence relation]] {{math|~}} on these pairs with the following rule:\n:<math>(a,b) \\sim (c,d) </math>\nprecisely when\n:<math>a + d = b + c. </math>\n\nAddition and multiplication of integers can be defined in terms of the equivalent operations on the natural numbers;<ref name=\"Campbell-1970-p83\"/> denoting by {{math|[(''a'',''b'')]}} the equivalence class having {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} as a member, one has:\n:<math>[(a,b)] + [(c,d)] := [(a+c,b+d)].</math>\n:<math>[(a,b)]\\cdot[(c,d)] := [(ac+bd,ad+bc)].</math>\n\nThe negation (or additive inverse) of an integer is obtained by reversing the order of the pair:\n:<math>-[(a,b)] := [(b,a)].</math>\n\nHence subtraction can be defined as the addition of the additive inverse:\n:<math>[(a,b)] - [(c,d)] := [(a+d,b+c)].</math>\n\nThe standard ordering on the integers is given by:\n:<math>[(a,b)] < [(c,d)]</math> [[If and only if|iff]] <math>a+d < b+c.</math>\n\nIt is easily verified that these definitions are independent of the choice of representatives of the equivalence classes.\n\nEvery equivalence class has a unique member that is of the form {{math|(''n'',0)}} or {{math|(0,''n'')}} (or both at once). The natural number {{math|''n''}} is identified with the class {{math|[(''n'',0)]}} (in other words the natural numbers are [[embedding|embedded]] into the integers by map sending {{math|''n''}} to {{math|[(''n'',0)]}}), and the class {{math|[(0,''n'')]}} is denoted {{math|−''n''}} (this covers all remaining classes, and gives the class {{math|[(0,0)]}} a second time since {{math|−0 {{=}} 0.}}\n\nThus, {{math|[(''a'',''b'')]}} is denoted by\n:<math>\\begin{cases} a - b, & \\mbox{if }  a \\ge b  \\\\ -(b - a),  & \\mbox{if } a < b. \\end{cases}</math>\n\nIf the natural numbers are identified with the corresponding integers (using the embedding mentioned above), this convention creates no ambiguity.\n\nThis notation recovers the familiar [[group representation|representation]] of the integers as  {{math|{…, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …}}}.\n\nSome examples are:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n 0 &= [(0,0)] &= [(1,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k)] \\\\\n 1 &= [(1,0)] &= [(2,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k+1,k)] \\\\\n-1 &= [(0,1)] &= [(1,2)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k+1)] \\\\\n 2 &= [(2,0)] &= [(3,1)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k+2,k)] \\\\\n-2 &= [(0,2)] &= [(1,3)] &= \\cdots & &= [(k,k+2)].\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn theoretical computer science, other approaches for the construction of integers are used by [[Automated theorem proving|automated theorem provers]] and [[Rewriting|term rewrite engines]]. \nIntegers are represented as [[Term algebra|algebraic terms]] built using a few basic operations  (such as '''zero''', '''succ''', '''pred''', etc.) and, possibly, using [[Natural number|natural numbers]], which are assumed to be already constructed (e.g., using the Peano approach).\n\nThere exist at least a tenth of such constructions of signed integers.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Garavel |first=Hubert |title=On the Most Suitable Axiomatization of Signed Integers |conference=Post-proceedings of the 23rd International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques (WADT'2016) |year=2017 |publisher=Springer |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=10644 |pages=120-134 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-72044-9_9 |url= https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01667321}}</ref> These constructions differ in several ways: the number of basic operations used for the construction, the number (usually, between 0 and 2) and the types of arguments accepted by these operations; the presence or absence of natural numbers as arguments of some of these operations, and the fact that these operations are free constructors or not, i.e., that the same integer can be represented using only one or many algebraic terms.\n\nThe technique for the construction of integers presented above in this section corresponds to the particular case where there is a single basic operation '''pair'''<math>(x,y)</math> that takes as arguments two natural numbers <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, and returns an integer (equal to <math>x-y</math>). This operation is not free since the integer 0 can be written '''pair'''(0,0), or '''pair'''(1,1), or '''pair'''(2,2), etc. This technique of construction is used by the [[proof assistant]] [[Isabelle_(proof_assistant)|Isabelle]]; however, many other tools use alternative construction techniques, notable those based upon free constructors, which are simpler and can be implemented more efficiently in computers.\n\n==Computer science==\n{{Main|Integer (computer science)}}\nAn integer is often a primitive [[data type]] in [[computer language]]s. However, integer data types can only represent a [[subset]] of all integers, since practical computers are of finite capacity. Also, in the common [[two's complement]] representation, the inherent definition of [[sign (mathematics)|sign]] distinguishes between \"negative\" and \"non-negative\" rather than \"negative, positive, and&nbsp;0\". (It is, however, certainly possible for a computer to determine whether an integer value is truly positive.) Fixed length integer approximation data types (or subsets) are denoted ''int'' or Integer in several programming languages (such as [[Algol68]], [[C (computer language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Object Pascal|Delphi]], etc.).\n\nVariable-length representations of integers, such as [[bignum]]s, can store any integer that fits in the computer's memory. Other integer data types are implemented with a fixed size, usually a number of bits which is a power of&nbsp;2 (4, 8, 16, etc.) or a memorable number of decimal digits (e.g., 9 or&nbsp;10).\n\n==Cardinality==\nThe [[cardinality]] of the set of integers is equal to {{math|ℵ{{sub|0}}}} ([[Aleph number|aleph-null]]). This is readily demonstrated by the construction of a [[bijection]], that is, a function that is [[injective]] and [[surjective]] from {{math|'''Z'''}} to {{math|'''N'''}}.\nIf {{math|'''N''' {{=}} <nowiki>{</nowiki>0, 1, 2, …&#125;}} then consider the function:\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases} 2|x|,  & \\mbox{if } x \\leq 0\\\\ 2x-1, & \\mbox{if }  x > 0. \\end{cases} </math>\n{{math|<nowiki>{…</nowiki> (−4,8) (−3,6) (−2,4) (−1,2) (0,0) (1,1) (2,3) (3,5) …&#125;}}\n\nIf {{math|'''N''' {{=}} <nowiki>{</nowiki>1, 2, 3, ...&#125;}} then consider the function:\n:<math>g(x) = \\begin{cases} 2|x|,  & \\mbox{if } x < 0 \\\\ 2x+1, & \\mbox{if }  x \\ge 0. \\end{cases} </math>\n{{math|{… (−4,8) (−3,6) (−2,4) (−1,2) (0,1) (1,3) (2,5) (3,7) …&#125;}}\n\nIf the domain is restricted to {{math|'''Z'''}} then each and every member of {{math|'''Z'''}} has one and only one corresponding member of '''N''' and by the definition of cardinal equality the two sets have equal cardinality.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n*[[0.999...]]\n*[[Canonical representation of a positive integer]]\n*[[Hyperinteger]]\n*[[Integer-valued function]]\n*[[Integer lattice]]\n*[[Integer part]]\n*[[Integer sequence]]\n*[[Profinite integer]]\n* [[Mathematical symbols]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*[[Eric Temple Bell|Bell, E.T.]], ''[[Men of Mathematics]].''
