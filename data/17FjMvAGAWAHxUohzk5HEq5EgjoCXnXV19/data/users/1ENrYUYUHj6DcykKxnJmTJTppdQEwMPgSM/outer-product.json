The outer product of two coordinate vectors <math>\\mathbf{u}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{v}</math>, denoted <math>\\mathbf{u} \\otimes \\mathbf{v}</math>, is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] <math>\\mathbf{w}</math> such that the coordinates satisfy <math>w_{ij} = u_i v_j</math>. The outer product for general tensors is also called the [[tensor product]].\n\nThe outer product contrasts with the [[dot product]], which takes as input a pair of coordinate vectors and produces a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]].\n\nThe outer product is also a related function in some computer programming languages.\n\n==Definition (matrix multiplication)==\n{{main|matrix multiplication}}\n\nThe outer product {{nowrap|'''u''' ⊗ '''v'''}} is equivalent to a matrix multiplication '''uv'''<sup>T</sup>, provided that '''u''' is represented as a {{nowrap|''m'' × 1}} [[column vector]] and '''v''' as a {{nowrap|''n'' × 1}} column vector (which makes '''v'''<sup>T</sup> a row vector).<ref>{{cite book |title=Linear Algebra |edition=4th |first=S. |last=Lipschutz |first2=M. |last2=Lipson |series=Schaum’s Outlines |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-07-154352-1 }}</ref> For instance, if {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 4}} and {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}, then\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\mathbf{u} \\otimes \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{v}^\\mathrm{T}\n= \\begin{bmatrix}u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\\\ u_3 \\\\ u_4\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}v_1 & v_2 & v_3\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\begin{bmatrix}u_1v_1 & u_1v_2 & u_1v_3 \\\\ u_2v_1 & u_2v_2 & u_2v_3 \\\\ u_3v_1 & u_3v_2 & u_3v_3 \\\\ u_4v_1 & u_4v_2 & u_4v_3\\end{bmatrix}.\\end{align}</math>\n\nOr in index notation:\n\n:<math>(\\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{v}^\\mathrm{T})_{ij}=u_iv_j</math>\n\nFor [[complex numbers|complex]] vectors, it is customary to use the [[conjugate transpose]] of '''v''' (denoted '''v'''<sup>H</sup>):\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} \\otimes \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{v}^\\mathrm{H}.</math>\n\n===Contrast with Euclidean inner product===\n\nIf {{nowrap|1=''m'' = ''n''}}, then one can take the matrix product the other way, yielding a scalar (or {{nowrap|1 × 1}} matrix):\n:<math>\\left\\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}\\right\\rangle = \\mathbf{u}^\\mathrm{T} \\mathbf{v}</math>\nwhich is the standard [[inner product]] for [[Euclidean vector space]]s, better known as the [[dot product]]. The inner product is the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the outer product.\n\n===Rank of an outer product===\n\nIf '''u''' and '''v''' are both nonzero then the outer product matrix '''uv'''<sup>T</sup> always has [[Rank (linear algebra)|matrix rank]] 1, as can be easily seen by multiplying it with a vector '''x''':\n\n:<math>(\\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{v}^\\mathrm{T}) \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{u} (\\mathbf{v}^\\mathrm{T} \\mathbf{x})</math>\nwhich is just a scalar '''v'''<sup>T</sup>'''x''' multiplied by a vector '''u'''.\n\n(\"Matrix rank\" should not be confused with \"[[tensor order]]\", or \"tensor degree\", which is sometimes referred to as \"rank\".)\n\n==Definition (vectors and tensors)==\n\n===Vector multiplication===\n\nGiven the vectors\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} =(u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_m)</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n)</math>\n\ntheir outer product {{nowrap|'''u''' ⊗ '''v'''}} is defined as the {{nowrap|''m'' × ''n''}} matrix '''A''' obtained by multiplying each element of '''u''' by each element of '''v''':<ref>{{cite web |title=Kronecker Product |work=Wolfram MathWorld |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KroneckerProduct.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia of Physics |edition=2nd |first=R.

Namely, matrix '''A''' is obtained by multiplying each element of '''u''' by the complex conjugate of each element of '''v'''.\n\n===Tensor multiplication===\n\nThe outer product on tensors is typically referred to as the [[tensor product]]. Given a [[tensor]] '''a''' of [[tensor order|order]] ''q'' with [[Dimension (vector space)|dimension]]s {{nowrap|(''i''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''i''<sub>''q''</sub>)}}, and a tensor '''b''' of order ''r'' with dimensions {{nowrap|(''j''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''j''<sub>''r''</sub>)}}, their outer product '''c''' is of order {{nowrap|''q'' + ''r''}} with dimensions {{nowrap|(''k''<sub>'''1'''</sub>, ..., ''k''<sub>''q''+''r''</sub>)}} which are the ''i''&nbsp; dimensions followed by the ''j''&nbsp; dimensions.

If '''A''' has a component {{nowrap|1=''A''<sub>[2, 2, 4]</sub> = 11}} and '''B''' has a component {{nowrap|1=''B''<sub>[8, 88]</sub> = 13}}, then the component of '''C''' formed by the outer product is {{nowrap|1=''C''<sub>[2, 2, 4, 8, 88]</sub> = 143}}.\n\nTo understand the matrix definition of outer product in terms of the definition of tensor product:\n\n# The vector '''v''' can be interpreted as an order-1 tensor with dimension ''M'', and the vector '''u''' as an order-1 tensor with dimension ''N''.  The result is an order-2 tensor with dimension {{nowrap|(''M'', ''N'')}}.\n# The order of the result of an [[inner product]] between two tensors of order ''q'' and ''r'' is the greater of {{nowrap|''q'' + ''r'' − 2}} and 0.  Thus, the inner product of two matrices has the same order as the outer product (or tensor product) of two vectors.\n# It is possible to add arbitrarily many leading or trailing ''1'' dimensions to a tensor without fundamentally altering its structure.  These ''1'' dimensions would alter the character of operations on these tensors, so any resulting equivalences should be expressed explicitly.\n# The inner product of two matrices '''V''' with dimensions {{nowrap|(''d'', ''e'')}} and '''U''' with dimensions {{nowrap|(''e'', ''f'')}} is <math>\\sum_{j = 1}^e V_{ij} U_{jk}</math>, where {{nowrap|1=''i'' = 1, 2, ..., ''d''}} and {{nowrap|1=''k'' = 1, 2, ..., ''f''}}. For the case where {{nowrap|1=''e'' = 1}}, the summation is trivial (involving only a single term).\n# The outer product of two matrices '''V''' with dimensions {{nowrap|(''m'', ''n'')}} and '''U''' with dimensions {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}} is <math> C_{st} = V_{ij} U_{hk}</math>, where {{nowrap|1=''s'' = 1, 2, ..., ''mp'' − 1, ''mp''}} and {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 1, 2, ..., ''nq'' − 1, ''nq''}}.\n\n==Definition (abstract)==\nLet ''V'' and ''W'' be two [[vector space]]s, and let ''W''<sup>∗</sup> be the [[dual space]] of ''W''.\nGiven vectors {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''V''}} and {{nowrap|''y'' ∈ ''W''<sup>∗</sup>}}, then the tensor product {{nowrap|''y'' ⊗ ''x''}} corresponds to the map {{nowrap|''A'' : W → ''V''}} given by\n\n:<math>w \\mapsto y(w)x.</math>\n\nHere ''y''(''w'') denotes the value of the [[linear functional]] ''y'' (which is an element of the dual space of ''W'') when evaluated at the element {{nowrap|''w'' ∈ ''W''}}.  This scalar in turn is multiplied by ''x'' to give as the final result an element of the space ''V''.\n\nIf ''V'' and ''W'' are finite-dimensional, then the space of all linear transformations from ''W'' to ''V'', denoted {{nowrap|Hom(''W'', ''V'')}}, is generated by such outer products; in fact, the rank of a matrix is the minimal number of such outer products needed to express it as a sum (this is the '''tensor rank''' of a matrix).  In this case {{nowrap|Hom(''W'', ''V'')}} is [[isomorphic]] to {{nowrap|''W''<sup>∗</sup> ⊗ ''V''}}.\n\n===Contrast with duality pairing===\n\nIf {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''V''}}, then one can pair the covector {{nowrap|''w'' ∈ ''V''<sup>∗</sup>}} with the vector {{nowrap|''v'' ∈ ''V''}} via the map {{nowrap|(''w'', ''v'') ↦ ''w''(''v'')}}, which is the duality pairing between ''V'' and its dual.\n\n==In programming languages==\n\nIn some programming languages, given a two-argument function ''f'' (or a binary operator), the outer product of ''f'' and two one-dimensional arrays A and B is a two-dimensional array C such that C[i,j] = f(A[i],B[j]). This is syntactically represented in various ways: in [[APL programming language|APL]], as the infix binary operator °.''f''; in [[R programming language|R]], as the function outer(A, B, ''f'');<ref>{{cite web |title=outer function |work=RDocumentation |date= |url=https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sets/versions/1.0-16/topics/outer }}</ref> in [[Wolfram Mathematica|Mathematica]], as Outer[''f'',A,B]. In MATLAB, the function kron(A,B) is used for this product. These often generalize to multi-dimensional arguments, and more than two arguments.\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe outer product is useful in computing physical quantities (e.g., the [[Moment of inertia|tensor of inertia]]), and performing transform operations in [[digital signal processing]] and [[digital image processing]].  It is also useful in [[statistical analysis]] for computing the [[Covariance matrix|covariance]] and auto-covariance matrices for two vector-valued [[random variables]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Linear algebra]]\n* [[Norm (mathematics)]]\n* [[Scatter matrix]]\n* [[Ricci calculus]]\n\n===Products===\n* [[Cross product]]\n* [[Exterior product]]\n* [[Cartesian product]]\n\n===Duality===\n* [[Complex conjugate]]\n* [[Conjugate transpose]]\n* [[Transpose]]\n* [[Bra–ket notation#Outer products|Bra–ket notation for outer product]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Linear algebra}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Outer Product}}\n[[Category:Bilinear operators]]\n[[Category:Binary operations]]\n[[Category:Higher-order functions]]",
