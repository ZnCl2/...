            "text": "{{see also|Examples of differential equations}}\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''ordinary differential equation''' ('''ODE''') is a [[differential equation]] containing one or more functions of one [[independent variable]] and its [[derivative]]s. The term ''ordinary'' is used in contrast with the term [[partial differential equation]] which may be with respect to ''more than'' one independent variable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hsm.stackexchange.com/a/5032/1772 |title=What is the origin of the term \"ordinary differential equations\"? |accessdate=2016-07-28 |website=hsm.stackexchange.com |publisher=[[Stack Exchange]] }}</ref>\n\nODEs that are [[linear differential equation]]s have exact [[Closed-form expression|closed-form solutions]] that can be added and multiplied by coefficients. By contrast, ODEs that lack additive solutions are nonlinear, and solving them is far more intricate, as one can rarely represent them by [[elementary functions]] in closed form: Instead, exact and analytic solutions of ODEs are in series or integral form.  Graphical and [[numerical ordinary differential equations|numerical]] methods, applied by hand or by computer, may approximate solutions of ODEs and perhaps yield useful information, often sufficing in the absence of exact, analytic solutions.\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Parabolic trajectory.svg|right|thumb|250px|alt=parabolic projectile motion showing velocity vector|The [[trajectory]] of a [[projectile]] launched from a [[cannon]] follows a curve determined by an ordinary differential equation that is derived from Newton's second law.]]\n\nOrdinary differential equations (ODEs) arise in many contexts of mathematics and science ([[social science|social]] as well as [[natural science|natural]]). Mathematical descriptions of change use differentials and derivatives. Various differentials, derivatives, and functions become related to each other via equations, and thus a differential equation is a result that describes dynamically changing phenomena, evolution, and variation. Often, quantities are defined as the rate of change of other quantities (for example, derivatives of displacement with respect to time), or gradients of quantities, which is how they enter differential equations.\n\nSpecific mathematical fields include [[geometry]] and [[analytical mechanics]]. Scientific fields include much of [[physics]] and [[astronomy]] (celestial mechanics), [[meteorology]] (weather modelling), [[chemistry]] (reaction rates),<ref>Mathematics for Chemists, D.M. Hirst, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Press]], 1976, (No ISBN) SBN: 333-18172-7</ref> [[biology]] (infectious diseases, genetic variation), [[ecology]] and [[population modelling]] (population competition), [[economics]] (stock trends, interest rates and the market equilibrium price changes).\n\nMany mathematicians have studied differential equations and contributed to the field, including [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], the [[Bernoulli family]], [[Riccati]],  [[Alexis Claude Clairaut|Clairaut]], [[d'Alembert]], and [[Euler]].\n\nA simple example is [[Newton's second law]] of motion &mdash; the relationship between the displacement ''x'' and the time ''t'' of an object under the force ''F'', is given by the differential equation\n\n:<math>m \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = F(x(t))\\,</math>\n\nwhich constrains the motion of a particle of constant mass ''m''. In general, ''F'' is a function of the position ''x''(''t'') of the particle at time ''t''. The unknown function ''x''(''t'') appears on both sides of the differential equation, and is indicated in the notation ''F''(''x''(''t'')).<ref>{{harvtxt|Kreyszig|1972|p=64}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Simmons|1972|pp=1,2}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Halliday|Resnick|1977|p=78}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Tipler|1991|pp=78–83}}</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nIn what follows, let ''y'' be a [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]] and ''x'' an [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]], and ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') is an unknown function of ''x''. The [[notation for differentiation]] varies depending upon the author and upon which notation is most useful for the task at hand. In this context, the [[notation for differentiation#Leibniz's notation|Leibniz's notation]] (''dy''/''dx'',''d''<sup>2</sup>''y''/''dx''<sup>2</sup>,...,''d''<sup>''n''</sup>''y''/''dx''<sup>''n''</sup>) is more useful for differentiation and [[Integration (mathematics)|integration]], whereas [[notation for differentiation#Lagrange's notation|Lagrange's notation]] (''y&prime;'',''y&prime;&prime;'', ..., ''y''<sup>(''n'')</sup>) is more useful for representing derivatives of any order compactly, and [[notation for differentiation#Newton's notation|Newton's notation]] <math>(\\dot y, \\ddot y, \\overset{...}{y})</math> is often used in physics for representing derivatives of low order with respect to time.\n\n===General definition===\nGiven ''F'', a function of ''x'', ''y'', and derivatives of ''y''.

In the same sources, implicit ODE systems with a singular Jacobian are termed [[differential algebraic equation]]s (DAEs). This distinction is not merely one of terminology; DAEs have fundamentally different characteristics and are generally more involved to solve than (nonsingular) ODE systems.<ref name=\"AscherPetzold1998\">{{cite book|author1=Uri M.

A solution defined on all of '''R''' is called a ''global solution''.\n\nA ''general solution'' of an ''n''th-order equation is a solution containing ''n'' arbitrary independent [[constant of integration|constants of integration]].  A ''particular solution'' is derived from the general solution by setting the constants to particular values, often chosen to fulfill set '[[initial value problem|initial conditions]] or [[boundary value problem|boundary conditions]]'.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kreyszig|1972|p=78}}</ref>  A [[singular solution]] is a solution that cannot be obtained by assigning definite values to the arbitrary constants in the general solution.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kreyszig|1972|p=4}}</ref>\n\n==Theories==\n\n===Singular solutions===\nThe theory of [[singular solution]]s of ordinary and [[partial differential equation]]s was a subject of research from the time of Leibniz, but only since the middle of the nineteenth century did it receive special attention. A valuable but little-known work on the subject is that of Houtain (1854). [[Jean Gaston Darboux|Darboux]] (starting in 1873) was a leader in the theory, and in the geometric interpretation of these solutions he opened a field worked by various\nwriters, notable ones being [[Felice Casorati (mathematician)|Casorati]] and [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]]. To the latter is due (1872) the theory of singular solutions of differential equations of the first order as accepted circa 1900.\n\n===Reduction to quadratures===\nThe primitive attempt in dealing with differential equations had in view a reduction to [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]]s. As it had been the hope of eighteenth-century algebraists to find a method for solving the general equation of the ''n''th degree, so it was the hope of analysts to find a general method for integrating any differential equation. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (1799) showed, however, that the differential equation meets its limitations very soon unless [[complex number]]s are introduced. Hence, analysts began to substitute the study of functions, thus opening a new and fertile field. [[Cauchy]] was the first to appreciate the importance of this view.  Thereafter, the real question was to be not whether a solution is possible by means of known functions or their integrals but whether a given differential equation suffices for the definition of a function of the independent variable or variables, and, if so, what are the characteristic properties of this function.\n\n===Fuchsian theory===\n{{main article|Frobenius method}}\nTwo memoirs by [[Lazarus Fuchs|Fuchs]] (''Crelle'', 1866, 1868), inspired a novel approach, subsequently elaborated by Thomé and [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]]. Collet was a prominent contributor beginning in 1869, although his method for integrating a non-linear system was communicated to Bertrand in 1868. [[Alfred Clebsch|Clebsch]] (1873) attacked the theory along lines parallel to those followed in his theory of [[Abelian integral]]s. As the latter can be classified according to the properties of the fundamental curve that remains unchanged under a rational transformation, so Clebsch proposed to classify the transcendent functions defined by the differential equations according to the invariant properties of the corresponding surfaces ''f'' = 0 under rational one-to-one transformations.\n\n===Lie's theory===\nFrom 1870, [[Sophus Lie]]'s work put the theory of differential equations on a more satisfactory foundation. He showed that the integration theories of the older mathematicians can, by the introduction of what are now called [[Lie group]]s, be referred to a common source, and that ordinary differential equations that admit the same [[infinitesimal transformation]]s present comparable difficulties of integration. He also emphasized the subject of [[contact transformation|transformations of contact]].\n\nLie's group theory of differential equations has been certified, namely: (1) that it unifies the many ad hoc methods known for solving differential equations, and (2) that it provides powerful new ways to find solutions. The theory has applications to both ordinary and partial differential equations.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lawrence|1999|p=9}}</ref>\n\nA general approach to solve DEs uses the symmetry property of differential equations, the continuous [[infinitesimal transformation]]s of solutions to solutions ([[Lie theory]]). Continuous [[group theory]], [[Lie algebras]], and [[differential geometry]] are used to understand the structure of linear and nonlinear (partial) differential equations for generating integrable equations, to find its [[Lax pair]]s, recursion operators, [[Bäcklund transform]], and finally finding exact analytic solutions to the DE.\n\nSymmetry methods have been recognized to study differential equations, arising in mathematics, physics, engineering, and many other disciplines.\n\n=== Sturm–Liouville theory ===\n{{main article|Sturm–Liouville theory}}\nSturm–Liouville theory is a theory of a special type of second order linear ordinary differential equations. Their solutions are based on eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of linear operators defined in terms of second-order homogeneous linear equations. The problems are identified as Sturm-Liouville Problems (SLP) and are named after [[Jacques Charles François Sturm|J.C.F. Sturm]] and [[Joseph Liouville|J. Liouville]], who studied such problems in the mid-1800s. The interesting fact about regular SLPs is that they have an infinite number of eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenfunctions form a complete, orthogonal set, which makes orthogonal expansions possible. This is a key idea in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering.<ref>Logan, J. (2013). Applied mathematics (Fourth ed.).</ref> SLPs are also useful in the analysis of certain partial differential equations.\n\n==Existence and uniqueness of solutions==\n\nThere are several theorems that establish existence and uniqueness of solutions to initial value problems involving ODEs both locally and globally. The two main theorems are\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Theorem\n! Assumption\n! Conclusion\n|-\n|[[Peano existence theorem]]\n||F [[continuous function|continuous]]\n||local existence only\n|-\n|[[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]]\n||F [[Lipschitz continuous]]\n||local existence and uniqueness\n|-\n|}\n\nwhich are both local results.\n\nNote that uniqueness theorems like the Lipschitz one above do not apply to DAE systems, which may have multiple solutions stemming from their (non-linear) algebraic part alone.<ref name=\"AscherPetzold1998c\">{{cite book|author1=Uri M.

Boyce, R.C. Diprima, Wiley International, John Wiley & Sons, 1986, {{isbn|0-471-83824-1}}</ref> For the equation and initial value problem:\n\n:<math> y' = F(x,y)\\,,\\quad y_0 = y(x_0)</math>\n\nif ''F'' and ∂''F''/∂''y'' are continuous in a closed rectangle\n\n:<math>R=[x_0-a,x_0+a]\\times [y_0-b,y_0+b]</math>\n\nin the ''x-y'' plane, where ''a'' and ''b'' are [[real number|real]] (symbolically: ''a, b'' ∈ ℝ) and × denotes the [[cartesian product]], square brackets denote [[interval notation|closed intervals]], then there is an interval\n\n:<math>I = [x_0-h,x_0+h] \\subset [x_0-a,x_0+a]</math>\n\nfor some ''h'' ∈ ℝ where ''the'' solution to the above equation and initial value problem can be found.

The domain of ''y'' could be taken as being <math>\\mathbf{R} \\smallsetminus (x_0+ 1/y_0)</math>, but this would lead to a domain that is not an interval, so that the side opposite to the initial condition would be disconnected from the initial condition, and therefore not uniquely determined by it.\n\nThe maximum domain is not ℝ because\n:<math>\\lim_{x \\to x_\\pm} \\|y(x)\\| \\rightarrow \\infty\\,,</math>\nwhich is one of the two possible cases according to the above theorem.\n\n== Reduction of order ==\nDifferential equations can usually be solved more easily if the order of the equation can be reduced.\n\n=== Reduction to a first-order system === <!-- Redirect [[Stiff equation]] links here -->\nAny explicit differential equation of order ''n'',\n\n:<math>F\\left(x, y, y', y'',\\ \\ldots,\\ y^{(n-1)}\\right) = y^{(n)}</math>\n\ncan be written as a system of ''n'' first-order differential equations by defining a new family of unknown functions\n\n:<math>y_i = y^{(i-1)}.\\!</math>\n\nfor ''i'' = 1, 2,..., ''n''.
