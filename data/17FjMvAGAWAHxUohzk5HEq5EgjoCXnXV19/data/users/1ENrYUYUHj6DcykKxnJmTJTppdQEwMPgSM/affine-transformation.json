Each of the leaves of the fern is related to each other leaf by an affine transformation. For instance, the red leaf can be transformed into both the small dark blue leaf and the large light blue leaf by a combination of reflection, rotation, scaling, and translation.]]\n\nIn [[geometry]], an '''affine transformation''', '''affine map'''<ref name=\"Berger\">Berger, Marcel (1987), p. 38.</ref> or an '''affinity''' (from the Latin, ''affinis'', \"connected with\") is a function between [[affine spaces]] which preserves points, straight lines and planes. Also, sets of [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines remain parallel after an affine transformation. An affine transformation does not necessarily preserve angles between lines or distances between points, though it does preserve ratios of distances between points lying on a straight line.\n\nExamples of affine transformations include [[Translation (geometry)|translation]], [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]], [[Homothetic transformation|homothety]], [[Similarity transformation (geometry)|similarity transformation]], [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]], [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]], [[shear mapping]], and [[Function composition|compositions]] of them in any combination and sequence.\n\nIf <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are [[affine space]]s, then every affine transformation <math>f\\colon X \\to Y</math> is of the form <math>x \\mapsto Mx + b</math>, where <math>M</math> is a [[linear transformation]] on <math>X</math> and <math>b</math> is a vector in <math>Y</math>. Unlike a purely linear transformation, an affine map need not preserve the zero point in a linear space. Thus, every linear transformation is affine, but not every affine transformation is linear.\n\nAll Euclidean spaces are affine, but there are affine spaces that are non-Euclidean. In [[affine coordinates]], which include [[Cartesian coordinates]] in Euclidean spaces, each output coordinate of an affine map is a [[Linear function (calculus)|linear function (in the sense of calculus)]] of all input coordinates. Another way to deal with affine transformations systematically is to select a point as the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]; then, any affine transformation is equivalent to a [[linear transformation]] (of [[Position (vector)|position vectors]]) followed by a [[Translation (geometry)|translation]].\n\n==Mathematical definition==\nAn affine map<ref name=\"Berger\" /> <math>f\\colon\\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{B}</math> between two [[affine space]]s is a map on the points that acts [[Linear transformation|linearly]] on the vectors (that is, the vectors between points of the space). In symbols, ''<math>f</math>'' determines a linear transformation ''<math>\\varphi</math>'' such that, for any pair of points <math>P, Q \\in \\mathcal{A}</math>:\n\n:<math>\\overrightarrow{f(P)~f(Q)} = \\varphi(\\overrightarrow{PQ})</math>\nor\n:<math>f(Q)-f(P) = \\varphi(Q-P)</math>.\n\nWe can interpret this definition in a few other ways, as follows.\n\nIf an origin <math>O \\in \\mathcal{A}</math> is chosen, and <math>B</math> denotes its image <math>f(O) \\in \\mathcal{B}</math>, then this means that for any vector <math>\\vec{x}</math>:\n\n:<math>f\\colon (O+\\vec{x}) \\mapsto (B+\\varphi(\\vec{x}))</math>.\n\nIf an origin <math>O' \\in \\mathcal{B}</math> is also chosen, this can be decomposed as an affine transformation <math>g\\colon \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{B}</math> that sends <math>O \\mapsto O'</math>, namely\n\n:<math>g\\colon (O+\\vec{x}) \\mapsto (O'+\\varphi(\\vec{x}))</math>,\n\nfollowed by the translation by a vector <math>\\vec{b} = \\overrightarrow{O'B}</math>.\n\nThe conclusion is that, intuitively, <math>f</math> consists of a translation and a linear map.\n\n===Alternative definition===\nGiven two [[affine space]]s <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> and <math>\\mathcal{B}</math>, over the same field, a function <math>f\\colon \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{B}</math> is an affine map [[if and only if]] for every family <math>\\{(a_i, \\lambda_i)\\}_{i\\in I}</math> of weighted points in <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> such that \n: <math>\\sum_{i\\in I}\\lambda_i = 1</math>,\n\nwe have<ref>\n{{cite book|authors=Schneider, Philip K. & Eberly, David H.|title=Geometric Tools for Computer Graphics|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|year=2003|isbn=978-1-55860-594-7|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Q7HGBx1uLIC&pg=PA98}}</ref>\n\n: <math>f\\left(\\sum_{i\\in I}\\lambda_i a_i\\right)=\\sum_{i\\in I}\\lambda_i f(a_i)</math>.\n\nIn other words, <math>f</math> preserves [[barycenter]]s.\n\n==Representation==\nAs shown above, an affine map is the [[Function composition|composition]] of two functions: a [[Translation_(geometry)|translation]] and a [[linear map]]. Ordinary vector algebra uses [[matrix multiplication]] to represent linear maps, and [[vector addition]] to represent translations. Formally, in the finite-dimensional case, if the linear map is represented as a multiplication by a matrix <math>A</math> and the translation as the addition of a vector <math>\\vec{b}</math>, an affine map <math>f</math> acting on a vector <math>\\vec{x}</math> can be represented as\n\n:<math>\n\\vec{y} = f(\\vec{x}) = A \\vec{x} + \\vec{b}.\n</math>\n\n===Augmented matrix===\n[[File:Affine transformations.ogv|thumb|250px|right|Affine transformations on the 2D plane can be performed in three dimensions. Translation is done by shearing along over the z axis, and rotation is performed around the z axis.]]\n\nUsing an [[augmented matrix]] and an augmented vector, it is possible to represent both the translation and the linear map using a single [[matrix multiplication]]. The technique requires that all vectors are augmented with a \"1\" at the end, and all matrices are augmented with an extra row of zeros at the bottom, an extra column—the translation vector—to the right, and a \"1\" in the lower right corner. If <math>A</math> is a matrix,\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\vec{y} \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} \\, & A & & \\vec{b} \\ \\\\ 0 & \\ldots & 0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right] \\begin{bmatrix} \\vec{x} \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nis equivalent to the following\n\n:<math>\n\\vec{y} = A \\vec{x} + \\vec{b}.\n</math>\n\nThe above-mentioned augmented matrix is called an ''[[Transformation matrix#Affine transformations|affine transformation matrix]]'', or ''projective transformation matrix'' (as it can also be used to perform [[projective transformation]]s).\n\nThis representation exhibits the set of all [[Inverse function|invertible]] affine transformations as the [[semidirect product]] of <math>K^n</math> and <math>GL(n, K)</math>.  This is a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] under the operation of composition of functions,  called the [[affine group]].\n\nOrdinary matrix-vector multiplication always maps the origin to the origin, and could therefore never represent a translation, in which the origin must necessarily be mapped to some other point. By appending the additional coordinate \"1\" to every vector, one essentially considers the space to be mapped as a subset of a space with an additional dimension. In that space, the original space occupies the subset in which the additional coordinate is 1. Thus the origin of the original space can be found at <math>(0,0, \\dotsc, 0, 1)</math>. A translation within the original space by means of a linear transformation of the higher-dimensional space is then possible (specifically, a shear transformation). The coordinates in the higher-dimensional space are an example of [[homogeneous coordinates]]. If the original space is [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]], the higher dimensional space is a [[real projective space]].\n\nThe advantage of using [[homogeneous coordinates]] is that one can [[Function composition|combine]] any number of affine transformations into one by multiplying the respective matrices. This property is used extensively in [[computer graphics]], [[computer vision]] and [[robotics]].\n\n====Example augmented matrix====\nIf the vectors <math>\\vec{x}_1, \\dotsc, \\vec{x}_{n+1}</math> are a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the domain's projective vector space and if <math>\\vec{y}_1, \\dotsc, \\vec{y}_{n+1}</math> are the corresponding vectors in the [[codomain]] vector space then the augmented matrix <math>M</math> that achieves this affine transformation\n:<math>\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\vec{y}\\\\1\\end{array}\\right] = M \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\vec{x}\\\\1\\end{array}\\right]</math>\nis\n:<math>M = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\\vec{y}_1&\\ldots&\\vec{y}_{n+1}\\\\1&\\ldots&1\\end{array}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\\vec{x}_1&\\ldots&\\vec{x}_{n+1}\\\\1&\\ldots&1\\end{array}\\right]^{-1}</math>.\n\nThis formulation works irrespective of whether any of the domain, codomain and image vector spaces have the same number of dimensions.\n\nFor example, the affine transformation of a vector plane is uniquely determined from the knowledge of where the three vertices of a non-degenerate triangle are mapped to.\n\n==Properties==\n=== Properties preserved ===\nAn affine transformation preserves:\n# '''[[collinearity]]''' between points: three or more points which lie on the same line (called collinear points) continue to be collinear after the transformation.\n# '''[[Parallel (geometry)|parallelism]]''': two or more lines which are parallel, continue to be parallel after the transformation.\n# '''[[Convex set|convexity]]''' of sets: a convex set continues to be convex after the transformation. Moreover, the [[extreme point]]s of the original set are mapped to the extreme points of the transformed set.<ref name=res>{{cite web|last1=Reinhard Schultz|title=Affine transformations and convexit|url=http://math.ucr.edu/~res/math145A-2014/affine+convex.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>\n# '''ratios of lengths''' along a line: for distinct collinear points <math>p_1</math>, <math>p_2</math>, <math>p_3</math>, the ratio of <math>\\overrightarrow{p_1p_2}</math> and <math>\\overrightarrow{p_2p_3}</math> is the same as that of <math>\\overrightarrow{f(p_1)f(p_2)}</math> and <math>\\overrightarrow{f(p_2)f(p_3)}</math>.\n# '''[[barycenter]]s''' of weighted collections of points.\n\n=== Groups ===\nAn affine transformation is [[invertible]] [[if and only if]] <math>A</math> is invertible. In the matrix representation, the inverse is:\n\n:<math>\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} & A^{-1} & & -A^{-1}\\vec{b} \\ \\\\ 0 & \\ldots & 0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right]\n</math>\n\nThe invertible affine transformations (of an affine space onto itself) form the [[affine group]], which has the [[general linear group]] of degree <math>n</math> as subgroup and is itself a subgroup of the general linear group of degree <math>n + 1</math>.\n\nThe [[Similarity transformation (geometry)|similarity transformations]] form the subgroup where <math>A</math> is a scalar times an [[orthogonal matrix]]. For example, if the affine transformation acts on the plane and if the [[determinant]] of <math>A</math> is 1 or −1 then the transformation is an [[Equiareal map|equiareal mapping]]. Such transformations form a subgroup called the ''equi-affine group''<ref>[[Oswald Veblen]] (1918) ''Projective Geometry'', volume 2, pp. 105–7.</ref> A transformation that is both equi-affine and a similarity is an [[isometry]] of the plane taken with [[Euclidean distance]].\n\nEach of these groups has a subgroup of ''[[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]-preserving'' or ''positive'' affine transformations: those where the determinant of <math>A</math> is positive. In the last case this is in 3D the group of [[rigid body]] motions ([[Improper rotation|proper rotations]] and pure translations).\n\nIf there is a fixed point, we can take that as the origin, and the affine transformation reduces to a linear transformation. This may make it easier to classify and understand the transformation. For example, describing a transformation as a rotation by a certain angle with respect to a certain axis may give a clearer idea of the overall behavior of the transformation than describing it as a combination of a translation and a rotation. However, this depends on application and context.\n\n== Image transformation ==\nIn their applications to [[digital image processing]], the affine transformations are analogous to printing on a sheet of rubber and stretching the sheet’s edges parallel to the plane. This transform relocates pixels requiring intensity interpolation to approximate the value of moved pixels, bicubic [[interpolation]] is the standard for image transformations in image processing applications. Affine transformations scale, rotate, translate, mirror and sheer images as shown in the following examples:<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Gonzalez\n  |first = Rafael\n  |title = 'Digital Image Processing, 3rd'\n  |publisher = Pearson Hall\n  |date = 2008\n  |ISBN = 9780131687288\n}}</ref> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

If the subject was a picture the results would be of higher quality if bicubic interpolation was used. The Affine transforms are applicable to the registration process where two or more images are aligned (registered), an example of image registration is the generation of panoramic images that are the product of multiple images [[Image stitching | stitched]] together.\n\n=== Affine warping  ===\n\nThe affine transform preserves parallel lines, however the stretching and shearing transformations warp shapes as the following example shows: \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[File:White_on_black_circle_image_256_by_256.png]]\n| [[File:Affine_transform_sheared_circle.png]]\n|}\n\nThis is an example of image warping, however the affine transformations do not facilitate projection onto a curved surface or [[Distortion (optics)|radial distortions]].\n\n==In the plane==\n[[File:Central dilation.svg|thumb|right|300px|A central dilation. The triangles A1B1Z, A1C1Z, and B1C1Z get mapped to A2B2Z, A2C2Z, and B2C2Z, respectively.]] \nAffine transformations in two real dimensions include:\n* pure translations,\n* [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]] in a given direction, with respect to a line in another direction (not necessarily perpendicular), combined with translation that is not purely in the direction of scaling; taking \"scaling\" in a generalized sense it includes the cases that the scale factor is zero ([[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]]) or negative; the latter includes [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]], and combined with translation it includes [[glide reflection]],\n* [[rotation]] combined with a [[Homothetic transformation|homothety]] and a translation,\n* [[shear mapping]] combined with a homothety and a translation, or \n* [[squeeze mapping]] combined with a homothety and a translation.\n\nTo visualise the general affine transformation of the [[Euclidean plane]], take labelled [[parallelogram]]s ''ABCD'' and ''A′B′C′D′''. Whatever the choices of points, there is an affine transformation ''T'' of the plane taking ''A'' to ''A′'', and each vertex similarly. Supposing we exclude the degenerate case where ''ABCD'' has zero [[area]], there is a unique such affine transformation ''T''. Drawing out a whole grid of parallelograms based on ''ABCD'', the image ''T''(''P'') of any point ''P'' is determined by noting that ''T''(''A'') = ''A′'', ''T'' applied to the line segment ''AB'' is ''A′B′'', ''T'' applied to the line segment ''AC'' is ''A′C′'', and ''T'' respects scalar multiples of vectors based at ''A''. [If ''A'', ''E'', ''F'' are collinear then the ratio length(''AF'')/length(''AE'') is equal to length(''A''′''F''′)/length(''A''′''E''′).] Geometrically ''T'' transforms the grid based on ''ABCD'' to that based in ''A′B′C′D′''.\n\nAffine transformations do not respect lengths or angles; they multiply area by a constant factor\n\n:area of ''A′B′C′D′'' / area of ''ABCD''.\n\nA given ''T'' may either be ''direct'' (respect orientation), or ''indirect'' (reverse orientation), and this may be determined by its effect on ''signed'' areas (as defined, for example, by the [[cross product]] of vectors).\n\n==Examples==\n===Over the real numbers===\nFunctions <math>f\\colon \\R \\to \\R,\\; f(x) = mx + c</math> with <math>m</math> and <math>c</math> constant, are commonplace affine transformations.\n\n===Over a finite field===\nThe following equation expresses an affine transformation in [[Galois field|GF]](2<sup>8</sup>):\n\n:<math>\n\\{a'\\} = M\\{a\\} \\oplus \\{v\\},\n</math>\n\n{|\n|-\n| where <math>[M]</math> is the matrix and <math>\\{v\\}</math> is the vector\n:<math>M\\{a\\}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1&0&0&0&1&1&1&1 \\\\\n1&1&0&0&0&1&1&1 \\\\\n1&1&1&0&0&0&1&1 \\\\\n1&1&1&1&0&0&0&1 \\\\\n1&1&1&1&1&0&0&0 \\\\\n0&1&1&1&1&1&0&0 \\\\\n0&0&1&1&1&1&1&0 \\\\\n0&0&0&1&1&1&1&1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>  :<math>\\{v\\}= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n|}\n\nFor instance, the affine transformation of the element <math>\\{a\\} = y^7 + y^6 + y^3 + y = \\{11001010_2\\}</math> in [[Endianness|big-endian]] [[Binary numeral system|binary]] notation = <math>\\{\\text{CA}_{16}\\}</math> in big-endian [[hexadecimal]] notation, is calculated as follows:\n\n:<math>a_0' = a_0 \\oplus a_4 \\oplus a_5 \\oplus a_6 \\oplus a_7 \\oplus 1 = 0 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 = 1</math>\n:<math>a_1' = a_0 \\oplus a_1 \\oplus a_5 \\oplus a_6 \\oplus a_7 \\oplus 1 = 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 = 0</math>\n:<math>a_2' = a_0 \\oplus a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus a_6 \\oplus a_7 \\oplus 0 = 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 0 = 1</math>\n:<math>a_3' = a_0 \\oplus a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus a_3 \\oplus a_7 \\oplus 0 = 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 0 = 1</math>\n:<math>a_4' = a_0 \\oplus a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus a_3 \\oplus a_4 \\oplus 0 = 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 0 = 0</math>\n:<math>a_5' = a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus a_3 \\oplus a_4 \\oplus a_5 \\oplus 1 = 1 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 1 = 1</math>\n:<math>a_6' = a_2 \\oplus a_3 \\oplus a_4 \\oplus a_5 \\oplus a_6 \\oplus 1 = 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 = 1</math>\n:<math>a_7' = a_3 \\oplus a_4 \\oplus a_5 \\oplus a_6 \\oplus a_7 \\oplus 0 = 1 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 0 = 1.</math>\n\nThus, <math>\\{a\\} = y^7 + y^6 + y^5 + y^3 + y^2 + 1 = \\{11101101_2\\} = \\{\\text{ED}_{16}\\}</math>.\n\n===In plane geometry===\n[[File:Geometric affine transformation example.png|thumb|left|A simple affine transformation on the real plane]]\n[[File:2D affine transformation matrix.svg|thumb|250px|Effect of applying various 2D affine transformation matrices on a unit square.
