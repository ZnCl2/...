            "text": "Foreign media institutions and correspondents were present for much of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. They included correspondents from the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), [[Voice of America]] (VOA), [[Cable News Network]] (CNN), [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS), [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), and [[the National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC).<ref>1. Nan Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'': Anatomy of the 1989 Mass Movement (Praeger Publishers, 1992), 144.</ref> Others included correspondents from then British-controlled Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref>2. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 150.</ref> Many of the correspondents were in China to report on the visit of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] or were covering the [[Asian Development Bank]] meeting that was happening in Beijing.<ref>3. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 143.</ref><ref>4. Michael Dobbs, “Protesters, and Reporters, Pedal to Beijing's Rally,” ''The Washington Post'', May 18, 1989, A36.</ref> Foreign media coverage of the protests became a popular source for news after [[martial law]] was declared on May 20 and the government “imposed strict control over the [[Chinese media]]”.<ref>5. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 148.</ref>\n\n== Prior To Martial Law ==\n\n\tBroadcasts from the VOA and BBC had been popular sources of information, both local and world-wide, for Chinese residents for some time.<ref>5. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 148.</ref> Their broadcasts covered news that Chinese media did not report.<ref>5. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 148.</ref> Occasionally, the VOA and BBC were “jammed with noise” but after 1978-1979 the jamming ended making listening to the news much more consistent.<ref>5. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 148.</ref>  From April 16 to May 16, 1989, the VOA broadcast's coverage of the Tiananmen movement averaged approximately 17% of its Mandarin newscast but grew to 20% between May 4 and May 15.<ref>6. Zhou He, ''Media and Tiananmen Square'' (Nova Science Publishers, Inc. 1996), 112.</ref> This coverage increased quickly as martial law was announced and around June 4  it grew from 70% to more than 80%.<ref>6. Zhou He, ''Media and Tiananmen Square'' (Nova Science Publishers, Inc. 1996), 112.</ref> In response to the growing pro-democracy movement, the VOA, which provides news in both Mandarin and English, expanded its regular eight hours per day of Mandarin content to eleven hours each day.<ref>6. Zhou He, ''Media and Tiananmen Square'' (Nova Science Publishers, Inc. 1996), 112.</ref> Many notable news anchors arrived to cover the pro-democracy movement. [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]] of CNN was the first of these newscasters to arrive.<ref>5. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 148.</ref> Others followed such as [[Ted Koppel]] of ABC, [[Dan Rather]] of CBS, and [[Tom Brokaw]] of NBC.<ref>5. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 148.</ref> Between May 13–20, the movement became “center stage of world attention” and live broadcasts from China were routine.<ref>7. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 149.</ref>\n\n\tPrior to the implementation of martial law, during the May 13–19 period, Chinese media outlets were able to report on the protests with little restriction.<ref>5. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 148.</ref><ref>8. “China expels two reporters as crackdown continues,” ''The Ottawa Citizen'', June 14, 1989, A1.</ref><ref>9. Jim Hoagland, “Blanket Television Coverage Gives Demonstrators a Media Security Blanket,” ''The Washington Post'', May 19, 1989, A35.</ref> Author [[Nan Lin]] suggests that local broadcasts were popular with the Chinese citizens for their “immediacy and accuracy”.<ref>5. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 148.</ref> During the period prior to martial law, the Chinese were less dependent on foreign media broadcasts as demonstrated by a rise in newspapers sales and an increase in television and radio audiences.<ref>5. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 148.</ref> The VOA, among other sources, used official Chinese news media as a listed source of information on 25% of its stories during the protests.<ref>10. He, ''Media and Tiananmen Square'', 115.</ref> After martial law was implemented, the popularity of foreign media outlets resumed.<ref>5. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 148.</ref>\n\n== Enactment of Martial Law ==\n\n\tForeign media faced many restrictions when covering the Tiananmen protests. After the declaration of martial law, foreign media was no longer permitted to visit Tiananmen Square.<ref>7. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 149.</ref><ref>11. “Troops march near Beijing square; foreign press coverage restricted,” ''The Globe and Mail'', June 2, 1989, A4.</ref> Foreign correspondents gave reports from guest rooms in tourist hotels; these became the backdrop for many live broadcasts from American networks.<ref>5. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 148.</ref><ref>12. Jan Wong, “Tiananmen Square draws foreign tourists seeking radical chic,” ''The Globe and Mail'', May 31, 1989, A9.</ref>  This ban was originally not strictly enforced, but soon security personnel and police spoke to foreign media correspondents and pushed them to leave stating that Gorbachev's visit had ended.<ref>7. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 149.</ref> Author Nan Lin states that when the journalists were slow in leaving, “forceful actions were taken to block news gathering and transmission”.<ref>7. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 149.</ref> Photography of the Square was also not permitted.<ref>11. “Troops march near Beijing square; foreign press coverage restricted,” ''The Globe and Mail'', June 2, 1989, A4.</ref><ref>13.

''Frontline: The Tank Man'', directed by Antony Thomas (April 11, 2006), DVD.</ref> Transporting film from Beijing became difficult, often requiring it to be taken apart frame by frame, sent out on ordinary phone lines, and reconstituted elsewhere.<ref>15. Salisbury, ''Tiananmen Diary'', 24.</ref>\n\n\tForeign media faced other difficulties in reporting on the Tiananmen Square protests. As the military entered the square and violence erupted, there was confusion as different outlets were isolated between east and west Beijing.<ref>16. “Chinese Army Detains Journals // CBS correspondent, cameraman missing in suppression of protests,” ''Austin American-Statesman'', June 4, 1989, A13.</ref><ref>17.

Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 149.</ref>\n\n== Interpretations of the Foreign Media Presence ==\n\n\tForeign media and the Chinese government have different perspectives on the influence of foreign correspondents during the protests. Foreign reporters were often looked upon as “sympathetic” towards protesters as they broadcast world-wide “appeals” for the pro-democratic movement<ref>7. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 149.</ref> Journalist [[Harrison E. Salisbury]] described the response of the Chinese government as “[[xenophobic]]” towards foreigners and cites the criticism of foreign correspondents during the protests as evidence.<ref>22. Salisbury, ''Tiananmen Diary'', 112.</ref> As a counterpoint, Salisbury recognizes that the Chinese government believe that the United States media, particularly Dan Rather, “had distorted the picture and not presented the government's side”.<ref>22. Salisbury, ''Tiananmen Diary'', 112.</ref> Salisbury attempts to understand the government perspective, reasoning that they believed “that the United States had a false idea of the nature of the student movements, [and] that American television was to blame [because it] had exaggerated the idealism of the movement”.<ref>23. Salisbury, ''Tiananmen Diary'', 111.</ref> Author Nan Lin concludes that the protests drew international attention through press, allowing the government to  “justify counteractions” while warning the population that China would “be humiliated in the eyes of the world” while the protesters used the attention  “to maximize public attention and sympathy” for their movement.<ref>24. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 165.</ref>\n\n== Role of Asian Media Correspondents ==\n\nThere were a variety of different correspondents present for the Tiananmen Square Protests, including from then British-controlled Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref>2. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 150.</ref> These correspondents were familiar with the politics and proficient in the language; they were able to gather important information and conduct interviews with locals.<ref>24. Lin, ''Struggle for Tiananmen'', 150.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]",
