            "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''topological vector space''' (also called a '''linear topological space''') is one of the basic structures investigated in [[functional analysis]]. As the name suggests the space blends a [[topology|topological structure]] (a [[uniform structure]] to be precise) with the [[algebra]]ic concept of a [[vector space]].\n\nThe elements of topological vector spaces are typically [[function (mathematics)|function]]s or [[Linear map|linear operators]] acting on topological vector spaces, and the topology is often defined so as to capture a particular notion of [[Limit (mathematics)#Convergence and fixed point|convergence]] of sequences of functions.\n\n[[Hilbert space]]s and [[Banach space]]s are well-known examples.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, the underlying field of a topological vector space is assumed to be either the [[complex number]]s '''C''' or the [[real number]]s '''R'''.\n\n== Definition ==\n[[Image:Topological vector space illust.svg|right|thumb|A family of neighborhoods of the origin with the above two properties determines uniquely a topological vector space. The system of neighborhoods of any other point in the vector space is obtained by [[translation (mathematics)|translation]].]]\nA '''topological vector space''' ''X'' is a [[vector space]] over a [[topological field]] '''K''' (most often the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers with their standard topologies) that is endowed with a [[topological space|topology]] such that vector addition ''X'' × ''X'' → ''X'' and scalar multiplication '''K''' × ''X'' → ''X'' are [[continuous function (topology)|continuous functions]] (where the domains of these functions are endowed with [[product topology|product topologies]]).\n\nSome authors (e.g., [[Walter Rudin]]) require the topology on ''X'' to be [[T1 space|T<sub>1</sub>]]; it then follows that the space is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and even [[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]. The topological and linear algebraic structures can be tied together even more closely with additional assumptions, the most common of which are listed [[topological vector space#Types of topological vector spaces|below]].\n\nThe [[category (category theory)|category]] of topological vector spaces over a given topological field '''K''' is commonly denoted '''TVS'''<sub>'''K'''</sub> or '''TVect'''<sub>'''K'''</sub>. The [[object (category theory)|objects]] are the topological vector spaces over '''K''' and the [[morphism]]s are the [[continuous linear map|continuous '''K'''-linear map]]s from one object to another.\n\n== Examples ==\nEvery [[normed vector space]] has a natural [[normed vector space#Topological structure|topological structure]]: the norm induces a [[metric space|metric]] and the metric induces a topology. This is a topological vector space because:\n#The vector addition + : ''V'' × ''V'' → ''V'' is jointly continuous with respect to this topology. This follows directly from the [[triangle inequality]] obeyed by the norm.\n#The scalar multiplication · : '''K''' × ''V'' → ''V'', where '''K''' is the underlying scalar field of ''V'', is jointly continuous. This follows from the triangle inequality and homogeneity of the norm.\n\nTherefore, all [[Banach space]]s and [[Hilbert space]]s are examples of topological vector spaces.\n\nThere are topological vector spaces whose topology is not induced by a norm, but are still of interest in analysis. Examples of such spaces are spaces of [[holomorphic function]]s on an open domain, spaces of [[infinitely differentiable function]]s, the [[Schwartz space]]s, and spaces of [[test function]]s and the spaces of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] on them.  These are all examples of [[Montel space]]s. An infinite-dimensional Montel space is never normable.\n\nA [[topological field]] is a topological vector space over each of its [[Field extension|subfields]].\n\n=== Product vector spaces ===\n\nA [[cartesian product]] of a family of topological vector spaces, when endowed with the [[product topology]], is a topological vector space.  For instance, the set ''X'' of all functions ''f''&nbsp;: '''R'''&nbsp;→ '''R''': this set ''X'' can be identified with the product space '''R'''<sup>'''R'''</sup> and carries a natural [[product topology]]. With this topology, ''X'' becomes a topological vector space, called the ''space of [[pointwise convergence]]''. The reason for this name is the following: if (''f''<sub>''n''</sub>) is a sequence of elements in ''X'', then ''f''<sub>''n''</sub> has [[limit of a sequence|limit]] ''f'' in ''X'' if and only if ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') has limit ''f''(''x'') for every real number ''x''.  This space is complete, but not normable: indeed, every neighborhood of 0 in the product topology contains lines, ''i.e.'', sets '''K'''&nbsp;''f'' for ''f''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0.\n\n== Topological structure ==\nA vector space is an [[abelian group]] with respect to the operation of addition, and in a topological vector space the inverse operation is always continuous (since it is the same as multiplication by &minus;1). Hence, every topological vector space is an abelian [[topological group]].\n\nLet ''X'' be a topological vector space. Given a [[Subspace topology|subspace]] ''M'' ⊂ ''X'', the quotient space ''X/M'' with the usual [[quotient space (topology)|quotient topology]] is a Hausdorff topological vector space if and only if ''M'' is closed.<ref>In particular, ''X'' is Hausdorff if and only if the set {0} is closed (i.e., ''X'' is a [[T1 space|T<sub>1</sub> space]]).</ref> This permits the following construction: given a topological vector space ''X'' (that is probably not Hausdorff), form the quotient space ''X / M'' where ''M'' is the closure of {0}. ''X / M'' is then a Hausdorff topological vector space that can be studied instead of ''X''.\n\nIn particular, topological vector spaces are [[uniform space]]s and one can thus talk about [[completeness (topology)|completeness]], [[uniform convergence]] and [[uniform continuity]]. (This implies that every Hausdorff topological vector space is [[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]].<ref>Schaefer (1999), 16.</ref>) The vector space operations of addition and scalar multiplication are actually uniformly continuous. Because of this, every topological vector space can be completed and is thus a [[Dense set|dense]] [[linear subspace]] of a complete topological vector space.\n\nThe '''[[Birkhoff–Kakutani theorem]]''' gives that the following three conditions on a topological vector space ''V'' are equivalent:<ref>Kŏthe (1983), section 15.11.</ref><!-- In fact, this is true for topological group, for the proof doesn't use the scalar multiplications. - Taku -->\n*The origin 0 is closed in ''V'', and there is a [[countable]] [[neighborhood basis|basis of neighborhoods]] for 0 in ''V''.\n*''V'' is [[metrizable]] (as a topological space).\n*There is a [[translation-invariant metric]] on ''V'' that induces the given topology on ''V''.\nA '''metric linear space''' means a (real or complex) vector space together with a metric for which addition and scalar multiplication are continuous. By the Birkhoff–Kakutani theorem, it follows that there is an [[equivalence of metrics|equivalent metric]] that is translation-invariant.\n\nMore strongly: a topological vector space is said to be ''[[normable]]'' if its topology can be induced by a norm. A topological vector space is normable if and only if it is Hausdorff and has a convex bounded neighborhood of 0.<ref name=\"springer\">http://eom.springer.de/T/t093180.htm</ref>\n\nA linear operator between two topological vector spaces which is continuous at one point is continuous on the whole domain. Moreover, a linear operator ''f'' is continuous if ''f(V)'' is bounded (as defined below) for some neighborhood ''V'' of 0.\n\nA [[hyperplane]] on a topological vector space ''X'' is either dense or closed. A [[linear functional]] ''f'' on a topological vector space ''X'' has either dense or closed kernel. Moreover, ''f'' is continuous if and only if its [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is [[closed set|closed]].\n\nLet '''K''' be a [[locally compact]] topological field, for example the real or complex numbers. A topological vector space over '''K''' is locally compact if and only if it is [[finite-dimensional]], that is, isomorphic to '''K'''<sup>''n''</sup> for some natural number ''n''.\n\n== Local notions ==\nA subset ''E''&thinsp; of a topological vector space ''X''&thinsp; is said to be\n*''[[balanced set|balanced]]'' if ''tE'' ⊂ ''E'' for every scalar&nbsp;{{nowrap begin}}|''t''&thinsp;| ≤ 1{{nowrap end}}\n*''[[Bounded set (topological vector space)|bounded]]'' if for every neighborhood ''V'' of&nbsp;''0'', then ''E'' ⊂ ''tV'' when ''t'' is sufficiently large.<ref>Rudin (1991), p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe definition of boundedness can be weakened a bit; ''E'' is bounded if and only if every countable subset of it is bounded. Also, ''E'' is bounded if and only if for every balanced neighborhood ''V'' of 0, there exists ''t'' such that ''E'' ⊂ ''tV''.  Moreover, when ''X'' is locally convex, the boundedness can be characterized by [[seminorm]]s: the subset ''E'' is bounded iff every continuous semi-norm ''p'' is bounded on ''E''.\n\nEvery topological vector space has a local base of [[absorbing set|absorbing]] and [[balanced set]]s.\n\nA sequence {''x<sub>n</sub>''} is said to be [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy]] if for every neighborhood ''V'' of 0, the difference ''x<sub>m</sub>'' − ''x<sub>n</sub>'' belongs to ''V'' when ''m'' and ''n'' are sufficiently large.  Every Cauchy sequence is bounded, although Cauchy nets or Cauchy filters may not be bounded.  A topological vector space where every Cauchy sequence converges is called ''sequentially complete''; in general, it may not be complete (in the sense that Cauchy filters converge). Every compact set is bounded.\n\n== Types ==\nDepending on the application additional constraints are usually enforced on the topological structure of the space. In fact, several principal results in functional analysis fail to hold in general for topological vector spaces: the [[closed graph theorem]], the [[Open mapping theorem (functional analysis)|open mapping theorem]], and the fact that the dual space of the space separates points in the space.\n\nBelow are some common topological vector spaces, roughly ordered by their ''niceness''.\n\n* [[F-space]]s are [[complete space|complete]] topological vector spaces with a translation-invariant metric.  These include [[Lp space|L<sup>''p''</sup> spaces]] for all p &gt; 0.  \n* [[Locally convex topological vector space]]s: here each point has a [[local base]] consisting of [[convex set]]s. By a technique known as [[Minkowski functional]]s it can be shown that a space is locally convex if and only if its topology can be defined by a family of semi-norms. Local convexity is the minimum requirement for \"geometrical\" arguments like the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]]. The L<sup>''p''</sup> spaces are locally convex (in fact, Banach spaces) for all ''p'' ≥ 1, but not for 0 < ''p'' < 1.\n* [[Barrelled space]]s: locally convex spaces where the [[Banach–Steinhaus theorem]] holds.\n* [[Bornological space]]: a locally convex space where the [[continuous linear operator]]s to any locally convex space are exactly the [[bounded linear operator]]s. \n* [[Stereotype space]]: a locally convex space satisfying a variant of [[reflexive space|reflexivity condition]], where the dual space is endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on [[totally bounded space|totally bounded sets]].\n* [[Montel space]]: a barrelled space where every [[closed set|closed]] and [[Bounded set (topological vector space)|bounded set]] is [[compact set|compact]]\n* [[Fréchet space]]s: these are complete locally convex spaces where the topology comes from a translation-invariant metric, or equivalently: from a countable family of semi-norms. Many interesting spaces of functions fall into this class. A locally convex F-space is a Fréchet space.\n* [[LF-space]]s are [[limit (category theory)|limits]] of [[Fréchet space]]s.  [[ILH space]]s are [[inverse limit]]s of Hilbert spaces.\n* [[Nuclear space]]s: these are locally convex spaces with the property that every bounded map from the nuclear space to an arbitrary Banach space is a [[nuclear operator]].\n* [[Normed space]]s and [[semi-normed space]]s: locally convex spaces where the topology can be described by a single [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] or [[semi-norm (mathematics)|semi-norm]]. In normed spaces a linear operator is continuous if and only if it is bounded.\n* [[Banach space]]s: Complete [[normed vector space]]s. Most of functional analysis is formulated for Banach spaces.\n* [[Reflexive space|Reflexive Banach space]]s: Banach spaces naturally isomorphic to their double dual (see below), which ensures that some geometrical arguments can be carried out. An important example which is ''not'' reflexive is L<sup>1</sup>, whose dual is L<sup>∞</sup> but is strictly contained in the dual of L<sup>∞</sup>.\n* [[Hilbert space]]s: these have an [[inner product]]; even though these spaces may be infinite-dimensional, most geometrical reasoning familiar from finite dimensions can be carried out in them. These include L<sup>2</sup> spaces.\n* [[Euclidean space]]s: '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> or '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup> with the topology induced by the standard inner product. As pointed out in the preceding section, for a given finite ''n'', there is only one n-dimensional topological vector space, up to isomorphism. It follows from this that any finite-dimensional subspace of a TVS is closed. A characterization of finite dimensionality is that a Hausdorff TVS is locally compact if and only if it is finite-dimensional (therefore isomorphic to some Euclidean space).\n\n== Dual space ==\nEvery topological vector space has a [[continuous dual space]]&mdash;the set ''V*'' of all continuous linear functionals, i.e. [[continuous linear map]]s from the space into the base field '''K'''. A topology on the dual can be defined to be the coarsest topology such that the dual pairing each point evaluation ''V*'' → '''K''' is continuous. This turns the dual into a locally convex topological vector space. This topology is called the [[weak topology|weak-* topology]]. This may not be the only natural topology on the dual space; for instance, the dual of a normed space has a natural norm defined on it. However, it is very important in applications because of its compactness properties (see [[Banach–Alaoglu theorem]]).\nCaution: Whenever ''V'' is a not-normable locally convex space, then the pairing map ''V*'' × ''V'' → '''K''' is never continuous, no matter which vector space topology one chooses on  ''V*''.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book | last=Grothendieck | first=Alexander | authorlink=Alexander Grothendieck | title=Topological vector spaces | publisher=Gordon and Breach Science Publishers | location=New York | year=1973 | isbn=0-677-30020-4 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Köthe | first=Gottfried |authorlink=Gottfried Köthe| title=Topological vector spaces I | series=Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften | volume=159 | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=New York | origyear=1969 | year=1983 | isbn=978-3-642-64990-5}}\n* {{cite book | last=Köthe | first=Gottfried |authorlink=Gottfried Köthe| title=Topological vector spaces II | series=Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften | volume=237 | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=New York | year=1979 | isbn=978-1-4684-9411-2}}\n* {{cite book\n | last1 = Schaefer\n | first1 = Helmut H.\n | authorlink1 = Helmut H.
