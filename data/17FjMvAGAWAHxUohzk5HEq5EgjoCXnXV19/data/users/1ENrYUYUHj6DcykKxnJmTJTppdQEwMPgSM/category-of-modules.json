            "text": "In algebra, given a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'', the '''category of left modules''' over ''R'' is the category whose objects are all left [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over ''R'' and whose morphisms are all [[module homomorphism]]s between left ''R''-modules. For example, when ''R'' is the ring of integers '''Z''', it is the same thing as the [[category of abelian groups]]. The '''category of right modules''' is defined in a similar way.\n\n'''Note:''' Some authors use the term '''[[module category]]''' for the category of modules; this term can be ambiguous since it could also refer to a category with a [[monoidal-category action]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/module+category|title=module category in nLab|work=ncatlab.org}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\nThe category of left modules (or that of right modules) is an [[abelian category]]. The category has [[enough projectives]]<ref>trivially since any module is a quotient of a free module.</ref> and [[enough injectives]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dummit–Foote|loc=Ch. 10, Theorem 38.}}</ref> [[Mitchell's embedding theorem]] states every abelian category arises as a full subcategory of the category of modules.\n\n[[Projective limit]]s and [[inductive limit]]s exist in the category of (say left) modules.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourbaki|loc=§ 6.}}</ref>\n\nOver a commutative ring, together with the [[tensor product of modules]] ⊗, the category of modules is a [[symmetric monoidal category]].\n\n== Example: the category of vector spaces ==\nThe [[category (mathematics)|category]] '''K-Vect''' (some authors use '''Vect'''<sub>''K''</sub>) has all [[vector space]]s over a fixed [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' as [[object (category theory)|objects]] and [[linear transformation|''K''-linear transformations]] as [[morphism]]s. Since vector spaces over ''K'' (as a field) are the same thing as [[module (algebra)|module]]s over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''K'', '''K-Vect''' is a special case of '''R-Mod''', the category of left ''R''-modules.\n\nMuch of [[linear algebra]] concerns the description of '''K-Vect'''. For example, the [[dimension theorem for vector spaces]] says that the [[isomorphism class]]es in '''K-Vect''' correspond exactly to the [[cardinal number]]s, and that '''K-Vect''' is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[subcategory]] of '''K-Vect''' which has as its objects the free vector spaces ''K''<sup>''n''</sup>, where ''n'' is any cardinal number.\n\n== Generalizations ==\nThe category of [[sheaves of modules]] over a [[ringed space]] also has enough projectives and injectives.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Algebraic K-theory]] (the important invariant of the category of modules.)\n*[[Category of rings]]\n*[[Derived category]]\n*[[Module spectrum]]\n* [[Category of graded vector spaces]]\n* [[Category of abelian groups]]\n* [[category of representations]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*Bourbaki, ''Algèbre''; \"Algèbre linéaire.\"\n*Dummit, David; Foote, Richard.
