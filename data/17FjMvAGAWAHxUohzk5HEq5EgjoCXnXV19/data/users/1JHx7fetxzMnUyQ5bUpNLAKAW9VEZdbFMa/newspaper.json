The [[journalism]] organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often [[metonymy|metonymically]] called newspapers.\n\nNewspapers have traditionally been published [[printing|in print]] (usually on cheap, low-grade [[paper]] called [[newsprint]]). However, today most newspapers are also [[electronic publishing|published]] on [[website]]s as [[online newspaper]]s, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely.\n\nNewspapers developed in the 17th century, as information sheets for businessmen. By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers.\n\nSome newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\n== Overview ==\nNewspapers are typically published [[newspaper#Daily|daily]] or [[weekly newspaper|weekly]]. [[News magazine]]s are also weekly, but they have a [[magazine]] format.{{Anchor|Article_type_summary_in_lower_lede}} General-interest newspapers typically publish [[article (publishing)#News articles|news articles]] and [[feature story|feature articles]] on national and international news as well as [[local news]]. The news includes [[political journalism|political events and personalities]], [[business journalism|business and finance]], crime, weather, and natural disasters; [[medical journalism|health and medicine]], [[science journalism|science]], and computers and technology; [[sports journalism|sports]]; and [[entertainment journalism|entertainment]], [[society reporting|society]], food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and [[the arts]].\n\nUsually the paper is divided into sections for each of those major groupings (labeled A, B, C, and so on, with pagination prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing [[editorial]]s written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called \"[[op-ed]]s\" written by guest writers (which are typically in the same section as the editorial), and [[column (periodical)|columns]] that express the personal opinions of [[columnist]]s, usually offering analysis and synthesis that attempts to translate the raw [[data]] of the news into information telling the reader \"what it all means\" and persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles which have no [[byline]]; these articles are written by staff writers.\n\nA wide variety of material has been published in newspapers. Besides the aforementioned news, information and opinions, they include weather forecasts; criticism and reviews of the arts (including [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], [[theater]], [[fine arts]], and [[architecture]]) and of local services such as restaurants; [[obituary|obituaries]], birth notices and graduation announcements; entertainment features such as crosswords, horoscopes, [[editorial cartoon]]s, [[gag cartoon]]s, and [[comic strip]]s; [[advice column|advice]] columns, [[food column|food]], and other columns; and radio and television listings (program schedules). As of 2017, newspapers may also provide information about new movies and TV shows available on [[streaming video]] services like [[Netflix]]. Newspapers have [[classified ad]] sections where people and businesses can buy small advertisements to sell goods or services; as of 2013, the huge increase in [[Internet]] websites for selling goods, such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]] has led to significantly less classified ad sales for newspapers.\n\nMost newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of [[Subscription business model|subscription]] revenue, [[newsagent's shop|newsstand sales]], and advertising revenue (other businesses or individuals pay to place advertisements in the pages, including [[newspaper display advertising|display ads]], [[classified advertising|classified ads]], and [[online advertising|their online equivalents]]). Some newspapers are government-run or at least government-funded; their reliance on advertising revenue and on profitability is less critical to their survival. The [[editorial independence]] of a newspaper is thus always subject to the [[wikt:interest|interests]] of someone, whether owners, advertisers, or a government. Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\nMany newspapers, besides employing journalists on their own payrolls, also subscribe to [[news agency|news agencies]] (wire services) (such as the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], or [[Agence France-Presse]]), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the [[content (media)|content]] to the various newspapers. This is a way to avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55&nbsp;million copies).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieworld.com/cc/NewspaperADailyMiracle.pdf|title='&#39;A Daily Miracle: A student guide to journalism and the newspaper business'&#39; (2007)|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> The [[Great Recession|late 2000s–early 2010s global recession]], combined with the rapid growth of free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses.<ref>{{cite news|author=Plambeck, Joseph|title=Newspaper Circulation Falls Nearly 9%|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html?scp=3&sq=newspapers&st=Search|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 April 2010}}</ref> Worldwide annual revenue approached $100&nbsp;billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9.

Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the [[World Wide Web|web]]) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by [[crowdsourcing]] both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, [[journalism]] (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of [[news aggregator]]s, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of [[web traffic]]. Increasing [[paywall]]ing of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the '''''[[Ordinari Post Tijdender]]''''', which was established in [[Stockholm]] in 1645.\n\n===Definitions===\nNewspapers typically meet four criteria:<ref>Werner Faulstich: \"Grundwissen Medien\", 4th ed., ya UTB, 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-8252-8169-4}}, chapter 4</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Margarete Rehm|url=http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~wumsta/infopub/textbook/umfeld/rehm5.html|title=Margarete Rehm: Information und Kommunikaegenwart.

While online newspapers have increased access to newspapers by people with Internet access, people without Internet or computer access (e.g., [[homelessness|homeless people]], [[poverty|impoverished people]] and people living in remote or rural regions may [[Digital divide|not be able to access the Internet]], and thus will not be able to read online news). [[Literacy]] is also a factor which prevents [[Illiteracy|people who cannot read]] from being able to benefit from reading newspapers (paper or online).\n* [[Frequency|Periodicity]]: They are published at regular intervals, typically daily or weekly. This ensures that newspapers can provide information on newly-emerging news stories or events.\n* Currency: Its information is as up to date as its publication schedule allows. The degree of up-to-date-ness of a print newspaper is limited by the need of time to print and distribute the newspaper. In major cities, there may be a morning edition and a later edition of the same day's paper, so that the later edition can incorporate [[breaking news]] that have occurred since the morning edition was printed. Online newspapers can be updated as frequently as new information becomes available, even a number of times per day, which means that online editions can be very up-to-date.\n* Universality: Newspapers covers a range of topics, from political and business news to updates on science and technology, arts, culture, and entertainment.\n\n==History==\n\n===Gazettes and bulletins===\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], ''[[Acta Diurna]]'', or government announcement bulletins, were produced. They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places. In China, early government-produced news-sheets, called [[Dibao (ancient Chinese Gazette)|Dibao]], circulated among court officials during the late [[Han dynasty]] (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' (\"Bulletin of the Court\") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials. In 1582, there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in Beijing, during the late [[Ming Dynasty]].<ref name=\"brook xxi\">[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998).

Most daily newspapers are sold in the morning.\n\nAfternoon or evening papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed more at commuters and office workers. In practice (though this may vary according to country), a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on the night before its [[cover date]], further editions being printed and distributed during the night. The later editions can include [[breaking news]] which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already printed. Previews of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late night news programs, such as [[Newsnight]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

In the past there were independent Sunday newspapers; nowadays the same publisher often produces a [[Sunday newspaper]], distinct in many ways from the daily, usually with a related name; e.g., ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' are distinct newspapers owned by the same company, and an article published in the latter would never be credited to ''The Times''.\n\nIn some cases a Sunday edition is an expanded version of a newspaper from the same publisher; in other cases, particularly in Britain, it may be a separate enterprise, e.g., ''[[The Observer]]'', not affiliated with a daily newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1993. Usually, it is a specially expanded edition, often several times the thickness and weight of the weekday editions and contain generally special sections not found in the weekday editions, such as [[Sunday comics]], Sunday magazines (such as ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'').\n\nDaily newspapers are not published on [[Christmas Day]], but weekly newspapers would change their day e.g. Sunday newspapers are published on Saturday December 24, [[Christmas Eve]] when [[Christmas Day]] is falling on Sunday.\n\n====Weekly and other====\n{{main|Weekly newspaper}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 133-075, Worms, Antisemitische Presse, \"Stürmerkasten\".jpg|thumb|Public reading of the anti-Semitic weekly newspaper ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', [[Worms, Germany]], 1935]]\n[[Weekly newspaper]]s are published once a week, and tend to be smaller than daily papers. Some newspapers are published two or three times a week and are known as biweekly publications. Some publications are published, for example, fortnightly (or bimonthly in American parlance). They have a change from normal weekly day of the week during the Christmas period depending the day of the week [[Christmas Day]] is falling on.\n\n===Geographical scope and distribution===\n\n====Local or regional====\nA '''local newspaper''' serves a region such as a city, or part of a large city.\nAlmost every market has one or two newspapers that dominate the area. Large metropolitan newspapers often have large distribution networks, and can be found outside their normal area, sometimes widely, sometimes from fewer sources.\n\n====National====\n{{See also|List of national newspapers}}\n[[File:Street Scene - Salta - Argentina.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper stand in [[Salta]] ([[Argentina]]).]]\nMost nations have at least one newspaper that circulates throughout the whole country: a '''national newspaper'''. Some national newspapers, such as the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', are specialised (in these examples, on financial matters). There are many [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|national newspapers in the United Kingdom]], but only a [[List of newspapers in the United States|few in the United States]] and [[List of newspapers in Canada|Canada]]. In Canada, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' is sold throughout the country. In the United States, in addition to national newspapers as such, ''[[The New York Times]]'' is available throughout the country.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Herszenhorn|first1=David|title=Ask a Reporter|url=https://global.nytimes.com/learning/students/ask_reporters/Herszenhorn.html|website=global.nytimes.com|accessdate=23 January 2015|date=29 August 2001 |quote=As of January of this year [2001], the national editions of The Times were being printed at 19 different locations across the United States and home delivery was available in 195 markets throughout the country.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:An old man in newsagent's shop, Paris September 2011.jpg|upright|thumb|International newspapers on sale in [[Paris]], France]]\nThere is also a small group of newspapers which may be characterized as '''international newspapers'''. Some, such as ''[[The New York Times International Edition]]'', (formerly The International Herald Tribune) have always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or \"international editions\" of national or large metropolitan newspapers. In some cases, articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted from international editions; in others, of interest to [[expatriates]], significant national news is retained. As English became the international language of business and technology, many newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed English-language editions. In places as varied as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Mumbai]], newspapers are printed for a local and international English-speaking public, and for tourists. The advent of the Internet has also allowed non-English-language newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.\n\nSimilarly, in many countries with a large foreign-language-speaking population or many tourists, newspapers in languages other than the national language are both published locally and imported. For example, newspapers and magazines from many countries, and [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom#Non-English-language newspapers|locally published newspapers in many languages]], are readily to be found on news-stands in central London. In the US state of [[Florida]], so many tourists from the French-speaking Canadian province of [[Quebec]] visit for long stays during the winter (\"[[snowbird (person)|snowbird]]s\") that some newsstands and stores sell French-language newspapers such as ''[[Le Droit]]''.\n\n===Subject matter===\nGeneral newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no longer be called newspapers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-85461-0005, Berlin, Mauerbau, NVA-Panzersoldaten.jpg|thumb|upright|Soldiers in an [[East Germany|East German]] tank unit reading about the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961 in the newspaper [[Neues Deutschland]]]]\n\n====Print====\nFor centuries newspapers were printed on paper and supplied physically to readers either by local distribution, or in some cases by mail, for example for British expatriates living in India or Hong Kong who subscribed to British newspapers. Newspapers can be delivered to subscribers homes and/or businesses by a paper's own delivery people, sent via the [[mail]], sold at [[newsstand]]s, [[grocery store]]s and [[convenience store]]s, and delivered to [[library|libraries]] and [[bookstore]]s. Newspaper organizations need a large distribution system to deliver their papers to these different distributors, which typically involves delivery trucks and delivery people.\nIn recent years, newspapers and other media have adapted to the changing technology environment by starting to offer online editions to cater to the needs of the public. In the future, the trend towards more electronic delivery of the news will continue with more emphasis on the Internet, social media and other electronic delivery methods. However, while the method of delivery is changing, the newspaper and the industry still has a niche in the world.\n\n====Online====\n{{Main|Online newspaper}}\nAs of 2007, virtually all major printed newspapers have online editions distributed over the Internet which, depending on the country may be regulated by journalism organizations such as the [[Press Complaints Commission]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story3152.shtml|title=Journalism Magazine|publisher=Journalism.co.uk|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> But as some publishers find their print-based models increasingly unsustainable,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Web-based \"newspapers\" have also started to appear, such as the ''[[Southport Reporter]]'' in the UK and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', which stopped publishing in print after 149 years in March 2009 and became an online only paper.\n\nA new trend in newspaper publishing is the introduction of [[personalization]] through [[on-demand printing]] technologies or with online news aggregator websites like [[Google news]]. Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications. This \"Best of\" approach allows revival of the print-based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com, Twitter. times and many others. With these online newspapers, the reader can select how much of each section (politics, sports, arts, etc.) they wish to see in their news.\n\nThe newspaper has been a part of our daily life for several centuries. They have been a way for the public to be informed of important events that are occurring around the world. Newspapers have undergone dramatic changes over the course of history. Some of the earliest newspapers date back to Ancient Rome where important announcements were carved in stone tablets and placed in highly populated areas where citizens could be informed of the announcements.\n\n==Organization and personnel==\n[[File:Gazeta Lubuska newsroom.jpg|thumb|left|The newsroom of Gazeta Lubuska in [[Zielona Góra]], Poland]]\nIn the United States, the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper is the publisher.<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Guide to Industries, 2010–11 Edition: Publishing, Except Software|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|author=Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself—editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names—as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.\n\nThroughout the English-speaking world, the person who selects the content for the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor. Variations on this title such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on are common. For small newspapers, a single editor may be responsible for all content areas. At large newspapers, the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication, while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area, such as local news or sports. These divisions are called [[news bureau]]s or \"desks\", and each is supervised by a designated editor. Most newspaper editors [[copy edit]] the stories for their part of the newspaper, but they may share their workload with [[proofreader]]s and [[fact checker]]s.\n[[File:Newsboy in 1905.jpg|thumb|A [[Newspaper delivery|newsboy]] in 1905 selling the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' in Canada]]\n\n[[Reporter]]s are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and [[graphic artist]]s provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a [[Beat reporting|beat]], such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. [[Printer (publishing)|Printer]]s and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, partly because of the cost of an [[Offset printing|offset web press]] (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's [[print run]] might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, [[webmaster]]s and [[web designer]]s may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.\n\nThe staff of the [[Newspaper circulation|circulation department]] liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper; sell subscriptions; and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail, by [[newspaper carrier]]s, at retailers, and through vending machines. [[Free newspapers]] do not sell subscriptions, but they still have a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers. Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell ad space to clients such as local businesses, but also help clients design and plan their advertising campaigns. Other members of the advertising department may include [[graphic designer]]s, who design ads according to the customers' specifications and the department's policies. In an [[Advertising-free media|advertising-free newspaper]], there is no advertising department.\n\n==Zoned and other editions==\n[[File:Newspapers.jpg|thumb|Israeli daily newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', seen in its [[Hebrew]] and English language editions]]\nNewspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising—the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial—or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising [[rate card]] provides a good example of editioning.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |title=WSJ Advertising: Rates |publisher=Advertising.wsj.com |date= |accessdate=10 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029083017/http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n''See also [[Los Angeles Times suburban sections]].''\n\n==Format==\n[[File:Newspapers of Japan 20090831.jpg|thumb|[[Yomiuri Shimbun]], a broadsheet in Japan credited with having the largest newspaper circulation in the world]]\nMost modern newspapers<ref>See K.G.

Since the 1980s, the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower-quality [[letterpress printing]] to higher-quality, [[CMYK color model|four-color process]], [[offset printing]]. In addition, desktop computers, [[word processor|word processing software]], [[graphics software]], [[digital camera]]s and digital [[prepress]] and [[typesetting]] technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative [[Page layout|layout]]s and better design.\n\nTo help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and [[Sheffield]]'s weekly sports publication derives its name, the ''[[Green Un|Green 'Un]]'', from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' is also printed on pink paper while ''[[L'Équipe]]'' (formerly ''L'Auto'') is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the [[Giro d'Italia]] wears a pink jersey.\n\n==Circulation and readership==\n{{Main|List of newspapers in the World by circulation|Newspaper circulation|Ageing of newspaper readership}}\n[[File:Newspaper vendor.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper vendor, [[Paddington]], London, February 2005]]\nThe number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the [[Alliance for Audited Media]] maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper ''[[Trud (newspaper)|Trud]]'' exceeded 21,500,000 in 1990, while the Soviet weekly ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'' boasted a circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991. According to United Nations data from 1995 Japan has three daily papers—the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', and ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]''—with circulations well above 5.5&nbsp;million. Germany's ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]]'', with a circulation of 3.8&nbsp;million, was the only other paper in that category. In the United Kingdom, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' is the top seller, with around 3.24&nbsp;million copies distributed daily. In the U.S., ''The Wall Street Journal'' has a daily circulation of approximately 2.02&nbsp;million, making it the most widely distributed paper in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010138873_apusnewspapercirculation.html|title=Newspaper circulation drop accelerates April–Sept|author=Liedtke, Michael|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=26 October 2009|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhile paid readership of print newspapers has been steadily declining in the developed [[OECD]] nations, it has been rising in the chief developing nations (Brazil, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), whose paid daily circulation exceeded those of the developed nations for the first time in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/30/24/45559596.pdf|title=The evolution of news and the internet|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|date=11 June 2010|accessdate=14 July 2011}}\"Growth in the BIICS countries by about 35% from 2000 to 2008 very much contributed to this growth, most notably India with a 45% increase in circulation between 2000 and 2008, South Africa (34%) and China (an estimated 29%).

In the 1920s, on a national basis in the U.S., daily newspapers achieved market penetration of 123 percent (meaning the average U.S. household received 1.23 newspapers). As other media began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market penetration began to decline. It wasn't until the early 1970s, however, that market penetration dipped below 100 percent. By 2000, it was 53 percent and still falling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/|title=Newspapers: Audience&nbsp;– State of the Media 2004}}</ref> Many paid-for newspapers offer a variety of subscription plans. For example, someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or maybe only a [[workweek]] subscription, or perhaps a daily subscription. Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet, either at no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks, or for a certain number of viewed articles, after which readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives are provided.\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:C & A Speciale Mantel-Aanbieding.jpg|thumb|upright|left|1938 Dutch newspaper advertisement for women's clothing sold at [[C&A]] stores]]\nA newspaper typically generates 70–80% of its revenue from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions.<ref name=\"business_model_1996\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.academia.edu/4894990/Online_Revenue_Business_Model_Has_Changed_Little_Since_1996\n|title=Online Revenue Business Model Has Changed Little Since 1996|publisher=[[Newspaper Research Journal]]|author=Mensing, Donica|date=Spring 2007}}</ref> The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called ''editorial content'', ''editorial matter'', or simply ''editorial'', although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions. (This distinction, however, developed over time&nbsp;– early publishers like Girardin (France) and Zang (Austria) did not always distinguish paid items from editorial content.). The [[business model]] of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in 1833 by ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18904178|title=Reinventing the newspaper|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011|work=The Economist}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Naa newspaper ad revenue.svg|thumb|US Newspaper Advertising Revenue -  ''Newspaper Association of America published data''<ref name=NAAdata>{{cite web|title=Trends & Numbers |date=14 March 2012 |publisher=[[Newspaper Association of America]] |accessdate=18 September 2012 |url=http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918094825/http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |archivedate=18 September 2012 |df= }}</ref>]]\n\nNewspapers in countries with easy access to the [[World Wide Web|web]] have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers.

Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an [[Editorial|opposite-editorial]] which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. [[Advertorial]]s commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a [[press release]] than of an objective [[news story]]. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/16/blurring-lines-between-advertising-and-editorial|title = Dangerous blend: how lines between editorial and advertising are blurring|last = Frédéric|first = Filloux|date = 16 May 2011|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Journalism==\n{{Main|Journalism}}\n[[File:Severnyi krai.jpg|thumb|The editorial staff of newspaper \"Severnyi Kray\" in [[Yaroslavl]], Russia in 1900]]\nSince newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called ''journalism''. In the [[yellow journalism]] era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around [[World War II]]. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived [[bias]]; and scandals involving [[plagiarism]] and fabrication.\n\nIn the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called [[press baron]]s, and were used for gaining a political voice. After 1920 most major newspapers became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as [[Gannett]], [[The McClatchy Company]], [[Hearst Corporation]], [[Cox Enterprises]], [[Landmark Media Enterprises LLC]], [[Morris Communications]], [[Tribune Company|The Tribune Company]], [[Hollinger Inc.|Hollinger International]], [[News Corporation]], [[Swift Communications]], etc. Newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who \"leak\" stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them. However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed. Recent research has examined the effects of a newspaper's closing on the reelection of incumbents, voter turnout, and campaign spending.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp686.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Do Newspapers Matter?'', 2011]</ref>\n\nOpinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the ''[[op-ed]]'' (\"opposite the editorial page\") and [[letter to the editor|''letters to the editors'']] sections of the paper. Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers, and asking sources to review articles after publication.\n\n==Impact of television and Internet==\n{{Main|Future of newspapers}}\n{{Further|Online newspapers}}\n[[File:2010 newspaper press France 5125942563.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper press in [[Limoges]], France]]\nBy the late 1990s, the availability of news via [[:Category:24-hour television news channels|24-hour television channels]] and then the availability of [[online journalism]] posed an ongoing challenge to the [[business model]] of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] has declined, while advertising revenue—which makes up the bulk of most newspapers' income—has been shifting from print to the new media ([[social media]] websites and news websites), resulting in a general decline in print newspapers' revenues and profits. Many newspapers around the world launched online editions in the 2000s, in an attempt to follow or stay ahead of their audience. One of the big challenges is that a number of online news websites, such as [[Google news]], are free to access. Some online news sites are free, and rely on online advertising; other online news sites have a [[paywall]] and require paid subscription for access. However, in the non-developed countries, cheaper printing and distribution, increased literacy, the growing middle class and other factors have more than compensated for the emergence of electronic media and newspapers continue to grow.<ref>N. Ram, [http://www.hindu.com/af/india60/stories/2007081550100300.htm Newspaper futures: India and the world], 15 August 2007, [[The Hindu]]</ref>\n\nOn 10 April 1995, ''[[The American Reporter]]'' became the first daily Internet-based newspaper, with its own paid reporters around the world and all-original content. The editor-in-chief and founder is [[Joe Shea]]. The site is owned by 400 journalists.<ref>J.D. Lasica, \"Net Gain\", ''American Journalism Review'', Vol. 18, November 1996</ref> The future of newspapers in countries with high levels of Internet access has been widely debated as the industry has faced down soaring newsprint prices, slumping ad sales, the loss of much classified advertising to [[Craigslist]], [[eBay]] and other websites, and precipitous drops in circulation. In the late 1990s the number of newspapers slated for closure, bankruptcy or severe cutbacks has risen—especially in the United States, where the industry has shed a fifth of its journalists since 2001.<ref name=\"E&P0316\" /> Revenue has plunged while competition from internet media has squeezed older print publishers.<ref name=\"E&P0316\">{{cite news|url = http://www.editorandpublisher.com/PrintArticle/Specifics-on-Newspapers-from-State-of-News-Media-Report|title = Specifics on Newspapers from 'State of News Media' Report|first = Jennifer|last = Saba|work = [[Editor & Publisher]]|date = 16 March 2009|accessdate = 17 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe debate has become more urgent lately, as the 2008-2009 recession shaved newspapers' profits, and as once-explosive growth in newspaper web revenues has leveled off, forestalling what the industry hoped would become an important source of revenue.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/media/13adco.html?src=linkedin|title=Newspapers' Web Revenue is Stalling|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 October 2008| first=Stephanie|last=Clifford|accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref> At issue is whether the newspaper industry faces a [[Business cycle|cyclical]] trough (or dip), or whether new technology has rendered print newspapers obsolete, at least in their traditional paper format. As of 2017, an increasing percentage of [[Millennial]]s (young adults) get their news from [[social media]] websites such as [[Facebook]]. In the 2010s, many traditional newspapers have begun offering \"digital editions\", which can be accessed via [[desktop computer]], [[laptop]]s, and mobile devices such as [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s. Online newspapers may offer new advertising opportunities to newspaper companies, as [[online advertising]] enables much more precise targeting of ads; with an online newspaper, for example, different readers, such as [[Baby boomer]]s and [[Millennial]]s can be sent different advertisements.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of newspaper comic strips]]\n* [[Lists of newspapers]]\n*[[Mad Magazine]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Willings Press Guide'' (134th ed. 3 vol. 2010), comprehensive guide to world press.
