Such study concentrates primarily upon the texts of the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] as well as on [[Christian tradition]]. Christian [[theology|theologians]] use biblical [[exegesis]], [[rationality|rational]] analysis and argument. Theology might be undertaken to help the theologian better understand Christian tenets; to make [[comparative religion|comparisons]] between Christianity and other traditions; to [[Christian apologetics|defend]] Christianity against objections and criticism; to facilitate reforms in the Christian church and to assist in the [[evangelism|propagation of Christianity]].\n\n== Divisions of Christian theology ==\nThere are many methods of categorizing different approaches to Christian theology.  For a historical analysis, see the main article on the [[History of Christian theology]].\n\n=== Sub-disciplines ===\n\nChristian theologians may be specialists in one or more theological sub-disciplines. These are the kinds of phrases that one finds in certain job titles such as 'Professor of x', 'Senior Lecturer in y':\n\n* [[Apologetics]]/[[polemics]] – studying Christian theology as it compares to non-Christian [[world view|worldview]]s in order to defend the faith and challenge beliefs that lie in contrast with Christianity.\n* [[Biblical hermeneutics]] – interpretation of the [[Bible]], often with particular emphasis on the nature and constraints of contemporary interpretation.\n* [[Biblical studies]] – interpretation of the Bible, often with particular emphasis on historical-critical investigation.\n* [[Biblical theology]] – interpretation of the Bible, often with particular emphasis on links between biblical texts and the topics of systematic or dogmatic theology.<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AbTzT7pv6t1lZGZxZjNtOTZfMTQxM2c4aG5qa2M1&hl=en |title=Session 1- What is theology? - Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref>\n* [[Constructive theology]] – generally another name for [[systematic theology]]; also specifically a [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] approach to systematic theology, applying (among other things) [[feminist theory]], [[queer theory]], [[deconstruction]]ism, and [[hermeneutics]] to theological topics.\n* [[Dogmatic theology]] – studying theology (or [[dogma]]) as it developed in different [[Christian denomination|church denominations]].\n* [[Ecumenism|Ecumenical theology]] – comparing the doctrines of the diverse churches (e.g., Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, the various Protestant denominations) with the goal of promoting unity among them\n* [[Exegesis]] – interpretation of the Bible.\n* [[Historical theology]] – studying Christian theology via the thoughts of other Christians throughout the centuries.<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n* [[Homiletics]] – in theology the application of general principles of rhetoric to public preaching.\n* [[Ethics in religion|Moral theology]], specifically [[Christian ethics]] – explores the [[Morality|moral]] and [[Ethics|ethical]] dimensions of the religious life\n* [[Natural theology]] – the discussion of those aspects of theology that can be investigated without the help of revelation scriptures or tradition (sometimes contrasted with \"positive theology\").\n* [[Patristics]] or patrology—studies the teaching of [[Church Fathers]], or the development of Christian ideas and practice in the period of the Church Fathers.\n* [[Philosophical theology]] – the use of philosophical methods in developing or analyzing theological concepts.<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n* Pragmatic or [[practical theology]] – studying theology as it relates to everyday living and service to God, including serving as a [[minister (Christianity)|religious minister]].\n* Spiritual theology—studying theology as a means to [[orthopraxis|orthopraxy]]; [[Religious text|scripture]] and [[tradition]] are both used as guides for spiritual growth and discipline.\n* [[Systematic theology]] (doctrinal theology, dogmatic theology or philosophical theology)—focused on the attempt to arrange and interpret the ideas current in the religion. This is also associated with constructive theology.\n* [[Theological aesthetics]] – interdisciplinary study of [[theology]] and [[aesthetics]]/[[the arts]].\n* [[Theological hermeneutics]] – the study of the manner of construction of theological formulations. Related to theological methodology.\n\n=== Major topics ===\n\nThese topics crop up repeatedly and often in Christian theology; composing the main recurrent 'loci' around which Christian theological discussion revolves.\n\n* [[Bible]] – the nature and means of its [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]], etc.; including [[hermeneutics]] (the development and study of theories of the interpretation and understanding of texts and the topic of [[Biblical law in Christianity]])\n* [[Christian eschatology|Eschatology]] – the study of the ''last things'', or [[end time]]s. Covers subjects such as death and the [[afterlife]], the end of [[history]], the end of the [[world]], the [[last Judgment|last judgment]], the nature of [[hope]] and progress, etc.\n* [[Christology]] – the study of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]], of his nature(s), and of the relationship between his divinity and humanity;\n* [[Creation myth]]s\n* [[Divine providence]] – the study of sovereignty, superintendence, or agency of God over events in people's lives and throughout history.\n* [[Ecclesiology]] (sometimes a subsection of missiology)—the study of the [[Christian Church]], including the [[institution|institutional structure]], [[sacrament]]s and practices (especially the [[worship]] of God) thereof\n* [[Mariology]] – area of theology concerned with Mary, the Mother of God.\n* [[Missiology]] (sometimes a subsection of ecclesiology)—God's will in the world, missions, evangelism, etc.\n* [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|Pneumatology]] – the study of the [[Holy Spirit]], sometimes also 'geist' as in Hegelianism and other philosophico-theological systems\n* [[Soteriology]] – the study of the nature and means of [[salvation]]. May include [[hamartiology]] (the study of [[sin]]), [[Law and Gospel|God's Law and the Gospel]] (the study of the relationship between [[Old Testament#Christian view of the Law|the Divine Law]] and [[divine grace]], justification, sanctification.\n* [[Theological anthropology]] – the study of [[Human nature|humanity]], especially as it relates to the divine.\n* [[Theology proper]] – the study of [[God]]'s attributes, nature, and relation to the world. May include:\n** [[Theodicy]] – attempts at reconciling the existence of [[evil]] and suffering in the world with the nature and justice of God.\n** [[Negative theology|Apophatic theology]] – negative theology which seeks to describe God by negation (e.g., [[immutability (theology)|immutable]], [[impassibility|impassible]] ). It is the discussion of what God is ''not'', or the investigation of how language about God breaks down (see [[the nature of God in Western theology]]). Apophatic theology often is contrasted with \"[[Cataphatic theology]]\".\n\n==== A traditional pattern ====\n\nIn many Christian seminaries, the four Great Departments of Theology are:\n\n# [[Exegesis|Exegetical theology]]\n# [[Historical theology]]\n# [[Systematic theology]]\n# [[Practical theology]]\n\nThe four departments can usefully be subdivided in the following way:<br>\n'''1. Exegetical theology:'''\n* [[Biblical studies]] (analysis of the contents of Scripture)\n* Biblical introduction ([[biblical criticism]] that studies the origins of the Bible<ref>http://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/torrey_ra/fundamentals/01.cfm</ref>)\n* [[Biblical canon|Canonics]] (inquiry into how the different books of the Bible came to be collected together)\n* [[Biblical theology]] (inquiry into how divine revelation progressed over the course of the Bible).\n\n'''2. Historical theology (study of how Christian theology develops over time):'''\n\n* The [[Patristics|Patristic Period]] (1st through 8th centuries)\n** The [[Ante-Nicene Fathers]] (1st to 3rd centuries)\n** The [[Nicene]] Fathers (4th century)\n** The [[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers|Post-Nicene Fathers]] (5th to 8th centuries)\n* The [[Middle Ages]] (8th to 16th centuries)\n* The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]] (16th to 18th centuries)\n* The Modern Period (18th to 21st centuries)\n\n'''3. Systematic theology:'''\n\n* Prolegomena (first principles)\n* [[Theology Proper]]\n** The existence of God\n** The attributes of God\n** The [[Trinity]]\n** [[Creation myth|Creation]]\n** [[Divine Providence]]\n* [[Doctrine of Man]] (theological anthropology)\n* [[Christology]]\n* [[Soteriology]]\n** [[Justification (theology)|Justification]]\n** [[Sanctification]]\n* [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|Pneumatology]] (doctrine of the [[Holy Spirit]])\n* [[Ecclesiology]] (doctrine of the Church)\n* [[Eschatology]] and the [[afterlife]].\n\n'''4. Practical theology:'''\n\n* [[Moral theology]] (Christian ethics and casuistry)\n* [[Ecclesiology]]\n* [[Pastoral theology]]\n** [[Liturgics]]\n** Homiletics\n** [[Christian education]]\n** [[Christian counseling]]\n* [[Missiology]]\n\n=== Roman Catholic theology ===\n\nOne important branch of Christian theology is [[Roman Catholic theology]] which has these major teachings:\n\n* [[Biblical canon]] (involvement of Pope [[Damasus I]] [b.305]);\n* [[Absolution (religious)|Absolution]] (sacerdotal remittance of sin);\n* The [[apostolic succession]] (i.e., of bishops and the Pope from the original Apostles);\n* [[Christology]];\n* [[Ecclesiology]] since Vatican II;\n* [[Infant Baptism]];\n* [[Ecumenism]] (the move to reunite churches);\n* [[Ecumenical Councils]] (as means to bring about change or reform);\n* [[Icon]] [[veneration]];\n* The [[Immaculate Conception]] of Mary;\n* [[Real Presence]];\n* [[Liturgy]] since Vatican II;\n*  Models of the Church ([[Avery Dulles]]);\n* [[Moral Theology]]/[[Ethics]];\n* [[Natural Law]];\n* [[Indulgences]] (i.e., remissions by the Church of some penalties for sin);\n* [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] (Mary as [[Theotokos]] [i.e., in Greek, \"God-bearer\" or \"Mother of God\"]; as perpetually [[virgin]]; the [[Assumption of Mary]]);\n* The [[Pope]] (i.e., belief that the Pope is the successor of [[St. Peter]], the \"rock\" on which the Church is built, and therefore the infallible head of Christendom);\n* [[Purgatory]] (a \"holding place\" after death where souls are purified before entering heaven);\n* [[Sacerdotalism]] (priesthood as intermediary and sacred office; also see [[priesthood (Catholic Church)]], [[Mass (liturgy)]], and priesthood in [[Vatican II]]);\n* The [[Sacrament]]s; [[Transubstantiation]]; [[Fermentum]];\n* [[Sainthood]], [[canonization]] and [[beatification]];\n* [[Papal Infallibility]] (the Pope being [[infallible]] when he speaks ''ex cathedra'', that is, when he speaks in his magisterial capacity to the whole Church on a matter of faith or morals);\n* [[Catholic Traditionalism|Tradition]] (i.e., its authority relative to Scripture and role of Tradition in [[Church Councils]]).\n\n=== Controversial movements ===\n\nChristians have had theological disagreements since the time of [[Jesus]]. Theological disputes have given rise to many [[Schism (religion)|schism]]s and different [[Christian denomination]]s, sects and movements.\n\n==== Pre-Reformation ====\n\n* [[Alogi]] –  rejected the doctrine of the [[Logos]]\n* [[Arianism]] –  doctrines regarding Christ's divinity;\n* [[Donatist|Donatism]]\n* [[Ebionites|Ebionitism]]\n* [[Gnosticism]] –  Generally rejected the goodness of the physical to emphasize the spiritual, also emphasized \"hidden teachings.\"\n* [[Judaizers]]\n* [[Manichaeism]]\n* [[Marcionism]]\n* [[Monarchianism]] –  doctrines regarding Christ's [[divinity]]\n* [[Monophysitism]] –  doctrines regarding Christ's divinity\n* [[Montanism]]\n* [[Nazarene (sect)]]\n* [[Nicolationism]]\n* [[Nontrinitarianism]]\n* [[Novatianism]]\n* [[Pelagianism]] –  denial of original sin and helplessness of sinner to save himself, strong affirmation of libertarian free will (see also [[Semi-Pelagianism]])\n* [[Quartodecimanism]] –  [[Easter controversy]]\n* [[Sabellianism]] –  doctrines regarding the Trinity, also known as \"[[modalism]].\"\n* [[Simonianism]]\n\n==== Post-Reformation ====\n\nBecause the Reformation promoted the idea that Christians could expound their own views of theology based on the notion of \"[[sola scriptura]],\" the Bible alone, many theological distinctions have occurred between the various Protestant denominations.  The differences between many of the denominations are relatively minor; however, and this has helped [[ecumenical]] efforts in recent times.\n\n* [[Adventism]] –  Typified by the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].\n* [[Anabaptism]]\n* [[Anglican doctrine|Anglicanism]]\n* [[Anglo-Catholicism]] –  [[High church]] theology of [[Anglican]]ism.\n* [[Arminianism]] –  Reaction to Calvinist [[soteriology]], which affirms man's freedom to accept or reject God's gift of salvation; identified with [[Dutch Reformed]] theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]], developed by [[Hugo Grotius]], defended by the [[Remonstrants]], and popularized by [[John Wesley]].
