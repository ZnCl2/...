The Cyrus Cylinder is a clay tablet created in 539 B.C. soon after the Achaemenid conquest of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. It proclaimed all of his subject to be free and banned the practice of slavery.

Additionally, the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] of 1776 encoded into law a number of fundamental [[civil rights]] and civil freedoms.\n\n{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.|United States Declaration of Independence, 1776}}\n\nThese were followed by developments in philosophy of human rights by philosophers such as [[Thomas Paine]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. The term ''human rights'' probably came into use some time between Paine's ''The Rights of Man'' and [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s 1831 writings in ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', in which he stated that he was trying to enlist his readers in \"the great cause of human rights\".

This was achieved across the [[British Empire]] by the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], which was [[Blockade of Africa|enforced internationally]] by the Royal Navy under treaties Britain negotiated with other nations,<ref name=\"Lovejoy\">{{cite book |last=Lovejoy |first=Paul E. |title=Transformations in slavery: a history of slavery in Africa |page=290 |location=New York |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0521780128 }}</ref> and the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. In the United States, all the northern states had [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolished]] the institution of slavery between 1777 and 1804, although southern states clung tightly to the \"peculiar institution\". Conflict and debates over the expansion of slavery to new territories constituted one of the reasons for the southern states' [[secession]] and the [[American Civil War]]. During the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction period]] immediately following the war, several amendments to the [[United States Constitution]] were made. These included the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th amendment]], banning slavery, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]], assuring full citizenship and civil rights to all people born in the United States, and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th amendment]], guaranteeing [[African Americans]] the right to vote. In [[Russia]], the reformer [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]] ended serfdom in 1861,<ref name=twsGaryJBass/> although the freed serfs often faced restrictions of their mobility within the nation.\n\nMany groups and movements have achieved profound social changes over the course of the 20th century in the name of human rights. In [[Europe]] and North America, [[trade union|labour unions]] brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating [[child labor|child labour]]. The [[women's rights]] movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to [[voting|vote]]. [[Wars of national liberation|National liberation movements]] in many countries succeeded in driving out [[colony|colonial]] powers. One of the most influential was [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s movement to free his native India from British rule. Movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the [[civil rights movement]], and more recent movements, on behalf of women and minorities in the United States.\n\nThe establishment of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], the 1864 [[Lieber Code]] and the first of the [[Geneva Conventions]] in 1864 laid the foundations of [[International humanitarian law]], to be further developed following the two [[World Wars]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nThe World Wars, and the huge losses of life and gross abuses of human rights that took place during them, were a driving force behind the development of modern [[international human rights instruments|human rights instruments]]. The [[League of Nations]] was established in 1919 at the negotiations over the [[Treaty of Versailles]] following the end of [[World War I]]. The League's goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation and diplomacy, and improving global welfare. Enshrined in its charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nAt the 1945 [[Yalta Conference]], the Allied Powers agreed to create a new body to supplant the League's role; this was to be the [[United Nations]]. The United Nations has played an important role in international human-rights law since its creation. Following the World Wars, the United Nations and its members developed much of the discourse and the bodies of law that now make up [[international humanitarian law]] and [[international human rights law]]. Analyst Belinda Cooper argued that human rights organisations flourished in the 1990s, possibly as a result of the dissolution of the [[Western bloc|western]] and [[Eastern bloc|eastern]] Cold War blocs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/books/review/Cooper-t.html|title=Book Review - The Last Utopia - Human Rights in History - By Samuel Moyn|first=Belinda|last=Cooper|date=September 24, 2010|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Ludwig Hoffmann argues that human rights became more widely emphasised in the latter half of the twentieth century because it \"provided a language for political claim making and counter-claims, liberal-democratic, but also socialist and post colonialist.<ref name=\"Hoffmann2010\">{{cite book|author=Stefan-Ludwig Hoffmann|title=Human Rights in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ES8ptQvfVvAC&pg=PA2|date=December 13, 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49410-6|pages=2–}}</ref>\n*Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam\n{{Main|Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam}}\nThe CDHR was signed by member states of the OIC in 1990 at the 19th Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Cairo, Egypt.

In fact, the CDHR was \"patterned after the UN-sponsored UDHR of 1948\".<ref name=\"Ahsan, Abdullah 2009\">al-Ahsan, Abdullah (2009). \"Law, Religion and Human Dignity in the Muslim World Today: An Examination of OIC's Cairo Declaration of Human Rights\". Journal of Law and Religion: 571</ref> The object of the CDHR was to \"serve as a guide for member states on human rights issues. CDHR translated the Qur'anic teachings as follows: \"All men are equal in terms of basic human dignity and basic obligations and responsibilities, without any discrimination on the basis of race, colour, language, belief, sex, religion, political affiliation, social status or other considerations. True religion is the guarantee for enhancing such dignity along the path to human integrity.<ref name=\"Ahsan, Abdullah 2009\"/> The CDHR referenced Islamic [[Sharia]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/cairodeclaration.html|title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|website=hrlibrary.umn.edu}}</ref> which includes [[Quran]], [[Hadith]], prophetic teachings and Islamic legal tradition.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{Main|Philosophy of human rights}}\nThe philosophy of human rights attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of human rights and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why human rights have become a part of social expectations.\n\nOne of the oldest Western philosophies of human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behaviour which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with [[David Hume|Hume]]). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of [[Max Weber|Weber]]). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) – a social contract. The two theories that dominate contemporary human rights discussion are the interest theory and the will theory. Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom.<ref name=\"IEOP\">{{Harvard citation no brackets |Fagan |2005 }}</ref> Other positions attempt to categorise rights into basic types, rather than make claims about the function or derivation of particular rights.<ref>[[Woody Evans]], 2015. \"Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds\".

At an international level the most common categorisation of human rights has been to split them into [[civil and political rights]], and [[economic, social and cultural rights]].\n\nCivil and political rights are enshrined in articles 3 to 21 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ([[ICCPR]]). Economic, social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles 22 to 28 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ([[ICESCR]]).\n\n===Indivisibility===\nThe [[UDHR]] included both economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination:\n\n{{Quote|The ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights, as well as his social, economic and cultural rights.|International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, 1966}}\n\nThis is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights. Similarly, without livelihoods and a working society, the public cannot assert or make use of civil or political rights (known as the ''full belly thesis'').\n\nThe indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights has been confirmed by the 1993 [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]]:\n\n{{Quote|All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and related. The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis.|[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], [[World Conference on Human Rights]], 1993}}\nThis statement was again endorsed at the 2005 World Summit in New York (paragraph 121).\n\nAlthough accepted by the signatories to the [[UDHR]], most do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights. Some Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the [[right to work]], to [[right to education|education]], [[right to health|health]] and housing. Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights.\n\n===Categorisation===\nOpponents of the indivisibility of human rights argue that economic, social and cultural rights are fundamentally different from civil and political rights and require completely different approaches.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Economic, social and cultural rights are argued{{By whom|date=July 2014}} to be:\n* ''aspirations or goals'', as opposed to real 'legal' rights\n* ''ideologically divisive/political'', meaning that there is no consensus on what should or should not be provided as a right\n* ''non-justiciable'', meaning that their provision, or the breach of them, cannot be judged in a court of law\n* ''positive'', meaning that they require active provision of entitlements by the state (as opposed to the state being required only to prevent the breach of rights)\n* ''progressive'', meaning that they will take significant time to implement\n* ''resource-intensive'', meaning that they are expensive and difficult to provide\n* ''[[socialism|socialist]]'', as opposed to [[capitalism|capitalist]]\n* ''vague'', meaning they cannot be quantitatively measured, and whether they are adequately provided or not is difficult to judge.\nSimilarly civil and political rights are categorized as:\n* ''capitalist''\n* ''cost-free''\n* ''immediate'', meaning they can be immediately provided if the state decides to\n* ''justiciable''\n* ''negative'', meaning the state can protect them simply by taking no action\n* ''non-ideological/non-political''\n* ''precise'', meaning their provision is easy to judge and measure\n* ''real 'legal' rights''\n\nAustralian politician Olivia Ball and British scholar Paul Gready argue that for both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, it is easy to find examples which do not fit into the above categorisation. Among several others, they highlight the fact that maintaining a judicial system, a fundamental requirement of the civil right to due process before the law and other rights relating to judicial process, is positive, resource-intensive, progressive and vague, while the social right to housing is precise, justiciable and can be a real 'legal' right.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=37 }}</ref>\n\n===Three generations===\nAnother categorisation, offered by Czech-French scholar [[Karel Vasak]], is that there are ''[[three generations of human rights]]'': first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment). Out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition. This categorisation is at odds with the indivisibility of rights, as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others. Prioritisation of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity. American human rights scholar [[Philip Alston]] argues:\n\n{{quote|If every possible human rights element is deemed to be essential or necessary, then nothing will be treated as though it is truly important.<ref name=\"Alston807\">{{Harvard citation no brackets |Alston |2005 |p=807 }}</ref>}}\n\nHe, and others, urge caution with prioritisation of rights:\n\n{{quote|source=|[T]he call for prioritizing is not to suggest that any obvious violations of rights can be ignored.|Philip Alston<ref name=\"Alston807\"/>}}\n\n{{quote|Priorities, where necessary, should adhere to core concepts (such as reasonable attempts at progressive realization) and principles (such as non-discrimination, equality and participation.|Olivia Ball, Paul Gready<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=42 }}</ref>}}\n\nSome human rights are said to be \"[[inalienable rights]]\". The term inalienable rights (or unalienable rights) refers to \"a set of human rights that are fundamental, are not awarded by human power, and cannot be surrendered.\"\n\n==International protection and promotion==\n{{Main|International human rights law}}\nIn the aftermath of the atrocities of World War II, there was increased concern for the social and legal protection of human rights as fundamental freedoms. The foundation of the [[United Nations]] and the provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for a comprehensive system of international law and practice for the protection of human rights. Since then, international human rights law has been characterised by a linked system of conventions, treaties, organisations, and political bodies, rather than any single entity or set of laws.<ref name=\"Brownlie532\">{{Harvard citation no brackets |Brownlie|2003|p=532 }}</ref> However, American analyst [[Pierre N.

Both covenants begin with the right of people to self-determination and to sovereignty over their natural resources.<ref>Henkin, Louis.

The original drafts included only political and civil rights, but economic and social rights were also proposed. The disagreement over which rights were basic human rights resulted in there being two covenants. The debate was whether economic and social rights are aspirational, as contrasted with basic human rights which all people possess purely by being human, because economic and social rights depend on wealth and the availability of resources. In addition, which social and economic rights should be recognised depends on ideology or economic theories, in contrast to basic human rights, which are defined purely by the nature (mental and physical abilities) of human beings. It was debated whether economic rights were appropriate subjects for binding obligations and whether the lack of consensus over such rights would dilute the strength of political-civil rights. There was wide agreement and clear recognition that the means required to enforce or induce compliance with socioeconomic undertakings were different from the means required for civil-political rights.<ref>Henkin, Louis. Introduction, The International Bill of Rights 9–10 (1981).</ref>\n\nThis debate and the desire for the greatest number of signatories to human-rights law led to the two covenants. The Soviet bloc and a number of developing countries had argued for the inclusion of all rights in a so-called ''Unity Resolution''.

They are generally known as ''human rights instruments''. Some of the most significant, referred to (with ICCPR and ICESCR) as \"the seven core treaties\", are:\n* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] ('''CEDAW''') (adopted 1979, entry into force: 1981)\n* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] ('''CERD''') (adopted 1966, entry into force: 1969)\n* [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] ('''CRPD''') (adopted 2006, entry into force: 2008)\n* [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] ('''CRC''') (adopted 1989, entry into force: 1989)\n* [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] ('''CAT''') (adopted 1984, entry into force: 1987)\n* [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families]] ('''ICRMW''' or more often '''MWC''') (adopted 1990, entry into force: 2003)\n\n===Customary international law===\n{{Main|Customary international law}}\nIn addition to protection by international treaties, customary international law may protect some human rights, such as the prohibition of torture, genocide and slavery and the principle of non-discrimination.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=275 }}</ref>\n\n===International humanitarian law===\n{{Main|Geneva Conventions|International humanitarian law}}\n\nThe '''Geneva Conventions''' came into being between 1864 and 1949 as a result of efforts by [[Henry Dunant]], the founder of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]. The conventions safeguard the human rights of individuals involved in armed conflict, and build on the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], the international community's first attempt to formalise the laws of war and war crimes in the nascent body of secular international law. The conventions were revised as a result of World War II and readopted by the international community in 1949.\n\n===United Nations system===\n{{Main|United Nations}}\nUnder the mandate of the UN charter, and the multilateral UN human rights treaties, the United Nations (UN) as an intergovernmental body seeks to apply international [[jurisdiction]] for universal human-rights legislation.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=92 }}</ref> Within the UN machinery, human-rights issues are primarily the concern of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], and there are numerous committees within the UN with responsibilities for safeguarding different human-rights treaties. The most senior body of the UN in the sphere of human rights is the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.

The 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) requires States parties to combat disease and malnutrition \"through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking-water\".\n\nThe most clear definition of the human right to water has been issued by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This treaty body interpreting legal obligations of State parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ([[ICESCR]]) issued in 2002 a non-binding interpretation affirming that access to water was a condition for the enjoyment of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] and inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of health (see ICESCR Art. 11 & 12) and therefore a human right:\n\n{{quote|The human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses.|United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights}}\n\nOn July 28, 2010, the United Nations General Assembly declared water and [[sanitation]] as human rights.

The first is that the right to a healthy or adequate environment is itself a human right (as seen in both Article 24 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], and Article 11 of the San Salvador Protocol to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]]).<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/charter_en.html \n |title=African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights \n |publisher=Achpr.org \n |date=July 20, 1979 \n |accessdate=August 29, 2010 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524075958/http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/charter_en.html \n |archivedate=May 24, 2005 \n |df=mdy-all \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url= http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/sigs/a-52.html\n |title= OAS – Organization of American States: Democracy for peace, security, and development\n |publisher= Oas.org\n |accessdate= August 29, 2010\n}}</ref>\nThe second conception is the idea that environmental human rights can be derived from other human rights, usually – the right to life, the right to health, the right to private family life and the right to property (among many others). This second theory enjoys much more widespread use in human rights courts around the world, as those rights are contained in many human rights documents.\n\nThe onset of various [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]], especially [[climate change]], has created potential conflicts between different human rights. Human rights ultimately require a working ecosystem and healthy environment, but the granting of certain rights to individuals may damage these.

However, in academia there is a dispute between scholars that advocate [[moral relativism]] and scholars that advocate [[moral universalism]]. Relativists do not argue against human rights, but concede that human rights are [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]] and are shaped by cultural and environmental contexts. Universalists argue that human rights have always existed, and apply to all people regardless of culture, race, sex, or religion.\n\nMore specifically, proponents of cultural relativism argue for acceptance of different cultures, which may have practices conflicting with human rights. Relativists caution that universalism could be used as a form of cultural, economic or political imperialism. [[The White Man's Burden]] is used as an example of imperialism and the destruction of local cultures justified by the desire to spread [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] values.<ref>\"Eurocentrism\". In ''Encyclopedia of the Developing World''. Ed. Thomas M. Leonard, Taylor & Francis, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-97662-6}}, p. 636.</ref>\nIn particular, the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically [[liberalism|liberal]] outlook which, although generally accepted in Europe, [[human rights in Japan|Japan]] or North America, is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nOpponents of relativism argue that some practices exist that violate the norms of all human cultures. A common example is [[female genital mutilation]], which occurs in different cultures in Africa, Asia and South America.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is not mandated by any religion, but has become a tradition in many cultures. It is considered a violation of women's and girl's rights by much of the international community, and is outlawed in some countries.\n\nThe former Prime Ministers of [[Singapore]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]], and of [[Malaysia]], [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] both claimed in the 1990s that ''[[Asian values]]'' were significantly different from Western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity, and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in Asia than democracy. [[Lee Kuan Yew]] argued that:\n\n{{quote|What Asians value may not necessarily be what Americans or Europeans value. Westerners value the freedoms and liberties of the individual. As an Asian of Chinese cultural background, my values are for a government which is honest, effective, and efficient.|[[Lee Kuan Yew]], ''Democracy, Human Rights and the Realities'', Tokyo, Nov 10, 1992<ref>Halper, Stefan. ''The Beijing consensus''. p. 133</ref>}}\n\nIn response, critics have pointed out that cultural relativism could be used as a justification for authoritarianism. An example is in 1981, when the Iranian representative to the [[United Nations]], Said Rajaie-Khorassani, articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by saying that the UDHR was \"a [[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition\", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law.<ref name=\"Littman1999\">Littman (1999)</ref>\nThe Asian Values argument was criticised by Mahathir's former deputy:\n\n{{quote|To say that freedom is Western or unAsian is to offend our traditions as well as our forefathers, who gave their lives in the struggle against tyranny and injustices.|[[Anwar Ibrahim|A. Ibrahim]] in his keynote speech to the Asian Press Forum titled ''Media and Society in Asia'', December 2, 1994}}\n\nand by Singapore's opposition leader [[Chee Soon Juan]], who states that it is racist to assert that Asians do not want human rights.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ball|Gready|2006|p=25}}</ref>\n\nDefenders of moral universalism argue that relativistic arguments neglect the fact that modern human rights are new to all cultures, dating back no further than the UDHR in 1948. They argue that the UDHR was drafted by people from many different cultures and traditions, including a US Roman Catholic, a Chinese Confucian philosopher, a French zionist and a representative from the Arab League, amongst others, and drew upon advice from thinkers such as Mahatma Gandhi.<ref name=\"Gready34\"/> [[Michael Ignatieff]] has argued that cultural relativism is almost exclusively an argument used by those who wield power in cultures which commit human rights abuses, and that those whose human rights are compromised are the powerless.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ignatieff|2001|p=68}}</ref>\nThis reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture.\n\nAlthough the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete, it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable. The [[2005 World Summit]] reaffirmed the international community's adherence to this principle:\n\n{{quote|The universal nature of human rights and freedoms is beyond question.|2005 World Summit, paragraph 121}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Human rights}}\n* [[Children's rights]]\n* [[Fundamental rights]]\n* [[Human rights in cyberspace]]\n* [[Human rights group]]\n* [[Human rights in the United States]]\n* [[Human rights literature]]\n* [[Human Rights Watch]]\n* [[International human rights law]]\n* [[International human rights instruments]]\n* [[Intersex human rights]]\n* [[List of human rights organisations]]\n* [[LGBT rights]]\n* [[Minority rights]]\n* [[Public international law]]\n*[[International Year of Human Rights]]\n*[[European Court of Human Rights]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n* {{Cite book\n |last= Beitz\n |first= Charles R.\n |title= The idea of human rights\n |year =2009\n |publisher= Oxford University Press\n |location= Oxford\n |isbn= 978-0-19-957245-8\n |ref= harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n |last= Moyn\n |first= Samuel\n|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674064348 |title=The last utopia: human rights in history\n |year= 2010\n |publisher= Belknap Press of Harvard University Press\n |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts\n |isbn= 978-0-674-06434-8\n |ref= harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n |last= Donnelly\n |first= Jack\n |title= Universal human rights in theory and practice\n |year =2003\n |publisher= Cornell University Press\n |location= Ithaca\n |isbn= 978-0-8014-8776-7\n |edition= 2nd\n |ref= harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n |last= Ball\n |last2= Gready\n |first= Olivia\n |title= The no-nonsense guide to human rights\n |year= 2006\n |work= New Internationalist\n |location= Oxford\n |isbn= 978-1-904456-45-2\n |first2= Paul\n |ref= harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n |last= Freeman\n |first= Michael\n |title= Human rights : an interdisciplinary approach\n |year= 2002\n |publisher= Polity Press\n |location= Cambridge\n |isbn= 978-0-7456-2355-9\n |ref= harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n |last= Doebbler\n |first= Curtis F.
