Such a conflict could result in the [[Human extinction|extinction of mankind itself]].]]\n'''World War III''' ('''WWIII''' or '''WW3''') and the '''Third World War''' are names given to a hypothetical third [[World war|worldwide large-scale military conflict]] subsequent to [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The term has been in use since at least as early as 1941. Some have applied it loosely to refer to limited or smaller conflicts such as the [[Cold War]] or the [[War on Terror]], while others have operated under the assumption that such a conflict would surpass both prior World Wars in both the level of its widespread scope and of its overall destructive impact.<ref name=\"einstein\">The New Quotable Einstein. By Alice Calaprice (2005), p. 173.</ref>\n\nBecause of the [[Manhattan Project|development]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use]] of [[nuclear weapon]]s near the end of World War II and their subsequent acquisition and deployment by [[List of states with nuclear weapons|many countries]], the potential risk of a nuclear devastation of Earth's civilization and life is a common theme in speculations of a Third World War. Another major concern is that [[biological warfare]] could cause a very large number of casualties, either intentionally or inadvertently by an accidental release of a biological agent, the unexpected mutation of an agent, or its adaptation to other species after use. High-scale [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] events like these, caused by advanced technology used for destruction, could potentially make [[Earth's surface]] uninhabitable.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914–1918) was believed to have been the \"[[The war to end war|war to end all wars]],\" as it was popularly believed that never again could there possibly be a global conflict of such magnitude. During the inter-war period between the two World Wars, WWI was typically referred to simply as \"The Great War\". The outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 disproved the hope that mankind might have already \"outgrown\" the need for such widespread global wars.\n\nWith the advent of the Cold War in 1945 and with the spread of nuclear weapons technology to the [[Soviet Union]], the possibility of a third global conflict became more plausible. During the Cold War years the possibility of a Third World War was anticipated and planned for by military and civil authorities in many countries. Scenarios ranged from [[conventional warfare]] to limited or total nuclear warfare. At the height of the Cold War, a scenario referred to as [[Mutual assured destruction|Mutually Assured Destruction]] (\"MAD\") had been calculated which determined that an all-out nuclear confrontation would most certainly destroy all or nearly all human life on the planet. The potential absolute destruction of the human race may have contributed to the ability of both American and Soviet leaders to avoid such a scenario.\n\nThe Cold War ended in 1991 when the Soviet Union dissolved, leaving the [[United States]] as the sole global superpower of the time. With the end of the Cold War, it was believed that the likelihood of a fully unrestricted nuclear confrontation between two superpowers was significantly diminished. However figures released by Google and published in 2017 reveal that the number of users searching the internet for various phases including \"World War 3\" and “Nuclear War” was at an all time high amid the election of US president Donald Trump and such ongoing flash points for potential superpower confrontation as the Syrian civil war.<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/google-searches-spike-world-world-3-donald-trump_us_58f1db82e4b0da2ff86115ce</ref>\n\n== Coinage ==\n\n===''Time'' magazine===\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine was an early adopter if not originator of the \"World War III.\"  Perhaps the first usage appears in its November 3, 1941, issue (preceding the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941) under its \"National Affairs\" section and entitled \"World War III?\" about [[Nazi]] refugee Dr. [[Hermann Rauschning]], who had just arrived in the United States.<ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Foreign News:  World War III?\n| publisher = Time\n| url = http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,772740,00.html\n| date = 3 November 1941\n| accessdate = 12 August 2017}}</ref>  In its March 22, 1943, issue under its \"Foreign News\" section, ''Time'' reused the same title \"World War III?\" with regard to statements by then-[[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Henry A.

Between 75 and 100 of the 300 nuclear weapons were targeted to destroy Soviet combat aircraft on the ground.\n\nThe scenario was devised prior to the development of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s. It was also devised before [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] and his [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] changed the US Nuclear War plan from the 'city killing' countervalue strike plan to a \"counterforce\" plan (targeted more at military forces).

The exercise was intended to ensure that NATO had the ability to quickly deploy forces to West Germany in the event of a conflict with the [[Warsaw Pact]].\nThe Warsaw Pact outnumbered NATO throughout the Cold War in conventional forces, especially armor. Therefore, in the event of a Soviet invasion, in order not to resort to tactical nuclear strikes, NATO forces holding the line against a Warsaw Pact armored spearhead would have to be quickly resupplied and replaced. Most of this support would have come across the Atlantic from the US and Canada.\n\nReforger was not merely a show of force—in the event of a conflict, it would be the actual plan to strengthen the NATO presence in Europe. In that instance, it would have been referred to as Operation Reforger. Important components in Reforger included the [[Military Airlift Command]], the [[Military Sealift Command]], and the [[Civil Reserve Air Fleet]].\n\n===Seven Days to the River Rhine===\n{{Main|Seven Days to the River Rhine}}\n[[File:Probable Axes of Attack.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A Warsaw Pact invasion would have come via three main paths through Germany]]\nSeven Days to the River Rhine was a top secret military simulation exercise developed in 1979 by the Warsaw Pact.

Other USSR plans stopped only upon reaching the French border on day nine. Individual Warsaw Pact states were only assigned their own subpart of the strategic picture; in this case, the Polish forces were only expected to go as far as Germany. The Seven Days to the Rhine plan envisioned that Poland and Germany would be largely destroyed by nuclear exchanges, and that large numbers of troops would die of [[radiation sickness]]. It was estimated that NATO would fire nuclear weapons behind the advancing Soviet lines to cut off their supply lines and thus blunt their advance. While this plan assumed that NATO would use nuclear weapons to push back any Warsaw Pact invasion, it did not include nuclear strikes on France or the United Kingdom. Newspapers speculated when this plan was declassified, that France and the UK were not to be hit in an effort to get them to withhold use of their own nuclear weapons.\n\n===Exercise Able Archer===\n{{main|Able Archer 83}}\n[[File:Reagan and Gordievsky.jpg|thumb|right|upright|President [[Ronald Reagan]] and Soviet double agent [[Oleg Gordievsky]], who later told the west how close the Able Archer 83 exercise had brought the Soviets to ordering a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|First Strike]].]]\nExercise Able Archer was an annual exercise by the United States military in Europe that practiced command and control procedures, with emphasis on transition from solely conventional operations to chemical, nuclear, and conventional operations during a time of war.\n\n\"Able Archer 83\" was a five-day [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) [[command post]] [[military exercise|exercise]] starting on 7 November 1983, that spanned [[Western Europe]], centered on the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) Headquarters in [[Casteau]], north of the city of [[Mons]].

Although he later believed in disarmament treaties slowly blunting the danger of nuclear weaponry by reducing their number and alert status, he also believed a technological solution might allow incoming ICBMs to be shot down, thus making the US invulnerable to a first strike. However the USSR saw the SDI concept as a major threat, since unilateral deployment of the system would allow the US to launch a massive first strike on the Soviet Union without any fear of retaliation.\n\nThe SDI concept was to use ground-based and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[ballistic missile]]s.

During the Cold War era (1947–1991), a number of military events have been described as having come quite close to potentially triggering World War III.\n\n=== Korean War: 25 June 1950&nbsp;– 27 July 1953 ===\nThe [[Korean War]] was a war between two coalitions fighting for control over the [[Korean Peninsula]]: a communist coalition including North Korea, China and the USSR, and a capitalist coalition including South Korea, the United States, and the UN. Many then believed that the conflict was likely to soon escalate into a full-scale war between the three countries, the US, the USSR, and China.

B-59 had a nuclear torpedo on board, three officer keys were required to use it. Only one dissent prevented the submarine from attacking the US fleet nearby, a spark that could have led to a Third World War (October 28–29, 1962)]]\nThe [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]: a confrontation on the stationing of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, in response to the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], is considered as having been the closest to a nuclear exchange, which could have precipitated a Third World War. The crisis peaked on 27 October, with three separate major incidents occurring on the same day, all of these incidents having been initiated by the US military.\n\n* The \"Arkhipov save\" incident occurred when a Soviet submarine nearly launched a nuclear-tipped torpedo in response to having been targeted by American naval [[depth charge]]s in international waters, with the Soviet nuclear launch response only having being prevented by Soviet naval officer [[Vasili Arkhipov]]. \n* The shooting down of a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] while violating Cuban airspace. \n* The near interception of another U-2 that had somehow managed to stray into Soviet airspace over Siberia, which airspace violation nearly caused the Soviets to believe that this might be the vanguard of a US aerial bombardment.\n\nDespite what many believe to be the closest the world has come to a nuclear conflict, throughout the entire standoff, the [[Doomsday Clock]], which is run by the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] to estimate how close the end of the world, or doomsday, is, with midnight being the apocalypse, stayed at a relatively stable seven minutes to midnight. This has been explained as being due to the brevity of the crisis, since the clock monitored more long term factors such as leadership of countries, conflicts, wars, and political upheavals, as well as societies reactions to said factors.\n\nThe Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists now credits the political developments resulting from the Cuban Missile Crisis with having actually enhanced global stability.  The Bulletin posits that future crises and occasions that might otherwise escalate, were rendered as more stable due to two major factors: \n# A Washington to Moscow [[Moscow–Washington hotline|direct telephone line]], resulted from the communication trouble between the [[White House]] and the [[Kremlin]] during the crisis, giving the leaders of the two largest nuclear powers the ability to contact each other in real time, rather than sending written messages that needed to be translated and wired, which had dragged out conversations in which seconds could have potentially prevented a nuclear exchange.\n# The second factor was caused in part due to the worldwide reaction to how close the US and USSR had come to the brink of World War III during the standoff.  As the public began to more closely monitor topics involving nuclear weapons, and therefore to rally support for the cause of non-proliferation, the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|1963 test ban treaty]] was signed.  To date this treaty has been signed by 126 total nations, with the most notable exceptions being [[France and weapons of mass destruction|France]] and [[China and weapons of mass destruction|China]].  Both of these countries were still in the relative beginning stages of their nuclear programs at the time of the original treaty signing, and both sought nuclear capabilities independent of their allies.\n\n::-This Test Ban Treaty prevented the testing of nuclear ordnance that detonated in the atmosphere, limiting testing to below ground and under water, decreasing fallout and effects on the environment, and subsequently caused the Doomsday Clock to decrease by five minutes, to arrive at a total of twelve minutes to midnight. Up until this point, over 1000 nuclear bombs had been detonated, and concerns over both long and short term affects to the planet became increasingly more worrisome to scientists.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thebulletin.org/remembering-cuban-missile-crisis |title=Remembering the Cuban Missile Crisis |date=16 October 2012 |website=thebulletin.org}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=September 2017|reason=only the part about doomsday clock is in article}}\n\n=== Yom Kippur War super-power tensions: 6–25 October 1973 ===\nThe [[Yom Kippur War]], also known as the Ramadan War, or October War, began with Arab victories.
