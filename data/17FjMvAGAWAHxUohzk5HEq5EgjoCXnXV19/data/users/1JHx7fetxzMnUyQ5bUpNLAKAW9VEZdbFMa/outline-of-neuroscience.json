The field draws on both neuroscience and developmental biology to provide insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which complex nervous systems develop.\n\n===Cognitive neuroscience===\n[[Cognitive neuroscience]] is concerned with the scientific study of biological substrates underlying cognition, with a focus on the neural substrates of mental processes.\n\n* [[Neurolinguistics]]\n* [[Neuroimaging]]\n* [[functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging]]\n* [[Positron emission tomography]]\n\n===Systems neuroscience===\n[[Systems neuroscience]] is a subdiscipline of neuroscience which studies the function of neural circuits and systems. It is an umbrella term, encompassing a number of areas of study concerned with how nerve cells behave when connected together to form neural networks.\n\n* [[Neural oscillation]]\n\n===Molecular neuroscience===\n[[Molecular neuroscience]] is a branch of neuroscience that examines the biology of the nervous system with molecular biology, molecular genetics, protein chemistry and related methodologies.\n\n* [[Nutritional neuroscience]]\n* [[Neurochemistry]]\n\n===Computational neuroscience===\n[[Computational neuroscience]] includes both the study of the information processing functions of the nervous system, and the use of digital computers to study the nervous system. It is an interdisciplinary science that links the diverse fields of neuroscience, cognitive science and psychology, electrical engineering, computer science, physics and mathematics.\n\n* [[Neural network]]\n* [[Neuroinformatics]]\n* [[Brainâ€“computer interface]]\n* [[Mathematical neuroscience]]\n\n===Neurophilosophy===\n[[Neurophilosophy]] or \"philosophy of neuroscience\" is the interdisciplinary study of neuroscience and philosophy. Work in this field is often separated into two distinct approaches. The first approach attempts to solve problems in philosophy of mind with empirical information from the neurosciences. The second approach attempts to clarify neuroscientific results using the conceptual rigor and methods of philosophy of science.\n\n* [[Criticism of the scientific status of neuroscience]]\n* [[Philosophy of mind]]\n* [[Neuroethics]]\n* [[Neuroscience of free will]]\n\n===Neurology===\n[[Neurology]] is the medical specialty dealing with disorders of the nervous system. It deals with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of disease involving the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems.\n\n* [[Stroke]]\n* [[Parkinson's disease]]\n* [[Alzheimer's disease]]\n* [[Huntington's disease]]\n* [[Multiple sclerosis]]\n* [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]\n* [[Rabies]]\n* [[Schizophrenia]]\n* [[Epilepsy]]\n* [[Hydrocephalus]]\n* [[Brain damage]]\n* [[Traumatic brain injury]]\n* [[Closed head injury]]\n* [[Coma]]\n* [[Paralysis]]\n* [[Level of consciousness]]\n* [[Neurosurgery]]\n\n===Neuropsychology===\n[[Neuropsychology]] studies the structure and function of the brain related to psychological processes and behaviors. The term is used most frequently with reference to studies of the effects of brain damage in humans and animals.\n\n* [[Agraphia]]\n* [[Agnosia]]\n* [[Alexia (acquired dyslexia)|Alexia]]\n* [[Amnesia]]\n* [[Anosognosia]]\n* [[Aphasia]]\n* [[Apraxia]]\n* [[Dementia]]\n* [[Dyslexia]]\n* [[Hemispatial neglect|Hemispatial Neglect]]\n* [[Neurobiological effects of physical exercise]]\n\n===Neuroevolution===\n\n* [[Evolution of nervous systems]]\n* [[Neuroevolution]]\n* [[Noogenesis]]\n\n== History of neuroscience ==\n* [[History of neuroscience]]\n* [[Neuron doctrine]]\n* [[:Category:History of neuroscience]]\n\n==Nervous system==\n\n[[Outline of the human nervous system]]\n* [[Action potential]]\n* [[Acetylcholine]]\n* [[Acetylcholinesterase]]\n* [[Aging and memory]]\n* [[Albert Einstein's brain]]\n* [[Brain]]\n* [[Central nervous system|Central nervous system (CNS)]]\n* [[Dendrite]]\n* [[Dopamine]]\n* [[Glial cell]]s\n* [[Human brain]]\n* [[Long-term potentiation]]\n* [[Nervous system]]\n* [[Neurite]]\n* [[Neuron]]\n* [[Neuroplasticity]]\n* [[Neurotransmitter]]\n* [[Synapse]]\n* [[Synaptic plasticity]]\n\n== Neuroscience organizations ==\n* [[List of neuroscience organizations]]\n\n== Persons influential in the field of neuroscience ==\n* [[List of neuroscientists]]\n* [[:Category:Neuroscientists]]\n\n==Related sciences==\n* [[Genetics]]\n* [[Neurochemistry]]\n* [[Cognitive science]]\n* [[Psychology]]\n* [[Molecular biology]]\n* [[Psychiatry]]\n* [[Neurosurgery]]\n* [[Linguistics]]\n* [[Developmental biology]]\n* [[Biotechnology]]\n* [[Neurophilosophy]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Neuroscience}}\n* [[v:Fundamentals of Neuroscience|Fundamentals of Neuroscience]] at [[v:|Wikiversity]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{sisterlinks|Neurosience}}\n\n* {{In Our Time|Neuroscience|b00fbd26|Neuroscience}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070125124755/http://www.neuinfo.org/ Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF)]\n* {{DMOZ|Science/Biology/Neurobiology/}}\n* [http://www.asneurochem.org American Society for Neurochemistry]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160214021422/http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/ Neuroscience Online (electronic neuroscience textbook)]\n* [http://www.funfaculty.org/drupal/ Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience (FUN)]\n* [http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/neurok.html Neuroscience for Kids]\n* [https://www.researchgate.net/group/Neuroscience Neuroscience Discussion Group] in [[ResearchGate]]\n* [http://www.neuroscienceforum.com Neuroscience Discussion Forum]\n* [http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/neuroscience/lectures.html HHMI Neuroscience lecture series - ''Making Your Mind: Molecules, Motion, and Memory'']\n\n{{Outline footer}}\n\n[[Category:Biology-related lists|Neuroscience]]\n[[Category:Neuroscience| ]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia outlines|Neuroscience]]\n[[Category:Psychology lists|Neuroscience]]",
