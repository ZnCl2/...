[[Bitcoin XT]] was one proposal that aimed for 24 transactions per second. In order to accomplish this, it proposed increasing the block size from 1 megabyte to 8 megabytes. When Bitcoin XT was declined, some community members still wanted block sizes to increase. In response, a group of developers launched [[Bitcoin Classic]], which intended to increase the block size to only 2 megabytes. [[Bitcoin Unlimited]] set itself apart by allowing miners to decide on the size of their blocks, with nodes and miners limiting the size of blocks they accept, up to 16 megabytes.\n\n==== Segregated Witness ====\n\n[[Bitcoin Core]] developer Peter Wuille presented the idea of [[Segregated Witness]] (SegWit) in late 2015. SegWit is a ''soft fork'' &ndash; a backward-compatible rule update &ndash that aims to reduce the size of each bitcoin transaction, thereby allowing more transactions to take place at once. Some developers and users decided to initiate a hard fork - [[Bitcoin Cash]] - in order to avoid the protocol updates SegWit brought about.\n\n==== New features ====\nBitcoin Gold was a hard fork that followed several months later in October 2017 that changed the proof-of-work algorithm with the aim of restoring mining functionality to basic graphics processing units (GPU), as the developers felt that mining had become too specialized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/bitcoin-gold-the-latest-bitcoin-fork-explained/|title=Bitcoin Gold, the latest Bitcoin fork, explained|website=Ars Technica|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229172206/https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/bitcoin-gold-the-latest-bitcoin-fork-explained/|archivedate=29 December 2017|deadurl=no|accessdate=29 December 2017}}</ref> [[Bitcoin Private]], launched in March 2018, added the ability to keep certain details private in a transaction, in contrast to bitcoin which has a transparent transaction history.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Blockchain ===\n{{broader|Blockchain}}\n\n[[File:Utxo-count.svg|thumb|Number of [[unspent transaction outputs]]]]\n\nThe ''blockchain'' is a public [[ledger]] that records bitcoin transactions.{{r|econbc}} It is implemented as a chain of blocks, each block containing a hash of the previous block up to the ''genesis block''{{efn|The genesis block is the block number 0.

Creating a bitcoin address is nothing more than picking a random valid private key and computing the corresponding bitcoin address. This computation can be done in a split second. But the reverse (computing the private key of a given bitcoin address) is mathematically unfeasible and so users can tell others and make public a bitcoin address without compromising its corresponding private key. Moreover, the number of valid private keys is so vast that it is extremely unlikely someone will compute a key-pair that is already in use and has funds. The vast number of valid private keys makes it unfeasible that brute force could be used for that.

The block size limit of one [[megabyte]] was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010. Eventually the block size limit of one megabyte created problems for transaction processing, such as increasing transaction fees and delayed processing of transactions.<ref>{{cite news |last1 = Orcutt |first1 = Mike |title = Leaderless Bitcoin Struggles to Make Its Most Crucial Decision |url = https://www.technologyreview.com/s/537486/leaderless-bitcoin-struggles-to-make-its-most-crucial-decision/ |accessdate = 22 June 2017 |work = MIT Technology Review |date = 19 May 2015 }}{{cite news |title = Bitcoin Transaction Fees Are Pretty Low Right Now: Heres Why |url=https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-transaction-fees-are-pretty-low-right-now-heres-why/ |date = 31 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 August 2017 (at block 481,824), [[Segregated Witness]] (SegWit) went live. Transactions contain some data which is only used to verify the transaction, and does not otherwise effect the movement of coins. SegWit introduces a new transaction format that moves this data into a new field in a backwards-compatible way. The segregated data, the so-called ''witness'', is not sent to non-SegWit nodes and therefore does not form part of the blockchain as seen by legacy nodes. This lowers the size of the average transaction in such nodes' view, thereby increasing the block size without incurring the hard fork implied by other proposals for block size increases. Thus, per computer scientist Jochen Hoenicke, the actual block capacity depends on the ratio of SegWit transactions in the block, and on the ratio of signature data. Based on his estimate, if the ratio of SegWit transactions is 50%, the block capacity may be 1.25 megabytes. According to Hoenicke, if native SegWit addresses from Bitcoin Core version 0.16.0 are used, and SegWit adoption reaches 90 to 95%, a block size of up to 1.8 megabytes is possible.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== Economics ==\n{{Main|Economics of bitcoin}}\n\nBitcoin is a [[digital asset]] invented by Satoshi Nakamoto that was designed to work in peer-to-peer transactions as a currency.{{r|paper|Monetarists}} Bitcoin does not work easily in transactions, or as a [[currency]].<ref name=\"currencydispute\">{{cite news |url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/04/25/ozy-bitcoin-africa-currency/8148853/ |title = How bitcoin is moving money in Africa |publisher = USA Today |work = usatoday.com |date = 25 April 2014 |accessdate = 25 May 2014 |author = Joyner, April |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140501011649/http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/04/25/ozy-bitcoin-africa-currency/8148853/ |archivedate = 1 May 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"JEP\"/> Bitcoins have three qualities useful in a currency, according to ''The Economist'' in January 2015: they are \"hard to earn, limited in supply and easy to verify\".<ref name=ec1305>{{cite news |title = The magic of mining |url = https://www.economist.com/news/business/21638124-minting-digital-currency-has-become-big-ruthlessly-competitive-business-magic |accessdate = 13 January 2015 |work = [[The Economist]] |date = 13 January 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150112165531/http://www.economist.com/news/business/21638124-minting-digital-currency-has-become-big-ruthlessly-competitive-business-magic |archivedate = 12 January 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Economists define money as a [[store of value]], a [[medium of exchange]], and a [[unit of account]] and agree that bitcoin does not meet all these criteria.<ref name=econ315 /> {{As of|2014|3}}, the bitcoin market suffered from [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]], limiting the ability of bitcoin to act as a stable store of value, and retailers accepting bitcoin use other currencies as their principal unit of account.<ref name=econ315>{{cite news |title = Free Exchange.
