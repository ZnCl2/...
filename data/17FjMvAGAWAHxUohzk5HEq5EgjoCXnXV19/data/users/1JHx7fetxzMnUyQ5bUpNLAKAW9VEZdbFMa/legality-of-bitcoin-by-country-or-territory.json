While some countries have ''explicitly'' allowed its use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoins differently. While this article provides the legal status of bitcoin, regulations and bans that apply to this [[cryptocurrency]] likely extend to similar systems as well.\n[[File:Legal status of bitcoin.png|thumb|Legal status of bitcoin\n{{legend|#33cc66|'''permissive''' (legal to use bitcoin)}}\n{{legend|#ffcc00|'''contentious''' (some restrictions on legal usage of bitcoin)}}\n{{legend|#ec6dd5|'''contentious''' (interpretation of old laws, but bitcoin isn't prohibited directly)}}\n{{legend|#ff3333|'''hostile''' (full or partial prohibition)}}]]\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Detail by union==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:120px;\"| '''Country or territory''' !!
