Stagecraft is distinct from the wider scope of [[scenography]]. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it relates primarily to the practical implementation of a [[designer]]'s artistic vision.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n== Essence of stagecraft ==\n\n[[Stagecraft]]\n* [[Cue (theatrical)]]\n* [[Curtain call|Curtain Call]]\n* [[Rehearsal]]\n* [[Stage (theatre)|Stage]]\n* [[Theatrical constraints]]\n* [[Theatrical superstitions]]\n* [[Technical rehearsal]]\n* [[Technical week]]\n* [[Performance]]\n\n== Branches of stagecraft ==\n\n=== Lighting===\n\n[[Lighting design]]\nLighting involves the process of determining the size, intensity, shape, and color of light for a given scene.   Typical work includes hanging, focusing, procurement and maintenance of fixtures as well as some aspects of [[show control]].\n\n*[[Electrician (theatre)]]\n*[[Color temperature]] \n*[[Intelligent lighting]] - [[LED stage lighting]] - [[Light plot]] - [[Stage lighting]] - [[Stage lighting instrument]] - [[Stage lighting accessories]]\n\n===Audio===\n\n[[Sound design]]\nSound, which can include musical [[underscoring]], vocal and instrument [[Audio mixing (film and television)|mixing]] as well as theatrical [[sound effect]]s.\n\n*[[Audio engineering]]\n*[[Microphone]] - [[Sound]] - [[Smiley face curve]]\n\n===Carpentry===\n\n[[set construction]]\nCarpentry is the process of building [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], which can include [[scenic painting]] and soft goods (drapes and stage curtains).  Scenic carpentry also covers ''mechanics'': the design, engineering and operation of [[Fly system]] scenery or flying of performers and mechanised scenic elements.\n\n*[[Carpenter (theatre)]]\n*[[Counterweight fly system]] - [[Rail (theater)]] - [[Rigging (theatre)]] - [[Scene shop]] -\n[[Scenery wagon]] - [[show control]] - [[Theatrical scenery]]\n\n===Props===\n\n[[Theatrical property]]\nProps, which includes furnishings, set dressings, and all items large and small which cannot be classified as scenery, electrics or wardrobe. Some [[Theatrical property#Property department crossovers|crossover]] may apply. Props handled by actors are known as ''hand props'', and props which are kept in an actor's costume are known as ''personal props''.\n\n===Costumes===\n\n[[costume construction]]\nCostuming, known as the [[Wardrobe (clothing)|Wardrobe]] department, is responsible for [[costume design]], [[costume construction|construction]] and the procurement and maintenance of [[costume]]s.\n\n*[[Make-up artist]] - [[Wig]]s\n\n== Positions in Stagecraft ==\n\n=== Management ===\n*[[stage management]]\n*[[Technical director]]\n*[[production management]]\n*[[house management]]\n*[[company management]]\n\n===Technical ===\n*[[Carpenter (theatre)]]\n*[[Electrician (theatre)]]\n*[[Fly crew]]\n*[[Property master]]\n*[[Pyrotechnician]]\n*[[Running crew]]\n*[[Spotlight operator]]\n*[[Stagehand]]\n*[[Theatrical Technician]]\n*[[Technical crew]]\n*[[Wardrobe supervisor]]\n\n=== Design ===\n* [[Costume Designer]]\n*[[Lighting designer]]\n*[[Scenic designer]]\n* [[Sound Designer]]\n* [[Video design]]\n\n== Stagecraft organizations ==\n* [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]]\n* [[PLASA]]\n* [[United Scenic Artists]]\n* [[United States Institute for Theatre Technology]]\n\n== History of stagecraft ==\n\n[[History of stagecraft]]\n*[[2007 Broadway stagehand strike]]\n\n== General stagecraft concepts ==\n[[Parts of a theatre]]\n\n=== Terminology ===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:WikiProject Stagecraft/Terminology}}\n\n*[[Bobbinet]] - [[McCandless Method]] - [[Spike (stagecraft)]] - [[Tannoy]]\n* [[Theatrical production]]\n* [[Film production]]\n* [[Video production]]\n\n=== Important technology ===\n\n*[[Architecture for Control Networks|ACN]] - [[C-Clamp (stagecraft)]] - [[Color gel]] - [[Color scroller]] - [[Dimmer]] - [[DMX512]]\n*[[Fog machine]] - [[Followspot]] - [[Footlights]] - [[Gobo (lighting)]] - [[Haze machine]]  - [[Parabolic aluminized reflector light]] - [[Safety curtain]] - [[XLR connector]]\n\n=== Venues ===\n*[[Broadway theatre]] - [[Regional theatre in the United States]] - [[community theatre]]\n\n== Persons influential in the field of stagecraft ==\n*[[Dale Ferguson (designer)|Dale Ferguson]] - Designer\n*[[Neil Peter Jampolis]] - Lighting and Set\n* [[Samuel James Hume]] - Organizer of the first exhibition of stagecraft in the United States.\n\n=== Costume Designers ===\n*[[Jane Greenwood]] - [[Paul Tazewell]]\n\n=== Lighting Designers ===\n\n[[List of lighting designers]]\n*[[Andrew Bridge (lighting designer)|Andrew Bridge]] - [[Howell Binkley]] - [[Luc Lafortune]] - [[Mark Henderson (lighting designer)|Mark Henderson]] - [[Nigel Levings]] - [[Paul Gallo]] - [[Richard Riddell]] - [[Tharon Musser]]\n\n=== Set Designers ===\n*[[Allen Moyer]] - [[Carl Toms]] - [[Donald Oenslager]] - [[John Conklin]] - [[John Napier (designer)|John Napier]]\n\n=== Sound Designers ===\n*[[Paul Arditti]]\n\n== Awards ==\n*[[Dora Mavor Moore Award]]\n*[[TEC Awards]]\n*[[Tony Award for Best Stage Technician]]\n*[[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Set Designer]]\n\n== Stagecraft lists ==\n{{see also|Wikipedia:WikiProject Stagecraft}}\n{{Portal|Theatre}}\n*[[List of theatre personnel]]\n*[[Running crew]]\n\n{{categorytree|Theatrical occupations}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links|collapsible=collapsed |Stagecraft}}\n\n{{Outline footer}}\n\n<!--Eponymous categories:-->\n\n[[Category:Stagecraft| 1]]\n<!--Other categories:-->\n[[Category:Wikipedia outlines|Stagecraft]]\n[[Category:Stage terminology]]\n[[Category:WikiProject Stagecraft]]",
