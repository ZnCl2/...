            "text": "A Zite is a [[ZeroNet]] [[website]]. Zites have the notable difference of being entirely [[decentralized]] and work even if the visitor is offline. Zites are designed to be entirely [[open source]] and freely shared. Zite owners can also make their site [[cloneable]]. This ensures content is not censored and cannot be forcefully taken down.\n\nHowever, due to how the site is distributed and viewed, sites must be entirely contained within local [[HTML]] and [[JavaScript]] files. Information for the site can be stored in an [[SQLite]] database or in [[JSON]] files.\n\nZites require the private key generated with the address in order to be edited or published. Users of the zite have a subdirectory they may edit within the zite's file structure.\n\n[http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Jtjb5CU9aod4jtz8hF5NPPqFKofRSsb4x/ ZeroTuto], is a great resource for creating zites.\n\nVarious attempts have been made to index and search the hundreds of zites that have been created. [[Search engine|Search engines]] like [[Kaffiene]] or [[ZeroSearch]] allow searching through hand-crafted indexes using key terms. While other zites, like [[0list]] or [[ZeroCentral]], allow user submissions to generate a list.",
