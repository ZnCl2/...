For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence. In addition to warming, many other aspects of global climate are changing, primarily in response to human activities. Thousands of studies conducted by researchers around the world have documented changes in surface, atmospheric, and oceanic temperatures; melting glaciers; diminishing snow cover; shrinking sea ice; rising sea levels; ocean acidification; and increasing atmospheric water vapor.}}</ref> and [[ecosystem]]s, [[biodiversity]], and [[natural resources]]<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates\">{{cite journal |author=Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. |year=2010 |title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land |journal=Biology Letters |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 |volume=6 |pages=544–547 |format=PDF |issue=4 |pmid=20106856 |pmc=2936204}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Biodiversity and Conservation in Europe |author1=Hawksworth, David L.  |author2=Bull, Alan T. |page=3390 |publisher=Springer |year=2008 |isbn=1402068646}}</ref> caused directly or indirectly by humans, including [[global warming]],<ref name=CSSR2017/><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002/meta |title=Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming|date=13 April 2016 |journal=[[Environmental Research Letters]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |publisher=[[IOP Publishing]]  |access-date=23 November 2017 |quote=The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002 |page=048002 | last1 = Cook | first1 = John|bibcode=2016ERL....11d8002C }}</ref> [[environmental degradation]]<ref name=CSSR2017/> (such as [[ocean acidification]]<ref name=CSSR2017/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange//kids/impacts/signs/acidity.html |title=Increased Ocean Acidity |date=30 August 2016 |website=[[epa.gov]] |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |access-date=23 November 2017 |quote=Carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere whenever people burn fossil fuels.

A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to environmental degradation and the eventual loss of resource bases.\n\nHumanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors, not just the raw number of people. Their lifestyle (including overall affluence and resource utilization) and the pollution they generate (including [[carbon footprint]]) are equally important. In 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that the inhabitants of the developed nations of the world consume resources like oil and metals at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, who make up the majority of the human population.<ref name=\"NYTimes_Diamond\">Diamond, Jared: (2008-01-02).

According to [[Paul R. Ehrlich]]:\n\n<blockquote>Rich western countries are now siphoning up the planet’s resources and destroying its ecosystems at an unprecedented rate. We want to build highways across the Serengeti to get more rare earth minerals for our cellphones. We grab all the fish from the sea, wreck the coral reefs and put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We have triggered a major extinction event... A world population of around a billion would have an overall pro-life effect. This could be supported for many millennia and sustain many more human lives in the long term compared with our current uncontrolled growth and prospect of sudden collapse... If everyone consumed resources at the US level – which is what the world aspires to – you will need another four or five Earths.

Environmental impacts caused by the application of technology are often perceived as unavoidable for several reasons. First, given that the purpose of many technologies is to exploit, control, or otherwise “improve” upon nature for the perceived benefit of humanity while at the same time the myriad of processes in nature have been optimized and are continually adjusted by evolution, any disturbance of these natural processes by technology is likely to result in negative environmental consequences.<ref>Commoner, B. (1971). The closing cycle – Nature, man, and technology, [[Alfred A. Knopf]].</ref> Second, the conservation of mass principle and the [[first law of thermodynamics]] (i.e., conservation of energy) dictate that whenever material resources or energy are moved around or manipulated by technology, environmental consequences are inescapable. Third, according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], order can be increased within a system (such as the human economy) only by increasing disorder or [[entropy]] outside the system (i.e., the environment). Thus, technologies can create “order” in the human economy (i.e., order as manifested in buildings, factories, transportation networks, communication systems, etc.) only at the expense of increasing “disorder” in the environment. According to a number of studies, increased entropy is likely to be correlated to negative environmental impacts.<ref>Faber, M., Niemes, N. and Stephan, G. (2012).

Ultimately, the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers. The connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect, as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature.\n\nThere are two types of indicators of environmental impact: \"means-based\", which is based on the farmer's production methods, and \"effect-based\", which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment. An example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater that is affected by the amount of [[Nitrogen fertilizers|nitrogen applied]] to the [[soil]].<!-- this first example makes no sense to me. If you agree, I suggest to leave and indication here; or, if you can, rewrite it.--> An indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-based.<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\">{{cite journal|last1=van der Warf|first1=Hayo|last2=Petit|first2=Jean|title=Evaluation of the environmental impact of agriculture at the farm level: a comparison and analysis of 12 indicator-based methods|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment|date=December 2002|volume=93|issue=1–3|pages=131–145|doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(01)00354-1|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880901003541|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors from the soil, to water, the air, animal and soil diversity, plants, and the food itself. Some of the environmental issues that are related to agriculture are [[climate change]], [[deforestation]], genetic engineering, irrigation problems, pollutants, [[soil degradation]], and [[waste]].\n\n====Fishing====\n{{main article|Environmental impact of fishing}}\n[[File:Fishing down the food web.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Fishing down the foodweb]]]]\nThe environmental impact of fishing can be divided into issues that involve the availability of fish to be caught, such as [[overfishing]], [[sustainable fisheries]], and [[fisheries management]]; and issues that involve the impact of fishing on other elements of the environment, such as [[by-catch]] and destruction of habitat such as [[coral reef]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Food Choice and Sustainability|last=Oppenlander|first=Richard|publisher=Langdon Street Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-62652-435-4|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=120–123|via=}}</ref>\n\nThese conservation issues are part of [[marine conservation]], and are addressed in [[fisheries science]] programs. There is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be caught and humanity’s desire to catch them, a problem that gets worse as the [[world population]] grows.\n\nSimilar to other [[environmental issue]]s, there can be conflict between the [[fishermen]] who depend on fishing for their livelihoods and fishery scientists who realize that if future fish populations are to be [[sustainability|sustainable]] then some fisheries must reduce or even close.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 = R.

The scientists stated that the decline was a result of [[overfishing]], [[pollution]] and other environmental factors that were reducing the population of fisheries at the same time as their ecosystems were being degraded. Yet again the analysis has met criticism as being fundamentally flawed, and many fishery management officials, industry representatives and scientists challenge the findings, although the debate continues. Many countries, such as [[Tonga]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and international management bodies have taken steps to appropriately manage marine resources.<ref>{{cite journal\n | author = Worm, Boris\n | date = 2006-11-03\n | title = Impacts of Biodiversity Loss on Ocean Ecosystem Services\n | journal = Science\n | volume = 314\n | issue = 5800\n | pages = 787–790\n | doi = 10.1126/science.1132294\n | pmid = 17082450\n | last2 = Barbier\n | first2 = E.

As a hydrological result it is found that:\n* the downstream river [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] is reduced\n* the [[evaporation]] in the scheme is increased\n* the [[groundwater recharge]] in the scheme is increased\n* the level of the [[watertable|water table]] rises\n* the [[drainage]] flow is increased.\nThese may be called direct effects.\n\nEffects on soil and [[water quality]] are indirect and complex, and subsequent impacts on natural, [[ecology|ecological]] and [[socio-economy|socio-economic]] conditions are intricate.  In some, but not all instances, [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|water logging]] and [[soil salinization]] can result.  However, irrigation can also be used, together with soil drainage, to overcome soil salinization by leaching excess salts from the vicinity of the root zone.<ref>FAO.

As a hydrological result it is found that the level of the water descends. The effects may be [[water mining]], land/soil [[Groundwater-related subsidence|subsidence]], and, along the coast, [[saltwater intrusion]].\n\nIrrigation projects can have large benefits, but the negative side effects are often overlooked.<ref>''Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review''.

J.  1999.  Soil degradation: a threat to developing country food security by 2020?  International Food Policy Research Institute.  Washington, D.

L., R. D. Pieper and C. H. Herbel. (1995).  ''Range management:  principles and practices''.  2nd Ed.  Prentice-Hall.</ref>  and these, together with terrain, vegetation and climate, influence the nature and importance of grazing’s environmental impact, which can range from severe to negligible, and in some cases (as noted below) beneficial.  Excessive use of vegetation by grazing can be especially conducive to land degradation in dry areas.<ref>Dregne, H., E., & Chou, N. T.

There are several published estimates of water use associated with livestock and meat production, but the amount of water use assignable to such production is seldom estimated.  For example, “green water” use is evapotranspirational use of soil water that has been provided directly by precipitation; and “green water” has been estimated to account for 94% of global beef cattle production’s “[[water footprint]]”,<ref>Mekonnen, M.

However, it would be misleading simply to assign that associated rangeland green water use to beef production, partly because that evapotranspirational use occurs even in the absence of cattle. Even when cattle are present, most of that associated water use can be considered assignable to production of terrestrial environmental values, because it produces root and residue biomass important for erosion control, stabilization of soil structure, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, support of numerous primary consumers, many of which support higher trophic levels, etc.  Withdrawn water (from surface and groundwater sources) is used for livestock watering, and in some cases is also used for irrigation of forage and feed crops.  Whereas all irrigation in the US (including loss in conveyance) is estimated to account for about 38% of US withdrawn freshwater use,<ref name=Maupin2014>Maupin, M. A. et al. (2014).

In the US, in a comparison of 32 industries, the livestock industry was found to have a relatively good record of compliance with environmental regulations pursuant to the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act,<ref>US EPA. 2000.

This power is normally generated at [[power plant]]s that convert some other kind of energy into [[electricity]]. Each such system has advantages and disadvantages, but many of them pose environmental concerns.\n\n====Nuclear power====\n{{main article|Environmental impact of nuclear power}}\nThe environmental impact of [[nuclear power]] results from the [[nuclear fuel cycle]] processes including mining, processing, transporting and storing fuel and [[radioactive]] fuel waste. Released [[radioisotopes]] pose a health danger to human populations, animals and plants as radioactive particles enter organisms through various transmission routes.\n\nRadiation is a [[carcinogen]] and causes numerous effects on living organisms and systems. The environmental impacts of nuclear power plant disasters such as the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] and the [[Three Mile Island accident]], among others, persist indefinitely, though several other factors contributed to these events including improper management of fail safe systems and natural disasters putting uncommon stress on the generators. The radioactive decay rate of particles varies greatly, dependent upon the nuclear properties of a particular isotope. Radioactive [[Plutonium-244]] has a half-life of 80.8 million years, which indicates the time duration required for half of a given sample to decay, though very little plutonium-244 is produced in the nuclear fuel cycle and lower half-life materials have lower activity thus giving off less dangerous radiation.<ref>Smith, G.

Petroleum, a common word for oil or natural gas, is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society, especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities.\n\n====Reservoirs====\n{{main article|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}\n[[Image:Wachusett-dam.jpg|thumb|right|The Wachusett Dam in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]]]]\nThe environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases.\n\n[[Dam]]s and the [[reservoir]]s can be used to supply [[drinking water]], generate [[hydroelectric]] power, increasing the water supply for [[irrigation]], provide recreational opportunities and flood control. However, adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions. Although the impact varies greatly between different dams and reservoirs, common criticisms include preventing sea-run fish from reaching their historical mating grounds, less access to water downstream, and a smaller catch for fishing communities in the area. Advances in technology have provided solutions to many negative impacts of dams but these advances are often not viewed as worth investing in if not required by law or under the threat of fines. Whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimental—to both the environment and surrounding human populations— has been debated since the 1960s and probably long before that. In 1960 the construction of [[Llyn Celyn]] and the flooding of [[Capel Celyn]] provoked political uproar which continues to this day. More recently, the construction of [[Three Gorges Dam]] and other similar projects throughout [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] have generated considerable environmental and political debate.\n\n====Wind power====\n{{main article|Environmental impact of wind power}}\n[[File:Wb deichh drei kuhs.jpg|thumb|right|Wind turbines in an agricultural setting]]\nCompared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor.

Such massive alteration of the global carbon cycle has only been possible because of the availability and deployment of advanced technologies, ranging in application from fossil fuel exploration, extraction, distribution, refining, and combustion in power plants and automobile engines and advanced farming practices. Livestock contributes to climate change both through the production of greenhouse gases and through destruction of [[carbon sink]]s such as rain-forests. According to the 2006 United Nations/FAO report, 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions found in the atmosphere are due to livestock. The raising of livestock and the land needed to feed them has resulted in the destruction millions of acres of Rainforest and as global demand for meat rises, so too will the demand for land. Ninety-one percent of all rainforest land deforested since 1970 is now used for livestock.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Food Choice and Sustainability|last=Oppenlander|first=Richard|publisher=Langdon Street Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-62652-435-4|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=31|via=}}</ref> Potential negative environmental impacts caused by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are rising global air temperatures, altered hydrogeological cycles resulting in more frequent and severe droughts, storms, and floods, as well as sea level rise and ecosystem disruption.<ref name=IPCC>[http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf IPCC, 2013: Summary for Policymakers.
