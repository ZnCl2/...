In September 1911, Eric arrived at St Cyprian's. He boarded at the school for the next five years, returning home only for school holidays. During this period, while working for the Ministry of Pensions, his mother lived at 23 Cromwell Crescent, Earls Court. He knew nothing of the reduced fees, although he \"soon recognised that he was from a poorer home\".<ref>Bowker p. 30</ref> Blair hated the school<ref>{{Cite book |first=Alaric |last=Jacob |authorlink=Alaric Jacob |chapter=Sharing Orwell's Joys, but not his Fears |editor-first=Christopher |editor-last=Norris |title=Inside the Myth |publisher=Lawrence and Wishart |year=1984}}</ref> and many years later wrote an essay \"[[Such, Such Were the Joys]]\", published posthumously, based on his time there. At St Cyprian's, Blair first met [[Cyril Connolly]], who became a writer. Many years later, as the editor of ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'', Connolly published several of Orwell's essays.\n\nWhile at St Cyprian's, Blair wrote two poems that were published in the ''[[Henley Standard|Henley and South Oxfordshire Standard]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Henley and South Oxfordshire Standard |date=2 October 1914}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Henley and South Oxfordshire Standard |date=21 July 1916}}</ref> He came second to Connolly in the [[Harrow History Prize]], had his work praised by the school's external examiner, and earned scholarships to [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington]] and [[Eton College|Eton]]. But inclusion on the Eton scholarship roll did not guarantee a place, and none was immediately available for Blair. He chose to stay at St Cyprian's until December 1916, in case a place at Eton became available.<ref name=Taylor/>\n\nIn January, Blair took up the place at Wellington, where he spent the Spring term. In May 1917 a place became available as a [[King's Scholar]] at [[Eton College|Eton]]. At this time the family lived at Mall Chambers, Notting Hill Gate. Blair remained at Eton until December 1921, when he left midway between his 18th and 19th birthday. Wellington was \"beastly\", Orwell told his childhood friend Jacintha Buddicom, but he said he was \"interested and happy\" at Eton.<ref>Jacintha Buddicom, ''Eric and Us'', p. 58</ref> His principal tutor was [[A. S. F. Gow]], Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], who also gave him advice later in his career.<ref name=Taylor/> Blair was briefly taught French by [[Aldous Huxley]]. [[Steven Runciman]], who was at Eton with Blair, noted that he and his contemporaries appreciated Huxley's linguistic flair.<ref name=Wadhams/> Cyril Connolly followed Blair to Eton, but because they were in separate years, they did not associate with each other.<ref name=Connolly/>\n\nBlair's academic performance reports suggest that he neglected his academic studies,<ref name=Wadhams/> but during his time at Eton he worked with [[Roger Mynors]] to produce a [[King's Scholar|College]] magazine, ''The Election Times'', joined in the production of other publications – ''College Days'' and ''Bubble and Squeak'' – and participated in the [[Eton Wall Game]]. His parents could not afford to send him to a university without another scholarship, and they concluded from his poor results that he would not be able to win one. Runciman noted that he had a romantic idea about the [[Eastern world|East]],<ref name=Wadhams>{{Cite journal |first=Stephen |last=Wadhams |title=Remembering Orwell |publisher=Penguin |year=1984}}</ref> and the family decided that Blair should join the [[Imperial Police]], the precursor of the Indian Police Service. For this he had to pass an entrance examination. In December 1921 he left Eton and travelled to join his retired father, mother, and younger sister Avril, who that month had moved to 40 Stradbroke Road, [[Southwold]], Suffolk, the first of their four homes in the town.<ref name=Binns>{{Cite book |last=Binns|first=Ronald |title=Orwell in Southwold |publisher=Zoilus Press |year=2018 |isbn=9781999735920}}</ref> Blair was enrolled at a [[crammer]] there called Craighurst, and brushed up on his Classics, English, and History.

In October 1922 he sailed on board SS ''Herefordshire'' via the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Ceylon]] to join the [[Indian Imperial Police]] in Burma. A month later, he arrived at [[Rangoon]] and travelled to the police training school in [[Mandalay]]. He was appointed an Assistant District Superintendent on 29 November 1922.<ref>{{cite book|pages=514|title=The India Office and Burma Office List: 1927|first= |last=|publisher=Harrison & Sons, Ltd.|year=1927|isbn=|subject=}}</ref> After a short posting at [[Maymyo]], Burma's principal [[hill station]], he was posted to the frontier outpost of [[Myaungmya]] in the [[Irrawaddy Delta]] at the beginning of 1924.\n\nWorking as an imperial police officer gave him considerable responsibility while most of his contemporaries were still at university in England. When he was posted farther east in the Delta to [[Twante]] as a sub-divisional officer, he was responsible for the security of some 200,000 people. At the end of 1924, he was posted to [[Syriam]], closer to Rangoon. Syriam had the refinery of the [[Burmah Oil Company]], \"the surrounding land a barren waste, all vegetation killed off by the fumes of [[sulphur dioxide]] pouring out day and night from the stacks of the refinery.\" But the town was near Rangoon, a cosmopolitan seaport, and Blair went into the city as often as he could, \"to browse in a bookshop; to eat well-cooked food; to get away from the boring routine of police life\".<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''The Unknown Orwell'', pp. 170–71</ref> In September 1925 he went to [[Insein Township|Insein]], the home of [[Insein Prison]], the second largest prison in Burma. In Insein, he had \"long talks on every conceivable subject\" with Elisa Maria Langford-Rae (who later married [[Kazi Lhendup Dorjee]]). She noted his \"sense of utter fairness in minutest details\".<ref name=Shelden>Michael Shelden ''Orwell: The Authorised Biography'', William Heinemann, 1991</ref>\n\n[[File:KatharBritishClub.JPG|left|thumb|British Club in [[Katha, Myanmar|Katha]] ]]\nIn Burma, Blair acquired a reputation as an outsider. He spent much of his time alone, reading or pursuing non-''[[Pukka sahib|pukka]]'' activities, such as attending the churches of the [[Karen people|Karen]] ethnic group. A colleague, Roger Beadon, recalled (in a 1969 recording for the BBC) that Blair was fast to learn the language and that before he left Burma, \"was able to speak fluently with Burmese priests in 'very high-flown Burmese.'\"<ref>''A Kind of Compulsion, 1903–36'', p. 87</ref> Blair made changes to his appearance in Burma that remained for the rest of his life. \"While in Burma, he acquired a moustache similar to those worn by officers of the British regiments stationed there.{{Clarify|date=April 2018|Reason=Was this the toothbrush style in the passport photo on this page, or the upper-lip style in later photos?}} [He] also acquired some tattoos; on each knuckle he had a small untidy blue circle. Many Burmese living in rural areas still sport tattoos like this&nbsp;– they are believed to protect against bullets and snake bites.\"<ref>[[Emma Larkin]], Introduction, ''Burmese Days'', Penguin Classics edition, 2009</ref> Later, he wrote that he felt guilty about his role in the work of [[British Empire|empire]] and he \"began to look more closely at his own country and saw that England also had its oppressed.\"\n\nIn April 1926 he moved to Moulmein, where his maternal grandmother lived. At the end of that year, he was assigned to [[Kathar|Katha]] in [[Upper Burma]], where he contracted [[dengue fever]] in 1927. Entitled to a [[leave (military)|leave]] in England that year, he was allowed to return in July due to his illness. While on leave in England and on holiday with his family in [[Cornwall]] in September 1927, he reappraised his life. Deciding against returning to Burma, he resigned from the Indian Imperial Police to become a writer, with effect from 12 March 1928 after five-and-a-half years of service.<ref>{{cite book|pages=894|title=The India Office and Burma Office List: 1929|first= |last=|publisher=Harrison & Sons, Ltd.|year=1929|isbn=|subject=}}</ref> He drew on his experiences in the Burma police for the novel ''[[Burmese Days]]'' (1934) and the essays \"[[A Hanging]]\" (1931) and \"[[Shooting an Elephant]]\" (1936).\n\n===London and Paris===\n[[File:Portobello Road - George Orwell House.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Blair's 1927 lodgings in [[Portobello Road]], London]]\n\nIn England, he settled back in the family home at [[Southwold]], renewing acquaintance with local friends and attending an [[Old Etonian]] dinner. He visited his old tutor Gow at Cambridge for advice on becoming a writer.<ref>Crick (1982), p. 122</ref> In 1927 he moved to London.<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''The Unknown Orwell'', p. 195</ref> [[Ruth Pitter]], a family acquaintance, helped him find lodgings, and by the end of 1927 he had moved into rooms in [[Portobello Road]];<ref>Ruth Pitter ''BBC Overseas Service broadcast'', 3 January 1956</ref> a [[blue plaque]] commemorates his residence there.<ref>{{openplaque|2825}}</ref> Pitter's involvement in the move \"would have lent it a reassuring respectability in Mrs Blair's eyes.\" Pitter had a sympathetic interest in Blair's writing, pointed out weaknesses in his poetry, and advised him to write about what he knew. In fact he decided to write of \"certain aspects of the present that he set out to know\" and \"ventured into the [[East End of London]]&nbsp;– the first of the occasional sorties he would make to discover for himself the world of poverty and the down-and-outers who inhabit it. He had found a subject. These sorties, explorations, expeditions, tours or immersions were made intermittently over a period of five years.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''The Unknown Orwell'', p. 204</ref>\n\nIn imitation of [[Jack London]], whose writing he admired (particularly ''[[The People of the Abyss]]''), Blair started to explore the poorer parts of London. On his first outing he set out to [[Limehouse Causeway]], spending his first night in a common lodging house, possibly George Levy's 'kip'. For a while he \"went native\" in his own country, dressing like a [[tramp]], adopting the name P.S. Burton and making no concessions to middle-class ''[[etiquette|mores]]'' and expectations; he recorded his experiences of the low life for use in \"[[The Spike (essay)|The Spike]]\", his first published essay in English, and in the second half of his first book, ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'' (1933).\n[[File:Rue du Pot-de-Fer.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Rue du Pot de Fer on the [[Rive Gauche (Paris)|Left Bank]] in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]], where Blair lived in Paris]]\n\nIn early 1928 he moved to Paris. He lived in the rue du Pot de Fer, a working class district in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th Arrondissement]].<ref name=Taylor/> His aunt Nellie Limouzin also lived in Paris and gave him social and, when necessary, financial support. He began to write novels, including an early version of ''Burmese Days'', but nothing else survives from that period.<ref name=Taylor/> He was more successful as a journalist and published articles in ''[[Monde (review)|Monde]]'', a political/literary journal edited by [[Henri Barbusse]] (his first article as a professional writer, \"La Censure en Angleterre\", appeared in that journal on 6 October 1928); ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]'', where his first article to appear in England, \"A Farthing Newspaper\", was printed on 29 December 1928;<ref>''A Kind of Compulsion'' (1903–36), p. 113</ref> and ''Le Progrès Civique'' (founded by the left-wing coalition [[Cartel des Gauches|Le Cartel des Gauches]]). Three pieces appeared in successive weeks in ''Le Progrès Civique'': discussing unemployment, a day in the life of a tramp, and the beggars of London, respectively. \"In one or another of its destructive forms, poverty was to become his obsessive subject&nbsp;– at the heart of almost everything he wrote until ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''The Unknown Orwell'', p. 216</ref>\n\nHe fell seriously ill in February 1929 and was taken to the [[Hôpital Cochin]] in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris|14th arrondissement]], a free hospital where medical students were trained. His experiences there were the basis of his essay \"[[How the Poor Die]]\", published in 1946. He chose not to identify the hospital, and indeed was deliberately misleading about its location. Shortly afterwards, he had all his money stolen from his lodging house. Whether through necessity or to collect material, he undertook menial jobs such as dishwashing in a fashionable hotel on the [[rue de Rivoli]], which he later described in ''Down and Out in Paris and London''. In August 1929, he sent a copy of \"[[The Spike (essay)|The Spike]]\" to [[John Middleton Murry]]'s ''[[Adelphi (magazine)|New Adelphi]]'' magazine in London. The magazine was edited by [[Max Plowman]] and [[Sir Richard Rees, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Rees]], and Plowman accepted the work for publication.\n\n===Southwold===\n[[File:Southwold North Parade.jpg|right|thumb|[[Southwold]]&nbsp;– North Parade]]\n\nIn December 1929, after nearly two years in Paris, Blair returned to England and went directly to his parents' house in [[Southwold]], a coastal town in [[Suffolk]], which remained his base for the next five years. The family was well established in the town, and his sister Avril was running a tea-house there. He became acquainted with many local people, including Brenda Salkeld, the clergyman's daughter who worked as a gym-teacher at [[Saint Felix School|St Felix Girls' School]] in the town. Although Salkeld rejected his offer of marriage, she remained a friend and regular correspondent for many years. He also renewed friendships with older friends, such as Dennis Collings, whose girlfriend Eleanor Jacques was also to play a part in his life.<ref name=Taylor/>\n\nIn early 1930 he stayed briefly in [[Bramley, Leeds]], with his sister Marjorie and her husband Humphrey Dakin, who was as unappreciative of Blair as when they knew each other as children. Blair was writing reviews for ''Adelphi'' and acting as a private tutor to a disabled child at Southwold. He then became tutor to three young brothers, one of whom, [[Richard Stanley Peters|Richard Peters]], later became a distinguished academic.<ref>R.S. Peters (1974). ''A Boy's View of George Orwell'' Psychology and Ethical Development. Allen & Unwin</ref> \"His history in these years is marked by dualities and contrasts. There is Blair leading a respectable, outwardly eventless life at his parents' house in Southwold, writing; then in contrast, there is Blair as Burton (the name he used in his down-and-out episodes) in search of experience in the kips and spikes, in the East End, on the road, and in the hop fields of Kent.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, p. 230 ''The Unknown Orwell''</ref> He went painting and bathing on the beach, and there he met Mabel and Francis Fierz, who later influenced his career. Over the next year he visited them in London, often meeting their friend Max Plowman. He also often stayed at the homes of Ruth Pitter and Richard Rees, where he could \"change\" for his sporadic tramping expeditions. One of his jobs was domestic work at a lodgings for [[half crown (British coin)|half a crown]] (two shillings and sixpence, or one-eighth of a pound) a day.<ref name=\"autogenerated1996\">Stella Judt \"I once met George Orwell\" in ''I once Met'' 1996</ref>\n\nBlair now contributed regularly to ''Adelphi'', with \"[[A Hanging]]\" appearing in August 1931. From August to September 1931 his explorations of poverty continued, and, like the protagonist of ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'', he followed the [[East End]] tradition of working in the Kent [[Hops|hop]] fields. He kept a diary about his experiences there. Afterwards, he lodged in the [[Tooley Street#George Orwell|Tooley Street kip]], but could not stand it for long, and with financial help from his parents moved to Windsor Street, where he stayed until Christmas. \"Hop Picking\", by Eric Blair, appeared in the October 1931 issue of ''[[New Statesman]]'', whose editorial staff included his old friend Cyril Connolly. Mabel Fierz put him in contact with [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], who became his [[literary agent]].\n\nAt this time [[Jonathan Cape]] rejected ''A Scullion's Diary'', the first version of ''Down and Out''. On the advice of Richard Rees, he offered it to [[Faber and Faber]], but their editorial director, [[T. S. Eliot]], also rejected it. Blair ended the year by deliberately getting himself arrested,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1214/041214-orwell-court-record|title=Discovery of 'drunk and incapable' arrest record shows Orwell's 'honesty'|work=ucl.ac.uk|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=2014-12-04}}</ref> so that he could experience Christmas in prison, but the authorities did not regard his \"drunk and disorderly\" behaviour as imprisonable, and he returned home to Southwold after two days in a police cell.\n\n===Teaching career===\n<!-- Courtesy note: [[P.

This was a small school offering private schooling for children of local tradesmen and shopkeepers, and had only 14 or 16 boys aged between ten and sixteen, and one other master.<ref>Crick (1982), p. 221</ref> While at the school he became friendly with the curate of the local parish church and became involved with activities there. Mabel Fierz had pursued matters with Moore, and at the end of June 1932, Moore told Blair that [[Victor Gollancz]] was prepared to publish ''A Scullion's Diary'' for a £40 advance, through his recently founded publishing house, [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]], which was an outlet for radical and socialist works.\n\nAt the end of the summer term in 1932, Blair returned to Southwold, where his parents had used a legacy to buy their own home. Blair and his sister Avril spent the holidays making the house habitable while he also worked on ''Burmese Days''.<ref>Avril Dunn ''My Brother George Orwell'' Twentieth Century 1961</ref> He was also spending time with Eleanor Jacques, but her attachment to Dennis Collings remained an obstacle to his hopes of a more serious relationship.[[File:River Orwell Shore - geograph.org.uk - 1044570.jpg|thumb|The pen name George Orwell was inspired by the [[River Orwell]] in the English county of Suffolk<ref>Voorhees (1986: 11)</ref> ]]\n\"Clink\", an essay describing his failed attempt to get sent to prison, appeared in the August 1932 number of ''Adelphi''.

''Down and Out'' was modestly successful and was next published by [[Harper (publisher)|Harper & Brothers]] in New York.\n\nIn mid-1933 Blair left Hawthorns to become a teacher at [[Frays River|Frays College]], in [[Uxbridge]], [[Middlesex]]. This was a much larger establishment with 200 pupils and a full complement of staff. He acquired a motorcycle and took trips through the surrounding countryside. On one of these expeditions he became soaked and caught a chill that developed into pneumonia. He was taken to Uxbridge Cottage Hospital, where for a time his life was believed to be in danger. When he was discharged in January 1934, he returned to Southwold to convalesce and, supported by his parents, never returned to teaching.\n\nHe was disappointed when Gollancz turned down ''Burmese Days'', mainly on the grounds of potential suits for libel, but Harper were prepared to publish it in the United States. Meanwhile, Blair started work on the novel ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'', drawing upon his life as a teacher and on life in Southwold. Eleanor Jacques was now married and had gone to Singapore and Brenda Salkield had left for Ireland, so Blair was relatively isolated in Southwold – working on the [[allotment (gardening)|allotments]], walking alone and spending time with his father. Eventually in October, after sending ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' to Moore, he left for London to take a job that had been found for him by his aunt Nellie Limouzin.\n\n===Hampstead===\n[[File:orwell hampstead home.JPG|thumb|Orwell's former home at 77 Parliament Hill, [[Hampstead]], London]]\n\nThis job was as a part-time assistant in Booklovers' Corner, a second-hand bookshop in Hampstead run by Francis and Myfanwy Westrope, who were friends of Nellie Limouzin in the [[Esperanto]] movement. The Westropes were friendly and provided him with comfortable accommodation at Warwick Mansions, Pond Street. He was sharing the job with [[Jon Kimche]], who also lived with the Westropes. Blair worked at the shop in the afternoons and had his mornings free to write and his evenings free to socialise. These experiences provided background for the novel ''[[Keep the Aspidistra Flying]]'' (1936). As well as the various guests of the Westropes, he was able to enjoy the company of Richard Rees and the ''Adelphi'' writers and Mabel Fierz. The Westropes and Kimche were members of the [[Independent Labour Party]], although at this time Blair was not seriously politically active. He was writing for the ''Adelphi'' and preparing ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' and ''Burmese Days'' for publication.\n\nAt the beginning of 1935 he had to move out of Warwick Mansions, and Mabel Fierz found him a flat in Parliament Hill. ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' was published on 11 March 1935. In early 1935 Blair met his future wife [[Eileen O'Shaughnessy]], when his landlady, Rosalind Obermeyer, who was studying for a master's degree in psychology at [[University College London]], invited some of her fellow students to a party. One of these students, Elizaveta Fen, a biographer and future translator of [[Chekhov]], recalled Blair and his friend [[Richard Rees]] \"draped\" at the fireplace, looking, she thought, \"moth-eaten and prematurely aged.\"<ref>Stansky & Abrahams, ''Orwell:The Transformation'' pp.&nbsp;100–01</ref> Around this time, Blair had started to write reviews for ''[[The New English Weekly]]''.\n[[File:George Orwell in Hampstead - geograph.org.uk - 432863.jpg|alt=|thumb|Orwell's time as a bookseller is commemorated with this plaque in Hampstead]]\n\nIn June, ''Burmese Days'' was published and Cyril Connolly's review in the ''New Statesman'' prompted Blair (as he then became known) to re-establish contact with his old friend. In August, he moved into a flat in [[Kentish Town]], which he shared with Michael Sayers and [[Rayner Heppenstall]]. The relationship was sometimes awkward and Blair and Heppenstall even came to blows, though they remained friends and later worked together on BBC broadcasts.<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 392</ref> Blair was now working on ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying'', and also tried unsuccessfully to write a serial for the ''[[News Chronicle]]''. By October 1935 his flatmates had moved out and he was struggling to pay the rent on his own. He remained until the end of January 1936, when he stopped working at Booklovers' Corner.\n\n===''The Road to Wigan Pier''===\n{{main|The Road to Wigan Pier}}\nAt this time, Victor Gollancz suggested Orwell spend a short time investigating social conditions in economically depressed [[northern England]].{{refn|The conventional view, based on Geoffrey Gorer's recollections, is of a specific commission with a £500 advance. Taylor argues that Orwell's subsequent life does not suggest he received such a large advance, Gollancz was not known to pay large sums to relatively unknown authors, and Gollancz took little proprietorial interest in progress.<ref>D. J. Taylor ''Orwell: The Life'' Chatto & Windus 2003</ref>|group= n}} Two years earlier, [[J. B. Priestley]] had written about England north of the [[River Trent|Trent]], sparking an interest in reportage. The depression had also introduced a number of working-class writers from the North of England to the reading public. It was one of these working-class authors, [[Jack Hilton (author)|Jack Hilton]], whom Orwell sought for advice. Orwell had written to Hilton seeking lodging and asking for recommendations on his route. Hilton was unable to provide him lodging, but suggested that he travel to [[Wigan]] rather than Rochdale, \"for there are the colliers and they're good stuff.\"<ref>Clarke, Ben. \"George Orwell, Jack Hilton, and the Working Class.\" ''Review of English Studies'' 67.281 (2016) 764-785.</ref>\n\nOn 31 January 1936, Orwell set out by public transport and on foot, reaching [[Manchester]] via [[Coventry]], Stafford, the [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]] and [[Macclesfield]]. Arriving in Manchester after the banks had closed, he had to stay in a common lodging-house. The next day he picked up a list of contacts sent by Richard Rees. One of these, the trade union official Frank Meade, suggested [[Wigan]], where Orwell spent February staying in dirty lodgings over a [[tripe]] shop. At Wigan, he visited many homes to see how people lived, took detailed notes of housing conditions and wages earned, went down [[Bryn Hall Colliery|Bryn Hall coal mine]], and used the [[Museum of Wigan Life|local public library]] to consult public health records and reports on working conditions in mines.\n\nDuring this time, he was distracted by concerns about style and possible libel in ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying''. He made a quick visit to [[Liverpool]] and during March, stayed in south Yorkshire, spending time in [[Sheffield]] and [[Barnsley]]. As well as visiting mines, including [[Grimethorpe]], and observing social conditions, he attended meetings of the Communist Party and of [[Oswald Mosley]]—\"his speech the usual claptrap – The blame for everything was put upon mysterious international gangs of Jews\"—where he saw the tactics of the [[British Union of Fascists|Blackshirts]]—\"one is liable to get both a hammering and a fine for asking a question which Mosley finds it difficult to answer.\"<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 457</ref> He also made visits to his sister at [[Headingley]], during which he visited the [[Brontë Parsonage Museum|Brontë Parsonage]] at [[Haworth]], where he was \"chiefly impressed by a pair of [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s cloth-topped boots, very small, with square toes and lacing up at the sides.\"<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 450. The Road to Wigan Pier Diary</ref>\n[[File:Wigan Pier - geograph.org.uk - 4175.jpg|alt=|thumb|A former warehouse at [[Wigan Pier]] is named after Orwell]] [[File:KitsLaneNo2WallingtonHertzUK2.jpg|thumb|No 2 Kits Lane, [[Wallington, Hertfordshire]], Orwell's residence circa 1936–1940]]\n\nThe result of his journeys through the north was ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'', published by Gollancz for the [[Left Book Club]] in 1937. The first half of the book documents his social investigations of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], including an evocative description of working life in the coal mines. The second half is a long essay on his upbringing and the development of his political conscience, which includes an argument for socialism (although he goes to lengths to balance the concerns and goals of socialism with the barriers it faced from the movement's own advocates at the time, such as \"priggish\" and \"dull\" socialist intellectuals and \"proletarian\" socialists with little grasp of the actual ideology). Gollancz feared the second half would offend readers and added a disculpatory preface to the book while Orwell was in Spain.\n\nOrwell needed somewhere he could concentrate on writing his book, and once again help was provided by Aunt Nellie, who was living at [[Wallington, Hertfordshire]] in a very small 16th-century cottage called the \"Stores\". Wallington was a tiny village 35 miles north of London, and the cottage had almost no modern facilities. Orwell took over the tenancy and moved in on 2 April 1936.<ref>A Kind of Compulsion, p. 468</ref> He started work on ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' by the end of April, but also spent hours working on the garden and testing the possibility of reopening the Stores as a village shop. ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying'' was published by Gollancz on 20 April 1936. On 4 August, Orwell gave a talk at the Adelphi Summer School held at [[Langham, Essex|Langham]], entitled ''An Outsider Sees the Distressed Areas''; others who spoke at the school included [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]], [[Max Plowman]], [[Karl Polanyi]] and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]].\n\nOrwell's research for ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' led to him being placed under surveillance by the [[Special Branch]] from 1936, for 12 years, until one year before the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.<ref>\"Freedom of Information, National Archives\" http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2005/highlights_july/july19/default.htm)</ref>\n\nOrwell married [[Eileen O'Shaughnessy]] on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards, the political crisis began in Spain and Orwell followed developments there closely. At the end of the year, concerned by [[Francisco Franco]]'s military uprising (supported by [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italy under fascism|Fascist Italy]] and local groups such as [[Falange]]), Orwell decided to go to Spain to take part in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on [[Second Spanish Republic|the Republican side]]. Under the erroneous impression that he needed papers from some left-wing organisation to cross the frontier, on [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]'s recommendation he applied unsuccessfully to [[Harry Pollitt]], leader of the [[British Communist Party]]. Pollitt was suspicious of Orwell's political reliability; he asked him whether he would undertake to join the [[International Brigade]] and advised him to get a safe-conduct from the Spanish Embassy in Paris.<ref>\"Notes on the Spanish Militias\" in Orwell in Spain, p. 278</ref> Not wishing to commit himself until he had seen the situation ''in situ'', Orwell instead used his Independent Labour Party contacts to get a letter of introduction to [[John McNair (UK politician)|John McNair]] in Barcelona.\n\n===The Spanish Civil War===\n{{contradict section|The language refers to Communist vs POUM fighting, yet both groups are communist.

The American writer told Orwell that going to fight in the Civil War out of some sense of obligation or guilt was \"sheer stupidity\" and that the Englishman's ideas \"about combating Fascism, defending democracy, etc., etc., were all baloney.\"<ref>Haycock, ''I Am Spain'' (2013), 152</ref> A few days later in [[Barcelona]], Orwell met John McNair of the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) Office who quoted him: \"I've come to fight against Fascism\".<ref>John McNair – Interview with Ian Angus UCL 1964</ref> Orwell stepped into a complex political situation in [[Catalonia]]. The [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican government]] was supported by a number of factions with conflicting aims, including the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification]] (POUM&nbsp;– Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista), the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and the [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]] (a wing of the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Spanish Communist Party]], which was backed by Soviet arms and aid). The ILP was linked to the POUM so Orwell joined the POUM.\n\nAfter a time at the Lenin Barracks in Barcelona he was sent to the relatively quiet [[Aragon]] Front under [[Georges Kopp]]. By January 1937 he was at [[Alcubierre]] {{convert|1500|ft|m}} above sea level, in the depth of winter. There was very little military action and Orwell was shocked by the lack of munitions, food and firewood as well as other extreme deprivations.<ref>See article by [[Iain King]] on Orwell's war experiences, [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-george-orwell.htm here.]</ref> With his Cadet Corps and police training, Orwell was quickly made a corporal. On the arrival of a British [[ILP Contingent]] about three weeks later, Orwell and the other English militiaman, Williams, were sent with them to Monte Oscuro. The newly arrived ILP contingent included Bob Smillie, [[Robert Edwards (politician)|Bob Edwards]], Stafford Cottman and Jack Branthwaite. The unit was then sent on to [[Huesca]].\n\nMeanwhile, back in England, Eileen had been handling the issues relating to the publication of ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' before setting out for Spain herself, leaving Nellie Limouzin to look after The Stores. Eileen volunteered for a post in John McNair's office and with the help of Georges Kopp paid visits to her husband, bringing him English tea, chocolate and cigars.<ref>Letter to Eileen Blair April 1937 in ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1&nbsp;– An Age Like This 1945–1950'' p. 296 (Penguin)</ref> Orwell had to spend some days in hospital with a poisoned hand<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|last1=Hicks|first1=Granville|title=George Orwell's Prelude in Spain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/16/specials/orwell-homage.html|website=New York Times|date=18 May 1952}}</ref> and had most of his possessions stolen by the staff. He returned to the front and saw some action in a night attack on the Nationalist trenches where he chased an enemy soldier with a bayonet and bombed an enemy rifle position.\n\nIn April, Orwell returned to Barcelona.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Wanting to be sent to the Madrid front, which meant he \"must join the International Column\", he approached a Communist friend attached to the Spanish Medical Aid and explained his case. \"Although he did not think much of the Communists, Orwell was still ready to treat them as friends and allies. That would soon change.\"<ref>Bowker, p. 216</ref> This was the time of the [[Barcelona May Days]] and Orwell was caught up in the factional fighting. He spent much of the time on a roof, with a stack of novels, but encountered [[Jon Kimche]] from his Hampstead days during the stay. The subsequent campaign of lies and distortion carried out by the Communist press,<ref>\"The accusation of espionage against the P.O.U.M. rested solely upon articles in the Communist press and the activities of the Communist-controlled secret police.\" ''Homage to Catalonia'' p. 168. Penguin, 1980</ref> in which the POUM was accused of collaborating with the fascists, had a dramatic effect on Orwell. Instead of joining the International Brigades as he had intended, he decided to return to the Aragon Front. Once the May fighting was over, he was approached by a Communist friend who asked if he still intended transferring to the International Brigades. Orwell expressed surprise that they should still want him, because according to the Communist press he was a fascist.<ref name=\"newsinger\">{{cite web|url=http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj62/newsinger.htm |title=Newsinger, John \"Orwell and the Spanish Revolution\" ''International Socialism Journal'' Issue 62 Spring 1994 |publisher=Pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk |accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref> \"No one who was in Barcelona then, or for months later, will forget the horrible atmosphere produced by fear, suspicion, hatred, censored newspapers, crammed jails, enormous food queues and prowling gangs of armed men.\"<ref>Bowker, quoting Orwell in Homage To Catalonia, p. 219</ref>\n\nAfter his return to the front, he was wounded in the throat by a sniper's bullet.

Unable to speak, and with blood pouring from his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to [[Siétamo]], loaded on an ambulance and after a bumpy journey via [[Barbastro]] arrived at the hospital at [[Lérida]]. He recovered sufficiently to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to [[Tarragona]] and two days later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed his main artery by the barest margin and his voice was barely audible. It had been such a clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of [[cauterisation]]. He received [[electrotherapy]] treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.<ref>Taylor (2003: 228–29))</ref>\n\nBy the middle of June the political situation in Barcelona had deteriorated and the POUM—painted by the pro-Soviet Communists as a [[Trotskyist]] organisation—was outlawed and under attack. The Communist line was that the POUM were \"objectively\" Fascist, hindering the Republican cause. \"A particularly nasty poster appeared, showing a head with a POUM mask being ripped off to reveal a Swastika-covered face beneath.\"<ref>Gordon Bowker, Orwell, p. 218 {{ISBN|978-0349115511}}</ref> Members, including Kopp, were arrested and others were in hiding.

In the first week of July 1937 Orwell arrived back at Wallington; on 13 July 1937 a deposition was presented to the ''Tribunal for Espionage & High Treason'', [[Valencia]], charging the Orwells with \"rabid [[Trotskyism]]\", and being agents of the [[POUM]].<ref>Facing Unpleasant Facts, p. xxix, Secker & Warburg, 2000</ref> The trial of the leaders of the POUM and of Orwell (in his absence) took place in Barcelona in October and November 1938.

He found his views on the Spanish Civil War out of favour. [[Kingsley Martin]] rejected two of his works and Gollancz was equally cautious. At the same time, the communist ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Daily Worker]]'' was running an attack on ''The Road to Wigan Pier'', taking out of context Orwell writing that \"the working classes smell\"; a letter to Gollancz from Orwell threatening libel action brought a stop to this. Orwell was also able to find a more sympathetic publisher for his views in [[Fredric Warburg]] of Secker & Warburg. Orwell returned to Wallington, which he found in disarray after his absence.

He was admitted to [[Preston Hall, Aylesford|Preston Hall Sanatorium]] at [[Aylesford]], Kent, a [[British Legion]] hospital for ex-servicemen to which his brother-in-law Laurence O'Shaughnessy was attached. He was thought initially to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and stayed in the sanatorium until September. A stream of visitors came to see him, including Common, Heppenstall, Plowman and Cyril Connolly. Connolly brought with him [[Stephen Spender]], a cause of some embarrassment as Orwell had referred to Spender as a \"pansy friend\" some time earlier. ''Homage to Catalonia'' was published by Secker & Warburg and was a commercial flop. In the latter part of his stay at the clinic, Orwell was able to go for walks in the countryside and study nature.\n\nThe novelist [[Leo Myers|L. H. Myers]] secretly funded a trip to [[French Morocco]] for half a year for Orwell to avoid the English winter and recover his health. The Orwells set out in September 1938 via [[Gibraltar]] and [[Tangier]] to avoid [[Spanish Morocco]] and arrived at [[Marrakech]]. They rented a villa on the road to [[Casablanca]] and during that time Orwell wrote ''[[Coming Up for Air]]''. They arrived back in England on 30 March 1939 and ''Coming Up for Air'' was published in June. Orwell spent time in Wallington and Southwold working on a [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] essay and it was in June 1939 that Orwell's father, Richard Blair, died.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Connelly |first1=Mark |title=George Orwell: A Literary Companion |date=2018 |publisher=McFarland |page=17}}</ref>\n\n===Second World War and ''Animal Farm''===\n\n[[File:George Orwell, c. 1940.jpg|alt=Orwell smiling|thumb|upright|left|A hand-coloured photo of Orwell, c. 1940]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Orwell's wife Eileen started working in the Censorship Department of the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in central London, staying during the week with her family in [[Greenwich]]. Orwell also submitted his name to the Central Register for war work, but nothing transpired. \"They won't have me in the army, at any rate at present, because of my lungs\", Orwell told Geoffrey Gorer. He returned to Wallington, and in late 1939 he wrote material for his first collection of essays, ''[[Inside the Whale and Other Essays|Inside the Whale]]''. For the next year he was occupied writing reviews for plays, films and books for ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'' and ''New Adelphi''. On 29 March 1940 his long association with ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' began<ref>''A Patriot After All, 1940–41'', p. xvii 1998 Secker & Warburg</ref> with a review of a sergeant's account of [[Napoleon]]'s [[French invasion of Russia|retreat from Moscow]]. At the beginning of 1940, the first edition of Connolly's ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' appeared, and this provided a new outlet for Orwell's work as well as new literary contacts. In May the Orwells took lease of a flat in London at Dorset Chambers, Chagford Street, [[Marylebone]]. It was the time of the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and the death in France of Eileen's brother Lawrence caused her considerable grief and long-term depression. Throughout this period Orwell kept a wartime diary.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Churchwell |first1=Sarah |title=Diaries |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/09/domestic-diaries-orwell-life |accessdate=22 October 2018 |work=New Statesman}}</ref>\n\nOrwell was declared \"unfit for any kind of military service\" by the Medical Board in June, but soon afterwards found an opportunity to become involved in war activities by joining the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/newsroom/orwell/story/0,,1048203,00.html|title=About George Orwell |website=www.theguardian.com – Newsroom|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref> He shared [[Tom Wintringham]]'s socialist vision for the Home Guard as a revolutionary People's Militia. His lecture notes for instructing platoon members include advice on street fighting, field fortifications, and the use of [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]] of various kinds. Sergeant Orwell managed to recruit [[Fredric Warburg]] to his unit. During the [[Battle of Britain]] he used to spend weekends with Warburg and his new [[Zionist]] friend, [[T. R. Fyvel|Tosco Fyvel]], at Warburg's house at [[Twyford, Berkshire]]. At Wallington he worked on \"[[England Your England]]\" and in London wrote reviews for various periodicals. Visiting Eileen's family in Greenwich brought him face-to-face with the effects of [[the Blitz]] on East London. In mid-1940, Warburg, Fyvel and Orwell planned [[Searchlight Books]]. Eleven volumes eventually appeared, of which Orwell's ''[[The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius]]'', published on 19 February 1941, was the first.<ref>''A Patriot After All'', p. xviii</ref>\n\nEarly in 1941 he began to write for the American ''[[Partisan Review]]'' which linked Orwell with [[The New York Intellectuals]] who were also anti-Stalinist,<ref>[[Frances Stonor Saunders]], ''[[Who Paid the Piper?]]'', p. 160</ref> and contributed to Gollancz anthology ''The Betrayal of the Left'', written in the light of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] (although Orwell referred to it as the Russo-German Pact and the Hitler-Stalin Pact<ref>''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 2&nbsp;– My Country Right or Left 1940–1943'' p. 40 (Penguin)</ref>). He also applied unsuccessfully for a job at the [[Air Ministry]]. Meanwhile, he was still writing reviews of books and plays and at this time met the novelist [[Anthony Powell]]. He also took part in a few radio broadcasts for the Eastern Service of the BBC. In March the Orwells moved to a seventh-floor flat at Langford Court, [[St John's Wood]], while at Wallington Orwell was \"[[Dig for Victory|digging for victory]]\" by planting potatoes.\n\n{{Quotation|One could not have a better example of the moral and emotional shallowness of our time, than the fact that we are now all more or less pro Stalin.

He supervised cultural broadcasts to India to counter propaganda from Nazi Germany designed to undermine Imperial links. This was Orwell's first experience of the rigid conformity of life in an office, and it gave him an opportunity to create cultural programmes with contributions from [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[E. M. Forster]], [[Ahmad Ali|Ahmed Ali]], [[Mulk Raj Anand]], and [[William Empson]] among others.\n\nAt the end of August he had a dinner with [[H. G. Wells]] which degenerated into a row because Wells had taken offence at observations Orwell made about him in a ''Horizon'' article. In October Orwell had a bout of bronchitis and the illness recurred frequently. [[David Astor]] was looking for a provocative contributor for ''[[The Observer]]'' and invited Orwell to write for him – the first article appearing in March 1942. In early 1942 Eileen changed jobs to work at the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] and in mid-1942 the Orwells moved to a larger flat, a ground floor and basement, 10a Mortimer Crescent in [[Maida Vale]]/[[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] – \"the kind of lower-middle-class ambience that Orwell thought was London at its best.\" Around the same time Orwell's mother and sister Avril, who had found work in a [[sheet-metal]] factory behind [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross Station]], moved into a flat close to George and Eileen.<ref>Crick (1982), pp. 432–33</ref>\n[[File:George-orwell-BBC.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Orwell spoke on many [[BBC]] and other broadcasts, but no recordings are known to survive.<ref name=\"Bowker2013\">{{cite book|author=Gordon Bowker|title=George Orwell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdAzAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT309|date=14 March 2013|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-1405528054|pages=309–10}}</ref><ref name=\"Recordings Capture Writers' Voices Off The Page Listen Queue\">{{cite web|title=Recordings Capture Writers' Voices Off The Page Listen Queue|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96030704|publisher=NPR|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC tried to take George Orwell off air because of 'unattractive' voice\">{{Cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Urmeen|title=BBC tried to take George Orwell off air because of 'unattractive' voice|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/5445579/BBC-tried-to-take-George-Orwell-off-air-because-of-unattractive-voice.html|website=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=5 November 2016|quote=The BBC tried to take the author George Orwell off air because his voice was \"unattractive\", according to archive documents released by the corporation...no recording of Orwell's voice survives but contemporaries – such as the artist Lucian Freud – have described it as \"monotonous\" with \"no power\".|date=2009-06-04}}</ref>]]\nAt the BBC, Orwell introduced ''Voice'', a literary programme for his Indian broadcasts, and by now was leading an active social life with literary friends, particularly on the political left. Late in 1942, he started writing regularly for the left-wing weekly ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]''<ref>Rodden (1989)</ref>{{RP|306}}<ref>Crick (1982)</ref>{{RP|441}} directed by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MPs [[Aneurin Bevan]] and [[George Strauss]]. In March 1943 Orwell's mother died and around the same time he told Moore he was starting work on a new book, which turned out to be ''[[Animal Farm]]''.\n\nIn September 1943, Orwell resigned from the BBC post that he had occupied for two years.<ref name=\"Crick-LBC\">{{cite book|last=Crick|first=Bernard R.|title=George Orwell: A Life|date=1980|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|isbn=978-0316161121}}</ref>{{RP|352}} His resignation followed a report confirming his fears that few Indians listened to the broadcasts,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://orwell.ru/library/novels/Burmese_Days/english/e_mm_int|first=Malcolm |last=Muggeridge|title=Burmese Days ''(Introduction)''|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|year=1962}} Muggeridge recalls that he asked Orwell if such broadcasts were useful, \"'Perhaps not', he said, somewhat crestfallen. He added, more cheerfully, that anyway, no one could pick up the broadcasts except on short-wave sets which cost about the equivalent of an Indian labourer's earnings over 10 years\"</ref> but he was also keen to concentrate on writing ''Animal Farm''. Just six days before his last day of service, on 24 November 1943, his adaptation of the [[fairy tale]], [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s ''[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]'' was broadcast. It was a genre in which he was greatly interested and which appeared on ''Animal Farm''{{'}}s title-page.<ref>''Two Wasted Years'', 1943, p. xxi, Secker & Warburg, 2001</ref> At this time he also resigned from the Home Guard on medical grounds.<ref>''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p. xv. Secker & Warburg, 2001</ref>\n\nIn November 1943, Orwell was appointed literary editor at ''Tribune'', where his assistant was his old friend [[Jon Kimche]]. Orwell was on staff until early 1945, writing over 80 book reviews<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yRHBGAAACAAJ&dq=ISBN0436205521 |author1=Orwell, G. |author2=Davison, P. |title=I Have Tried to Tell the Truth |publisher=Secker & Warburg |location =London |year=1999 |isbn=978-0436203701}}</ref> and on 3 December 1943 started his regular personal column, \"[[As I Please]]\", usually addressing three or four subjects in each.<ref>''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p. xxix</ref> He was still writing reviews for other magazines, including ''Partisan Review'', ''Horizon'', and the New York ''[[The Nation|Nation]]'' and becoming a respected pundit among left-wing circles but also a close friend of people on the right such as Powell, Astor and [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. By April 1944 ''Animal Farm'' was ready for publication. Gollancz refused to publish it, considering it an attack on the Soviet regime which was a crucial ally in the war. A similar fate was met from other publishers (including [[T. S. Eliot]] at [[Faber and Faber]]) until [[Jonathan Cape]] agreed to take it.\n\nIn May the Orwells had the opportunity to adopt a child, thanks to the contacts of Eileen's sister Gwen O'Shaughnessy, then a doctor in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. In June a [[V-1 flying bomb]] struck Mortimer Crescent and the Orwells had to find somewhere else to live. Orwell had to scrabble around in the rubble for his collection of books, which he had finally managed to transfer from Wallington, carting them away in a wheelbarrow.\n\nAnother bombshell was Cape's reversal of his plan to publish ''Animal Farm''. The decision followed his personal visit to [[Peter Smollett]], an official at the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]. Smollett was later identified as a Soviet agent.<ref name=\"TGA\">{{cite news |author=Garton Ash, Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Garton Ash |title=Orwell's List |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=25 September 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305071504/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2003/09/25/orwells-list/|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2003/09/25/orwells-list/|archivedate=5 March 2016|accessdate=26 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Caute2009\">{{cite book |last=Caute |first=David |authorlink=David Caute |title=Politics and the Novel during the Cold War |year=2009 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, NJ |isbn=978-1412811613 |page=79}}</ref>\n\nThe Orwells spent some time in the North East, near [[Carlton, County Durham]], dealing with matters in the adoption of a boy whom they named Richard Horatio Blair.<ref>\"He had led a quiet life as Richard Blair, not 'Richard Orwell'\": Shelden (1991: 398; 489)</ref> By September 1944 they had set up home in [[Islington]], at 27b [[Canonbury]] Square.<ref>Orwell: Collected Works, I Have Tried to Tell the Truth, p. 283</ref> Baby Richard joined them there, and Eileen gave up her work at the Ministry of Food to look after her family. [[Secker & Warburg]] had agreed to publish ''Animal Farm'', planned for the following March, although it did not appear in print until August 1945. By February 1945 David Astor had invited Orwell to become a war correspondent for the ''Observer''. Orwell had been looking for the opportunity throughout the war, but his failed medical reports prevented him from being allowed anywhere near action. He went to Paris after the liberation of France and to Cologne once it had been occupied by the Allies.\n\nIt was while he was there that Eileen went into hospital for a [[hysterectomy]] and died under anaesthetic on 29 March 1945. She had not given Orwell much notice about this operation because of worries about the cost and because she expected to make a speedy recovery. Orwell returned home for a while and then went back to Europe. He returned finally to London to cover the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]] at the beginning of July. ''[[Animal Farm]]: A Fairy Story'' was published in Britain on 17 August 1945, and a year later in the US, on 26 August 1946.\n\n===Jura and ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''===\n''Animal Farm'' had particular resonance in the post-war climate and its worldwide success made Orwell a sought-after figure. For the next four years, Orwell mixed journalistic work—mainly for ''Tribune'', ''The Observer'' and the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', though he also contributed to many small-circulation political and [[literary magazine]]s—with writing his best-known work, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', which was published in 1949.\n[[File:Barnhill (Cnoc an t-Sabhail) - geograph.org.uk - 451643.jpg|thumb|[[Barnhill, Jura|Barnhill]] on the Isle of [[Jura, Scotland]]. Orwell completed ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' while living in the farmhouse.]]\n\nIn the year following Eileen's death he published around 130 articles and a selection of his ''[[Critical Essays (Orwell)|Critical Essays]]'', while remaining active in various political lobbying campaigns. He employed a housekeeper, Susan Watson, to look after his adopted son at the [[Islington]] flat, which visitors now described as \"bleak\". In September he spent a fortnight on the island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]] and saw it as a place to escape from the hassle of London literary life. David Astor was instrumental in arranging a place for Orwell on Jura.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theorwellprize.co.uk/news/remembering-jura/ |title=Remembering Jura, Richard Blair |publisher=Theorwellprize.co.uk |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> Astor's family owned Scottish estates in the area and a fellow Old Etonian Robin Fletcher had a property on the island. In late 1945 and early 1946 Orwell made several hopeless and unwelcome marriage proposals to younger women, including [[Celia Kirwan]] (who later became [[Arthur Koestler]]'s sister-in-law), Ann Popham who happened to live in the same block of flats and [[Sonia Brownell]], one of Connolly's coterie at the ''Horizon'' office. Orwell suffered a tubercular haemorrhage in February 1946 but disguised his illness. In 1945 or early 1946, while still living at Canonbury Square, Orwell wrote an article on \"British Cookery\", complete with recipes, commissioned by the [[British Council]]. Given the post-war shortages, both parties agreed not to publish it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theorwellprize.co.uk/life-and-work.aspx |title=The Orwell Prize {{!}} Life and Work – Exclusive Access to the Orwell Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210180526/http://www.theorwellprize.co.uk/life-and-work.aspx |archivedate=10 December 2007}}</ref> His sister Marjorie died of kidney disease in May and shortly after, on 22 May 1946, Orwell set off to live on the Isle of Jura.\n\n[[Barnhill, Jura|Barnhill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orwelltoday.com/jurabarnhillvisit.shtml|title= Barnhill}} is located at {{Coord|56|06|39|N|5|41|30|W|display=inline}} ([[British national grid reference system]] NR705970)</ref> was an abandoned farmhouse with outbuildings near the northern end of the island, situated at the end of a five-mile (8&nbsp;km), heavily rutted track from Ardlussa, where the owners lived. Conditions at the farmhouse were primitive but the natural history and the challenge of improving the place appealed to Orwell. His sister Avril accompanied him there and young novelist [[Paul Potts (writer)|Paul Potts]] made up the party. In July Susan Watson arrived with Orwell's son Richard. Tensions developed and Potts departed after one of his manuscripts was used to light the fire. Orwell meanwhile set to work on ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Later Susan Watson's boyfriend [[David Holbrook]] arrived. A fan of Orwell since school days, he found the reality very different, with Orwell hostile and disagreeable probably because of Holbrook's membership of the Communist Party.<ref>David Holbrook in Stephen Wadham's ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin Books 1984</ref> Susan Watson could no longer stand being with Avril and she and her boyfriend left.\n\nOrwell returned to London in late 1946 and picked up his literary journalism again. Now a well-known writer, he was swamped with work. Apart from a visit to Jura in the new year he stayed in London for [[Winter of 1946–1947 in the United Kingdom|one of the coldest British winters on record]] and with such a national shortage of fuel that he burnt his furniture and his child's toys. The heavy smog in the days before the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] did little to help his health about which he was reticent, keeping clear of medical attention. Meanwhile, he had to cope with rival claims of publishers Gollancz and Warburg for publishing rights. About this time he co-edited a collection titled ''British Pamphleteers'' with [[Reginald Reynolds]]. As a result of the success of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell was expecting a large bill from the Inland Revenue and he contacted a firm of accountants of which the senior partner was Jack Harrison. The firm advised Orwell to establish a company to own his copyright and to receive his royalties and set up a \"service agreement\" so that he could draw a salary. Such a company \"George Orwell Productions Ltd\" (GOP Ltd) was set up on 12 September 1947 although the service agreement was not then put into effect. Jack Harrison left the details at this stage to junior colleagues.<ref name=Carroll>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article466206.ece |title=Tim Carroll ''A writer wronged'' The Sunday Times 15 August 2004 |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nOrwell left London for Jura on 10 April 1947.<ref name=Taylor/> In July he ended the lease on the Wallington cottage.<ref>Crick (1982), p. 530</ref> Back on Jura he worked on ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' and made good progress.

In December a chest specialist was summoned from Glasgow who pronounced Orwell seriously ill and a week before Christmas 1947 he was in [[Hairmyres Hospital]] in East Kilbride, then a small village in the countryside, on the outskirts of Glasgow. [[Tuberculosis]] was diagnosed and the request for permission to import [[streptomycin]] to treat Orwell went as far as [[Aneurin Bevan]], then Minister of Health. [[David Astor]] helped with supply and payment and Orwell began his course of streptomycin on 19 or 20 February 1948.<ref>It Is what I Think, p. 274</ref> By the end of July 1948 Orwell was able to return to Jura and by December he had finished the manuscript of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. In January 1949, in a very weak condition, he set off for a sanatorium at [[Cranham, Gloucestershire]], escorted by Richard Rees.\n\nThe sanatorium at Cranham consisted of a series of small wooden chalets or huts in a remote part of the [[Cotswolds]] near [[Stroud]]. Visitors were shocked by Orwell's appearance and concerned by the short-comings and ineffectiveness of the treatment. Friends were worried about his finances, but by now he was comparatively well-off. He was writing to many of his friends, including Jacintha Buddicom, who had \"rediscovered\" him, and in March 1949, was visited by Celia Kirwan. Kirwan had just started working for a [[Foreign Office]] unit, the [[Information Research Department]], set up by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government to publish anti-communist propaganda, and Orwell gave her a list of people he considered to be unsuitable as IRD authors because of their pro-communist leanings. [[Orwell's list]], not published until 2003, consisted mainly of writers but also included actors and Labour MPs.<ref name=\"TGA\"/><ref>{{cite news |work=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities |first=John |last=Ezard |title=Blair's babe: Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge? |date=21 June 2003}}</ref> Orwell received more streptomycin treatment and improved slightly.

She was considered to have a strong case, but was becoming increasingly ill and eventually was persuaded to settle out of court on 2 November 1980. She died on 11 December 1980, aged 62.<ref name=Carroll/>\n\n==Literary career and legacy==\nDuring most of his career, Orwell was best known for his journalism, in essays, reviews, columns in newspapers and magazines and in his books of reportage: ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'' (describing a period of poverty in these cities), ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'' (describing the living conditions of the poor in northern England, and class division generally) and ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''. According to [[Irving Howe]], Orwell was \"the best English essayist since [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]], perhaps since [[Samuel Johnson|Dr Johnson]].\"<ref name=\"Howe\">{{Cite journal|authorlink=Irving Howe|title=George Orwell: \"As the bones know\"|first=Irving|last=Howe|journal=[[Harper's Magazine]]|date= January 1969}}(reprinted in ''[[Newsweek]]''). Howe considered Orwell \"the finest journalist of his day and the foremost architect of the English essay since [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]]\".</ref>\n\nModern readers are more often introduced to Orwell as a novelist, particularly through his enormously successful titles ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. The former is often thought to reflect degeneration in the Soviet Union after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the rise of [[Stalinism]]; the latter, life under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian rule]]. ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' is often compared to ''[[Brave New World]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]]; both are powerful [[dystopia]]n novels warning of a future world where the state machine exerts complete control over social life. In 1984, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' and [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' were honoured with the [[Prometheus Award]] for their contributions to dystopian literature. In 2011 he received it again for ''Animal Farm''.\n\n''[[Coming Up for Air]]'', his last novel before World War II, is the most \"English\" of his novels; alarms of war mingle with images of idyllic [[Thames]]-side [[Edwardian]] childhood of protagonist George Bowling. The novel is pessimistic; industrialism and capitalism have killed the best of Old England, and there were great, new external threats. In homely terms, Bowling posits the totalitarian hypotheses of Borkenau, Orwell, Silone and Koestler: \"Old Hitler's something different. So's Joe Stalin. They aren't like these chaps in the old days who crucified people and chopped their heads off and so forth, just for the fun of it&nbsp;... They're something quite new – something that's never been heard of before\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Penguin complete novels of George Orwell |date=1976 |publisher=Penguin |page=523}}</ref>\n\n===Literary influences===\nIn an autobiographical piece that Orwell sent to the editors of ''Twentieth Century Authors'' in 1940, he wrote: \"The writers I care about most and never grow tired of are: [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Charles Reade]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] and, among modern writers, [[James Joyce]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]]. But I believe the modern writer who has influenced me most is [[W. Somerset Maugham]], whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frills.\" Elsewhere, Orwell strongly praised the works of [[Jack London]], especially his book ''The Road''. Orwell's investigation of poverty in ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' strongly resembles that of Jack London's ''The People of the Abyss'', in which the American journalist disguises himself as an out-of-work sailor to investigate the lives of the poor in London. In his essay \"Politics vs. Literature: An Examination of Gulliver's Travels\" (1946) Orwell wrote: \"If I had to make a list of six books which were to be preserved when all others were destroyed, I would certainly put ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' among them.\"\n\nOrwell was an admirer of [[Arthur Koestler]] and became a close friend during the three years that Koestler and his wife Mamain spent at the cottage of Bwlch Ocyn, a secluded farmhouse that belonged to [[Clough Williams-Ellis]], in the [[Vale of Ffestiniog]]. Orwell reviewed Koestler's. ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' in 1941, saying:\n<blockquote>\nBrilliant as this book is as a novel, and a piece of brilliant literature, it is probably most valuable as an interpretation of the Moscow \"confessions\" by someone with an inner knowledge of totalitarian methods. What was frightening about these trials was not the fact that they happened – for obviously such things are necessary in a totalitarian society – but the eagerness of Western intellectuals to justify them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/to-the-detriment-of-us-all-the-untouched-legacy-of-arthur-koestler-and-george-orwell/|title=The Untouched Legacy of Arthur Koestler and George Orwell|date=24 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOther writers admired by Orwell included: [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[George Gissing]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Tobias Smollett]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Joseph Conrad]], and [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]].<ref>''Letter to Gleb Struve, 17 February 1944'', Orwell: Essays, Journalism and Letters Vol 3, eds.

Sonia Brownell and Ian Angus, p. 576</ref>\n\n===Orwell as literary critic===\nThroughout his life Orwell continually supported himself as a book reviewer, writing works so long and sophisticated they have had an influence on literary criticism. He wrote in the conclusion to his 1940 essay on [[Charles Dickens]],\n{{quote|When one reads any strongly individual piece of writing, one has the impression of seeing a face somewhere behind the page. It is not necessarily the actual face of the writer. I feel this very strongly with [[Jonathon Swift|Swift]], with [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], with [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], [[Stendhal]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], though in several cases I do not know what these people looked like and do not want to know. What one sees is the face that the writer ought to have. Well, in the case of Dickens I see a face that is not quite the face of Dickens's photographs, though it resembles it. It is the face of a man of about forty, with a small beard and a high colour. He is laughing, with a touch of anger in his laughter, but no triumph, no malignity. It is the face of a man who is always fighting against something, but who fights in the open and is not frightened, the face of a man who is generously angry – in other words, of a nineteenth-century liberal, a free intelligence, a type hated with equal hatred by all the smelly little orthodoxies which are now contending for our souls.}}\n\n[[George Woodcock]] suggested that the last two sentences also describe Orwell.<ref>George Woodcock Introduction to Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin 1984</ref>\n\nOrwell wrote a critique of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Arms and the Man#Critical acclaim|Arms and the Man]]''. He considered this Shaw's best play and the most likely to remain socially relevant, because of its theme that war is not, generally speaking, a glorious romantic adventure. His 1945 essay ''In Defense of P.G. Wodehouse'' contains an amusing assessment of Wodehouse's writing and also argues that his broadcasts from Germany (during the war) did not really make him a traitor. He accused [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|The Ministry of Information]] of exaggerating Wodehouse's actions for propaganda purposes.\n\n===Reception and evaluations of Orwell's works===\nArthur Koestler said that Orwell's \"uncompromising intellectual honesty made him appear almost inhuman at times.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orwelltoday.com/orwellpersona.shtml|title= Orwell Today}}</ref> [[Ben Wattenberg]] stated: \"Orwell's writing pierced intellectual hypocrisy wherever he found it.\"<ref name=\"thinktank\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript990.html|title=PBS: Think Tank: Transcript for \"Orwell's Century\"|work=pbs.org|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref> According to historian [[Piers Brendon]], \"Orwell was the saint of common decency who would in earlier days, said his BBC boss Rushbrook Williams, 'have been either canonised&nbsp;– or burnt at the stake'\".<ref>{{Cite news|newspaper=The Guardian |location=UK |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/07/biography.georgeorwell|title=The saint of common decency|first=Piers|last=Brendon|date=7 June 2003}}</ref> [[Raymond Williams]] in [[Politics and Letters: Interviews with New Left Review]] describes Orwell as a \"successful impersonation of a plain man who bumps into experience in an unmediated way and tells the truth about it.\"<ref>Raymond Williams ''Politics and Letters'' 1979</ref> [[Christopher Norris (critic)|Christopher Norris]] declared that Orwell's \"homespun empiricist outlook&nbsp;– his assumption that the truth was just there to be told in a straightforward common-sense way&nbsp;– now seems not merely naïve but culpably self-deluding\".<ref>Christopher Norris ''Language, Truth and Ideology:Orwell and the Post War Left'' in ''Inside the Myth:Orwell views from the Left'' Lawrence and Whishart 1984</ref> The American scholar Scott Lucas has described Orwell<ref>Lucas, Scott (2003).

Alan Brown noted that this brings to the forefront questions about the political content of teaching practices. Study aids, in particular with potted biographies, might be seen to help propagate the Orwell myth so that as an embodiment of human values he is presented as a \"trustworthy guide\", while examination questions sometimes suggest the \"right ways of answering\" in line with the myth.<ref>Alan Brown ''Examining Orwell: Political and Literary Values in Education'' in Christopher Norris ''Inside the Myth Orwell:Views from the Left'' Lawrence and Wishart 1984</ref>{{Clarify|date=September 2010|reason=precise language needed; see [[Talk:George Orwell#Reactions to Orwell's works unclear]]}}\n\nHistorian John Rodden stated: \"[[John Podhoretz]] did claim that if Orwell were alive today, he'd be standing with the [[neo-conservatives]] and against the Left.

In other ways there has been the politics of selective quotation.\"<ref name=\"thinktank\"/> Rodden refers to the essay \"[[Why I Write]]\", in which Orwell refers to the Spanish Civil War as being his \"watershed political experience\", saying: \"The Spanish War and other events in 1936–37, turned the scale.

Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and ''for'' Democratic Socialism as I understand it.\" (emphasis in original)<ref name=\"thinktank\"/> Rodden goes on to explain how, during the McCarthy era, the introduction to the Signet edition of ''Animal Farm'', which sold more than 20 million copies, makes use of \"the politics of ellipsis\":\n<blockquote>\nIf the book itself, ''Animal Farm'', had left any doubt of the matter, Orwell dispelled it in his essay ''Why I Write'': 'Every line of serious work that I've written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against Totalitarianism&nbsp;... dot, dot, dot, dot.' \"For Democratic Socialism\" is vaporised, just like Winston Smith did it at the Ministry of Truth, and that's very much what happened at the beginning of the McCarthy era and just continued, Orwell being selectively quoted.<ref name=\"thinktank\"/></blockquote>\n\nFyvel wrote about Orwell: \"His crucial experience&nbsp;[...] was his struggle to turn himself into a writer, one which led through long periods of poverty, failure and humiliation, and about which he has written almost nothing directly.

In that essay, Orwell provides six rules for writers:\n<blockquote>\n# Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.\n# Never use a long word where a short one will do.\n# If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.\n# Never use the passive where you can use the active.\n# Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.\n# Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm\n |first       = George\n |last        = Orwell\n |title       = Politics and the English Language\n |date        = April 1946\n |publisher   = [[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]\n |work        = mtholyoke.edu\n |accessdate  = 15 July 2010\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100715144246/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm\n |archivedate = 15 July 2010\n |df          = dmy\n}}</ref></blockquote>\nAndrew N. Rubin argues that \"Orwell claimed that we should be attentive to how the use of language has limited our capacity for critical thought just as we should be equally concerned with the ways in which dominant modes of thinking have reshaped the very language that we use.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Rubin|first=Andrew N|url=http://outsidethewhale.com/2011/10/04/70/|title=The Rhetoric of Perpetual War|accessdate=11 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123221507/http://outsidethewhale.com/2011/10/04/70/|archivedate=23 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe adjective \"[[Orwellian]]\" connotes an attitude and a policy of control by propaganda, surveillance, misinformation, denial of truth and manipulation of the past. In ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', Orwell described a totalitarian government that controlled thought by controlling language, making certain ideas literally unthinkable. Several words and phrases from ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' have entered popular language. \"[[Newspeak]]\" is a simplified and obfuscatory language designed to make independent thought impossible. \"[[Doublethink]]\" means holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously. The \"[[Thought Police]]\" are those who suppress all dissenting opinion. \"[[Prolefeed]]\" is homogenised, manufactured superficial literature, film and music used to control and indoctrinate the populace through docility. \"[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]\" is a supreme dictator who watches everyone.\n\nOrwell may have been the first to use the term \"[[cold war (general term)|cold war]]\" to refer to the state of tension between powers in the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc that followed World War II in his essay, \"You and the Atom Bomb\", published in ''Tribune'' on 19 October 1945. He wrote:\n<blockquote>We may be heading not for general breakdown but for an epoch as horribly stable as the slave empires of antiquity. [[James Burnham]]'s theory has been much discussed, but few people have yet considered its ideological implications – this is, the kind of world-view, the kind of beliefs, and the social structure that would probably prevail in a State which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of 'cold war' with its neighbours.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://orwell.ru/library/articles/ABomb/english/e_abomb.html\n|first=George|last=Orwell\n|title=You and the Atom Bomb\n|publisher=[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]\n|date=19 October 1945\n|accessdate=15 July 2010\n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Modern culture===\nIn 2014, a play written by playwright [[Joe Sutton]] titled ''Orwell in America'' was first performed by the Northern Stage theatre company in White River Junction, Vermont.

Jacintha Buddicom repudiated Orwell's schoolboy misery described in the essay, stating that \"he was a specially happy child\". She noted that he did not like his name because it reminded him of a book he greatly disliked—''[[Eric, or, Little by Little]]'', a Victorian boys' school story.<ref>Orwell Remembered, p. 23</ref>\n[[File:Eton College front 4.jpg|alt=A large gothic facade|thumb|Orwell's time at Eton College was formative in his attitude and his later career as a writer]]\nConnolly remarked of him as a schoolboy, \"The remarkable thing about Orwell was that alone among the boys he was an intellectual and not a parrot for he thought for himself\".<ref name=Connolly/> At Eton, [[John Vaughan Wilkes]], his former headmaster's son recalled that \"he was extremely argumentative – about anything – and criticising the masters and criticising the other boys&nbsp;[...] We enjoyed arguing with him.

Later in Southwold, his sister Avril recalled him blowing up the garden. When teaching he enthused his students with his nature-rambles both at Southwold<ref>R.S.

She wrote that it was because of the letters he wrote complaining about his life, but an addendum to ''[[Eric & Us]]'' by Venables reveals that he may have lost her sympathy through an incident which was, at best, a clumsy attempt at seduction.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nMabel Fierz, who later became Blair's confidante, said: \"He used to say the one thing he wished in this world was that he'd been attractive to women.

She wrote: \"He was a great letter writer. Endless letters, and I mean when he wrote you a letter he wrote pages.\"<ref name=Wadhams/> His correspondence with Eleanor Jacques (London) was more prosaic, dwelling on a closer relationship and referring to past rendezvous or planning future ones in London and [[Burnham Beeches]].<ref>Correspondence in ''Collected Essays Journalism and Letters'', Secker & Warburg 1968</ref>\n\nWhen Orwell was in the sanatorium in Kent, his wife's friend Lydia Jackson visited.

''George Orwell: Complete Works'' XI 336</ref> Jackson was to be the most critical of Orwell's marriage to [[Eileen O'Shaughnessy]], but their later correspondence hints at a complicity. Eileen at the time was more concerned about Orwell's closeness to Brenda Salkield. Orwell had an affair with his secretary at ''Tribune'' which caused Eileen much distress, and others have been mooted. In a letter to Ann Popham he wrote: \"I was sometimes unfaithful to Eileen, and I also treated her badly, and I think she treated me badly, too, at times, but it was a real marriage, in the sense that we had been through awful struggles together and she understood all about my work, etc.\"<ref>Crick (1982), p. 480</ref> Similarly he suggested to Celia Kirwan that they had both been unfaithful.<ref>Celia Goodman interview with Shelden June 1989 in Michael Shelden ''Orwell: The Authorised Biography''</ref> There are several testaments that it was a well-matched and happy marriage.<ref name=Dakin>Henry Dakin in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell''</ref><ref name=Donahue>Patrica Donahue in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell''</ref><ref>Michael Meyer ''Not Prince Hamlet: Literary and Theatrical Memoirs'' 1989</ref>\n\nIn June 1944, Orwell and Eileen adopted a three-week-old boy they named Richard Horatio.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Lost Orwell|first=Peter|last=Davison|authorlink=Peter Davison (professor)|page=244|publisher=Timewell Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1857252149}}</ref> According to Richard, Orwell was a wonderful father who gave him devoted, if rather rugged, attention and a great degree of freedom.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/george-packer/orwell-and-son|title=Orwell and Son|journal=The New Yorker|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=2009-03-25}}</ref> After Orwell's death Richard went to live with Orwell's sister and her husband.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://orwellsocietyblog.wordpress.com/2011/10/27/richard-blair-on-life-with-my-aunt-avril/|title=Richard Blair on Life With My Aunt Avril|date=27 October 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nBlair was very lonely after Eileen's death in 1945, and desperate for a wife, both as companion for himself and as mother for Richard.

''The girl from the Fiction Department: a portrait of Sonia Orwell.'' New York: Counterpoint, p. 96.</ref> Orwell had met her when she was assistant to Cyril Connolly, at ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' literary magazine.<ref>Crick (1982), p. 449</ref> They were married on 13 October 1949, only three months before Orwell's death. Some maintain that Sonia was the model for Julia in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.\n\n===Social interactions===\nOrwell was noted for very close and enduring friendships with a few friends, but these were generally people with a similar background or with a similar level of literary ability. Ungregarious, he was out of place in a crowd and his discomfort was exacerbated when he was outside his own class. Though representing himself as a spokesman for the common man, he often appeared out of place with real working people. His brother-in-law Humphrey Dakin, a \"Hail fellow, well met\" type, who took him to a local pub in Leeds, said that he was told by the landlord: \"Don't bring that bugger in here again.\"<ref>Ian Angus Interview 23–25 April 1965 quoted in Stansky and Abrahams ''The Unknown George Orwell''</ref> Adrian Fierz commented \"He wasn't interested in racing or greyhounds or pub crawling or [[shove ha'penny]]. He just did not have much in common with people who did not share his intellectual interests.\"<ref>Adrian Fierz in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell''</ref> Awkwardness attended many of his encounters with working-class representatives, as with Pollitt and McNair,<ref>John McNair ''George Orwell: The Man I knew'' MA Thesis – Newcastle University Library 1965, quoted Crick (1982), p. 317</ref> but his courtesy and good manners were often commented on. [[Jack Common]] observed on meeting him for the first time, \"Right away manners, and more than manners – breeding – showed through.\"<ref>Jack Common Collection Newcastle University Library quoted in Crick (1982), p. 204</ref>\n\nIn his tramping days, he did domestic work for a time. His extreme politeness was recalled by a member of the family he worked for; she declared that the family referred to him as \"[[Stan Laurel|Laurel]]\" after the film comedian.<ref name=\"autogenerated1996\"/> With his gangling figure and awkwardness, Orwell's friends often saw him as a figure of fun. [[Geoffrey Gorer]] commented \"He was awfully likely to knock things off tables, trip over things. I mean, he was a gangling, physically badly co-ordinated young man. I think his feeling [was] that even the inanimate world was against him.\"<ref>Geoffrey Gorer&nbsp;– recorded for Melvyn Bragg BBC Omnibus production ''The Road to the Left'' 1970</ref> When he shared a flat with Heppenstall and Sayer, he was treated in a patronising manner by the younger men.<ref>Rayner Heppenstall ''Four Absentees'' in Audrey Coppard and Bernard Crick ''Orwell Remembered'' 1984</ref> At the BBC in the 1940s, \"everybody would pull his leg\"<ref name =Wilshin>Sunday Wilshin in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin Books 1984</ref> and Spender described him as having real entertainment value \"like, as I say, watching a Charlie Chaplin movie.\"<ref>Stephen Spender in Stephen Wadhams ''Remembering Orwell'' Penguin Books 1984</ref> A friend of Eileen's reminisced about her tolerance and humour, often at Orwell's expense.<ref name=Donahue/>\n\nOne biography of Orwell accused him of having had an authoritarian streak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780805076936-1 |title=Powell's Books&nbsp;– Synopses and Reviews of D J Taylor ''Orwell:The Life'' |publisher=Powells.com |date=12 October 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref> In Burma, he struck out at a Burmese boy who, while \"fooling around\" with his friends, had \"accidentally bumped into him\" at a station, resulting in Orwell falling \"heavily\" down some stairs.<ref>Maung Htin Aung ''George Orwell and Burma'' in Miriam Goss ''The World of George Orwell'' Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1971</ref> One of his former pupils recalled [[school corporal punishment|being beaten]] so hard he could not sit down for a week.<ref>Interview with Geoffrey Stevens, Crick (1982), pp. 222–23</ref> When sharing a flat with Orwell, Heppenstall came home late one night in an advanced stage of loud inebriation. The upshot was that Heppenstall ended up with a bloody nose and was locked in a room. When he complained, Orwell hit him across the legs with a [[shooting stick]] and Heppenstall then had to defend himself with a chair. Years later, after Orwell's death, Heppenstall wrote a dramatic account of the incident called \"The Shooting Stick\"<ref>Heppenstall ''The Shooting Stick'' Twentieth Century April 1955</ref> and Mabel Fierz confirmed that Heppenstall came to her in a sorry state the following day.<ref>Crick (1982), pp. 274–75</ref>\n\nOrwell got on well with young people. The pupil he beat considered him the best of teachers and the young recruits in Barcelona tried to drink him under the table without success. His nephew recalled Uncle Eric laughing louder than anyone in the cinema at a [[Charlie Chaplin]] film.<ref name= Dakin/>\n\nIn the wake of his most famous works, he attracted many uncritical hangers-on, but many others who sought him found him aloof and even dull. With his soft voice, he was sometimes shouted down or excluded from discussions.<ref>Michael Meyer ''Not Prince Hamlet: Literary and Theatrical Memoirs'' Secker and Warburg 1989</ref> At this time, he was severely ill; it was wartime or the austerity period after it; during the war his wife suffered from depression; and after her death he was lonely and unhappy. In addition to that, he always lived frugally and seemed unable to care for himself properly. As a result of all this, people found his circumstances bleak.<ref>T. R.

His first article, \"La Censure en Angleterre\" (\"Censorship in England\"), was an attempt to account for the \"extraordinary and illogical\" moral censorship of plays and novels then practised in Britain. His own explanation was that the rise of the \"puritan middle class,\" who had stricter morals than the aristocracy, tightened the rules of censorship in the 19th century. Orwell's first published article in his home country, \"A Farthing Newspaper\", was a critique of the new French daily the ''Ami de Peuple''. This paper was sold much more cheaply than most others, and was intended for ordinary people to read. Orwell pointed out that its proprietor [[François Coty]] also owned the right-wing dailies ''[[Le Figaro]]'' and ''[[Le Gaulois]]'', which the ''Ami de Peuple'' was supposedly competing against. Orwell suggested that cheap newspapers were no more than a vehicle for advertising and anti-leftist propaganda, and predicted the world might soon see [[free newspapers]] which would drive legitimate dailies out of business.<ref>{{Citation |first = P |last = Davison |title = A Kind of Compulsion |publisher = Secker & Warburg |place = London |year = 2000 |pages = 117–21}}</ref>\n[[File:Logo of the Independent Labour Party.svg|alt=The letters \"ISLP\" in white on a red circle|thumb|upright|Orwell joined the [[Independent Labour Party]] during his time in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and became a defender of [[democratic socialism]] and a critic of [[totalitarianism]] for the rest of his life.]]\nThe Spanish Civil War played the most important part in defining Orwell's socialism.

He left the ILP because of its opposition to the war and adopted a political position of \"revolutionary patriotism\". In December 1940 he wrote in ''Tribune'' (the Labour left's weekly): \"We are in a strange period of history in which a revolutionary has to be a patriot and a patriot has to be a revolutionary.\" During the war, Orwell was highly critical of the popular idea that an Anglo-Soviet alliance would be the basis of a post-war world of peace and prosperity. In 1942, commenting on journalist [[E. H. Carr]]'s pro-Soviet views, Orwell stated that \"all the appeasers, e.g. Professor E.H. Carr, have switched their allegiance from Hitler to Stalin.\"<ref>{{cite web |last = Collini |first =Stefan |title = E.H.

In any state of society where crime can be profitable you have got to have a harsh criminal law and administer it ruthlessly.\"\n\nIn his reply (dated 15 November 1943) to an invitation from the [[Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl|Duchess of Atholl]] to speak for the British League for European Freedom, he stated that he did not agree with their objectives. He admitted that what they said was \"more truthful than the lying propaganda found in most of the press\", but added that he could not \"associate himself with an essentially Conservative body\" that claimed to \"defend democracy in Europe\" but had \"nothing to say about British imperialism.\" His closing paragraph stated: \"I belong to the Left and must work inside it, much as I hate Russian totalitarianism and its poisonous influence in this country.\"<ref name=\"In Front of Your Nose\">Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.).
