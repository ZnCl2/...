It was Sega's first entry into the home video game hardware business. Introduced in 1983, the SG-1000 was released on the same day that [[Nintendo]] released the [[Family Computer]] in Japan. The SG-1000 was released in several forms, including the '''SC-3000''' computer and the redesigned '''SG-1000 II'''{{efn|{{nihongo|SG-1000 II|エスジー・セン・ツー|Esu Jī Sen Tsū}}<!-- See [[WP:JFN]] -->}} released in 1984. A third iteration of the console, the '''Sega Mark III''', was released in 1985. It provided a custom video display processor over previous iterations and served as the basis for the [[Master System]] in 1986, Sega's first internationally-released console.\n\nDeveloped in response to a downturn in arcades in 1982, the SG-1000 was created on the advice of [[Hayao Nakayama]], president of Sega Enterprises, Ltd. Shortly after the release, Sega Enterprises was sold to [[SCSK|CSK Corporation]], which was followed by the release of the SG-1000 II. The SC-3000 and the SG-1000 line both support a library of 76 [[ROM cartridge]] games and 29 [[Sega Card|Sega My Card]] games, all of which are fully compatible with the Mark III and the Japanese version of the Master System.\n\n==History==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:1em;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Sega-SG-1000-Console-FL.jpg|none|120px|SG-1000]]\n| [[File:Sega SC-3000 wb.jpg|none|120px|SC-3000]]\n|-\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| <center><small>SG-1000</small></center>\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| <center><small>SC-3000</small></center>\n|-\n| [[File:Sega-SG-1000-MkII-Console-FL.jpg|none|120px|SG-1000 II]]\n| [[File:Sega-Sg-1000-MkIII-Console-FL.jpg|none|120px|Sega Mark III]]\n|-\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| <center><small>SG-1000 II</small></center>\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| <center><small>Sega Mark III</small></center>\n|}\nIn the early 1980s, [[Sega|Sega Enterprises, Inc.]], then a subsidiary of [[Gulf and Western]], was one of the top five arcade game manufacturers active in the United States, as company revenues rose to $214 million.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1994-02-20/sega| title=Sega!| magazine=Businessweek| date=February 1994| accessdate=October 10, 2013| first1=Richard| last1=Brandt| first2=Neil| last2=Gross| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203121725/http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1994-02-20/sega| archivedate=December 3, 2013| df=mdy-all}}</ref>  A downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982 seriously hurt the company, leading Gulf and Western to sell its North American arcade manufacturing organization and the licensing rights for its arcade games to [[Bally Manufacturing]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news |title=What's New In Video Games; Taking the Zing Out of the Arcade Boom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/24/business/what-s-new-in-video-games-taking-the-zing-out-of-the-arcade-boom.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 24, 1982 |accessdate=November 27, 2013 |first=Andrew |last=Pollack |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219200336/http://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/24/business/what-s-new-in-video-games-taking-the-zing-out-of-the-arcade-boom.html |archivedate=December 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"herald\">{{cite news |title=The Bottom Line |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:MIHB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB35D5F24528A22&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0ECC86DE7A4704AD |newspaper=Miami Herald {{subscription required|via=[[NewsBank]]}} |date=August 27, 1983 |accessdate=October 10, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110080330/http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004 |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  The company retained Sega's North American [[research and development|R&D]] operation, as well as its Japanese subsidiary, Sega Enterprises, Ltd.

The last two SC-3000/SG-1000 cartridge games were ''[[The Castle (video game)|The Castle]]'' in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]] and ''Portrait of Loretta'' in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]]. The final Sega My Card game for the SC-3000/SG-1000 was ''[[The Black Onyx]]'', also in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]].<ref name=\"sc3k_software_list\">{{cite web|url=https://sega.jp/history/hard/sc3000/software.html|title=ソフトウェア一覧 - SC-3000 - セガハード大百科 - セガ|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Sega]]|language=Japanese|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe SG-1000 made little impact on the video game industry, but has been recognized for being Sega's first video game console. ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' writer Damien McFerran said it was an \"abject failure\", but called it and the SG-1000 II \"the Japanese forefathers of the Master System\".<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Writing for ''Wired'', Chris Kohler criticized the poor response of the controller's joystick and the lack of an [[RCA connector|RCA]] output. He said the release timing hurt its success; \"[al]though its graphics were of better quality than most consoles on the market, it had the bad luck to be released in the same month as Nintendo's world-changing Famicom, which had killer apps like ''Donkey Kong'' and could run circles around Sega's hardware.\"<ref name=\"Wired\"/>  Of its legacy, Kohler said, \"Few have heard of it, even fewer have played it, and the games weren't that great anyway.\"<ref name=\"Wired\"/> By contrast, Luke Plunkett of ''[[Kotaku]]'' recognized that \"while all this makes it sound like the SG-1000 was a bit of a misfire, it was still important in the development of Sega's home console business.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHideki Sato reflected positively on the innovations in the development of the SG-1000, but admitted that the console had limitations because of how new the market was and that Sega was inexperienced in developing for a video game console at the time.  According to Sato, \"The problem was, while we knew how to make arcade games, we didn’t really know anything about console development. In fact, the very idea of a “consumer” market for video games was unheard of then: back then it was just a 'new business' idea.\"<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sega}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{commons category-inline|SG-1000}}\n\n{{Sega}}\n{{Third generation game consoles}}\n{{Home video game consoles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sg-1000}}\n[[Category:Sega consoles|SG-1000]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1983]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:Products and services discontinued in 1984]]\n[[Category:Products and services discontinued in 1985]]\n[[Category:1984 disestablishments in Japan]]\n[[Category:1985 disestablishments in Japan]]\n[[Category:1980s toys]]\n[[Category:Home video game consoles]]\n[[Category:Third-generation video game consoles]]",
