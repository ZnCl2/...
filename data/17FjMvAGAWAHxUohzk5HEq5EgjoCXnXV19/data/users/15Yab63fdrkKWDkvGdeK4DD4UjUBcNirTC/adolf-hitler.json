Hitler took this title after the death of [[Paul von Hindenburg]], who had been serving as President. He was afterwards both Head of State and Head of the Government, with the full official title of ''Führer und Reichskanzler des deutschen Volkes'' (\"Führer and Reich Chancellor of the German People\").{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=226–227}}{{sfn|Overy|2005|p=63}}}} As [[dictator]], Hitler initiated [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]] with the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, and was central to [[the Holocaust]].\n\nHitler was born in Austria—then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]—and was raised near [[Linz]]. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his [[Military career of Adolf Hitler|service in the German Army]] in [[World War I]]. In 1919, he joined the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP), the precursor of the NSDAP, and was appointed leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize power in [[Beer Hall Putsch|a failed coup in Munich]] and was imprisoned. While in jail he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (\"My Struggle\"). After his release from prison in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and promoting [[Pan-Germanism]], [[anti-semitism]] and [[anti-communism]] with [[Charismatic authority|charismatic]] oratory and [[Nazi propaganda]]. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a [[Antisemitic canard|Jewish conspiracy]].\n\nBy 1933, the Nazi Party was the largest elected party in the German [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], but did not have a majority, and no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor.  This led to former chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] and other conservative leaders persuading President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to appoint Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], which began the process of transforming the [[Weimar Republic]] into Nazi Germany, a [[One-party state|one-party]] dictatorship based on the [[totalitarian]] and [[autocratic]] ideology of [[National Socialism]]. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]] to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the [[Great Depression]], the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of [[ethnic Germans]] which gave him significant popular support.\n\nHitler sought ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") for the German people in Eastern Europe and his aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France [[British and French declaration of war on Germany|declaring war on Germany]]. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European [[Axis powers]] occupied most of Europe and [[North African Campaign|North Africa]]. In December 1941, he formally declared war on the United States, bringing them directly into the conflict. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war during the [[Battle of Berlin]] in 1945, he married his long-time lover [[Eva Braun]]. Less than two days later on 30 April 1945, the two [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] to avoid capture by the Soviet [[Red Army]] and their corpses were burned.\n\nUnder Hitler's leadership and [[Nazism and race|racially motivated ideology]], the Nazi regime was responsible for the [[genocide]] of [[Holocaust victims|at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims]] whom he and his followers deemed ''[[Untermensch]]en'' (sub-humans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of civilians killed during World War II was unprecedented in warfare and the casualties constituted the [[List of wars by death toll|deadliest conflict in human history]].\n\n==Early years==\n\n===Ancestry===\n{{Main article|Hitler family}}\nHitler's father [[Alois Hitler|Alois Hitler Sr.]] (1837–1903) was the [[illegitimate]] child of [[Maria Anna Schicklgruber]].{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=24}} The baptismal register did not show the name of his father, and Alois initially bore his mother's surname ''Schicklgruber''. In 1842, [[Johann Georg Hiedler]] married Alois's mother Maria Anna. Alois was brought up in the family of Hiedler's brother, [[Johann Nepomuk Hiedler]].{{sfn|Maser|1973|p=4}} In 1876, Alois was legitimated and the baptismal register changed by a priest to register Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois's father (recorded as \"Georg Hitler\").{{sfn|Maser|1973|p=15}}{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=5}} Alois then assumed the surname \"Hitler\",{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=5}} also spelled ''Hiedler'', ''Hüttler'', or ''Huettler''. The ''Hitler'' surname is probably based on \"one who lives in a hut\" (German ''Hütte'' for \"hut\").{{sfn|Jetzinger|1976|p=32}}\n\nNazi official [[Hans Frank]] suggested that Alois's mother had been employed as a housekeeper by a [[Jewish]] family in [[Graz]], and that the family's 19-year-old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered Alois.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1999|p=21}} No Frankenberger was registered in Graz during that period, and no record has been produced of Leopold Frankenberger's existence,{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=50}} so historians dismiss the claim that Alois's father was Jewish.{{sfn|Toland|1992|pp=246–247}}{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Childhood and education===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0322-506, Adolf Hitler, Kinderbild retouched.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Adolf Hitler as an infant (c. 1889–90)]]\nAdolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in [[Braunau am Inn]], a town in [[Austria-Hungary]] (in present-day Austria), close to the border with the [[German Empire]].{{sfn|House of Responsibility}} He was [[Infant baptism|christened]] as \"Adolphus Hitler\".{{sfn|Giblin|2002|p=4}} He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, [[Klara Pölzl]]. Three of Hitler's siblings—Gustav, Ida, and Otto—died in infancy.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=4}} Also living in the household were Alois's children from his second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and [[Angela Hitler|Angela]] (born 1883).{{sfn|Toland|1976|p=6}} When Hitler was three, the family moved to [[Passau]], Germany.{{sfn|Rosmus|2004|p=33}} There he acquired the distinctive [[Bavarian language|lower Bavarian dialect]], rather than [[Austrian German]], which marked his speech throughout his life.{{sfn|Keller|2010|p=15}}{{sfn|Hamann|2010|pp=7–8}}{{sfn|Kubizek|2006|p=37}} The family returned to Austria and settled in [[Leonding]] in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near [[Lambach]], where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended ''[[Volksschule]]'' (a state-owned school) in nearby [[Fischlham]].{{sfn|Kubizek|2006|p=92}}{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=6}}\n\nThe move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school.{{sfn|Fromm|1977|pp=493–498}} His father beat him, although his mother tried to protect him.{{sfn|Diver|2005}} Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=10–11}} In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding. Hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother [[Edmund Hitler|Edmund]], who died in 1900 from [[measles]]. Hitler changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers.{{sfn|Payne|1990|p=22}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Klara Hitler.jpg\n | width1 = 140\n | caption1 = <center>Hitler's mother, [[Klara Hitler|Klara]]\n | image2 = Alois Hitler in his last years.jpg\n | width2 = 155\n | caption2 = <center>Hitler's father, [[Alois Hitler|Alois]]\n}}\n\nAlois had made a successful career in the customs bureau, and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=9}} Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed.{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=8}}{{sfn|Keller|2010|pp=33–34}}{{sfn|Fest|1977|p=32}} Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the ''[[Realschule]]'' in Linz in September 1900.{{efn|name=Realschule}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=8}} Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' states that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw \"what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream\".{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=10}}\n\nLike many Austrian Germans, Hitler began to develop [[German nationalism|German nationalist]] ideas from a young age.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=163–164}} He expressed loyalty only to Germany, despising the declining [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and its rule over an ethnically variegated empire.{{sfn|Bendersky|2000|p=26}}{{sfn|Ryschka|2008|p=35}} Hitler and his friends used the greeting \"Heil\", and sang the \"[[Deutschlandlied]]\" instead of the [[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser#Austria-Hungary|Austrian Imperial anthem]].{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=13}}\n\nAfter Alois's sudden death on 3 January 1903, Hitler's performance at school deteriorated and his mother allowed him to leave.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=10}} He enrolled at the ''Realschule'' in [[Steyr]] in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=19}} In 1905, after passing a repeat of the final exam, Hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=20}}\n\n===Early adulthood in Vienna and Munich===\n[[File:Hitler house in Leonding.jpg|thumb|The house in [[Leonding]] in Austria where Hitler spent his early adolescence (photo taken in July 2012)]]\n\nIn 1907 Hitler left Linz to live and study fine art in [[Vienna]], financed by orphan's benefits and support from his mother. He applied for admission to the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]] but was rejected twice.{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=20}}{{sfn|Bullock|1962|pp=30–31}} The director explained his drawings showed \"unfitness for painting\" and suggested Hitler was better suited to studying architecture. Though this was an interest of his, he lacked the academic credentials as he had not finished secondary school.{{sfn|Bullock|1962|p=31}}\nOn 21 December 1907, his mother died of [[breast cancer]] at the age of 47.\nIn 1909 Hitler ran out of money and was forced to live a [[bohemian]] life in homeless shelters and [[Meldemannstraße dormitory]].{{sfn|Bullock|1999|pp=30–33}}{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=157}} He earned money as a casual labourer and by painting and selling watercolours of Vienna's sights.{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=20}}\n[[File:Adolf Hitler Der Alte Hof.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Courtyard of the Old Residency in Munich|The Alter Hof in Munich]]''. Watercolour by Adolf Hitler, 1914]]\nDuring his time in Vienna he pursued a growing passion for two interests, architecture and music, attending ten performances of ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', his favorite [[Wagner]] opera.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=41, 42}}\n\nIt was here that Hitler first became exposed to [[racist]] rhetoric.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=26}} [[Populists]] such as mayor [[Karl Lueger]] exploited the climate of virulent [[anti-Semitism]] and occasionally espoused German nationalist notions for political effect. German nationalism had a particularly widespread following in the [[Mariahilf]] district, where Hitler lived.{{sfn|Hamann|2010|pp=243–246}} [[Georg Ritter von Schönerer]] became a major influence on Hitler.{{sfn|Nicholls|2000|pp=236, 237, 274}} He also developed an admiration for [[Martin Luther]].{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=250}} Hitler read local newspapers such as ''Deutsches Volksblatt'' that fanned prejudice and played on Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of Eastern European Jews.{{sfn|Hamann|2010|pp=341–345}} He read newspapers and pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Gustave Le Bon]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=233}}\n\nThe origin and development of Hitler's anti-Semitism remains a matter of debate.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=60–67}} His friend, [[August Kubizek]], claimed that Hitler was a \"confirmed anti-Semite\" before he left Linz.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=25}} However, historian Brigitte Hamann describes Kubizek's claim as \"problematical\".{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=58}} While Hitler states in ''Mein Kampf'' that he first became an anti-Semite in Vienna,{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=52}} [[Reinhold Hanisch]], who helped him sell his paintings, disagrees. Hitler had dealings with Jews while living in Vienna.{{sfn|Toland|1992|p=45}}{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=55,63}}{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=174}} Historian [[Richard J. Evans]] states that \"historians now generally agree that his notorious, murderous anti-Semitism emerged well after Germany's defeat [in World War I], as a product of the paranoid [[Stab-in-the-back myth|\"stab-in-the-back\" explanation]] for the catastrophe\".{{sfn|Evans|2011}}\n\nHitler received the final part of his father's estate in May 1913 and moved to [[Munich]], Germany.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=27}} Hitler was called up for conscription into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]],{{sfn|Weber|2010|p=13}} so he journeyed to [[Salzburg]] on 5 February 1914 for medical assessment. After he was deemed by the medical examiners as unfit for service, he returned to Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=86}} Hitler later claimed that he did not wish to serve the [[Habsburg Empire]] because of the mixture of races in its army and his belief that the collapse of Austria-Hungary was imminent.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=49}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1974-082-44, Adolf Hitler im Ersten Weltkrieg retouched.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Hitler (''far right, seated'') with his army comrades of the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment{{nbsp}}16 (c.&nbsp;1914–18)]]\n\n===World War I===\n{{Main|Military career of Adolf Hitler}}\nIn August 1914, at the outbreak of [[World War I]], Hitler was living in Munich and voluntarily enlisted in the [[Bavarian Army]].{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=90}} According to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing Hitler to serve was almost certainly an administrative error, since as an Austrian citizen, he should have been returned to Austria.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=90}} Posted to the [[6th Bavarian Reserve Division|Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16]] (1st Company of the List Regiment),{{sfn|Weber|2010|pp=12–13}}{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=90}} he served as a dispatch [[runner (soldier)|runner]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France and Belgium,{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=53}} spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in [[Fournes-en-Weppes]], well behind the front lines.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=54}}{{sfn|Weber|2010|p=100}} He was present at the [[First Battle of Ypres]], the [[Battle of the Somme]], the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]], and the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], and was wounded at the Somme.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=30}} He was decorated for bravery, receiving the [[Iron Cross]], Second Class, in 1914.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=30}} On a recommendation by Lieutenant [[Hugo Gutmann]], Hitler's Jewish superior, he received the Iron Cross, First Class on 4 August 1918, a decoration rarely awarded to one of Hitler's ''[[Gefreiter]]'' rank.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=59}}{{sfn|Weber|2010a}} He received the [[Wound Badge|Black Wound Badge]] on 18 May 1918.{{sfn|Steiner|1976|p=392}}\n\nDuring his service at headquarters, Hitler pursued his artwork, drawing cartoons and instructions for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, he was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=57}} Hitler spent almost two months in hospital at [[Beelitz]], returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=58}} On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a [[mustard gas]] attack and was hospitalised in [[Pasewalk]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=59, 60}} While there, Hitler learned of Germany's defeat, and—by his own account—upon receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=97, 102}}\n\nHitler described the war as \"the greatest of all experiences\", and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery.{{sfn|Keegan|1987|pp=238–240}} His wartime experience reinforced his German patriotism and he was shocked by Germany's capitulation in November 1918.{{sfn|Bullock|1962|p=60}} His bitterness over the collapse of the war effort began to shape his ideology.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=61, 62}} Like other German nationalists, he believed the ''[[Dolchstoßlegende]]'' (stab-in-the-back myth), which claimed that the German army, \"undefeated in the field\", had been \"stabbed in the back\" on the [[home front]] by civilian leaders, Jews, [[Marxists]], and those who signed the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]] that ended the fighting - later dubbed the \"November criminals\".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=61–63}}\n\nThe [[Treaty of Versailles]] stipulated that Germany must relinquish several of its territories and [[demilitarisation|demilitarise]] the [[Rhineland]]. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation—they especially objected to [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]], which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=96}} The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gain.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=80, 90, 92}}\n\n==Entry into politics==\n{{Main|Political views of Adolf Hitler}}\n[[File:Hitler's DAP membership card.png|thumb|Hitler's [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) membership card]]\n\nAfter World War I, Hitler returned to Munich.{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=61}} Without formal education or career prospects, he remained in the army.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=109}} In July 1919 he was appointed ''Verbindungsmann'' (intelligence agent) of an ''Aufklärungskommando'' (reconnaissance unit) of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP). At a DAP meeting on 12 September 1919, Party Chairman [[Anton Drexler]] was impressed with Hitler's oratorical skills. He gave him a copy of his pamphlet ''My Political Awakening'', which contained anti-Semitic, nationalist, [[anti-capitalist]], and anti-Marxist ideas.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party,{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=170}} and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=75, 76}}{{sfn|Mitcham|1996|p=67}}\n\nAround this time, Hitler made his earliest known recorded statement about the Jews in a letter (now known as the [[Gemlich letter]]) dated 16 September 1919 to Adolf Gemlich about the [[Jewish question]]. In the letter, Hitler argues that the aim of the government \"must unshakably be the removal of the Jews altogether\".{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=125-126}}\n\nAt the DAP, Hitler met [[Dietrich Eckart]], one of the party's founders and a member of the occult [[Thule Society]].{{sfn|Fest|1970|p=21}} Eckart became Hitler's mentor, exchanging ideas with him and introducing him to a wide range of Munich society.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=94, 95, 100}} To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' ([[National Socialist German Workers Party]]; NSDAP).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=87}} Hitler designed the party's banner of a [[swastika]] in a white circle on a red background.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=88}}\n\nHitler was discharged from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=93}} The party headquarters was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the [[Weimar Republic]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=81}} In February 1921—already highly effective at [[crowd manipulation]]—he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=89}} To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets.

A critical influence on Hitler's thinking during this period was the ''[[Aufbau Vereinigung]]'',{{sfn|Kellogg|2005|p=275}} a conspiratorial group of [[White émigré|White Russian]] exiles and early National Socialists.

The NSDAP used [[Italian Fascism]] as a model for their appearance and policies. Hitler wanted to emulate [[Benito Mussolini]]'s \"[[March on Rome]]\" of 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin. Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of ''Staatskommissar'' (state commissioner) [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]], Bavaria's ''de facto'' ruler. However, Kahr, along with Police Chief [[Hans Ritter von Seisser]] and Reichswehr General [[Otto von Lossow]], wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=126}}\n\nOn 8 November 1923 Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the [[Bürgerbräukeller]], a beer hall in Munich.

Neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with Hitler.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=129}} The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the [[Ministry of War (Kingdom of Bavaria)|Bavarian War Ministry]] to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=130–131}} [[List of Nazis who died in the Beer Hall Putsch|Sixteen NSDAP members]] and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=73–74}}\n\n[[File:Mein Kampf dust jacket.jpeg|thumb|[[Dust jacket]] of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1926–28 edition)]]\n\nHitler fled to the home of [[Ernst Hanfstaengl]] and by some accounts contemplated suicide.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=132}} He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for [[high treason]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=131}} His trial before the special [[People's Court (Bavaria)|People's Court]] in Munich began in February 1924,{{sfn|Munich Court, 1924}} and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] became temporary leader of the NSDAP.

As a result of the failed Beer Hall Putsch, the Nazi Party and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria [[Heinrich Held]] on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the state's authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process. The meeting paved the way for the ban on the NSDAP to be lifted on 16 February.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=158, 161, 162}} However, after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 February, Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=162, 166}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=129}} To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, Hitler appointed [[Gregor Strasser]], [[Otto Strasser]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]] to organise and grow the NSDAP in northern Germany.

This meant that he was [[Statelessness|stateless]], legally unable to run for public office, and still faced the risk of deportation.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=130}} On 25 February 1932, the interior minister of [[Free State of Brunswick|Brunswick]], [[Dietrich Klagges]], who was a member of the NSDAP, appointed Hitler as administrator for the state's delegation to the [[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]] in Berlin, making Hitler a citizen of Brunswick,{{sfn|Hinrichs|2007}} and thus of Germany.{{sfn|Halperin|1965|p=476}}\n\nHitler ran against Hindenburg in the [[German presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential elections]]. A speech to the Industry Club in [[Düsseldorf]] on 27 January 1932 won him support from many of Germany's most powerful industrialists.{{sfn|Halperin|1965|pp=468–471}} Hindenburg had support from various nationalist, monarchist, Catholic, and [[republicanism|republican]] parties, and some [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]].

Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and Hugenberg's party, the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP). On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, [[Wilhelm Frick]] Minister of the Interior, and Hermann Göring Minister of the Interior for Prussia.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=184}} Hitler had insisted on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=307}}\n\n===Reichstag fire and March elections===\nAs chancellor, Hitler worked against attempts by the NSDAP's opponents to build a majority government. Because of the political stalemate, he asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early March. On 27 February 1933, the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag building was set on fire]]. Göring blamed a communist plot, because Dutch communist [[Marinus van der Lubbe]] was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building.{{sfn|Bullock|1962|p=262}} According to Kershaw, the consensus of nearly all historians is that van der Lubbe actually set the fire.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=456–458, 731–732}} Others, including [[William L.

The decree was permitted under [[Article 48]] of the Weimar Constitution, which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=194, 274}} Activities of the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] (KPD) were suppressed, and some 4,000 KPD members were arrested.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=194}}\n\nIn addition to political campaigning, the NSDAP engaged in paramilitary violence and the spread of anti-communist propaganda in the days preceding the election. On election day, 6 March 1933, the NSDAP's share of the vote increased to 43.9 per{{nbsp}}cent, and the party acquired the largest number of seats in parliament.

Hitler appeared in a [[morning coat]] and humbly greeted Hindenburg.{{sfn|City of Potsdam}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=196–197}}\n\nTo achieve full political control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, Hitler's government brought the ''Ermächtigungsgesetz'' (Enabling Act) to a vote in the newly elected Reichstag. The Act—officially titled the ''Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich'' (\"Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich\")—gave Hitler's cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the Reichstag for four years. These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=198}} Since it would affect the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (in spite of their virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=335}}) and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=196}}\n\nOn 23 March 1933, the Reichstag assembled at the [[Kroll Opera House]] under turbulent circumstances. Ranks of SA men served as guards inside the building, while large groups outside opposing the proposed legislation shouted slogans and threats towards the arriving members of parliament.{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=269}} The position of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], the third largest party in the Reichstag, was decisive. After Hitler verbally promised party leader [[Ludwig Kaas]] that Hindenburg would retain his power of veto, Kaas announced the Centre Party would support the Enabling Act. The Act passed by a vote of 441–84, with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour.

The previous day, the cabinet had enacted the \"Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich\".{{sfn|Overy|2005|p=63}} This law stated that upon Hindenburg's death, the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government, and was formally named as ''[[Führer|Führer und Reichskanzler]]'' (leader and chancellor),{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=226–227}} although ''Reichskanzler'' was eventually quietly dropped.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=44}} With this action, Hitler eliminated the last legal remedy by which he could be removed from office.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=229}}\n\nAs head of state, Hitler became commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

He occasionally drank beer and wine in private, but gave up drinking because of weight gain in 1943.{{sfn|Linge|2009|p=Chapter 3}} He was a non-smoker for most of his adult life, but smoked heavily in his youth (25 to 40 cigarettes a day); he eventually quit, calling the habit \"a waste of money\".{{sfn|Proctor|1999|p=219}} He encouraged his close associates to quit by offering a gold watch to anyone able to break the habit.{{sfn|Toland|1992|p=741}} Hitler began using [[amphetamine]] occasionally after 1937 and became addicted to it in late 1942.{{sfn|Heston|Heston|1980|pp=125–142}} Speer linked this use of amphetamine to Hitler's increasingly erratic behavior and inflexible decision making (for example, rarely allowing military retreats).{{sfn|Heston|Heston|1980|pp=11–20}}\n\nPrescribed 90 medications during the war years by his personal physician, [[Theodor Morell]], Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=782}} He regularly consumed [[amphetamine]], [[barbiturate]]s, [[opiate]]s, and [[cocaine]],{{sfn|Ghaemi|2011|p=190–191}}{{sfn|Porter|2013}} as well as [[potassium bromide]] and [[atropa belladonna]] (the latter in the form of [[Doktor Koster's Antigaspills]]).{{sfn|Doyle|2005|p=8}} He suffered [[ruptured eardrum]]s as a result of the [[20 July plot]] bomb blast in 1944, and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs.{{sfn|Linge|2009|p=156}} Newsreel footage of Hitler shows tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk, which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=782}} [[Ernst-Günther Schenck]] and several other doctors who met Hitler in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.{{sfn|O'Donnell|2001|p=37}}\n\n==Family==\n{{Main|Hitler family|Sexuality of Adolf Hitler}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F051673-0059, Adolf Hitler und Eva Braun auf dem Berghof.jpg|thumb|Hitler in 1942 with his long-time lover, [[Eva Braun]], whom he married on 29 April 1945]]\nHitler created a public image as a celibate man without a domestic life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=130}}{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=563}} He met his lover, [[Eva Braun]], in 1929,{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=378}} and married her in April 1945.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=947–948}} In September 1931, his half-niece, [[Geli Raubal]], took her own life with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment.
