Each element of a matrix is often denoted by a variable with two [[index notation|subscripts]]. For example, ''a''<sub>2,1</sub> represents the element at the second row and first column of a matrix '''A'''.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''matrix''' (plural: '''matrices''') is a [[rectangle|rectangular]] ''[[wikt:array|array]]''<ref>Equivalently, ''[[wikt:table|table]]''.</ref> of [[number]]s, [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s, or [[expression (mathematics)|expression]]s, arranged in ''[[wikt:row|row]]s'' and ''[[wikt:column|column]]s''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Anton|1987|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Beauregard|Fraleigh|1973|p=56}}</ref> For example, the dimensions of the matrix below are 2 × 3 (read \"two by three\"), because there are two rows and three columns:\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 9 & -13 \\\\20 & 5 & -6 \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\nThe individual items in an ''m'' × ''n'' matrix '''A''', often denoted by ''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>, where max ''i'' = ''m'' and max ''j'' = ''n'', are called its ''elements'' or ''entries''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Cynthia|title=Precalculus|publisher=Laurie Rosatone|page=727|accessdate=2015-02-06}}</ref> Provided that they have the same size (each matrix has the same number of rows and the same number of columns as the other), two matrices can be [[matrix addition|added]] or subtracted element by element (see [[Conformable matrix]]). The rule for [[matrix multiplication]], however, is that ''two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second'' (i.e., the inner dimensions are the same, '''n''' for ''A''<sub>''m'','''''n'''''</sub> × ''B''<sub>'''''n''''',''p''</sub>). Any matrix can be [[Matrix multiplication#Scalar multiplication|multiplied]] element-wise by a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] from its associated [[Field (mathematics)|field]]. A major application of matrices is to represent [[linear transformation]]s, that is, generalizations of [[linear functions]] such as {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 4''x''}}. For example, the [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] of [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s in three-[[dimension]]al space is a linear transformation, which can be represented by a [[rotation matrix]] '''R''': if '''v''' is a [[column vector]] (a matrix with only one column) describing the [[Position (vector)|position]] of a point in space, the product '''Rv''' is a column vector describing the position of that point after a rotation. The product of two [[transformation matrices]] is a matrix that represents the [[function composition|composition]] of two [[Transformation (function)|transformations]]. Another application of matrices is in the solution of [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]]. If the matrix is [[#Square matrices|square]], it is possible to deduce some of its properties by computing its [[determinant]]. For example, a square matrix [[Invertible matrix|has an inverse]] [[if and only if]] its determinant is not [[zero]]. Insight into the [[geometry]] of a linear transformation is obtainable (along with other information) from the matrix's [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors]].\n\nApplications of matrices are found in most scientific fields. In every branch of [[physics]], including [[classical mechanics]], [[optics]], [[electromagnetism]], [[quantum mechanics]], and [[quantum electrodynamics]], they are used to study physical phenomena, such as [[rigid-body dynamics|the motion of rigid bodies]]. In [[computer graphics]], they are used to manipulate [[3D models]] and project them onto a [[Glossary of computer graphics#screen space|2-dimensional screen]]. In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], [[Stochastic matrix|stochastic matrices]] are used to describe sets of probabilities; for instance, they are used within the [[PageRank]] algorithm that ranks the pages in a Google search.<ref>K. Bryan and T. Leise. The $25,000,000,000 eigenvector: The linear algebra behind Google. SIAM Review, 48(3):569–581, 2006.</ref> [[Matrix calculus]] generalizes classical [[mathematical analysis|analytical]] notions such as [[derivative]]s and [[exponentials]] to higher dimensions. Matrices are used in [[economics]] to describe systems of economic relationships.\n\nA major branch of [[numerical analysis]] is devoted to the development of efficient algorithms for matrix computations, a subject that is centuries old and is today an expanding area of research. [[Matrix (mathematics)#Decomposition|Matrix decomposition methods]] simplify computations, both theoretically and practically. Algorithms that are tailored to particular matrix structures, such as [[Sparse matrix|sparse matrices]] and [[diagonal matrix|near-diagonal matrices]], expedite computations in [[finite element method]] and other computations. Infinite matrices occur in planetary theory and in atomic theory. A simple example of an infinite matrix is the matrix representing the [[derivative (calculus)|derivative]] operator, which acts on the [[Taylor series]] of a function.\n\n==Definition==\nA ''matrix'' is a rectangular array of [[number]]s or other mathematical objects for which operations such as [[#Basic operations|addition]] and [[#Matrix multiplication|multiplication]] are defined.<ref>{{Harvard citations |author=Lang |year=2002 |nb=yes }}</ref>  Most commonly, a matrix over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' is a rectangular array of scalars each of which is a member of ''F''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=209}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Nering|1970|p=37}}</ref> Most of this article focuses on ''real'' and ''complex matrices'', that is, matrices whose elements are [[real numbers]] or [[complex numbers]], respectively. More general types of entries are discussed [[#Matrices with more general entries|below]]. For instance, this is a real matrix:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -1.3 & 0.6 \\\\\n     20.4 & 5.5 \\\\\n      9.7 & -6.2 \n  \\end{bmatrix}. </math>\n\nThe numbers, symbols or expressions in the matrix are called its ''entries'' or its ''elements''. The horizontal and vertical lines of entries in a matrix are called ''rows'' and ''columns'', respectively.\n\n===Size===\n\nThe size of a matrix is defined by the number of rows and columns that it contains. A matrix with ''m'' rows and ''n'' columns is called an ''m''&nbsp;×&nbsp;''n'' matrix or ''m''-by-''n'' matrix, while ''m'' and ''n'' are called its ''dimensions''. For example, the matrix '''A''' above is a 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;2 matrix.\n\nMatrices which have a single row are called ''[[row vector]]s'', and those which have a single column are called ''[[column vectors]]''. A matrix which has the same number of rows and columns is called a ''[[square matrix]]''. A matrix with an infinite number of rows or columns (or both) is called an [[#Infinite matrices|''infinite matrix'']]. In some contexts, such as computer algebra programs, it is useful to consider a matrix with no rows or no columns, called an [[#Empty matrices|''empty matrix'']].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Matrices are usually symbolized using [[upper-case]] letters (such as '''A''' in the examples above), while the corresponding [[lower-case]] letters, with two subscript indices (for example, ''a''<sub>11</sub>, or ''a''<sub>1,1</sub>), represent the entries. In addition to using upper-case letters to symbolize matrices, many authors use a special [[Emphasis (typography)|typographical style]], commonly boldface upright (non-italic), to further distinguish matrices from other mathematical objects.  An alternative notation involves the use of a double-underline with the variable name, with or without boldface style, (for example, <math>\\underline{\\underline{A}}</math>).\n\nThe entry in the ''i''-th row and ''j''-th column of a matrix '''A''' is sometimes referred to as the ''i'',''j'', (''i'',''j''), or (''i'',''j'')<sup>th</sup> entry of the matrix, and most commonly denoted as ''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>, or ''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>. Alternative notations for that entry are ''A''[''i,j''] or ''A''<sub>''i,j''</sub>. For example, the (1,3) entry of the following matrix '''A''' is 5 (also denoted ''a''<sub>13</sub>, ''a''<sub>1,3</sub>, ''A''[''1,3''] or ''A''<sub>''1,3''</sub>):\n\n:<math>\n  \\mathbf{A}=\\begin{bmatrix} \n    4 & -7 & \\color{red}{5} & 0 \\\\ \n    -2 & 0 & 11 & 8 \\\\\n    19 & 1 & -3 & 12\n  \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nSometimes, the entries of a matrix can be defined by a formula such as ''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> = ''f''(''i'', ''j''). For example, each of the entries of the following matrix '''A''' is determined by ''a''<sub>''ij''</sub> = ''i'' − ''j''. \n:<math>\\mathbf A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & -1 & -2 & -3\\\\\n1 & 0 & -1 & -2\\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\nIn this case, the matrix itself is sometimes defined by that formula, within square brackets or double parentheses. For example, the matrix above is defined as '''A''' = [''i''-''j''], or '''A''' = ((''i''-''j'')). If matrix size is ''m'' × ''n'', the above-mentioned formula ''f''(''i'', ''j'') is valid for any ''i'' = 1, ..., ''m'' and any ''j'' = 1, ..., ''n''. This can be either specified separately, or using ''m'' × ''n'' as a subscript. For instance, the matrix '''A''' above is 3 × 4 and can be defined as '''A''' = [''i'' − ''j''] (''i'' = 1, 2, 3; ''j'' = 1, ..., 4), or '''A''' = [''i'' − ''j'']<sub>''3''×''4''</sub>.\n\nSome programming languages utilize doubly subscripted arrays (or arrays of arrays) to represent an ''m''-×-''n'' matrix. Some programming languages start the numbering of array indexes at zero, in which case the entries of an ''m''-by-''n'' matrix are indexed by {{nowrap|0 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''m'' − 1}} and {{nowrap|0 ≤ ''j'' ≤ ''n'' − 1}}.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Oualline |year=2003 |loc=Ch. 5| nb=yes }}</ref> This article follows the more common convention in mathematical writing where enumeration starts from 1.\n\nAn asterisk is occasionally used to refer to whole rows or columns in a matrix. For example, ''a''<sub>''i'',∗</sub> refers to the i<sup>th</sup> row of '''A''', and ''a''<sub>∗,''j''</sub> refers to the j<sup>th</sup> column of '''A'''. The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all ''m''-by-''n'' matrices is denoted 𝕄(''m'', ''n'').\n\n==Basic operations==\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | video1 = [http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-organize-add-and-multiply-matrices-bill-shillito How to organize, add and multiply matrices - Bill Shillito], [[TED (conference)|TED ED]]<ref name=\"Ted\">{{cite web | title =How to organize, add and multiply matrices - Bill Shillito | work = | publisher =[[TED (conference)|TED ED]] | date = | url =http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-organize-add-and-multiply-matrices-bill-shillito | accessdate =April 6, 2013 }}</ref> }}\nThere are a number of basic operations that can be applied to modify matrices, called ''matrix addition'', ''scalar multiplication'', ''transposition'', ''matrix multiplication'', ''row operations'', and ''submatrix''.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Brown |year=1991 |nb=yes |loc=Definition I.2.1 (addition), Definition I.2.4 (scalar multiplication), and Definition I.2.33 (transpose) }}</ref>\n\n===Addition, scalar multiplication and transposition===\n{{Main|Matrix addition|Scalar multiplication|Transpose}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Similarly if all entries of ''A'' above the main diagonal are zero, '''A''' is called a ''lower triangular matrix''. If all entries outside the main diagonal are zero, '''A''' is called a [[diagonal matrix]].\n\n==== Identity matrix ====\n{{Main|Identity matrix}}\nThe ''identity matrix'' '''I'''<sub>''n''</sub> of size ''n'' is the ''n''-by-''n'' matrix in which all the elements on the [[main diagonal]] are equal to 1 and all other elements are equal to 0, for example,\n:<math>\nI_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n,\\ \nI_2 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n         1 & 0 \\\\\n         0 & 1 \n      \\end{bmatrix}\n,\\ \\cdots ,\\ \nI_n = \\begin{bmatrix}\n         1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n         0 & 1 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n         \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n         0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1\n      \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\nIt is a square matrix of order ''n'', and also a special kind of [[diagonal matrix]].

Equivalently, a matrix ''A'' is orthogonal if its [[transpose]] is equal to its [[Invertible matrix|inverse]]:\n:<math>A^\\mathrm{T}=A^{-1}, \\,</math>\nwhich entails\n:<math>A^\\mathrm{T} A = A A^\\mathrm{T} = I_n, \\,</math>\nwhere ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]] of size ''n''.\n\nAn orthogonal matrix ''A'' is necessarily [[Invertible matrix|invertible]] (with inverse {{nowrap|1=''A''<sup>&minus;1</sup> = ''A''<sup>T</sup>}}), [[Unitary matrix|unitary]] ({{nowrap|1=''A''<sup>&minus;1</sup> = ''A''*}}), and [[Normal matrix|normal]] ({{nowrap|1=''A''*''A'' = ''AA''*}}). The [[determinant]] of any orthogonal matrix is either +1 or −1. A ''special orthogonal matrix'' is an orthogonal matrix with [[determinant]] +1. As a [[linear transformation]], every orthogonal matrix with determinant +1 is a pure [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]], while every orthogonal matrix with determinant -1 is either a pure [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]], or a composition of reflection and rotation.\n\nThe [[complex number|complex]] analogue of an orthogonal matrix is a [[unitary matrix]].\n\n===Main operations===\n\n====Trace====\nThe [[trace of a matrix|trace]], tr('''A''') of a square matrix '''A''' is the sum of its diagonal entries. While matrix multiplication is not commutative as mentioned [[#non commutative|above]], the trace of the product of two matrices is independent of the order of the factors: \n: tr('''AB''') = tr('''BA'''). \nThis is immediate from the definition of matrix multiplication:\n:<math>\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathsf{AB}) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij} B_{ji} = \\operatorname{tr}(\\mathsf{BA}).</math>\nAlso, the trace of a matrix is equal to that of its transpose, that is,\n:{{nowrap begin}}tr('''A''') = tr('''A'''<sup>T</sup>){{nowrap end}}.\n\n====Determinant====\n{{Main|Determinant}}\n[[File:Determinant example.svg|thumb|300px|right|A linear transformation on '''R'''<sup>2</sup> given by the indicated matrix.

A matrix is invertible [[if and only if]] its determinant is nonzero. Its [[absolute value]] equals the area (in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>) or volume (in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>) of the image of the unit square (or cube), while its sign corresponds to the orientation of the corresponding linear map: the determinant is positive if and only if the orientation is preserved.\n\nThe determinant of 2-by-2 matrices is given by\n:<math>\\det \\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\\\c&d\\end{bmatrix} = ad-bc.</math>\nThe determinant of 3-by-3 matrices involves 6 terms ([[rule of Sarrus]]).

Determinants can be used to solve [[linear system]]s using [[Cramer's rule]], where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system's variables.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Brown |year=1991 |nb=yes |loc=Theorem III.3.18 }}</ref>\n\n====Eigenvalues and eigenvectors====\n{{Main|Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|l1=Eigenvalues and eigenvectors}}\nA number λ and a non-zero vector '''v''' satisfying\n:'''Av''' = λ'''v'''\nare called an ''eigenvalue'' and an ''eigenvector'' of '''A''', respectively.<ref>''Eigen'' means \"own\" in [[German language|German]] and in [[Dutch language|Dutch]].</ref><ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Brown |year=1991 |nb=yes |loc=Definition III.4.1 }}</ref> The number λ is an eigenvalue of an ''n''×''n''-matrix '''A''' if and only if '''A'''−λ'''I'''<sub>''n''</sub> is not invertible, which is [[logical equivalence|equivalent]] to\n:<math>\\det(\\mathsf{A}-\\lambda \\mathsf{I}) = 0.\\ </math><ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Brown |year=1991 |nb=yes |loc=Definition III.4.9 }}</ref>\nThe polynomial ''p''<sub>'''A'''</sub> in an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] ''X'' given by evaluation the determinant det(''X'''''I'''<sub>''n''</sub>−'''A''') is called the [[characteristic polynomial]] of '''A'''.

According to the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]], {{nowrap begin}}''p''<sub>'''A'''</sub>('''A''') = '''0'''{{nowrap end}}, that is, the result of substituting the matrix itself into its own characteristic polynomial yields the [[zero matrix]].\n\n==Computational aspects==\nMatrix calculations can be often performed with different techniques. Many problems can be solved by both direct algorithms or iterative approaches. For example, the eigenvectors of a square matrix can be obtained by finding a [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] of vectors '''x'''<sub>''n''</sub> [[Limit of a sequence|converging]] to an eigenvector when ''n'' tends to [[infinity]].<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Householder |year=1975 |loc=Ch. 7 |nb=yes }}</ref>\n\nTo be able to choose the more appropriate algorithm for each specific problem, it is important to determine both the effectiveness and precision of all the available algorithms. The domain studying these matters is called [[numerical linear algebra]].<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Bau III |last2=Trefethen |year=1997 |nb=yes }}</ref> As with other numerical situations, two main aspects are the [[complexity analysis|complexity]] of algorithms and their [[numerical stability]].\n\nDetermining the complexity of an algorithm means finding [[upper bound]]s or estimates of how many elementary operations such as additions and multiplications of scalars are necessary to perform some algorithm, for example, [[matrix multiplication algorithm|multiplication of matrices]]. For example, calculating the matrix product of two ''n''-by-''n'' matrix using the definition given above needs ''n''<sup>3</sup> multiplications, since for any of the ''n''<sup>2</sup> entries of the product, ''n'' multiplications are necessary. The [[Strassen algorithm]] outperforms this \"naive\" algorithm; it needs only ''n''<sup>2.807</sup> multiplications.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Golub |last2=Van Loan |year=1996 |nb=yes |loc=Algorithm 1.3.1 }}</ref> A refined approach also incorporates specific features of the computing devices.\n\nIn many practical situations additional information about the matrices involved is known. An important case are [[sparse matrix|sparse matrices]], that is, matrices most of whose entries are zero. There are specifically adapted algorithms for, say, solving linear systems '''Ax''' = '''b''' for sparse matrices '''A''', such as the [[conjugate gradient method]].<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Golub |last2=Van Loan |year=1996 |nb=yes |loc=Chapters 9 and 10, esp. section 10.2 }}</ref>\n\nAn algorithm is, roughly speaking, numerically stable, if little deviations in the input values do not lead to big deviations in the result. For example, calculating the inverse of a matrix via [[Laplace's formula]] (Adj ('''A''') denotes the [[adjugate matrix]] of '''A''')\n:'''A'''<sup>−1</sup> = Adj('''A''') / det('''A''')\nmay lead to significant rounding errors if the determinant of the matrix is very small. The [[matrix norm|norm of a matrix]] can be used to capture the [[Condition number|conditioning]] of linear algebraic problems, such as computing a matrix's inverse.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Golub |last2=Van Loan |year=1996 |nb=yes |loc=Chapter 2.3 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough most [[computer language]]s are not designed with commands or libraries for matrices, as early as the 1970s, some engineering desktop computers such as the [[HP 9830]] had ROM cartridges to add BASIC commands for matrices. Some computer languages such as [[APL (programming language)|APL]] were designed to manipulate matrices, and [[List of numerical analysis software|various mathematical programs]] can be used to aid computing with matrices.<ref>For example, [[Mathematica]], see {{Harvard citations |last1=Wolfram |year=2003 |loc=Ch. 3.7 |nb=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Decomposition==\n{{Main|Matrix decomposition|Matrix diagonalization|Gaussian elimination|Montante's method}}\nThere are several methods to render matrices into a more easily accessible form. They are generally referred to as ''matrix decomposition'' or ''matrix factorization'' techniques. The interest of all these techniques is that they preserve certain properties of the matrices in question, such as determinant, rank or inverse, so that these quantities can be calculated after applying the transformation, or that certain matrix operations are algorithmically easier to carry out for some types of matrices.\n\nThe [[LU decomposition]] factors matrices as a product of lower ('''L''') and an upper [[triangular matrix|triangular matrices]] ('''U''').<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Press |last2=Flannery |last3=Teukolsky |year=1992 |nb=yes }}</ref> Once this decomposition is calculated, linear systems can be solved more efficiently, by a simple technique called [[forward substitution|forward and back substitution]]. Likewise, inverses of triangular matrices are algorithmically easier to calculate. The ''Gaussian elimination'' is a similar algorithm; it transforms any matrix to [[row echelon form]].<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Stoer |last2=Bulirsch |year=2002 |nb=yes |loc=Section 4.1 }}</ref> Both methods proceed by multiplying the matrix by suitable [[elementary matrix|elementary matrices]], which correspond to [[permutation matrix|permuting rows or columns]] and adding multiples of one row to another row. [[Singular value decomposition]] expresses any matrix '''A''' as a product '''UDV'''<sup>∗</sup>, where '''U''' and '''V''' are [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]] and '''D''' is a diagonal matrix.\n\n[[File:Jordan blocks.svg|right|thumb|250px|An example of a matrix in Jordan normal form. The grey blocks are called Jordan blocks.]]\nThe [[eigendecomposition]] or ''diagonalization'' expresses '''A''' as a product '''VDV'''<sup>−1</sup>, where '''D''' is a diagonal matrix and '''V''' is a suitable invertible matrix.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Horn |last2=Johnson |year=1985 |nb=yes |loc=Theorem 2.5.4 }}</ref>  If '''A''' can be written in this form, it is called [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]]. More generally, and applicable to all matrices, the Jordan decomposition transforms a matrix into [[Jordan normal form]], that is to say matrices whose only nonzero entries are the eigenvalues λ<sub>1</sub> to λ<sub>n</sub> of '''A''', placed on the main diagonal and possibly entries equal to one directly above the main diagonal, as shown at the right.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Horn |last2=Johnson |year=1985 |nb=yes |loc=Ch. 3.1, 3.2 }}</ref> Given the eigendecomposition, the ''n''<sup>th</sup> power of '''A''' (that is, ''n''-fold iterated matrix multiplication) can be calculated via\n:'''A'''<sup>''n''</sup> = ('''VDV'''<sup>−1</sup>)<sup>''n''</sup> = '''VDV'''<sup>−1</sup>'''VDV'''<sup>−1</sup>...'''VDV'''<sup>−1</sup> = '''VD'''<sup>''n''</sup>'''V'''<sup>−1</sup>\nand the power of a diagonal matrix can be calculated by taking the corresponding powers of the diagonal entries, which is much easier than doing the exponentiation for '''A''' instead.

Abstract algebra uses matrices with entries in more general [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] or even [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], while linear algebra codifies properties of matrices in the notion of linear maps. It is possible to consider matrices with infinitely many columns and rows. Another extension are [[tensors]], which can be seen as higher-dimensional arrays of numbers, as opposed to vectors, which can often be realised as sequences of numbers, while matrices are rectangular or two-dimensional arrays of numbers.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Coburn |year=1955 |nb=yes |loc=Ch. V }}</ref> Matrices, subject to certain requirements tend to form [[group (mathematics)|groups]] known as matrix groups. Similarly under certain conditions matrices form [[ring (mathematics)|rings]]  known as [[matrix ring]]s. Though the product of matrices is not in general commutative yet certain matrices form [[field (mathematics)|fields]] known as [[matrix field]]s.\n\n===Matrices with more general entries===\nThis article focuses on matrices whose entries are real or [[complex number]]s. <span id=\"more_general_entries\">However, matrices can be considered with much more general types of entries than real or complex numbers.</span> As a first step of generalization, any [[field (mathematics)|field]], that is, a [[set (mathematics)|set]] where [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] operations are defined and well-behaved, may be used instead of '''R''' or '''C''', for example [[rational number]]s or [[finite field]]s. For example, [[coding theory]] makes use of matrices over finite fields. Wherever [[eigenvalue]]s are considered, as these are roots of a polynomial they may exist only in a larger field than that of the entries of the matrix; for instance they may be complex in case of a matrix with real entries. The possibility to reinterpret the entries of a matrix as elements of a larger field (for example, to view a real matrix as a complex matrix whose entries happen to be all real) then allows considering each square matrix to possess a full set of eigenvalues. Alternatively one can consider only matrices with entries in an [[algebraically closed field]], such as '''C''', from the outset.\n\nMore generally, abstract algebra makes great use of matrices with entries in a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R''.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Lang |year=2002 |nb=yes |loc=Chapter XIII }}</ref> Rings are a more general notion than fields in that a division operation need not exist. The very same addition and multiplication operations of matrices extend to this setting, too. The set M(''n'', ''R'') of all square ''n''-by-''n'' matrices over ''R'' is a ring called [[matrix ring]], isomorphic to the [[endomorphism ring]] of the left ''R''-[[module (mathematics)|module]] ''R''<sup>''n''</sup>.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Lang |year=2002 |nb=yes |loc=XVII.1, p. 643 }}</ref> If the ring ''R'' is [[commutative ring|commutative]], that is, its multiplication is commutative, then M(''n'', ''R'') is a unitary noncommutative (unless ''n'' = 1) [[associative algebra]] over ''R''. The [[determinant]] of square matrices over a commutative ring ''R'' can still be defined using the [[Leibniz formula (determinant)|Leibniz formula]]; such a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is [[invertible]] in ''R'', generalising the situation over a field ''F'', where every nonzero element is invertible.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Lang |year=2002 |nb=yes |loc=Proposition XIII.4.16 }}</ref> Matrices over [[superring]]s are called [[supermatrix|supermatrices]].<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Reichl |year=2004 |nb=yes |loc=Section L.2 }}</ref>\n\nMatrices do not always have all their entries in the same ring&nbsp;– or even in any ring at all. One special but common case is [[block matrix|block matrices]], which may be considered as matrices whose entries themselves are matrices. The entries need not be quadratic matrices, and thus need not be members of any ordinary [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]; but their sizes must fulfil certain compatibility conditions.\n\n===Relationship to linear maps===\nLinear maps '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> → '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> are equivalent to ''m''-by-''n'' matrices, as described [[#linear maps|above]]. More generally, any linear map {{nowrap|''f'': ''V'' → ''W''}} between finite-[[Hamel dimension|dimensional]] [[vector space]]s can be described by a matrix '''A''' = (''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>), after choosing [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] '''v'''<sub>1</sub>, ..., '''v'''<sub>''n''</sub> of ''V'', and '''w'''<sub>1</sub>, ..., '''w'''<sub>''m''</sub> of ''W'' (so ''n'' is the dimension of ''V'' and ''m'' is the dimension of ''W''), which is such that\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{v}_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^m a_{i,j} \\mathbf{w}_i\\qquad\\mbox{for }j=1,\\ldots,n.</math>\nIn other words, column ''j'' of ''A'' expresses the image of '''v'''<sub>''j''</sub> in terms of the basis vectors '''w'''<sub>''i''</sub> of ''W''; thus this relation uniquely determines the entries of the matrix '''A'''. The matrix depends on the choice of the bases: different choices of bases give rise to different, but [[Matrix equivalence|equivalent matrices]].<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Greub |year=1975 |nb=yes |loc=Section III.3 }}</ref> Many of the above concrete notions can be reinterpreted in this light, for example, the transpose matrix '''A'''<sup>''T''</sup> describes the [[Transpose of a linear map|transpose of the linear map]] given by '''A''', with respect to the [[dual space|dual bases]].<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Greub |year=1975 |nb=yes |loc=Section III.3.13 }}</ref>\n\nThese properties can be restated in a more natural way: the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of all matrices with entries in a field <math>k</math> with multiplication as composition is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of finite dimensional [[vector space]]s and linear maps over this field.\n\nMore generally, the set of ''m''×''n'' matrices can be used to represent the ''R''-linear maps between the free modules ''R''<sup>''m''</sup> and ''R''<sup>''n''</sup> for an arbitrary ring ''R'' with unity.  When ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m'' composition of these maps is possible, and this gives rise to the [[matrix ring]] of ''n''×''n'' matrices representing the [[endomorphism ring]] of ''R''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\n===Matrix groups===\n{{Main|Matrix group}}\nA [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of objects together with a [[binary operation]], that is, an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements.<ref>See any standard reference in group.</ref> A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication is called a ''matrix group''.<ref>Additionally, the group is required to be [[closed subset|closed]] in the general linear group.</ref><ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Baker |year=2003 |nb=yes |loc=Def. 1.30 }}</ref> Since in a group every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size, called the [[general linear group]]s.\n\nAny property of matrices that is preserved under matrix products and inverses can be used to define further matrix groups. For example, matrices with a given size and with a determinant of 1 form a [[subgroup]] of (that is, a smaller group contained in) their general linear group, called a [[special linear group]].<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Baker |year=2003 |nb=yes |loc=Theorem 1.2 }}</ref> [[orthogonal matrix|Orthogonal matrices]], determined by the condition\n:'''M'''<sup>T</sup>'''M''' = '''I''',\nform the [[orthogonal group]].<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Artin |year=1991 |nb=yes |loc=Chapter 4.5 }}</ref> Every orthogonal matrix has [[determinant]] 1 or −1. Orthogonal matrices with determinant 1 form a subgroup called ''special orthogonal group''.\n\nEvery [[finite group]] is [[isomorphic]] to a matrix group, as one can see by considering the [[regular representation]] of the [[symmetric group]].<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Rowen |year=2008 |loc=Example 19.2, p. 198 |nb=yes }}</ref> General groups can be studied using matrix groups, which are comparatively well understood, by means of [[representation theory]].<ref>See any reference in representation theory or [[group representation]].</ref>\n\n===Infinite matrices===\nIt is also possible to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns<ref>See the item \"Matrix\" in {{Harvard citations |editor1-last=Itõ |year=1987 |nb=yes }}</ref> even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. All that matters is that for every element in the set indexing rows, and every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.\n\nIf ''R'' is any ring with unity, then the ring of endomorphisms of <math>M=\\bigoplus_{i\\in I}R</math> as a right ''R'' module is isomorphic to the ring of '''column finite matrices''' <math>\\mathbb{CFM}_I(R)</math> whose entries are indexed by <math>I\\times I</math>, and whose columns each contain only finitely many nonzero entries.  The endomorphisms of ''M'' considered as a left ''R'' module result in an analogous object, the '''row finite matrices''' <math>\\mathbb{RFM}_I(R)</math> whose rows each only have finitely many nonzero entries.\n\nIf infinite matrices are used to describe linear maps, then only those matrices can be used all of whose columns have but a finite number of nonzero entries, for the following reason. For a matrix '''A''' to describe a linear map ''f'': ''V''→''W'', bases for both spaces must have been chosen; recall that by definition this means that every vector in the space can be written uniquely as a (finite) [[linear combination]] of basis vectors, so that written as a (column) vector&nbsp;''v'' of coefficients, only finitely many entries ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> are nonzero. Now the columns of '''A''' describe the images by ''f'' of individual basis vectors of ''V'' in the basis of ''W'', which is only meaningful if these columns have only finitely many nonzero entries. There is no restriction on the rows of ''A'' however: in the product '''A'''·''v'' there are only finitely many nonzero coefficients of ''v'' involved, so every one of its entries, even if it is given as an infinite sum of products, involves only finitely many nonzero terms and is therefore well defined. Moreover, this amounts to forming a linear combination of the columns of '''A''' that effectively involves only finitely many of them, whence the result has only finitely many nonzero entries, because each of those columns do. One also sees that products of two matrices of the given type is well defined (provided as usual that the column-index and row-index sets match), is again of the same type, and corresponds to the composition of linear maps.\n\nIf ''R'' is a [[normed ring]], then the condition of row or column finiteness can be relaxed.  With the norm in place, [[absolutely convergent series]] can be used instead of finite sums.  For example, the matrices whose column sums are absolutely convergent sequences form a ring.  Analogously of course, the matrices whose row sums are absolutely convergent series also form a ring.\n\nIn that vein, infinite matrices can also be used to describe [[Hilbert space#Operators on Hilbert spaces|operators on Hilbert spaces]], where convergence and [[Continuous function|continuity]] questions arise, which again results in certain constraints that have to be imposed. However, the explicit point of view of matrices tends to obfuscate the matter,<ref>\"Not much of matrix theory carries over to infinite-dimensional spaces, and what does is not so useful, but it sometimes helps.\" {{Harvard citations |last1=Halmos |year=1982 |loc=p. 23, Chapter 5 |nb=yes }}</ref> and the abstract and more powerful tools of [[functional analysis]] can be used instead.\n\n===Empty matrices===\nAn ''empty matrix'' is a matrix in which the number of rows or columns (or both) is zero.<ref>\"Empty Matrix: A matrix is empty if either its row or column dimension is zero\", [http://www.omatrix.com/manual/glossary.htm Glossary], O-Matrix v6 User Guide</ref><ref>\"A matrix having at least one dimension equal to zero is called an empty matrix\", [http://www.system.nada.kth.se/unix/software/matlab/Release_14.1/techdoc/matlab_prog/ch_dat29.html MATLAB Data Structures]</ref> Empty matrices help dealing with maps involving the [[zero vector space]]. For example, if ''A'' is a 3-by-0 matrix and ''B'' is a 0-by-3 matrix, then ''AB'' is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space ''V'' to itself, while ''BA'' is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most [[computer algebra system]]s allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the [[empty product]] occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value is also consistent with the fact that the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant&nbsp;1, a fact that is often used as a part of the characterization of determinants.\n\n==Applications==\nThere are numerous applications of matrices, both in mathematics and other sciences. Some of them merely take advantage of the compact representation of a set of numbers in a matrix. For example, in [[game theory]] and [[economics]], the [[payoff matrix]] encodes the payoff for two players, depending on which out of a given (finite) set of alternatives the players choose.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Fudenberg |last2=Tirole |year=1983 |nb=yes |loc=Section 1.1.1 }}</ref> [[Text mining]] and automated [[thesaurus]] compilation makes use of [[document-term matrix|document-term matrices]] such as [[tf-idf]] to track frequencies of certain words in several documents.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Manning |year=1999 |loc=Section 15.3.4 |nb=yes }}</ref>\n\nComplex numbers can be represented by particular real 2-by-2 matrices via\n:<math>a + ib \\leftrightarrow \\begin{bmatrix}\na & -b  \\\\\nb & a \\end{bmatrix},</math>\nunder which addition and multiplication of complex numbers and matrices correspond to each other. For example, 2-by-2 rotation matrices represent the multiplication with some complex number of [[absolute value]] 1, as [[#rotation matrix|above]]. A similar interpretation is possible for [[quaternion]]s<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Ward |year=1997 |loc=Ch. 2.8 |nb=yes }}</ref> and [[Clifford algebra]]s in general.\n\nEarly [[encryption]] techniques such as the [[Hill cipher]] also used matrices. However, due to the linear nature of matrices, these codes are comparatively easy to break.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Stinson |year=2005 |loc=Ch. 1.1.5 and 1.2.4 |nb=yes }}</ref> [[Computer graphics]] uses matrices both to represent objects and to calculate transformations of objects using affine [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] to accomplish tasks such as projecting a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional screen, corresponding to a theoretical camera observation.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Association for Computing Machinery |year=1979 |loc=Ch. 7 |nb=yes }}</ref> Matrices over a [[polynomial ring]] are important in the study of [[control theory]].\n\n[[Chemistry]] makes use of matrices in various ways, particularly since the use of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] to discuss [[chemical bond|molecular bonding]] and [[spectroscopy]].

The [[equation of motion|equations of motion]] of such systems can be described in matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's [[eigenvector]]s, its [[normal mode]]s, by diagonalizing the matrix equation.

In this approximative theory, the [[light wave|wave nature]] of light is neglected. The result is a model in which [[ray (optics)|light rays]] are indeed [[ray (geometry)|geometrical rays]]. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a [[lens (optics)|lens]] or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called [[ray transfer matrix]]: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes the properties of the optical element. Actually, there are two kinds of matrices, viz. a ''refraction matrix'' describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a ''translation matrix'', describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.\nThe optical system, consisting of a combination of lenses and/or reflective elements, is simply described by the matrix resulting from the product of the components' matrices.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Guenther |year=1990 |nb=yes |loc=Ch. 5 }}</ref>\n\n===Electronics===\nTraditional [[mesh analysis]] and [[nodal analysis]] in electronics lead to a system of linear equations that can be described with a matrix.\n\nThe behaviour of many [[Electronics|electronic]] components can be described using matrices.

III, p. 96 |nb=yes }}</ref> in which he proposed and demonstrated the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAn English mathematician named Cullis was the first to use modern bracket notation for matrices in 1913 and he simultaneously demonstrated the first significant use of the notation '''A''' = [''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>] to represent a matrix where ''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> refers to the'' i''th row and the ''j''th column.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe modern study of determinants sprang from several sources.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Knobloch |year=1994 |nb=yes }}</ref> [[number theory|Number-theoretical]] problems led [[Gauss]] to relate coefficients of [[quadratic form]]s, that is, expressions such as {{nowrap|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''xy'' − 2''y''<sup>2</sup>,}} and [[linear map]]s in three dimensions to matrices. [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] further developed these notions, including the remark that, in modern parlance, [[matrix product]]s are [[non-commutative]]. [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] was the first to prove general statements about determinants, using as definition of the determinant of a matrix '''A''' = [''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>] the following: replace the powers ''a''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>''k''</sup> by ''a''<sub>''jk''</sub> in the [[polynomial]]\n:<math>a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n \\prod_{i < j} (a_j - a_i)\\;</math>,\nwhere Π denotes the [[multiplication|product]] of the indicated terms. He also showed, in 1829, that the [[eigenvalue]]s of symmetric matrices are real.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Hawkins |year=1975 |nb=yes }}</ref> [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]] studied \"functional determinants\"—later called [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobi determinant]]s by Sylvester—which can be used to describe geometric transformations at a local (or [[infinitesimal]]) level, see [[#Jacobi matrix|above]]; [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]]'s ''Vorlesungen über die Theorie der Determinanten''<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Kronecker |editor1-last=Hensel |year=1897 |nb=yes }}</ref> and [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass']] ''Zur Determinantentheorie'',<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Weierstrass |year=1915 |volume=3 |loc=pp. 271–286 |nb=yes }}</ref> both published in 1903, first treated determinants [[axiom]]atically, as opposed to previous more concrete approaches such as the mentioned formula of Cauchy. At that point, determinants were firmly established.\n\nMany theorems were first established for small matrices only, for example the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] was proved for 2×2 matrices by Cayley in the aforementioned memoir, and by [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] for 4×4 matrices. [[Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]], working on [[bilinear form]]s, generalized the theorem to all dimensions (1898). Also at the end of the 19th century the [[Gauss–Jordan elimination]] (generalizing a special case now known as [[Gauss elimination]]) was established by [[Wilhelm Jordan (geodesist)|Jordan]]. In the early 20th century, matrices attained a central role in linear algebra.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Bôcher |year=2004 |nb=yes }}</ref> partially due to their use in classification of the [[hypercomplex number]] systems of the previous century.\n\nThe inception of [[matrix mechanics]] by [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Max Born|Born]] and [[Pascual Jordan|Jordan]] led to studying matrices with infinitely many rows and columns.<ref>{{Harvard citations |last1=Mehra |last2=Rechenberg |year=1987 |nb=yes }}</ref> Later, [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] carried out the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], by further developing [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] notions such as [[linear operator]]s on [[Hilbert space]]s, which, very roughly speaking, correspond to [[Euclidean space]], but with an infinity of [[Hamel dimension|independent directions]].\n\n===Other historical usages of the word “matrix” in mathematics===\nThe word has been used in unusual ways by at least two authors of historical importance.\n\n[[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in their ''Principia Mathematica'' (1910–1913) use the word “matrix” in the context of their [[axiom of reducibility]]. They proposed this axiom as a means to reduce any function to one of lower type, successively, so that at the “bottom” (0 order) the function is identical to its [[Extension (predicate logic)|extension]]:\n:“Let us give the name of ''matrix'' to any function, of however many variables, which does not involve any [[apparent variable]]s. Then any possible function other than a matrix is derived from a matrix by means of generalization, that is, by considering the proposition which asserts that the function in question is true with all possible values or with some value of one of the arguments, the other argument or arguments remaining undetermined”.<ref>Whitehead, Alfred North; and Russell, Bertrand (1913) ''Principia Mathematica to *56'', Cambridge at the University Press, Cambridge UK (republished 1962) cf page 162ff.</ref>\nFor example, a function Φ(''x, y'') of two variables ''x'' and ''y'' can be reduced to a ''collection'' of functions of a single variable, for example, ''y'', by “considering” the function for all possible values of “individuals” ''a<sub>i</sub>'' substituted in place of variable ''x''. And then the resulting collection of functions of the single variable ''y'', that is, ∀a<sub>i</sub>: Φ(''a<sub>i</sub>, y''), can be reduced to a “matrix” of values by “considering” the function for all possible values of “individuals” ''b<sub>i</sub>'' substituted in place of variable ''y'':\n:∀b<sub>j</sub>∀a<sub>i</sub>: Φ(''a<sub>i</sub>, ''b<sub>j</sub>'').''\n\n[[Alfred Tarski]] in his 1946 ''Introduction to Logic'' used the word “matrix” synonymously with the notion of [[truth table]] as used in mathematical logic.<ref>Tarski, Alfred; (1946) ''Introduction to Logic and the Methodology of Deductive Sciences'', Dover Publications, Inc, New York NY, {{isbn|0-486-28462-X}}.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{Div col|cols=2}}\n\n* [[Algebraic multiplicity]]\n* [[Geometric multiplicity]]\n* [[Gram–Schmidt process]]\n* [[List of matrices]]\n* [[Matrix calculus]]\n* [[Matrix function]]\n* [[Periodic matrix set]]\n* [[Tensor]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n{{Reflist|group=nb|3}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation | first1 = Howard | last1 = Anton | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-471-84819-0 | title = Elementary Linear Algebra | edition = 5th | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] | location = New York }}\n* {{Citation |last1=Arnold |first1=Vladimir I. |author1-link=Vladimir Arnold |last2=Cooke |first2=Roger |author2-link=Roger Cooke |title=Ordinary differential equations |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |location=Berlin, DE; New York, NY |isbn=978-3-540-54813-3 |year=1992 }}\n* {{Citation |last1=Artin |first1=Michael |author1-link=Michael Artin |title=Algebra |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |isbn=978-0-89871-510-1 |year=1991 }}\n* {{Citation |last1=Association for Computing Machinery |title=Computer Graphics |publisher=Tata McGraw–Hill |isbn=978-0-07-059376-3 |year=1979 }}\n* {{Citation |last1=Baker |first1=Andrew J. |title=Matrix Groups: An Introduction to Lie Group Theory |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin, DE; New York, NY |isbn=978-1-85233-470-3 |year=2003 }}\n* {{Citation |last1=Bau III |first1=David |last2=Trefethen |first2=Lloyd N. |author2-link=Lloyd N.
