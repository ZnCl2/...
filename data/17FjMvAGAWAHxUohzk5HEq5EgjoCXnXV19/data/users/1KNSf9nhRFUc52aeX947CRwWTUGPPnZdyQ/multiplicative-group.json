(2004), p. 2.</ref> [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], or other structure for which one of its operations is referred to as multiplication. In the case of a field ''F'', the group is {{nowrap|(''F'' ∖ {0}, •)}}, where 0 refers to the [[zero element]] of ''F'' and the [[binary operation]] • is the field [[multiplication]],\n*the [[algebraic torus]] GL(1).{{clarify|reason=this is not defined in this article nor in the linked article|date=March 2015}}\n\n== Examples ==\n*The [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo ''n'']] is the group under multiplication of the invertible elements of <math>\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}</math>.  When ''n'' is not prime, there are elements other than zero that are not invertible.\n* The multiplicative group of [[positive real numbers]], <math>\\mathbb{R}^+</math>, is an [[abelian group]] with 1 being its [[neutral element]]. The [[logarithm]] is a [[group isomorphism]] of this group to the [[additive group]] of real numbers, <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>.\n\n==Group scheme of roots of unity==\nThe '''group scheme of ''n''-th [[roots of unity]]''' is by definition the kernel of the ''n''-power map on the multiplicative group GL(1), considered as a [[group scheme]]. That is, for any integer ''n'' > 1 we can consider the morphism on the multiplicative group that takes ''n''-th powers, and take an appropriate [[fiber product of schemes]], with the morphism ''e'' that serves as the identity.\n\nThe resulting group scheme is written μ<sub>''n''</sub>. It gives rise to a [[reduced scheme]], when we take it over a field ''K'', [[if and only if]] the [[characteristic (field)|characteristic]] of ''K'' does not divide ''n''. This makes it a source of some key examples of non-reduced schemes (schemes with [[nilpotent element]]s in their [[structure sheaf|structure sheaves]]); for example μ<sub>''p''</sub> over a [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements for any [[prime number]] ''p''. \n\nThis phenomenon is not easily expressed in the classical language of algebraic geometry. It turns out to be of major importance, for example, in expressing the [[duality theory of abelian varieties]] in characteristic ''p'' (theory of [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]]). The Galois cohomology of this group scheme is a way of expressing [[Kummer theory]].\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n* [[Michiel Hazewinkel]], Nadiya Gubareni, Nadezhda Mikhaĭlovna Gubareni, Vladimir V.
