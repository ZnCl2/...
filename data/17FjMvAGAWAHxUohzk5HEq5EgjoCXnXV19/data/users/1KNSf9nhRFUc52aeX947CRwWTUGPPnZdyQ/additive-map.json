For example, any [[linear map]] is additive. When the domain is the [[real numbers]], this is [[Cauchy's functional equation]]. For a specific case of this definition, see [[additive polynomial]].\n\nMore formally, an additive map is a '''Z'''-[[module homomorphism]].  Since an [[abelian group]] is a '''Z'''-module, it may be defined as a [[group homomorphism]] between abelian groups.\n\nTypical examples include maps between [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, [[vector space]]s, or [[Module (mathematics)|module]]s that preserve the [[additive group]].  An additive map does not necessarily preserve any other structure of the object, for example the product operation of a ring.\n\nIf {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are additive maps, then the map {{math|''f'' + ''g''}} (defined [[pointwise]]) is additive.\n\nA map {{math|''V'' × ''W'' → ''X''}} that is additive each of two arguments separately is called a '''bi-additive map''' or a '''Z-bilinear map'''.\n\n== References ==\n\n* Leslie Hogben, Richard A.
