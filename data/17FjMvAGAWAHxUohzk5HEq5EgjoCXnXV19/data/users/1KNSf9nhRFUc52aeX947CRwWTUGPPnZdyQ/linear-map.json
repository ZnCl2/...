Sometimes the term ''[[linear function]]'' has the same meaning as ''linear map'', while in [[analytic geometry]] it does not.\n\nA linear map always [[map (mathematics)|maps]] linear subspaces onto linear subspaces (possibly of a lower dimension);<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=14}}<br> Here are some properties of linear mappings <math>\\Lambda: X \\to Y</math> whose proofs are so easy that we omit them; it is assumed that <math>A \\subset X</math> and <math>B \\subset Y</math>:<br>(a) <math>\\Lambda 0=0.</math><br>(b) If {{mvar|A}} is a subspace (or a [[convex set]], or a [[balanced set]]) the same is true of <math>\\Lambda(A)</math><br>(c) If {{mvar|B}} is a subspace (or a convex set, or a balanced set) the same is true of <math>\\Lambda^{-1}(B)</math><br>(d) In particular, the set:<br><math>\\Lambda^{-1}(\\{0\\})=\\{x \\in X: \\Lambda x = 0\\} = {N}(\\Lambda)</math><br> is a subspace of {{mvar|X}}, called the ''null space'' of <math>\\Lambda</math>.</ref> for instance it maps a plane through the [[Origin (geometry)|origin]] to a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], [[straight line]] or [[Point (geometry)|point]]. Linear maps can often be represented as [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], and simple examples include [[rotation and reflection linear transformations]].\n\nIn the language of [[abstract algebra]], a linear map is a [[module homomorphism]].  In the language of [[category theory]] it is a [[morphism]] in the [[category of modules]] over a given [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]].\n\n== Definition and first consequences ==\nLet <math>V</math> and <math>W</math> be vector spaces over the same [[field (mathematics)|field]] <math>\\mathbf{K}.</math> A function <math>f : V \\to W</math> is said to be a ''linear map'' if for any two vectors <math>\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\in V</math> and any scalar <math>c \\in \\mathbf{K},</math> the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 20pt\"|<math>f(\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}) = f(\\mathbf{u})+f(\\mathbf{v})</math>\n| [[Additive map|additivity]] / operation of addition\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 20pt\"|<math>f(c \\mathbf{u}) = c f(\\mathbf{u})</math>\n| [[Homogeneous function|homogeneity]] of degree 1 / operation of scalar multiplication\n|}\n\nThus, a linear map is said to be ''operation preserving''.  In other words, it does not matter whether you apply the linear map before or after the operations of addition and scalar multiplication.\n\nThis is equivalent to requiring the same for any linear combination of vectors, i.e. that for any vectors <math>\\mathbf{u}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{u}_n \\in V</math> and scalars <math>c_1, \\ldots, c_n \\in \\mathbf{K},</math> the following equality holds:<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=14}}. Suppose now that {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are vector spaces ''over the same scalar field''. A mapping <math>\\Lambda: X \\to Y</math> is said to be ''linear'' if <math>\\Lambda ( \\alpha x + \\beta y) = \\alpha\\Lambda x + \\beta\\Lambda y</math> for all <math>x,y \\in X</math> and all scalars <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math>. Note that one often writes <math>\\Lambda x</math>, rather than <math>\\Lambda(x)</math>, when <math>\\Lambda</math> is linear.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1976|page=206}}. A mapping {{mvar|A}} of a vector space {{mvar|X}} into a vector space {{mvar|Y}} is said to be a ''linear transformation'' if: <math>A({\\bf x}_1 + {\\bf x}_2) = A{\\bf x}_1 + A{\\bf x}_2, A(c{\\bf x})=cA{\\bf x}</math> for all <math>{\\bf x},{\\bf x}_1,{\\bf x}_2 \\in X</math> and all scalars {{mvar|c}}. Note that one often writes <math>A{\\bf x}</math> instead of <math>A({\\bf x})</math> if {{mvar|A}} is linear.</ref>\n\n: <math>f(c_1 \\mathbf{u}_1+\\cdots+c_n \\mathbf{u}_n) = c_1 f(\\mathbf{u}_1)+\\cdots+c_n f(\\mathbf{u}_n).</math>\n\nDenoting the zero elements of the vector spaces <math>V</math> and <math>W</math> by <math>\\mathbf{0}_V</math> and <math>\\mathbf{0}_W</math> respectively, it follows that <math>f(\\mathbf{0}_V) = \\mathbf{0}_W.</math> Let <math>c = 0</math> and <math>\\mathbf{v} \\in V</math> in the equation for homogeneity of degree 1:\n\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{0}_V) = f(0\\mathbf{v}) = 0f(\\mathbf{v}) = \\mathbf{0}_W.</math>\n\nOccasionally, <math>V</math> and <math>W</math> can be considered to be vector spaces over different fields.  It is then necessary to specify which of these ground fields is being used in the definition of \"linear\". If <math>V</math> and <math>W</math> are considered as spaces over the field <math>\\mathbf{K}</math> as above, we talk about <math>\\mathbf{K}</math>-linear maps. For example, the [[complex conjugate|conjugation]] of [[complex numbers]] is an <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>-linear map <math>\\mathbf{C} \\to \\mathbf{C}</math>, but it is not <math>\\mathbf{C}</math>-linear.\n\nA linear map <math>V \\to \\mathbf{K}</math> with <math>\\mathbf{K}</math> viewed as a vector space over itself, is called a [[linear functional]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=14}}. Linear mappings of {{mvar|X}} onto its scalar field are called ''linear functionals''.</ref>\n\nThese statements generalize to any left-module <math>_R M</math> over a ring <math>R</math> without modification, and to any right-module upon reversing of the scalar multiplication.\n\n== Examples ==\n* The zero map {{nowrap|''x'' ↦ 0}} between two left-modules (or two right-modules) over the same ring is always linear.\n* The [[Identity function|identity map]] on any module is a linear operator.\n* Any [[homothecy]] centered in the origin of a vector space, <math>v\\mapsto cv</math> where ''c'' is a scalar, is a linear operator.  This does not hold in general for modules, where such a map might only be [[Semilinear map|semilinear]].\n* For real numbers, the map {{nowrap|''x'' ↦ ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is not linear.\n* For real numbers, the map {{nowrap|''x'' ↦ ''x'' + 1}} is not linear (but is an [[affine transformation]]; {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x'' + 1}} is a [[linear equation]], as the term is used in [[analytic geometry]].)\n* If ''A'' is a real {{nowrap|''m'' × ''n''}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], then ''A'' defines a linear map from  '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> by sending the [[column vector]] {{nowrap|'''x''' ∈ '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} to the column vector {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' ∈ '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}}. Conversely, any linear map between [[finite-dimensional]] vector spaces can be represented in this manner; see the [[#Matrices|following section]].\n* [[Derivative|Differentiation]] defines a linear map from the space of all differentiable functions to the space of all functions. It also defines a linear operator on the space of all [[smooth function]]s.\n* The (definite) [[integral]] over some [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] ''I'' is a linear map from the space of all real-valued integrable functions on ''I'' to '''R'''\n* The (indefinite) [[integral]] (or [[antiderivative]]) with a fixed starting point defines a linear map from the space of all real-valued integrable functions on '''R''' to the space of all real-valued, differentiable, functions on '''R'''. Without a fixed starting point, an exercise in group theory will show that the antiderivative maps to the [[quotient space]] of the differentiables over the [[equivalence relation]], \"differ by a constant\", which yields an identity class of the constant valued functions <math>\\textstyle\\left(\\  \\int\\!:\\  I(\\Re) \\to\\  D(\\Re)/\\Re\\  \\right)</math>.\n* If ''V'' and ''W'' are finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field ''F'', then functions that send linear maps {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} to {{nowrap|dim<sub>''F''</sub>(''W'') × dim<sub>''F''</sub>(''V'')}} matrices in the way described in the sequel are themselves linear maps (indeed [[linear isomorphism]]s).\n* The [[expected value]] of a [[Random variable#Definition|random variable]] (which is in fact a function, and as such a member of a vector space) is linear, as for random variables ''X'' and ''Y'' we have {{nowrap|1=E[''X'' + ''Y''] = E[''X''] + E[''Y'']}} and {{nowrap|1=E[''aX''] = ''a''E[''X'']}}, but the [[variance]] of a random variable is not linear.\n\n== Matrices ==\n{{main|Transformation matrix}}\n\nIf ''V'' and ''W'' are [[finite-dimensional]] vector spaces and a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] is defined for each vector space, then every linear map from ''V'' to ''W'' can be represented by a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1976|page=210}}<br> Suppose <math>\\{{\\bf x}_1,\\ldots,{\\bf x}_n\\}</math> and <math>\\{{\\bf y}_1,\\ldots,{\\bf y}_m\\}</math> are bases of vector spaces {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}}, respectively. Then every <math> A \\in L(X,Y)</math> determines a set of numbers <math>a_{i,j}</math> such that<br><math>A{\\bf x}_j = \\sum_{i=1}^m a_{i,j}{\\bf y}_i \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;(1\\leq j\\leq n).</math><br>It is convenient to represent these numbers in a rectangular array of {{mvar|m}} rows and {{mvar|n}} columns, called an {{mvar|m}} ''by'' {{mvar|n}} ''matrix'':<br><math>[A] = \\begin{bmatrix}\n       a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \\ldots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n       a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \\ldots & a_{2,n} \\\\ \n       \\ldots \\ldots&\\ldots\\ldots&\\ldots\\ldots&\\ldots \\\\\n       a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \\ldots & a_{m,n}\n     \\end{bmatrix}</math><br>Observe that the coordinates <math>a_{i,j}</math> of the vector <math>A{\\bf x}_j</math> (with respect to the basis <math>\\{{\\bf y}_1,\\ldots,{\\bf y}_m\\}</math>) appear in the ''j''<sup>th</sup> column of <math>[A]</math>. The vectors <math>A{\\bf x}_j</math> are therefore sometimes called the ''column vectors'' of <math>[A]</math>. With this terminology, the ''range'' of {{mvar|A}} ''is spanned by the column vectors of <math>[A]</math>''.</ref> This is useful because it allows concrete calculations. Matrices yield examples of linear maps: if ''A'' is a real {{nowrap|''m'' × ''n''}} matrix, then {{nowrap|1=''f''('''x''') = ''A'''''x'''}} describes a linear map {{nowrap|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> → '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} (see [[Euclidean space]]).\n\nLet {'''v'''<sub>1</sub>, ..., '''v'''<sub>''n''</sub>} be a basis for ''V''.  Then every vector '''v''' in ''V'' is uniquely determined by the coefficients ''c''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> in the field '''R''':\n\n: <math>c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1+\\cdots+c_n \\mathbf{v}_n.</math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} is a linear map,\n\n: <math>f(c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1+\\cdots+c_n \\mathbf{v}_n)=c_1 f(\\mathbf{v}_1)+\\cdots+c_n f(\\mathbf{v}_n),</math>\n\nwhich implies that the function ''f'' is entirely determined by the vectors ''f''('''v'''<sub>1</sub>), ..., ''f''('''v'''<sub>''n''</sub>). Now let {{nowrap|{'''w'''<sub>1</sub>, ..., '''w'''<sub>''m''</sub>} }} be a basis for ''W''.  Then we can represent each vector ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) as\n\n: <math>f(\\mathbf{v}_j)=a_{1j} \\mathbf{w}_1 + \\cdots + a_{mj} \\mathbf{w}_m.</math>\n\nThus, the function ''f'' is entirely determined by the values of ''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>. If we put these values into an {{nowrap|''m'' × ''n''}} matrix ''M'', then we can conveniently use it to compute the vector output of ''f'' for any vector in ''V''.  To get ''M'', every column ''j'' of ''M'' is a vector\n\n: <math>(a_{1j},...,a_{mj})^\\text{T}</math>\n\ncorresponding to ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) as defined above. To define it more clearly, for some column ''j'' that corresponds to the mapping ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>),\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{M}=\\begin{pmatrix} & & & a_{1j} & &\\\\  & & &.& &\\\\  & *& &.& & *\\\\  & & &.& & \\\\   & & &a_{mj}& &\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere '''M''' is the matrix of ''f''. The symbol ∗ denotes that there are other columns which together with column ''j'' make up a total of ''n'' columns of ''M''. In other words, every column {{nowrap|1=''j'' = 1, ..., ''n''}} has a corresponding vector ''f''('''v'''<sub>''j''</sub>) whose coordinates ''a''<sub>1''j''</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''mj''</sub> are the elements of column ''j''. A single linear map may be represented by many matrices. This is because the values of the elements of a matrix depend on the bases chosen.\n\nThe matrices of a linear transformation can be represented visually:\n\n# Matrix for <math>T</math> relative to <math>B</math>: <math>A</math>\n# Matrix for <math>T</math> relative to <math>B'</math>: <math>A'</math>\n# Transition matrix from <math>B'</math> to <math>B</math>: <math>P</math>\n# Transition matrix from <math>B</math> to <math>B'</math>: <math>P^{-1}</math>\n\n[[File:Linear_transformation_visualization.svg|The relationship between matrices in a linear transformation]]\n\nSuch that starting in the bottom left corner <math>[\\vec v ]_{B'}</math> and looking for the bottom right corner <math>[ T ( \\vec v ) ]_{B'}</math>, one would left-multiply—that is, <math>A'[\\vec v]_{B'} = [T(\\vec v)]_{B'}</math>. The equivalent method would be the \"longer\" method going clockwise from the same point such that <math>[\\vec v]_{B'}</math> is left-multiplied with <math>P^{-1}AP</math>, or <math>P^{-1}AP[\\vec v]_{B'} = [T(\\vec v)]_{B'}</math>.\n\n== Examples of linear transformation matrices ==\nIn two-[[dimension]]al space '''R'''<sup>2</sup> linear maps are described by [[2 × 2 real matrices]]. These are some examples:\n\n* [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] by 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & -1\\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] by angle ''θ'' counterclockwise:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] against the ''x'' axis:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] against the ''y'' axis:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]] by 2 in all directions:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 2\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[shear mapping|horizontal shear mapping]]:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & m\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[squeeze mapping]]:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}k & 0\\\\ 0 & 1/k\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n* [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] onto the ''y'' axis:\n*: <math>\\mathbf{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n== Forming new linear maps from given ones ==\nThe composition of linear maps is linear: if {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} and {{nowrap|''g'' : ''W'' → ''Z''}} are linear, then so is their [[Relation composition|composition]] {{nowrap|''g'' ∘ ''f'' : ''V'' → ''Z''}}. It follows from this that the [[class (set theory)|class]] of all vector spaces over a given field ''K'', together with ''K''-linear maps as [[morphism]]s, forms a [[category (mathematics)|category]].\n\nThe [[inverse function|inverse]] of a linear map, when defined, is again a linear map.\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f''<sub>1</sub> : ''V'' → ''W''}} and {{nowrap|''f''<sub>2</sub> : ''V'' → ''W''}} are linear, then so is their [[pointwise]] sum {{nowrap|''f''<sub>1</sub> + ''f''<sub>2</sub>}} (which is defined by {{nowrap|1=(''f''<sub>1</sub> + ''f''<sub>2</sub>)('''x''') = ''f''<sub>1</sub>('''x''') + ''f''<sub>2</sub>('''x'''))}}.\n\nIf {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} is linear and ''a'' is an element of the ground field ''K'', then the map ''af'', defined by {{nowrap|1=(''af'')('''x''') = ''a''(''f''('''x'''))}}, is also linear.\n\nThus the set {{nowrap|''L''(''V'', ''W'')}} of linear maps from ''V'' to ''W'' itself forms a vector space over ''K'', sometimes denoted {{nowrap|Hom(''V'', ''W'')}}.  Furthermore, in the case that {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''W''}}, this vector space (denoted End(''V'')) is an [[associative algebra]] under [[composition of maps]], since the composition of two linear maps  is again a linear map, and the composition of maps is always associative.  This case is discussed in more detail below.\n\nGiven again the finite-dimensional case, if bases have been chosen, then the composition of linear maps corresponds to the [[matrix multiplication]], the addition of linear maps corresponds to the [[matrix addition]], and the multiplication of linear maps with scalars corresponds to the multiplication of matrices with scalars.\n\n== Endomorphisms and automorphisms ==\n{{main|Endomorphism|Automorphism}}\nA linear transformation ''f'': ''V'' → ''V'' is an [[endomorphism]] of ''V''; the set of all such endomorphisms End(''V'')  together with addition, composition and scalar multiplication as defined above forms an [[associative algebra]] with identity element over the field ''K'' (and in particular a [[ring (algebra)|ring]]). The multiplicative identity element of this algebra is the [[identity function|identity map]] id: ''V'' → ''V''.\n\nAn endomorphism of ''V'' that is also an [[isomorphism]] is called an [[automorphism]] of ''V''. The composition of two automorphisms is again an automorphism, and the set of all automorphisms of ''V'' forms a [[group (math)|group]], the [[automorphism group]] of ''V'' which is denoted by Aut(''V'') or GL(''V''). Since the automorphisms are precisely those [[endomorphisms]] which possess inverses under composition, Aut(''V'') is the group of [[Unit (ring theory)|units]] in the ring End(''V'').\n\nIf ''V'' has finite dimension ''n'', then End(''V'') is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[associative algebra]] of all ''n'' × ''n'' matrices with entries in ''K''. The automorphism group of ''V'' is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the  [[general linear group]] GL(''n'', ''K'') of all ''n'' × ''n'' invertible matrices with entries in ''K''.\n\n== Kernel, image and the rank–nullity theorem ==\n{{main|Kernel (linear operator)|Image (mathematics)|Rank of a matrix}}\nIf ''f'' : ''V'' → ''W'' is linear, we define the [[kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] and the [[image (mathematics)|image]] or [[range (mathematics)|range]] of ''f'' by\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  \\operatorname{\\ker}(f) &= \\{\\,x \\in V: f(x) = 0\\,\\} \\\\\n    \\operatorname{im}(f) &= \\{\\,w \\in W: w = f(x), x \\in V\\,\\}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nker(''f'') is a [[Linear subspace|subspace]] of ''V'' and im(''f'') is a subspace of ''W''.  The following [[dimension]] formula is known as the [[rank–nullity theorem]]:\n\n: <math>\\dim(\\ker( f )) + \\dim(\\operatorname{im}( f )) = \\dim( V ).</math><ref>{{harvnb|Horn|Johnson|2013|loc=0.2.3 Vector spaces associated with a matrix or linear transformation, p. 6}}</ref>\n\nThe number dim(im(''f'')) is also called the ''rank of f'' and written as rank(''f''), or sometimes, ρ(''f''); the number dim(ker(''f'')) is called the ''nullity of f'' and written as null(''f'') or ν(''f''). If ''V'' and ''W'' are finite-dimensional, bases have been chosen and ''f'' is represented by the matrix ''A'', then the rank and nullity of ''f'' are equal to the [[rank of a matrix|rank]] and [[Kernel (matrix)#Subspace properties|nullity]] of the matrix ''A'', respectively.\n\n== Cokernel ==\n{{main|Cokernel}}\n\nA subtler invariant of a linear transformation <math>f: V \\to W</math> is the [[cokernel|''co''kernel]], which is defined as\n\n: <math>\\mathrm{coker}\\,f := W/f(V) = W/\\mathrm{im}(f).</math>\n\nThis is the ''dual'' notion to the kernel: just as the kernel is a ''sub''space of the ''domain,'' the co-kernel is a [[quotient space (linear algebra)|''quotient'' space]] of the ''target.''\nFormally, one has the [[exact sequence]]\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\ker f \\to V \\to W \\to \\mathrm{coker}\\,f \\to 0.</math>\n\nThese can be interpreted thus: given a linear equation ''f''('''v''') = '''w''' to solve,\n\n* the kernel is the space of ''solutions'' to the ''homogeneous'' equation ''f''('''v''') = 0, and its dimension is the number of ''degrees of freedom'' in a solution, if it exists;\n* the co-kernel is the space of ''constraints'' that must be satisfied if the equation is to have a solution, and its dimension is the number of constraints that must be satisfied for the equation to have a solution.\n\nThe dimension of the co-kernel and the dimension of the image (the rank) add up to the dimension of the target space. For finite dimensions, this means that the dimension of the quotient space ''W''/''f''(''V'') is the dimension of the target space minus the dimension of the image.\n\nAs a simple example, consider the map ''f'': '''R'''<sup>2</sup> → '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, given by ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = (0, ''y''). Then for an equation ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = (''a'', ''b'') to have a solution, we must have ''a'' = 0 (one constraint), and in that case the solution space is (''x'', ''b'')  or equivalently stated, (0, ''b'') + (''x'', 0), (one degree of freedom). The kernel may be expressed as the subspace (''x'', 0) < ''V'': the value of ''x'' is the freedom in a solution – while the cokernel may be expressed via the map ''W'' → '''R''', <math> (a,b) \\mapsto (a):</math> given a vector (''a'', ''b''), the value of ''a'' is the ''obstruction'' to there being a solution.\n\nAn example illustrating the infinite-dimensional case is afforded by the map ''f'': '''R'''<sup>∞</sup> → '''R'''<sup>∞</sup>, <math>\\{a_n\\} \\mapsto \\{b_n\\}</math> with ''b''<sub>1</sub> = 0 and ''b''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub> = ''a<sub>n</sub>'' for ''n'' > 0. Its image consists of all sequences with first element 0, and thus its cokernel consists of the classes of sequences with identical first element. Thus, whereas its kernel has dimension 0 (it maps only the zero sequence to the zero sequence), its co-kernel has dimension 1. Since the domain and the target space are the same, the rank and the dimension of the kernel add up to the same [[cardinal number#Cardinal addition|sum]] as the rank and the dimension of the co-kernel ( <math>\\aleph_0 + 0 = \\aleph_0 + 1</math> ), but in the infinite-dimensional case it cannot be inferred that the kernel and the co-kernel of an [[endomorphism]] have the same dimension (0 ≠ 1). The reverse situation obtains for the map ''h'': '''R'''<sup>∞</sup> → '''R'''<sup>∞</sup>, <math>\\{a_n\\} \\mapsto \\{c_n\\}</math> with ''c<sub>n</sub>'' = ''a''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>. Its image is the entire target space, and hence its co-kernel has dimension 0, but since it maps all sequences in which only the first element is non-zero to the zero sequence, its kernel has dimension 1.\n\n=== Index ===\nFor a linear operator with finite-dimensional kernel and co-kernel, one may define  ''index'' as:\n\n: <math>\\mathrm{ind}\\,f := \\dim \\ker f - \\dim \\mathrm{coker}\\,f,</math>\n\nnamely the degrees of freedom minus the number of constraints.\n\nFor a transformation between finite-dimensional vector spaces, this is just the difference dim(''V'') − dim(''W''), by rank–nullity. This gives an indication of how many solutions or how many constraints one has: if mapping from a larger space to a smaller one, the map may be onto, and thus will have degrees of freedom even without constraints. Conversely, if mapping from a smaller space to a larger one, the map cannot be onto, and thus one will have constraints even without degrees of freedom.\n\nThe index of an operator is precisely the [[Euler characteristic]] of the 2-term complex 0 → ''V'' → ''W'' → 0. In [[operator theory]], the index of [[Fredholm]] operators is an object of study, with a major result being the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]].<ref>{{SpringerEOM|title=Index theory|id=Index_theory&oldid=23864|first=Victor|last=Nistor}}: \"The main question in index theory is to provide index formulas for classes of Fredholm operators ... Index theory has become a subject on its own only after M. F. Atiyah and I. Singer published their index theorems\"</ref>\n\n== Algebraic classifications of linear transformations ==\nNo classification of linear maps could hope to be exhaustive. The following incomplete list enumerates some important classifications that do not require any additional structure on the vector space.\n\nLet ''V'' and ''W'' denote vector spaces over a field, ''F''. Let ''T'': ''V'' → ''W'' be a linear map.\n\n* ''T'' is said to be ''[[injective]]'' or a ''[[monomorphism]]'' if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:\n** ''T'' is [[injective|one-to-one]] as a map of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].\n** ker''T'' = {0<sub>''V''</sub>}\n** ''T'' is [[monic morphism|monic]] or left-cancellable, which is to say, for any vector space ''U'' and any pair of linear maps ''R'': ''U'' → ''V'' and ''S'': ''U'' → ''V'', the equation ''TR'' = ''TS'' implies ''R'' = ''S''.\n** ''T'' is [[inverse (ring theory)|left-invertible]], which is to say there exists a linear map ''S'': ''W'' → ''V'' such that ''ST'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] on ''V''.\n* ''T'' is said to be ''[[surjective]]'' or an ''[[epimorphism]]'' if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:\n** ''T'' is [[surjective|onto]] as a map of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].\n** [[cokernel|coker]] ''T'' = {0<sub>''W''</sub>}\n** ''T'' is [[epimorphism|epic]] or right-cancellable, which is to say, for any vector space ''U'' and any pair of linear maps ''R'': ''W'' → ''U'' and ''S'': ''W'' → ''U'', the equation ''RT'' = ''ST'' implies ''R'' = ''S''.\n** ''T'' is [[inverse (ring theory)|right-invertible]], which is to say there exists a linear map ''S'': ''W'' → ''V'' such that ''TS'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] on ''W''.\n* ''T'' is said to be an ''[[isomorphism]]'' if it is both left- and right-invertible. This is equivalent to ''T'' being both one-to-one and onto (a [[bijection]] of sets) or also to ''T'' being both epic and monic, and so being a [[bimorphism]].\n* If ''T'': ''V'' → ''V'' is an endomorphism, then:\n** If, for some positive integer ''n'', the ''n''-th iterate of ''T'', ''T<sup>n</sup>'', is identically zero, then ''T'' is said to be [[nilpotent]].\n** If ''T''<sup>2</sup> = ''T'', then ''T'' is said to be [[idempotent]]\n** If ''T'' = ''kI'', where ''k'' is some scalar, then ''T'' is said to be a scaling transformation or scalar multiplication map; see [[scalar matrix]].\n\n== Change of basis ==\n{{main|Basis (linear algebra)|Change of basis}}\nGiven a linear map which is an [[endomorphism]] whose matrix is ''A'', in the basis ''B'' of the space it transforms vector coordinates [u] as [v] = ''A''[u]. As vectors change with the inverse of ''B'' (vectors are [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]]) its inverse transformation is [v]  = ''B''[v'].\n\nSubstituting this in the first expression\n:<math>B[v'] = AB[u'] </math>\nhence\n:<math>[v'] = B^{-1}AB[u'] = A'[u'].</math>\n\nTherefore, the matrix in the new basis is ''A′'' = ''B''<sup>−1</sup>''AB'', being ''B'' the matrix of the given basis.\n\nTherefore, linear maps are said to be 1-co 1-contra [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|-variant]] objects, or type (1, 1) [[tensor]]s.\n\n== Continuity ==\n{{main|Discontinuous linear map}}\n\nA ''linear transformation'' between [[topological vector space]]s, for example [[normed space]]s, may be [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].  If its domain and codomain are the same, it will then be a [[continuous linear operator]].  A linear operator on a normed linear space is continuous if and only if it is [[bounded operator|bounded]], for example, when the domain is finite-dimensional.<ref>{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=15}}<br>'''1.18 Theorem''' ''Let <math>\\Lambda</math> be a linear functional on a topological vector space {{mvar|X}}. Assume <math>\\Lambda x \\neq 0</math> for some <math>x \\in X</math>. Then each of the following four properties implies the other three:<br>(a) <math>\\Lambda</math> is continuous<br>(b) The null space <math>N(\\Lambda)</math> is closed.<br>(c) <math>N(\\Lambda)</math> is not dense in {{mvar|X}}.<br>(d) <math>\\Lambda</math> is bounded in some neighbourhood {{mvar|V}} of 0.</ref>   An infinite-dimensional domain may have [[discontinuous linear operator]]s.\n\nAn example of an unbounded, hence discontinuous, linear transformation is differentiation on the space of smooth functions equipped with the supremum norm (a function with small values can have a derivative with large values, while the derivative of 0 is 0).  For a specific example, sin(''nx'')/''n'' converges to 0, but its derivative cos(''nx'') does not, so differentiation is not continuous at 0 (and by a variation of this argument, it is not continuous anywhere).\n\n== Applications ==\nA specific application of linear maps is for geometric transformations, such as those performed in [[computer graphics]], where the translation, rotation and scaling of 2D or 3D objects is performed by the use of a [[transformation matrix]]. Linear mappings also are used as a mechanism for describing change: for example in calculus correspond to derivatives; or in relativity, used as a device to keep track of the local transformations of reference frames.\n\nAnother application of these transformations is in [[compiler optimizations]] of nested-loop code, and in [[parallelizing compiler]] techniques.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikibooks|Linear Algebra/Linear Transformations}}\n* [[Affine transformation]]\n* [[Linear equation]]\n* [[Bounded operator]]\n* [[Antilinear map]]\n* [[Semilinear map]]\n* [[Continuous linear operator]]\n* [[Bent function]]\n\n== Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{Cite book | last1=Halmos | first1=Paul R. | author1-link=Paul R.
