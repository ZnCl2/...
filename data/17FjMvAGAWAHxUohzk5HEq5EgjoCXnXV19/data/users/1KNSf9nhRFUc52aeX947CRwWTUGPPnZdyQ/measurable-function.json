            "text": "In [[mathematics]] and in particular [[Mathematical analysis#Measure_theory|measure theory]], a '''measurable function''' is a function between two [[measurable space|measurable spaces]] such that the [[preimage]] of any [[Measure (mathematics)|measurable]] set is measurable, analogously to the definition that a function between [[topological space|topological spaces]] is [[continuous function|continuous]] if the preimage of each [[open set]] is open. In [[real analysis]], measurable functions are used in the definition of the [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integral]]. In [[probability theory]], a measurable function on a [[probability space]] is known as a [[random variable]].\n\n==Formal definition==\nLet <math>(X,\\Sigma)</math> and <math>(Y,\\Tau)</math> be measurable spaces, meaning that <math>X</math> and <math>Y</Math> are sets equipped with respective [[sigma algebra|<math>\\sigma</math>-algebras]] <math>\\Sigma</math> and <math>\\Tau</math>.  A function <math>f:X\\to Y</math> is said to be measurable if the preimage of <math>E</math> under <math>f</math> is in <math>\\Sigma</math> for every <math>E\\in \\Tau</math>; i.e.\n\n:<math> f^{-1}(E) := \\{ x\\in X |\\; f(x) \\in E \\} \\in \\Sigma,\\;\\;  \\forall E \\in \\Tau. </math>\n\nIf <math>f:X\\to Y</math> is a measurable function, we will write\n\n:<math> f \\colon (X, \\Sigma )  \\rightarrow ( Y, \\Tau ). </math>\n\nto emphasize the dependency on the <math>\\sigma</math>-algebras <math>\\Sigma</math> and <math>\\Tau</math>.\n\n==Term usage variations==\nThe choice of <math>\\sigma</math>-algebras in the definition above is sometimes implicit and left up to the context. For example, for <math>{\\mathbb R}</math>, <math>{\\mathbb C}</math>, or other topological space, the [[Borel algebra]] (containing all the open sets) is a common choice. Some authors define '''measurable functions''' as exclusively real-valued ones with respect to the Borel algebra.<ref name=\"strichartz\">{{cite book | last = Strichartz | first = Robert | title = The Way of Analysis | publisher = Jones and Bartlett | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-7637-1497-6}}</ref>\n\nIf the values of the function lie in an [[infinite-dimensional vector space]], other non-equivalent definitions of measurability, such as [[weak measurability]] and [[Bochner measurability]], exist.\n\n== Notable classes of measurable functions ==\n* Random variables are by definition measurable functions defined on probability spaces.\n* If <math>(X,\\Sigma)</math> and <math>(Y,T)</math> are [[Borel set#Standard Borel spaces and Kuratowski theorems|Borel space]]s, a measurable function <math>f:(X,\\Sigma)\\to(Y,T)</math>  is also called a '''Borel function'''. Continuous functions are Borel functions but not all Borel functions are continuous. However, a measurable function is nearly a continuous function; see [[Luzin's theorem]].  If a Borel function happens to be a section of some map <math>Y\\xrightarrow{~\\pi~}X</math>, it is called a '''Borel section'''.\n* A [[Lebesgue measurable]] function is a measurable function <math>f : (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{L}) \\to (\\mathbb{C}, \\mathcal{B}_\\mathbb{C})</math>, where <math>\\mathcal{L}</math> is the <math>\\sigma</math>-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets, and <math>\\mathcal{B}_\\mathbb{C}</math> is the [[Borel algebra]] on the [[complex number]]s <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>.  Lebesgue measurable functions are of interest in [[mathematical analysis]] because they can be integrated. In the case <math>f:X\\to\\mathbb{R}</math>, <math>f</math> is Lebesgue measurable iff <math>\\{f>\\alpha\\}=\\{x\\in X:f(x)>\\alpha\\}</math> is measurable for all <math>\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}</math>. This is also equivalent to any of <math>\\{f\\ge\\alpha\\},\\{f<\\alpha\\},\\{f\\le\\alpha\\}</math> being measurable for all <math>\\alpha</math>. Continuous functions, monotone functions, step functions, semicontinuous functions, Riemann-integrable functions, and functions of bounded variation are all Lebesgue measurable.<ref name=\"carothers\">{{cite book | last = Carothers | first = N.

Indeed, two Lebesgue-measurable functions may be constructed in such a way as to make their composition non-Lebesgue-measurable.\n* The (pointwise) [[supremum]], [[infimum]], [[limit superior]], and [[limit inferior]] of a sequence (viz., countably many) of real-valued measurable functions are all measurable as well.<ref name=\"strichartz\" /><ref name=\"royden\">{{cite book | last = Royden | first = H.

Note that the corresponding statement for continuous functions requires stronger conditions than pointwise convergence, such as uniform convergence.<ref name=\"dudley\">{{cite book | last = Dudley | first = R.

If <math>(X,\\Sigma)</math> is some measurable space and <math>A\\subset X</math> is a non-measurable set, i.e. if <math>A\\notin\\Sigma</math>, then the [[indicator function]] <math>\\mathbf{1}_A:(X,\\Sigma)\\to\\mathbb{R}</math> is non-measurable (where <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> is equipped with the [[Borel algebra]] as usual), since the preimage of the measurable set <math>\\{1\\}</math> is the non-measurable set <math>A</math>.  Here <math>\\mathbf{1}_A</math> is given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{1}_A(x) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{ if } x \\in A; \\\\\n0 & \\text{ otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\n* Any non-constant function can be made non-measurable by equipping the domain and range with appropriate <math>\\sigma</math>-algebras.  If <math>f:X\\to\\mathbb{R}</math> is an arbitrary non-constant, real-valued function, then <math>f</math> is non-measurable if <math>X</math> is equipped with the trivial <math>\\sigma</math>-algebra <math>\\Sigma=\\{\\emptyset,X\\}</math>, since the preimage of any point in the range is some proper, nonempty subset of <math>X</math>, and therefore does not lie in <math>\\Sigma</math>.\n\n==See also==\n*Vector spaces of measurable functions: the [[Lp space|<math>L^p</math> spaces]]\n*[[Measure-preserving dynamical system]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Measurable_function Measurable function] at [http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/ Encyclopedia of Mathematics]\n* [http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Borel_function Borel function] at [http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/ Encyclopedia of Mathematics]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Measurable Function}}\n[[Category:Measure theory]]\n[[Category:Types of functions]]",
