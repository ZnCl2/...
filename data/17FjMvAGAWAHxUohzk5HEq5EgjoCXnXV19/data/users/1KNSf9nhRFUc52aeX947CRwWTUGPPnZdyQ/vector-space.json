Below, '''w''' is stretched by a factor of 2, yielding the sum {{math|'''v''' + 2'''w'''}}.]]\n\nA '''vector space''' (also called a '''linear space''') is a collection of objects called '''vectors''', which may be [[Vector addition|added]] together and [[Scalar multiplication|multiplied]] (\"scaled\") by numbers, called ''[[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]]''. Scalars are often taken to be [[real number]]s, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by [[complex number]]s, [[rational number]]s, or generally any [[field (mathematics)|field]]. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called ''[[axiom]]s'', listed [[#Definition|below]].\n\n[[Euclidean vector]]s are an example of a vector space.  They represent [[physics|physical]] quantities such as [[force]]s: any two forces (of the same type) can be added to yield a third, and the multiplication of a [[force vector]] by a real multiplier is another force vector. In the same vein, but in a more [[geometry|geometric]] sense, vectors representing displacements in the plane or in [[three-dimensional space]] also form vector spaces. Vectors in vector spaces do not necessarily have to be arrow-like objects as they appear in the mentioned examples: vectors are regarded as abstract mathematical objects with particular properties, which in some cases can be visualized as arrows.\n\nVector spaces are the subject of [[linear algebra]] and are well characterized by their [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]], which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in [[mathematical analysis]], as [[function space]]s, whose vectors are [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a [[topology]], allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and [[continuous function|continuity]]. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] or [[inner product]] are more commonly used, as having a notion of [[metric (mathematics)|distance]] between two vectors. This is particularly the case of [[Banach space]]s and [[Hilbert space]]s, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.\n\nHistorically, the first ideas leading to vector spaces can be traced back as far as the 17th century's [[analytic geometry]], [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], systems of [[linear equation]]s, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by [[Giuseppe Peano]] in 1888, encompasses more general objects than [[Euclidean space]], but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s and their higher-dimensional analogs.\n\nToday, vector spaces are applied throughout [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[engineering]]. They are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion to deal with [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]]. They offer a framework for [[Fourier series|Fourier expansion]], which is employed in [[image compression]] routines, and they provide an environment that can be used for solution techniques for [[partial differential equation]]s. Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, [[coordinate-free]] way of dealing with geometrical and physical objects such as [[tensor]]s. This in turn allows the examination of local properties of [[manifold (mathematics)|manifolds]] by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and [[abstract algebra]].\n\n{{Algebraic structures |Module}}\n\n== Introduction and definition ==\nThe concept of vector space will first be explained by describing two particular examples:\n\n===First example: arrows in the plane===\nThe first example of a vector space consists of [[arrow]]s in a fixed [[plane (geometry)|plane]], starting at one fixed point. This is used in physics to describe [[force]]s or [[velocity|velocities]]. Given any two such arrows, {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}}, the [[parallelogram]] spanned by these two arrows contains one diagonal arrow that starts at the origin, too. This new arrow is called the ''sum'' of the two arrows and is denoted {{math|'''v''' + '''w'''}}. In the special case of two arrows on the same line, their sum is the arrow on this line whose length is the sum or the difference of the lengths, depending on whether the arrows have the same direction. Another operation that can be done with arrows is scaling: given any positive [[real number]] {{math|''a''}}, the arrow that has the same direction as {{math|'''v'''}}, but is dilated or shrunk by multiplying its length by {{math|''a''}}, is called ''multiplication'' of {{math|'''v'''}} by {{math|''a''}}. It is denoted {{math|''a'''''v'''}}. When {{math|''a''}} is negative, {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is defined as the arrow pointing in the opposite direction, instead.\n\nThe following shows a few examples: if {{math|1=''a'' = 2}}, the resulting vector {{math|''a'''''w'''}} has the same direction as {{math|'''w'''}}, but is stretched to the double length of {{math|'''w'''}} (right image below). Equivalently, {{math|2'''w'''}} is the sum {{math|'''w''' + '''w'''}}. Moreover, {{math|1=(−1)'''v''' = −'''v'''}} has the opposite direction and the same length as {{math|'''v'''}} (blue vector pointing down in the right image).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n|width=50%|[[File:Vector addition3.svg|180px|Vector addition: the sum {{math|'''v''' + '''w'''}} (black) of the vectors {{math|'''v'''}} (blue) and {{math|'''w'''}} (red) is shown.]]\n|width=50%|[[File:Scalar multiplication.svg|230px|Scalar multiplication: the multiples {{math|−'''v'''}} and {{math|2'''w'''}} are shown.]]\n|}\n\n===Second example: ordered pairs of numbers===\nA second key example of a vector space is provided by pairs of real numbers {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}. (The order of the components {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} is significant, so such a pair is also called an [[ordered pair]].) Such a pair is written as {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}}. The sum of two such pairs and multiplication of a pair with a number is defined as follows:\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} + {{math|(''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub>)}} {{math|1== (''x''<sub>1</sub> + ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub> + ''y''<sub>2</sub>)}}\nand \n:{{math|1=''a''&thinsp;(''x'', ''y'') = (''ax'', ''ay'')}}.\n\nThe first example above reduces to this one if the arrows are represented by the pair of [[Cartesian coordinates]] of their end points.\n\n===Definition===\nIn this article, vectors are represented in boldface to distinguish them from scalars.<ref group=nb>It is also common, especially in physics, to denote vectors with an arrow on top: {{math|{{vec|''v''}}}}.</ref>\n\nA vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|F}} is a [[set (mathematics)|set]]&nbsp;{{mvar|V}} together with two operations that satisfy the eight axioms listed below.\n\n* The first operation, called '''vector addition''' or simply '''addition''' {{math| + : ''V'' × ''V'' → ''V''}}, takes any two vectors&nbsp;{{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} and assigns to them a third vector which is commonly written as {{math|'''v''' + '''w'''}}, and called the sum of these two vectors. (Note that the resultant vector is also an element of the set {{mvar|V}} ). \n* The second operation, called '''[[scalar multiplication]]''' {{math| · : ''F'' × ''V'' → ''V''}}， takes any scalar&nbsp;{{mvar|a}} and any vector&nbsp;{{math|'''v'''}} and gives another vector&nbsp;{{math|''a'''''v'''}}. (Similarly, the vector {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is an element of the set {{mvar|V}} ).\n\nElements of {{mvar|V}} are commonly called ''vectors''. Elements of&nbsp;{{mvar|F}} are commonly called ''scalars''.\n\nIn the two examples above, the field is the field of the real numbers and the set of the vectors consists of the planar arrows with fixed starting point and of pairs of real numbers, respectively.\n\nTo qualify as a vector space, the set&nbsp;{{mvar|V}} and the operations of addition and multiplication must adhere to a number of requirements called [[axiom]]s.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 27}}</ref> In the list below, let {{math|'''u'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} be arbitrary vectors in {{mvar|V}}, and {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} scalars in {{mvar|F}}.\n\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They do not assert the associativity of either operation. More formally, scalar multiplication is a [[group action]] of the multiplicative group of the field {{mvar|F}} on the vector space {{mvar|V}}.</ref>\n|- style=\"background:#F8F4FF;\"\n| Identity element of scalar multiplication ||  {{math|1=1'''v''' = '''v'''}}, where {{math|1}} denotes the [[multiplicative identity]] in {{mvar|F}}.\n|-\n| [[Distributivity]] of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition&emsp;&emsp;|| {{math|1=''a''('''u''' + '''v''') = ''a'''''u''' + ''a'''''v'''}}\n|- style=\"background:#F8F4FF;\"\n| Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition || {{math|1=(''a'' + ''b'')'''v''' = ''a'''''v''' + ''b'''''v'''}}\n|}\n\nThese axioms generalize properties of the vectors introduced in the above examples. Indeed, the result of addition of two ordered pairs (as in the second example above) does not depend on the order of the summands:\n:{{math|1=(''x''<sub>'''v'''</sub>, ''y''<sub>'''v'''</sub>) + (''x''<sub>'''w'''</sub>, ''y''<sub>'''w'''</sub>) = (''x''<sub>'''w'''</sub>, ''y''<sub>'''w'''</sub>) + (''x''<sub>'''v'''</sub>, ''y''<sub>'''v'''</sub>)}}.\nLikewise, in the geometric example of vectors as arrows, {{math|1='''v''' + '''w''' = '''w''' + '''v'''}} since the parallelogram defining the sum of the vectors is independent of the order of the vectors. All other axioms can be checked in a similar manner in both examples. Thus, by disregarding the concrete nature of the particular type of vectors, the definition incorporates these two and many more examples in one notion of vector space.\n\nSubtraction of two vectors and division by a (non-zero) scalar can be defined as\n:{{math|1='''v''' − '''w''' = '''v''' + (−'''w''')}},\n:{{math|1='''v'''/''a'' = (1/''a'')'''v'''}}.\n\nWhen the scalar field {{mvar|F}} is the [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, the vector space is called a ''real vector space''. When the scalar field is the [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}}, the vector space is called a ''complex vector space''. These two cases are the ones used most often in engineering. The general definition of a vector space allows scalars to be elements of any fixed [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|F}}. The notion is then known as an {{mvar|F}}-''vector spaces'' or a ''vector space over {{mvar|F}}''. A field is, essentially, a set of numbers possessing [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] operations.<ref group=nb>Some authors (such as {{Harvard citations|last = Brown|year = 1991|nb=yes}}) restrict attention to the fields {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}}, but most of the theory is unchanged for an arbitrary field.</ref> For example, [[rational number]]s form a field.\n\nIn contrast to the intuition stemming from vectors in the plane and higher-dimensional cases, there is, in general vector spaces, no notion of [[neighborhood (topology)|nearness]], [[angle]]s or [[distance]]s. To deal with such matters, particular types of vector spaces are introduced; see [[#Vector spaces with additional structure|below]].\n\n===Alternative formulations and elementary consequences===\nVector addition and scalar multiplication are operations, satisfying the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] property:  {{math|'''u''' + '''v'''}} and {{math|''a'''''v'''}} are in {{math|''V''}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, and {{math|'''u'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}} in {{math|''V''}}. Some older sources mention these properties as separate axioms.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = van der Waerden|year = 1993|nb = yes|loc=Ch. 19}}</ref>\n\nIn the parlance of [[abstract algebra]], the first four axioms are equivalent to requiring the set of vectors to be an [[abelian group]] under addition. The remaining axioms give this group an {{math|''F''}}-[[Module (mathematics)|module]] structure. In other words, there is a [[ring homomorphism]] {{math|''f''}} from the field {{math|''F''}} into the [[endomorphism ring]] of the group of vectors. Then scalar multiplication {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is defined as {{math|(''f''(''a''))('''v''')}}.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last=Bourbaki|year=1998|nb=yes|loc=§II.1.1}}. Bourbaki calls the group homomorphisms {{math|''f''(''a'')}} ''homotheties''.</ref>\n\nThere are a number of direct consequences of the vector space axioms. Some of them derive from [[elementary group theory]], applied to the additive group of vectors: for example the zero vector {{math|'''0'''}} of {{math|''V''}} and the additive inverse {{math|−'''v'''}} of any vector {{math|'''v'''}} are unique. Other properties follow from the distributive law, for example {{math|''a'''''v'''}} equals {{math|'''0'''}} if and only if {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|0}} or {{math|'''v'''}} equals {{math|'''0'''}}.\n\n==History==\nVector spaces stem from [[affine geometry]] via the introduction of [[coordinate]]s in the plane or three-dimensional space. Around 1636, [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] founded [[analytic geometry]] by equating solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane [[curve]].<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1969|nb = yes|loc = ch. \"Algèbre linéaire et algèbre multilinéaire\", pp. 78–91}}</ref> In 1804, to achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, [[Bernard Bolzano|Bolzano]] introduced certain operations on points, lines and planes, which are predecessors of vectors.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Bolzano|year = 1804|nb = yes}}</ref> His work was then used in the conception of [[Barycentric coordinate system (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] by [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] in 1827.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Möbius|year = 1827|nb = yes}}</ref> In 1828 [[C. V. Mourey]] suggested the existence of an algebra surpassing not only ordinary algebra but also two-dimensional algebra created by him searching a geometrical interpretation of complex numbers.<ref>{{Citation |title=A History of Vector Analysis: The Evolution of the Idea of a Vectorial System |last1=Crowe |first1=Michel J. |year=1994 |publisher=Dover |isbn= 0-486-67910-1 |page=11 and 16}}</ref>\n\nThe definition of vectors was founded on [[Giusto Bellavitis|Bellavitis]]' notion of the bipoint, an oriented segment of which one end is the origin and the other a target, then further elaborated with the presentation of [[complex number]]s by [[Jean-Robert Argand|Argand]] and [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] and the introduction of [[quaternion]]s and [[biquaternion]]s by the latter.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Hamilton|year = 1853|nb = yes}}</ref> They are elements in {{math|'''R'''<sup>2</sup>}}, {{math|'''R'''<sup>4</sup>}}, and {{math|'''R'''<sup>8</sup>}}; their treatment as [[linear combination]]s can be traced back to [[Edmond Laguerre|Laguerre]] in 1867, who also defined [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]].\n\nIn 1857, [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] introduced [[matrix notation]], which allows for a harmonization and simplification of [[linear map]]s. Around the same time, [[Hermann Grassmann|Grassmann]] studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Grassmann|year = 1844|nb = yes}}</ref> In his work, the concepts of [[linear independence]] and [[dimension]], as well as [[scalar product]]s, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work extended a vector space of ''n'' dimensions to one of 2<sup>n</sup> dimensions by consideration of 2-vectors <math>u \\wedge v</math> and 3-vectors <math>u \\wedge v \\wedge w</math> called [[multivector]]s. This extension, called [[multilinear algebra]], is governed by the rules of [[exterior algebra]]. [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] was the first to give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Peano|year = 1888|nb = yes |loc = ch. IX}}</ref>\n\nAn important development of vector spaces is due to the construction of [[function space]]s by [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]]. This was later formalized by [[Stefan Banach|Banach]] and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], around 1920.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Banach|year = 1922|nb = yes}}</ref> At that time, [[algebra]] and the new field of [[functional analysis]] began to interact, notably with key concepts such as [[Lp space|spaces of ''p''-integrable functions]] and [[Hilbert space]]s.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Dorier|year = 1995|nb = yes}}, {{Harvard citations|last = Moore|year = 1995|nb = yes}}</ref> Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.\n\n== Examples ==\n{{main|Examples of vector spaces}}\n\n===Coordinate spaces===\n{{Main|Coordinate space}}\nThe simplest example of a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} is the field itself, equipped with its standard addition and multiplication. More generally, a vector space can be composed of\n[[tuple|''n''-tuples]] (sequences of length {{math|''n''}}) of elements of {{math|''F''}}, such as\n:{{math|(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, where each {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is an element of {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. I.1|nb = yes}}</ref>\nA vector space composed of all the {{math|''n''}}-tuples of a field {{math|''F''}} is known as a ''[[coordinate space]]'', usually denoted {{math|''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. The case {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} is the above-mentioned simplest example, in which the field {{math|''F''}} is also regarded as a vector space over itself. The case {{math|1=''F'' = '''R'''}} and {{math|1=''n'' = 2}} was discussed in the introduction above.\n\n===Complex numbers and other field extensions===\nThe set of [[complex numbers]] {{math|'''C'''}}, i.e., numbers that can be written in the form {{math|1=''x'' + ''iy''}} for [[real numbers]] {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} where {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], form a vector space over the reals with the usual addition and multiplication: {{math|1=(''x'' + ''iy'') + (''a'' + ''ib'') = (''x'' + ''a'') + ''i''(''y'' + ''b'')}} and {{math|1=''c'' ⋅ (''x'' + ''iy'') = (''c'' ⋅ ''x'') + ''i''(''c'' ⋅ ''y'')}} for real numbers {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}}.  The various axioms of a vector space follow from the fact that the same rules hold for complex number arithmetic.\n\nIn fact, the example of complex numbers is essentially the same (i.e., it is ''isomorphic'') to the vector space of ordered pairs of real numbers mentioned above: if we think of the complex number {{math|''x'' + ''i'' ''y''}} as representing the ordered pair {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} in the [[complex plane]] then we see that the rules for sum and scalar product correspond exactly to those in the earlier example.\n\nMore generally, [[field extension]]s provide another class of examples of vector spaces, particularly in algebra and [[algebraic number theory]]: a field {{math|''F''}} containing a [[Field extension|smaller field]] {{math|''E''}} is an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, by the given multiplication and addition operations of {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year =2002|loc = ch. V.1|nb = yes}}</ref> For example, the complex numbers are a vector space over {{math|'''R'''}}, and the field extension <math>\\mathbf{Q}(i\\sqrt{5})</math> is a vector space over {{math|'''Q'''}}.  <!--A particularly interesting type of field extension in [[number theory]] is {{math|'''Q'''(''α'')}}, the extension of the rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} by a fixed complex number {{math|''α''}}. {{math|'''Q'''(''α'')}} is the smallest field containing the rationals and a fixed complex number ''α''. Its dimension as a vector space over {{math|'''Q'''}} depends on the choice of {{math|''α''}}.-->\n\n===Function spaces===\n{{Main|Function space}}\nFunctions from any fixed set {{math|Ω}} to a field {{math|''F''}} also form vector spaces, by performing addition and scalar multiplication pointwise. That is, the sum of two functions {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} is the function {{math|(''f'' + ''g'')}} given by\n:{{math|1=(''f'' + ''g'')(''w'') = ''f''(''w'') + ''g''(''w'')}},\nand similarly for multiplication. Such function spaces occur in many geometric situations, when {{math|Ω}} is the [[real line]] or an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], or other [[subset]]s of {{math|'''R'''}}. Many notions in topology and analysis, such as [[continuous function|continuity]], [[integral|integrability]] or [[differentiability]] are well-behaved with respect to linearity: sums and scalar multiples of functions possessing such a property still have that property.<ref>e.g. {{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc = ch. XII.3., p. 335|nb = yes}}</ref>  Therefore, the set of such functions are vector spaces. They are studied in greater detail using the methods of [[functional analysis]], see [[#labelFunctionalAnalysis|below]]. Algebraic constraints also yield vector spaces: the <cite id=labelPolynomialRing>[[polynomial ring|vector space {{math|''F''[x]}}]]</cite> is given by [[polynomial function]]s:\n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''r''<sub>0</sub> + ''r''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ... + ''r''<sub>''n''−1</sub>''x''<sup>''n''−1</sup> + ''r''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, where the [[coefficient]]s {{math|''r''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''r''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are in {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. IX.1|nb = yes}}</ref>\n\n===Linear equations===\n{{Main|Linear equation|Linear differential equation|Systems of linear equations}}\nSystems of [[homogeneous linear equation]]s are closely tied to vector spaces.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. VI.3.|nb = yes}}</ref> For example, the solutions of \n:{|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|{{math|''a''}}\n|{{math|+}}\n|{{math|3''b''}}\n|{{math|+}}\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|{{math|''c''}}\n|{{math|{{=}} 0}}\n|-\n|{{math|4''a''}}\n|{{math|+}}\n|{{math|2''b''}}\n|{{math|+}}\n|{{math|2''c''}}\n|{{math|{{=}} 0}}\n|}\nare given by triples with arbitrary {{math|''a''}}, {{math|1=''b'' = ''a''/2}}, and {{math|1=''c'' = −5''a''/2}}. They form a vector space: sums and scalar multiples of such triples still satisfy the same ratios of the three variables; thus they are solutions, too. [[matrix (mathematics)|Matrices]] can be used to condense multiple linear equations as above into one vector equation, namely\n:<cite id=equation3>{{math|1=''A'''''x''' = '''0'''}}</cite>,\nwhere {{math|1=''A'' =}} <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n4 & 2 & 2\\end{bmatrix}</math> is the matrix containing the coefficients of the given equations, {{math|'''x'''}} is the vector {{math|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}}, {{math|''A'''''x'''}} denotes the [[matrix product]], and {{math|1='''0''' = (0, 0)}} is the zero vector. In a similar vein, the solutions of homogeneous ''linear differential equations'' form vector spaces. For example,\n:<cite id=equation1>{{math|1=''f''′′(''x'') + 2''f''′(''x'') + ''f''(''x'') = 0}}</cite>\nyields {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''a&thinsp;e''<sup>−''x''</sup> + ''bx&thinsp;e''<sup>−''x''</sup>}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary constants, and {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} is the [[natural exponential function]].\n\n== Basis and dimension ==\n{{Main|basis (linear algebra)|l1=Basis|dimension (linear algebra)|l2=Dimension}}\n[[File:Vector components and base change.svg|A vector {{math|'''v'''}} in {{math|'''R'''<sup>2</sup>}} (blue) expressed in terms of different bases: using the [[standard basis]] of {{math|1='''R'''<sup>2</sup> '''v''' = ''x'''''e'''<sub>1</sub> + ''y'''''e'''<sub>2</sub>}} (black), and using a different, non-[[orthogonal vector|orthogonal]] basis: {{math|1='''v''' = '''f'''<sub>1</sub> + '''f'''<sub>2</sub>}} (red).|thumb|200px]]\n<cite id=label1>''Bases''</cite> allow one to represent vectors by a [[sequence]] of scalars called ''coordinates'' or ''components''. A basis is a (finite or infinite) set {{math|1=''B'' = {'''b'''<sub>''i''</sub>}<sub>''i'' ∈ ''I''</sub>}} of vectors {{math|'''b'''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, for convenience often indexed by some [[index set]] {{math|''I''}}, that spans the whole space and is [[linearly independent]]. \"Spanning the whole space\" means that any vector {{math|'''v'''}} can be expressed as a finite sum (called a ''[[linear combination]]'') of the basis elements:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\mathbf{v} = a_1 \\mathbf{b}_{i_1} + a_2 \\mathbf{b}_{i_2} + \\cdots + a_n \\mathbf{b}_{i_n},</math>|{{EquationNote|1}}}}\nwhere the {{math|''a''<sub>''k''</sub>}} are scalars, called the coordinates (or the components) of the vector {{math|'''v'''}} with respect to the basis {{math|''B''}}, and {{math|'''b'''<sub>''i''<sub>''k''</sub></sub>}} {{math|1=(''k'' = 1, ..., ''n'')}} elements of {{math|''B''}}. Linear independence means that the coordinates {{math|''a''<sub>''k''</sub>}} are uniquely determined for any vector in the vector space.\n\nFor example, the [[coordinate vector]]s {{math|1='''e'''<sub>1</sub> = (1, 0, ..., 0)}}, {{math|1='''e'''<sub>2</sub> = (0, 1, 0, ..., 0)}}, to {{math|1='''e'''<sub>''n''</sub> = (0, 0, ..., 0, 1)}}, form a basis of {{math|''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, called the [[standard basis]], since any vector {{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these vectors:\n:{{math|1=(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) = ''x''<sub>1</sub>(1, 0, ..., 0) + ''x''<sub>2</sub>(0, 1, 0, ..., 0) + ... + ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>(0, ..., 0, 1) = ''x''<sub>1</sub>'''e'''<sub>1</sub> + ''x''<sub>2</sub>'''e'''<sub>2</sub> + ... + ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>'''e'''<sub>''n''</sub>}}.\nThe corresponding coordinates {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{math|...}}, {{math|''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are just the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the vector.\n\nEvery vector space has a basis.

The dimension (or [[degree of a field extension|degree]]) of the field extension {{math|'''Q'''(α)}} over {{math|'''Q'''}} depends on {{math|α}}.

Another way to express this is that any vector space is ''completely classified'' ([[up to]] isomorphism) by its dimension, a single number. In particular, any ''n''-dimensional {{math|''F''}}-vector space {{math|''V''}} is isomorphic to {{math|''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.

The kernel of this map is the subspace of vectors '''x''' such that {{math|1=''A'''''x''' = 0}}, which is precisely the set of solutions to the system of homogeneous linear equations belonging to ''A''. This concept also extends to linear differential equations\n:<math>a_0 f + a_1 \\frac{d f}{d x} + a_2 \\frac{d^2 f}{d x^2} + \\cdots + a_n \\frac{d^n f}{d x^n} = 0</math>, where the coefficients ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> are functions in ''x'', too.\nIn the corresponding map\n:<math>f \\mapsto D(f) = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i \\frac{d^i f}{d x^i}</math>,\nthe [[derivative]]s of the function ''f'' appear linearly (as opposed to ''f''′′(''x'')<sup>2</sup>, for example).

In particular, the solutions to the differential equation {{math|1=''D''(''f'') = 0}} form a vector space (over {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}}).\n\n===Direct product and direct sum===\n{{Main|Direct product|Direct sum of modules}}\nThe ''direct product'' of vector spaces and the ''direct sum'' of vector spaces are two ways of combining an indexed family of vector spaces into a new vector space.\n\nThe ''direct product''<!--explain direct--> <math>\\textstyle{\\prod_{i \\in I} V_i}</math> of a family of vector spaces ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> consists of the set of all tuples ({{math|'''v'''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sub>''i'' ∈ ''I''</sub>}}, which specify for each index ''i'' in some [[index set]] ''I'' an element '''v'''<sub>''i''</sub> of ''V''<sub>''i''</sub>.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, pp. 31–32}}</ref> Addition and scalar multiplication is performed componentwise.

A map {{math|''g'' : [[Cartesian product|''V'' × ''W'']] → ''X''}} is called [[bilinear map|bilinear]] if ''g'' is linear in both variables '''v''' and '''w'''.  That is to say, for fixed '''w''' the map {{math|'''v''' ↦ ''g''('''v''', '''w''')}} is linear in the sense above and likewise for fixed '''v'''.\n\nThe tensor product is a particular vector space that is a ''universal'' recipient of bilinear maps ''g'', as follows.

However, vector spaces ''per se'' do not offer a framework to deal with the question—crucial to analysis—whether a sequence of functions [[Limit of a sequence|converges]] to another function.

For example, the ''f''<sub>''i''</sub> could be (real or complex) functions belonging to some [[function space]] ''V'', in which case the series is a [[function series]]. The [[modes of convergence|mode of convergence]] of the series depends on the topology imposed on the function space.

Roughly, a vector space is complete provided that it contains all necessary limits. For example, the vector space of polynomials on the unit interval [0,1], equipped with the [[topology of uniform convergence]] is not complete because any continuous function on [0,1] can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials, by the [[Weierstrass approximation theorem]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kreyszig|1989|loc=§4.11-5}}</ref>  In contrast, the space of ''all'' continuous functions on [0,1] with the same topology is complete.<ref>{{harvnb|Kreyszig|1989|loc=§1.5-5}}</ref> A norm gives rise to a topology by defining that a sequence of vectors '''v'''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to '''v''' if and only if\n:<math>\\text{lim}_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} |\\mathbf v_n - \\mathbf v| = 0.</math>\nBanach and Hilbert spaces are complete topological vector spaces whose topologies are given, respectively, by a norm and an inner product. Their study—a key piece of [[functional analysis]]—focusses on infinite-dimensional vector spaces, since all norms on finite-dimensional topological vector spaces give rise to the same notion of convergence.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last =Choquet|year = 1966|nb = yes|loc=Proposition III.7.2}}</ref> The image at the right shows the equivalence of the 1-norm and ∞-norm on '''R'''<sup>2</sup>: as the unit \"balls\" enclose each other, a sequence converges to zero in one norm if and only if it so does in the other norm. In the infinite-dimensional case, however, there will generally be inequivalent topologies, which makes the study of topological vector spaces richer than that of vector spaces without additional data.\n\nFrom a conceptual point of view, all notions related to topological vector spaces should match the topology. For example, instead of considering all linear maps (also called [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s) {{math|''V'' → ''W''}}, maps between topological vector spaces are required to be continuous.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=p. 34–36}}</ref> In particular, the <cite id=label2>(topological) dual space {{math|''V''<sup>∗</sup>}}</cite> consists of continuous functionals {{math|''V'' → '''R'''}} (or to {{math|'''C'''}}).

For example, [[Green's function]]s and [[fundamental solution]]s are usually distributions rather than proper functions, and can then be used to find solutions of the equation with prescribed boundary conditions.

It is, however, different from the [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] {{math|''S''<sup>1</sup> × '''R'''}}, because the latter is [[orientable manifold|orientable]] whereas the former is not.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Kreyszig|year = 1991|nb = yes|loc=§34, p. 108}}</ref>\n\nProperties of certain vector bundles provide information about the underlying topological space. For example, the [[tangent bundle]] consists of the collection of [[tangent space]]s parametrized by the points of a differentiable manifold. The tangent bundle of the circle ''S''<sup>1</sup> is globally isomorphic to {{math|''S''<sup>1</sup> × '''R'''}}, since there is a global nonzero [[vector field]] on ''S''<sup>1</sup>.<ref group=nb>A line bundle, such as the tangent bundle of ''S''<sup>1</sup> is trivial if and only if there is a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] that vanishes nowhere, see {{Harvard citations|last = Husemoller|year = 1994|nb = yes|loc=Corollary 8.3}}. The sections of the tangent bundle are just [[vector field]]s.</ref> In contrast, by the [[hairy ball theorem]], there is no (tangent) vector field on the [[2-sphere]] ''S''<sup>2</sup> which is everywhere nonzero.<ref>{{harvard citations|last1=Eisenberg|last2=Guy|year=1979|nb=yes}}</ref> [[K-theory]] studies the isomorphism classes of all vector bundles over some topological space.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Atiyah|year = 1989|nb = yes}}</ref> In addition to deepening topological and geometrical insight, it has purely algebraic consequences, such as the classification of finite-dimensional real [[division algebra]]s: '''R''', '''C''', the [[quaternion]]s '''H''' and the [[octonion]]s '''O'''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nThe [[cotangent bundle]] of a differentiable manifold consists, at every point of the manifold, of the dual of the tangent space, the [[cotangent space]]. [[Section (fiber bundle)|Sections]] of that bundle are known as [[differential form|differential one-form]]s.\n\n===Modules===\n{{Main|Module (mathematics)|l1=Module}}\n''Modules'' are to [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] what vector spaces are to fields: the same axioms, applied to a ring ''R'' instead of a field ''F'', yield modules.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Artin|year = 1991|nb = yes|loc=ch. 12}}</ref> The theory of modules, compared to that of vector spaces, is complicated by the presence of ring elements that do not have [[multiplicative inverse]]s. For example, modules need not have bases, as the '''Z'''-module (i.e., [[abelian group]]) [[Modular arithmetic|'''Z'''/2'''Z''']] shows; those modules that do (including all vector spaces) are known as [[free module]]s. Nevertheless, a vector space can be compactly defined as a [[Module (mathematics)|module]] over a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] which is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] with the elements being called vectors.  Some authors use the term ''vector space'' to mean modules over a [[division ring]].<ref>Grillet, Pierre Antoine. Abstract algebra. Vol. 242. Springer Science & Business Media, 2007.</ref>  The algebro-geometric interpretation of commutative rings via their [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] allows the development of concepts such as [[locally free module]]s, the algebraic counterpart to vector bundles.\n\n===Affine and projective spaces===\n{{Main|Affine space|Projective space}}\n[[Image:Affine subspace.svg|thumb|right|200px|An [[affine space|affine plane]] (light blue) in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.

Below, '''w''' is stretched by a factor of 2, yielding the sum {{math|'''v''' + 2'''w'''}}.]]\n\nA '''vector space''' (also called a '''linear space''') is a collection of objects called '''vectors''', which may be [[Vector addition|added]] together and [[Scalar multiplication|multiplied]] (\"scaled\") by numbers, called ''[[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]]''. Scalars are often taken to be [[real number]]s, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by [[complex number]]s, [[rational number]]s, or generally any [[field (mathematics)|field]]. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called ''[[axiom]]s'', listed [[#Definition|below]].\n\n[[Euclidean vector]]s are an example of a vector space.  They represent [[physics|physical]] quantities such as [[force]]s: any two forces (of the same type) can be added to yield a third, and the multiplication of a [[force vector]] by a real multiplier is another force vector. In the same vein, but in a more [[geometry|geometric]] sense, vectors representing displacements in the plane or in [[three-dimensional space]] also form vector spaces. Vectors in vector spaces do not necessarily have to be arrow-like objects as they appear in the mentioned examples: vectors are regarded as abstract mathematical objects with particular properties, which in some cases can be visualized as arrows.\n\nVector spaces are the subject of [[linear algebra]] and are well characterized by their [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]], which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in [[mathematical analysis]], as [[function space]]s, whose vectors are [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a [[topology]], allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and [[continuous function|continuity]]. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] or [[inner product]] are more commonly used, as having a notion of [[metric (mathematics)|distance]] between two vectors. This is particularly the case of [[Banach space]]s and [[Hilbert space]]s, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.\n\nHistorically, the first ideas leading to vector spaces can be traced back as far as the 17th century's [[analytic geometry]], [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], systems of [[linear equation]]s, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by [[Giuseppe Peano]] in 1888, encompasses more general objects than [[Euclidean space]], but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s and their higher-dimensional analogs.\n\nToday, vector spaces are applied throughout [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[engineering]]. They are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion to deal with [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]]. They offer a framework for [[Fourier series|Fourier expansion]], which is employed in [[image compression]] routines, and they provide an environment that can be used for solution techniques for [[partial differential equation]]s. Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, [[coordinate-free]] way of dealing with geometrical and physical objects such as [[tensor]]s. This in turn allows the examination of local properties of [[manifold (mathematics)|manifolds]] by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and [[abstract algebra]].\n\n{{Algebraic structures |Module}}\n\n== Introduction and definition ==\nThe concept of vector space will first be explained by describing two particular examples:\n\n===First example: arrows in the plane===\nThe first example of a vector space consists of [[arrow]]s in a fixed [[plane (geometry)|plane]], starting at one fixed point. This is used in physics to describe [[force]]s or [[velocity|velocities]]. Given any two such arrows, {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}}, the [[parallelogram]] spanned by these two arrows contains one diagonal arrow that starts at the origin, too. This new arrow is called the ''sum'' of the two arrows and is denoted {{math|'''v''' + '''w'''}}. In the special case of two arrows on the same line, their sum is the arrow on this line whose length is the sum or the difference of the lengths, depending on whether the arrows have the same direction. Another operation that can be done with arrows is scaling: given any positive [[real number]] {{math|''a''}}, the arrow that has the same direction as {{math|'''v'''}}, but is dilated or shrunk by multiplying its length by {{math|''a''}}, is called ''multiplication'' of {{math|'''v'''}} by {{math|''a''}}. It is denoted {{math|''a'''''v'''}}. When {{math|''a''}} is negative, {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is defined as the arrow pointing in the opposite direction, instead.\n\nThe following shows a few examples: if {{math|1=''a'' = 2}}, the resulting vector {{math|''a'''''w'''}} has the same direction as {{math|'''w'''}}, but is stretched to the double length of {{math|'''w'''}} (right image below). Equivalently, {{math|2'''w'''}} is the sum {{math|'''w''' + '''w'''}}. Moreover, {{math|1=(−1)'''v''' = −'''v'''}} has the opposite direction and the same length as {{math|'''v'''}} (blue vector pointing down in the right image).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n|width=50%|[[File:Vector addition3.svg|180px|Vector addition: the sum {{math|'''v''' + '''w'''}} (black) of the vectors {{math|'''v'''}} (blue) and {{math|'''w'''}} (red) is shown.]]\n|width=50%|[[File:Scalar multiplication.svg|230px|Scalar multiplication: the multiples {{math|−'''v'''}} and {{math|2'''w'''}} are shown.]]\n|}\n\n===Second example: ordered pairs of numbers===\nA second key example of a vector space is provided by pairs of real numbers {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}. (The order of the components {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} is significant, so such a pair is also called an [[ordered pair]].) Such a pair is written as {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}}. The sum of two such pairs and multiplication of a pair with a number is defined as follows:\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} + {{math|(''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub>)}} {{math|1== (''x''<sub>1</sub> + ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub> + ''y''<sub>2</sub>)}}\nand \n:{{math|1=''a''&thinsp;(''x'', ''y'') = (''ax'', ''ay'')}}.\n\nThe first example above reduces to this one if the arrows are represented by the pair of [[Cartesian coordinates]] of their end points.\n\n===Definition===\nIn this article, vectors are represented in boldface to distinguish them from scalars.<ref group=nb>It is also common, especially in physics, to denote vectors with an arrow on top: {{math|{{vec|''v''}}}}.</ref>\n\nA vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|F}} is a [[set (mathematics)|set]]&nbsp;{{mvar|V}} together with two operations that satisfy the eight axioms listed below.\n\n* The first operation, called '''vector addition''' or simply '''addition''' {{math| + : ''V'' × ''V'' → ''V''}}, takes any two vectors&nbsp;{{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} and assigns to them a third vector which is commonly written as {{math|'''v''' + '''w'''}}, and called the sum of these two vectors. (Note that the resultant vector is also an element of the set {{mvar|V}} ). \n* The second operation, called '''[[scalar multiplication]]''' {{math| · : ''F'' × ''V'' → ''V''}}， takes any scalar&nbsp;{{mvar|a}} and any vector&nbsp;{{math|'''v'''}} and gives another vector&nbsp;{{math|''a'''''v'''}}. (Similarly, the vector {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is an element of the set {{mvar|V}} ).\n\nElements of {{mvar|V}} are commonly called ''vectors''. Elements of&nbsp;{{mvar|F}} are commonly called ''scalars''.\n\nIn the two examples above, the field is the field of the real numbers and the set of the vectors consists of the planar arrows with fixed starting point and of pairs of real numbers, respectively.\n\nTo qualify as a vector space, the set&nbsp;{{mvar|V}} and the operations of addition and multiplication must adhere to a number of requirements called [[axiom]]s.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 27}}</ref> In the list below, let {{math|'''u'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} be arbitrary vectors in {{mvar|V}}, and {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} scalars in {{mvar|F}}.\n\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They do not assert the associativity of either operation. More formally, scalar multiplication is a [[group action]] of the multiplicative group of the field {{mvar|F}} on the vector space {{mvar|V}}.</ref>\n|- style=\"background:#F8F4FF;\"\n| Identity element of scalar multiplication ||  {{math|1=1'''v''' = '''v'''}}, where {{math|1}} denotes the [[multiplicative identity]] in {{mvar|F}}.\n|-\n| [[Distributivity]] of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition&emsp;&emsp;|| {{math|1=''a''('''u''' + '''v''') = ''a'''''u''' + ''a'''''v'''}}\n|- style=\"background:#F8F4FF;\"\n| Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition || {{math|1=(''a'' + ''b'')'''v''' = ''a'''''v''' + ''b'''''v'''}}\n|}\n\nThese axioms generalize properties of the vectors introduced in the above examples. Indeed, the result of addition of two ordered pairs (as in the second example above) does not depend on the order of the summands:\n:{{math|1=(''x''<sub>'''v'''</sub>, ''y''<sub>'''v'''</sub>) + (''x''<sub>'''w'''</sub>, ''y''<sub>'''w'''</sub>) = (''x''<sub>'''w'''</sub>, ''y''<sub>'''w'''</sub>) + (''x''<sub>'''v'''</sub>, ''y''<sub>'''v'''</sub>)}}.\nLikewise, in the geometric example of vectors as arrows, {{math|1='''v''' + '''w''' = '''w''' + '''v'''}} since the parallelogram defining the sum of the vectors is independent of the order of the vectors. All other axioms can be checked in a similar manner in both examples. Thus, by disregarding the concrete nature of the particular type of vectors, the definition incorporates these two and many more examples in one notion of vector space.\n\nSubtraction of two vectors and division by a (non-zero) scalar can be defined as\n:{{math|1='''v''' − '''w''' = '''v''' + (−'''w''')}},\n:{{math|1='''v'''/''a'' = (1/''a'')'''v'''}}.\n\nWhen the scalar field {{mvar|F}} is the [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, the vector space is called a ''real vector space''. When the scalar field is the [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}}, the vector space is called a ''complex vector space''. These two cases are the ones used most often in engineering. The general definition of a vector space allows scalars to be elements of any fixed [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|F}}. The notion is then known as an {{mvar|F}}-''vector spaces'' or a ''vector space over {{mvar|F}}''. A field is, essentially, a set of numbers possessing [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] operations.<ref group=nb>Some authors (such as {{Harvard citations|last = Brown|year = 1991|nb=yes}}) restrict attention to the fields {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}}, but most of the theory is unchanged for an arbitrary field.</ref> For example, [[rational number]]s form a field.\n\nIn contrast to the intuition stemming from vectors in the plane and higher-dimensional cases, there is, in general vector spaces, no notion of [[neighborhood (topology)|nearness]], [[angle]]s or [[distance]]s. To deal with such matters, particular types of vector spaces are introduced; see [[#Vector spaces with additional structure|below]].\n\n===Alternative formulations and elementary consequences===\nVector addition and scalar multiplication are operations, satisfying the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] property:  {{math|'''u''' + '''v'''}} and {{math|''a'''''v'''}} are in {{math|''V''}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, and {{math|'''u'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}} in {{math|''V''}}. Some older sources mention these properties as separate axioms.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = van der Waerden|year = 1993|nb = yes|loc=Ch. 19}}</ref>\n\nIn the parlance of [[abstract algebra]], the first four axioms are equivalent to requiring the set of vectors to be an [[abelian group]] under addition. The remaining axioms give this group an {{math|''F''}}-[[Module (mathematics)|module]] structure. In other words, there is a [[ring homomorphism]] {{math|''f''}} from the field {{math|''F''}} into the [[endomorphism ring]] of the group of vectors. Then scalar multiplication {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is defined as {{math|(''f''(''a''))('''v''')}}.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last=Bourbaki|year=1998|nb=yes|loc=§II.1.1}}. Bourbaki calls the group homomorphisms {{math|''f''(''a'')}} ''homotheties''.</ref>\n\nThere are a number of direct consequences of the vector space axioms. Some of them derive from [[elementary group theory]], applied to the additive group of vectors: for example the zero vector {{math|'''0'''}} of {{math|''V''}} and the additive inverse {{math|−'''v'''}} of any vector {{math|'''v'''}} are unique. Other properties follow from the distributive law, for example {{math|''a'''''v'''}} equals {{math|'''0'''}} if and only if {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|0}} or {{math|'''v'''}} equals {{math|'''0'''}}.\n\n==History==\nVector spaces stem from [[affine geometry]] via the introduction of [[coordinate]]s in the plane or three-dimensional space. Around 1636, [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] founded [[analytic geometry]] by equating solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane [[curve]].<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1969|nb = yes|loc = ch. \"Algèbre linéaire et algèbre multilinéaire\", pp. 78–91}}</ref> In 1804, to achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, [[Bernard Bolzano|Bolzano]] introduced certain operations on points, lines and planes, which are predecessors of vectors.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Bolzano|year = 1804|nb = yes}}</ref> His work was then used in the conception of [[Barycentric coordinate system (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] by [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] in 1827.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Möbius|year = 1827|nb = yes}}</ref> In 1828 [[C. V. Mourey]] suggested the existence of an algebra surpassing not only ordinary algebra but also two-dimensional algebra created by him searching a geometrical interpretation of complex numbers.<ref>{{Citation |title=A History of Vector Analysis: The Evolution of the Idea of a Vectorial System |last1=Crowe |first1=Michel J. |year=1994 |publisher=Dover |isbn= 0-486-67910-1 |page=11 and 16}}</ref>\n\nThe definition of vectors was founded on [[Giusto Bellavitis|Bellavitis]]' notion of the bipoint, an oriented segment of which one end is the origin and the other a target, then further elaborated with the presentation of [[complex number]]s by [[Jean-Robert Argand|Argand]] and [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] and the introduction of [[quaternion]]s and [[biquaternion]]s by the latter.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Hamilton|year = 1853|nb = yes}}</ref> They are elements in {{math|'''R'''<sup>2</sup>}}, {{math|'''R'''<sup>4</sup>}}, and {{math|'''R'''<sup>8</sup>}}; their treatment as [[linear combination]]s can be traced back to [[Edmond Laguerre|Laguerre]] in 1867, who also defined [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]].\n\nIn 1857, [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] introduced [[matrix notation]], which allows for a harmonization and simplification of [[linear map]]s. Around the same time, [[Hermann Grassmann|Grassmann]] studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Grassmann|year = 1844|nb = yes}}</ref> In his work, the concepts of [[linear independence]] and [[dimension]], as well as [[scalar product]]s, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work extended a vector space of ''n'' dimensions to one of 2<sup>n</sup> dimensions by consideration of 2-vectors <math>u \\wedge v</math> and 3-vectors <math>u \\wedge v \\wedge w</math> called [[multivector]]s. This extension, called [[multilinear algebra]], is governed by the rules of [[exterior algebra]]. [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] was the first to give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Peano|year = 1888|nb = yes |loc = ch. IX}}</ref>\n\nAn important development of vector spaces is due to the construction of [[function space]]s by [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]]. This was later formalized by [[Stefan Banach|Banach]] and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], around 1920.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Banach|year = 1922|nb = yes}}</ref> At that time, [[algebra]] and the new field of [[functional analysis]] began to interact, notably with key concepts such as [[Lp space|spaces of ''p''-integrable functions]] and [[Hilbert space]]s.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Dorier|year = 1995|nb = yes}}, {{Harvard citations|last = Moore|year = 1995|nb = yes}}</ref> Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.\n\n== Examples ==\n{{main|Examples of vector spaces}}\n\n===Coordinate spaces===\n{{Main|Coordinate space}}\nThe simplest example of a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} is the field itself, equipped with its standard addition and multiplication. More generally, a vector space can be composed of\n[[tuple|''n''-tuples]] (sequences of length {{math|''n''}}) of elements of {{math|''F''}}, such as\n:{{math|(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, where each {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is an element of {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. I.1|nb = yes}}</ref>\nA vector space composed of all the {{math|''n''}}-tuples of a field {{math|''F''}} is known as a ''[[coordinate space]]'', usually denoted {{math|''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. The case {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} is the above-mentioned simplest example, in which the field {{math|''F''}} is also regarded as a vector space over itself. The case {{math|1=''F'' = '''R'''}} and {{math|1=''n'' = 2}} was discussed in the introduction above.\n\n===Complex numbers and other field extensions===\nThe set of [[complex numbers]] {{math|'''C'''}}, i.e., numbers that can be written in the form {{math|1=''x'' + ''iy''}} for [[real numbers]] {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} where {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], form a vector space over the reals with the usual addition and multiplication: {{math|1=(''x'' + ''iy'') + (''a'' + ''ib'') = (''x'' + ''a'') + ''i''(''y'' + ''b'')}} and {{math|1=''c'' ⋅ (''x'' + ''iy'') = (''c'' ⋅ ''x'') + ''i''(''c'' ⋅ ''y'')}} for real numbers {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}}.  The various axioms of a vector space follow from the fact that the same rules hold for complex number arithmetic.\n\nIn fact, the example of complex numbers is essentially the same (i.e., it is ''isomorphic'') to the vector space of ordered pairs of real numbers mentioned above: if we think of the complex number {{math|''x'' + ''i'' ''y''}} as representing the ordered pair {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} in the [[complex plane]] then we see that the rules for sum and scalar product correspond exactly to those in the earlier example.\n\nMore generally, [[field extension]]s provide another class of examples of vector spaces, particularly in algebra and [[algebraic number theory]]: a field {{math|''F''}} containing a [[Field extension|smaller field]] {{math|''E''}} is an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, by the given multiplication and addition operations of {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year =2002|loc = ch. V.1|nb = yes}}</ref> For example, the complex numbers are a vector space over {{math|'''R'''}}, and the field extension <math>\\mathbf{Q}(i\\sqrt{5})</math> is a vector space over {{math|'''Q'''}}.  <!--A particularly interesting type of field extension in [[number theory]] is {{math|'''Q'''(''α'')}}, the extension of the rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} by a fixed complex number {{math|''α''}}. {{math|'''Q'''(''α'')}} is the smallest field containing the rationals and a fixed complex number ''α''. Its dimension as a vector space over {{math|'''Q'''}} depends on the choice of {{math|''α''}}.-->\n\n===Function spaces===\n{{Main|Function space}}\nFunctions from any fixed set {{math|Ω}} to a field {{math|''F''}} also form vector spaces, by performing addition and scalar multiplication pointwise. That is, the sum of two functions {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} is the function {{math|(''f'' + ''g'')}} given by\n:{{math|1=(''f'' + ''g'')(''w'') = ''f''(''w'') + ''g''(''w'')}},\nand similarly for multiplication. Such function spaces occur in many geometric situations, when {{math|Ω}} is the [[real line]] or an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], or other [[subset]]s of {{math|'''R'''}}. Many notions in topology and analysis, such as [[continuous function|continuity]], [[integral|integrability]] or [[differentiability]] are well-behaved with respect to linearity: sums and scalar multiples of functions possessing such a property still have that property.<ref>e.g. {{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc = ch. XII.3., p. 335|nb = yes}}</ref>  Therefore, the set of such functions are vector spaces. They are studied in greater detail using the methods of [[functional analysis]], see [[#labelFunctionalAnalysis|below]]. Algebraic constraints also yield vector spaces: the <cite id=labelPolynomialRing>[[polynomial ring|vector space {{math|''F''[x]}}]]</cite> is given by [[polynomial function]]s:\n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''r''<sub>0</sub> + ''r''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ... + ''r''<sub>''n''−1</sub>''x''<sup>''n''−1</sup> + ''r''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, where the [[coefficient]]s {{math|''r''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''r''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are in {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. IX.1|nb = yes}}</ref>\n\n===Linear equations===\n{{Main|Linear equation|Linear differential equation|Systems of linear equations}}\nSystems of [[homogeneous linear equation]]s are closely tied to vector spaces.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. VI.3.|nb = yes}}</ref> For example, the solutions of \n:{|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|{{math|''a''}}\n|{{math|+}}\n|{{math|3''b''}}\n|{{math|+}}\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|{{math|''c''}}\n|{{math|{{=}} 0}}\n|-\n|{{math|4''a''}}\n|{{math|+}}\n|{{math|2''b''}}\n|{{math|+}}\n|{{math|2''c''}}\n|{{math|{{=}} 0}}\n|}\nare given by triples with arbitrary {{math|''a''}}, {{math|1=''b'' = ''a''/2}}, and {{math|1=''c'' = −5''a''/2}}. They form a vector space: sums and scalar multiples of such triples still satisfy the same ratios of the three variables; thus they are solutions, too. [[matrix (mathematics)|Matrices]] can be used to condense multiple linear equations as above into one vector equation, namely\n:<cite id=equation3>{{math|1=''A'''''x''' = '''0'''}}</cite>,\nwhere {{math|1=''A'' =}} <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n4 & 2 & 2\\end{bmatrix}</math> is the matrix containing the coefficients of the given equations, {{math|'''x'''}} is the vector {{math|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}}, {{math|''A'''''x'''}} denotes the [[matrix product]], and {{math|1='''0''' = (0, 0)}} is the zero vector. In a similar vein, the solutions of homogeneous ''linear differential equations'' form vector spaces. For example,\n:<cite id=equation1>{{math|1=''f''′′(''x'') + 2''f''′(''x'') + ''f''(''x'') = 0}}</cite>\nyields {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''a&thinsp;e''<sup>−''x''</sup> + ''bx&thinsp;e''<sup>−''x''</sup>}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary constants, and {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} is the [[natural exponential function]].\n\n== Basis and dimension ==\n{{Main|basis (linear algebra)|l1=Basis|dimension (linear algebra)|l2=Dimension}}\n[[File:Vector components and base change.svg|A vector {{math|'''v'''}} in {{math|'''R'''<sup>2</sup>}} (blue) expressed in terms of different bases: using the [[standard basis]] of {{math|1='''R'''<sup>2</sup> '''v''' = ''x'''''e'''<sub>1</sub> + ''y'''''e'''<sub>2</sub>}} (black), and using a different, non-[[orthogonal vector|orthogonal]] basis: {{math|1='''v''' = '''f'''<sub>1</sub> + '''f'''<sub>2</sub>}} (red).|thumb|200px]]\n<cite id=label1>''Bases''</cite> allow one to represent vectors by a [[sequence]] of scalars called ''coordinates'' or ''components''.

Linear independence means that the coordinates {{math|''a''<sub>''k''</sub>}} are uniquely determined for any vector in the vector space.\n\nFor example, the [[coordinate vector]]s {{math|1='''e'''<sub>1</sub> = (1, 0, ..., 0)}}, {{math|1='''e'''<sub>2</sub> = (0, 1, 0, ..., 0)}}, to {{math|1='''e'''<sub>''n''</sub> = (0, 0, ..., 0, 1)}}, form a basis of {{math|''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, called the [[standard basis]], since any vector {{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these vectors:\n:{{math|1=(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) = ''x''<sub>1</sub>(1, 0, ..., 0) + ''x''<sub>2</sub>(0, 1, 0, ..., 0) + ... + ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>(0, ..., 0, 1) = ''x''<sub>1</sub>'''e'''<sub>1</sub> + ''x''<sub>2</sub>'''e'''<sub>2</sub> + ... + ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>'''e'''<sub>''n''</sub>}}.\nThe corresponding coordinates {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{math|...}}, {{math|''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are just the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the vector.\n\nEvery vector space has a basis. This follows from [[Zorn's lemma]], an equivalent formulation of the [[Axiom of Choice]].<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 1.9, p. 43}}</ref> Given the other axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], the existence of bases is equivalent to the axiom of choice.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Blass|year = 1984|nb=yes}}</ref> The [[ultrafilter lemma]], which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or [[cardinality]] (cf.

The kernel of this map is the subspace of vectors '''x''' such that {{math|1=''A'''''x''' = 0}}, which is precisely the set of solutions to the system of homogeneous linear equations belonging to ''A''. This concept also extends to linear differential equations\n:<math>a_0 f + a_1 \\frac{d f}{d x} + a_2 \\frac{d^2 f}{d x^2} + \\cdots + a_n \\frac{d^n f}{d x^n} = 0</math>, where the coefficients ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> are functions in ''x'', too.\nIn the corresponding map\n:<math>f \\mapsto D(f) = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i \\frac{d^i f}{d x^i}</math>,\nthe [[derivative]]s of the function ''f'' appear linearly (as opposed to ''f''′′(''x'')<sup>2</sup>, for example).

In particular, the solutions to the differential equation {{math|1=''D''(''f'') = 0}} form a vector space (over {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}}).\n\n===Direct product and direct sum===\n{{Main|Direct product|Direct sum of modules}}\nThe ''direct product'' of vector spaces and the ''direct sum'' of vector spaces are two ways of combining an indexed family of vector spaces into a new vector space.\n\nThe ''direct product''<!--explain direct--> <math>\\textstyle{\\prod_{i \\in I} V_i}</math> of a family of vector spaces ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> consists of the set of all tuples ({{math|'''v'''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sub>''i'' ∈ ''I''</sub>}}, which specify for each index ''i'' in some [[index set]] ''I'' an element '''v'''<sub>''i''</sub> of ''V''<sub>''i''</sub>.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, pp. 31–32}}</ref> Addition and scalar multiplication is performed componentwise.

If the index set ''I'' is finite, the two constructions agree, but in general they are different.\n\n===Tensor product===\n{{Main|Tensor product of vector spaces}}\nThe ''tensor product'' {{math|''V'' ⊗<sub>''F''</sub> ''W''}}, or simply {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}}, of two vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'' is one of the central notions of [[multilinear algebra]] which deals with extending notions such as linear maps to several variables. A map {{math|''g'' : [[Cartesian product|''V'' × ''W'']] → ''X''}} is called [[bilinear map|bilinear]] if ''g'' is linear in both variables '''v''' and '''w'''.  That is to say, for fixed '''w''' the map {{math|'''v''' ↦ ''g''('''v''', '''w''')}} is linear in the sense above and likewise for fixed '''v'''.\n\nThe tensor product is a particular vector space that is a ''universal'' recipient of bilinear maps ''g'', as follows.

However, vector spaces ''per se'' do not offer a framework to deal with the question—crucial to analysis—whether a sequence of functions [[Limit of a sequence|converges]] to another function. Likewise, linear algebra is not adapted to deal with [[infinite series]], since the addition operation allows only finitely many terms to be added. <cite id=labelFunctionalAnalysis>Therefore, the needs of [[functional analysis]] require considering additional structures.</cite>\n\nA vector space may be given a [[partial order]] ≤, under which some vectors can be compared.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last1 = Schaefer|last2=Wolff|year = 1999|loc = pp. 204–205|nb = yes}}</ref> For example, ''n''-dimensional real space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> can be ordered by comparing its vectors componentwise.

Roughly, a vector space is complete provided that it contains all necessary limits. For example, the vector space of polynomials on the unit interval [0,1], equipped with the [[topology of uniform convergence]] is not complete because any continuous function on [0,1] can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials, by the [[Weierstrass approximation theorem]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kreyszig|1989|loc=§4.11-5}}</ref>  In contrast, the space of ''all'' continuous functions on [0,1] with the same topology is complete.<ref>{{harvnb|Kreyszig|1989|loc=§1.5-5}}</ref> A norm gives rise to a topology by defining that a sequence of vectors '''v'''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to '''v''' if and only if\n:<math>\\text{lim}_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} |\\mathbf v_n - \\mathbf v| = 0.</math>\nBanach and Hilbert spaces are complete topological vector spaces whose topologies are given, respectively, by a norm and an inner product. Their study—a key piece of [[functional analysis]]—focusses on infinite-dimensional vector spaces, since all norms on finite-dimensional topological vector spaces give rise to the same notion of convergence.<ref>{{Harvard citations|last =Choquet|year = 1966|nb = yes|loc=Proposition III.7.2}}</ref> The image at the right shows the equivalence of the 1-norm and ∞-norm on '''R'''<sup>2</sup>: as the unit \"balls\" enclose each other, a sequence converges to zero in one norm if and only if it so does in the other norm.

Distributions are a powerful instrument to solve differential equations. Since all standard analytic notions such as derivatives are linear, they extend naturally to the space of distributions. Therefore, the equation in question can be transferred to a distribution space, which is bigger than the underlying function space, so that more flexible methods are available for solving the equation. For example, [[Green's function]]s and [[fundamental solution]]s are usually distributions rather than proper functions, and can then be used to find solutions of the equation with prescribed boundary conditions.
