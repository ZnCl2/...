This is an example of an endomorphism that is not an [[automorphism]].]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''endomorphism''' is a [[morphism]] (or [[homomorphism]]) from a [[mathematical object]] to itself.  For example, an endomorphism of a [[vector space]] {{math|''V''}} is a [[linear map]], {{math|''f'': ''V'' → ''V''}}, and an endomorphism of a [[group (mathematics)|group]], {{math|''G''}}, is a [[group homomorphism]] {{math|''f'': ''G'' → ''G''}}. In general, we can talk about endomorphisms in any [[category theory|category]]. In the [[category of sets]], endomorphisms are functions from a set ''S'' to itself.\n\nIn any category, the [[function composition|composition]] of any two endomorphisms of {{math|''X''}} is again an endomorphism of {{math|''X''}}.  It follows that the set of all endomorphisms of {{math|''X''}} forms a [[monoid]], denoted {{math|End(''X'')}} (or {{math|End{{sub|''C''}}(''X'')}} to emphasize the category {{math|''C''}}).\n\n==Automorphisms==\n{{main|Automorphism}}\nAn [[inverse element|invertible]] endomorphism of {{math|''X''}} is called an [[automorphism]].  The set of all automorphisms is a [[subset]] of {{math|End(''X'')}} with a [[group (mathematics)|group]] structure, called the [[automorphism group]] of {{math|''X''}} and denoted {{math|Aut(''X'')}}.  In the following diagram, the arrows denote implication:\n{| style=\"border:none;\"\n|-\n| align=\"center\" width=\"42%\" | [[Automorphism]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\" | ⇒\n| align=\"center\" width=\"42%\" | [[Isomorphism]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | ⇓\n|\n| align=\"center\" | ⇓\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | Endomorphism\n| align=\"center\" | ⇒\n| align=\"center\" | [[Homomorphism|(Homo)morphism]]\n|}\n\n==Endomorphism ring==\n{{main|Endomorphism ring}}\nAny two endomorphisms of an [[abelian group]], {{math|''A''}}, can be added together by the rule {{math|(''f'' + ''g'')(''a'') {{=}} ''f''(''a'') + ''g''(''a'')}}.  Under this addition, the endomorphisms of an abelian group form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] (the [[endomorphism ring]]).  For example, the set of endomorphisms of {{math|ℤ{{sup|''n''}}}} is the ring of all {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices with integer entries.  The endomorphisms of a vector space or [[module (mathematics)|module]] also form a ring, as do the endomorphisms of any object in a [[preadditive category]].  The endomorphisms of a nonabelian group generate an algebraic structure known as a [[near-ring]]. Every ring with one is the endomorphism ring of its [[regular module]], and so is a subring of an endomorphism ring of an abelian group;<ref>Jacobson (2009), p. 162, Theorem 3.2.</ref> however there are rings that are not the endomorphism ring of any abelian group.\n\n==Operator theory==\nIn any [[concrete category]], especially for [[vector space]]s, endomorphisms are maps from a set into itself, and may be interpreted as [[unary operator]]s on that set, [[action (group theory)|acting]] on the elements, and allowing to define the notion of [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]]s of elements, etc.\n\nDepending on the additional structure defined for the category at hand ([[topology]], [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], ...), such operators can have properties like [[continuous function (topology)|continuity]], [[Bounded function|boundedness]], and so on.  More details should be found in the article about [[operator theory]].\n\n==Endofunctions==\n{{Merge to |Transformation (function)|date=June 2016|section=yes}}\nAn '''endofunction''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is equal to its [[codomain]]. A [[homomorphism|homomorphic]] endofunction is an endomorphism.\n\nLet {{math|''S''}} be an arbitrary set. Among endofunctions on {{math|''S''}} one finds [[permutation]]s of {{math|''S''}} and constant functions associating to every {{math|''x'' ∈ ''S''}} the same {{math|''c'' ∈ ''S''}}.  Every permutation of {{math|''S''}} has the codomain equal to its domain and is [[bijection|bijective]] and invertible. A constant function on {{math|''S''}}, if {{math|''S''}} has more than 1 element, has an image that is a proper subset of its codomain, is not bijective (and non invertible). The function associating to each natural integer {{math|''n''}} the floor of {{math|''n''/2}} has its image equal to its codomain and is not invertible.\n\nFinite endofunctions are equivalent to [[directed pseudoforest]]s. For sets of size {{math|''n''}} there are {{math|''n''{{sup|''n''}}}} endofunctions on the set.\n\nParticular examples of bijective endofunctions are the [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]s; i.e., the functions coinciding with their inverses.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adjoint endomorphism]]\n*[[Epimorphism]] (Surjective morphism)\n*[[Frobenius endomorphism]]\n*[[Monomorphism]] (Injective morphism)\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation| last=Jacobson| first=Nathan| author-link=Nathan Jacobson| year=2009| title=Basic algebra| edition=2nd| volume = 1 | series= | publisher=Dover| isbn = 978-0-486-47189-1}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Endomorphism|id=p/e035600}}\n* {{planetmath reference|id=7462|title=Endomorphism}}\n\n[[Category:Morphisms]]",
