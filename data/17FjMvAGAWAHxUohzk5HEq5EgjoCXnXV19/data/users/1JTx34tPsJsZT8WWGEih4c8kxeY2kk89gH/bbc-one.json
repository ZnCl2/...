The competition quickly forced the channel to change its identity and priorities following a large reduction in its audience.\n\nThe 1962 [[Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting|Pilkington Report]] on the future of broadcasting noticed this, and that ITV lacked any serious programming. It therefore decided that Britain's third television station should be awarded to the BBC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sixtiescity.com/Television/BritishTV.htm |title=British Television up to the end of the Sixties |publisher=Sixtiescity.com |access-date=12 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024020910/http://www.sixtiescity.com/Television/BritishTV.htm |archive-date=24 October 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nThe station, renamed BBC TV in 1960, became BBC1 when [[BBC Two|BBC2]] was launched on 20 April 1964 transmitting an incompatible [[576i|625-line image]] on UHF. The only way to receive all channels was to use a complex \"dual-standard\" 405- and 625-line, VHF and UHF, receiver, with both a VHF and a UHF [[Television antenna|aerial]]. Old 405-line-only sets became obsolete in 1985, when transmission in the standard ended, although standards converters have become available for enthusiasts who collect and restore such TVs.\n\nBBC1 was based at the purpose-built [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] at [[White City, London]] between 1960 and 2013. [[BBC News#1950s|Television News]] continued to use Alexandra Palace as its base—by early 1968 it had even converted one of its studios to colour—before moving to new purpose-built facilities at Television Centre on 20 September 1969.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to 15 November 1969, BBC1 unofficially transmitted the occasional programme in its new colour system, to test it. At midnight on 15 November, simultaneously with [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and two years after BBC2, BBC1 officially began 625-line [[PAL]] colour programming on UHF with a broadcast of a concert by [[Petula Clark]].<ref>[http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/news/50-still-watch-black-and.5818157.jp 50 still watch black and white TV in Calderdale] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115113349/http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/news/50-still-watch-black-and.5818157.jp |date=15 November 2009 }} ''Halifax Courier'', 12 November 2009</ref> Colour transmissions could be received (in monochrome) on monochrome 625-line sets until the end of analogue broadcasting (and indeed can still be received if such a set is connected to a [[digital television adapter]] tuned to the [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]] version of the channel.)\n\nIn terms of audience share, the most successful period for BBC1 was under [[Bryan Cowgill]] between 1973 and 1977, when the channel achieved an average audience share of 45%.<ref>{{cite web|title=BRYAN COWGILL|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tv/tvheroes/bryancowgill|publisher=transdiffusion.org|access-date=2 June 2014}}</ref> This period is still regarded by many as a golden age of the BBC's output, with the BBC achieving a very high standard across its entire range of series, serials, plays, light entertainment and documentaries. {{original research inline|date=June 2014}}\n\nOn 30 December 1980, the BBC announced their intention to introduce a new [[breakfast television]] service to compete with [[TV-am]]. The BBC stated it would start broadcasting before TV-am, but made clear their hands were tied until November 1981 when the new licence fee income became available, to help finance extending broadcast hours, with the hope of starting in 1982.  On 17 January 1983, the first edition of ''[[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]]'' was shown on BBC1, becoming the first UK wide breakfast television service<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/presenters/7706825.stm |title=Programmes &#124; Breakfast &#124; Presenters &#124; The Evolution of Breakfast |work=BBC News |access-date=1 February 2014}}</ref> and continued to lead in the ratings until 1984.<ref>{{cite news |title=TV-am takes peak breakfast ratings lead |work=The Times |date=27 August 1983}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=BBC regains lead in breakfast TV ratings |work=The Times |date=17 September 1983}}</ref>\n\n===Michael Grade era (1984–1987)===\nIn 1984, [[Bill Cotton]] become managing director of Television at the BBC, and set about overhauling BBC1, which had been slated for poor home grown shows, its heavy reliance on US imports, with ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' and ''[[The Thorn Birds (TV miniseries)|The Thorn Birds]]'' being BBC1's highest rated programmes and ratings being over 20% behind ITV.

Its replacement was the ''[[BBC News at Six|BBC Six O'Clock News]]'',<ref>{{cite news |work=The Times |date=6 June 1984 |page=3 |issue=61850}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=BBC goes for news to replace Sixty Minutes flop |last=Chorlton |first=Penny |work=The Guardian |date=9 June 1984}}</ref> a straight news programme in a bid to shore up its failing early evening slot. It was believed the BBC were planning to cut short the evening news and move more light entertainment programming in from the 18:20 slot, but this was dismissed. The [[Miss Great Britain]] contest was dropped, being described as verging on the too offensive after the January 1985 contest, with ''Worlds Strongest Man'' and ''International Superstar'' also being cancelled.<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC drops beauty show |work=The Times |date=17 November 1984 |page=3}}</ref>\n\nBBC1 was relaunched on 18 February 1985 with a [[Computer Originated World|new look]], new programming including ''[[Wogan]]'', ''[[EastEnders]]'' and a revised schedule to help streamline and maintain viewers throughout the course of the evening. Grade started to gear most programmes to either on the hour or half past the hour, while ''Panorama'' and ''Omnibus'' were both moved after the ''Nine O'Clock News''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Battle plan that opens a new panorama |first=Peter |last=Fiddick |work=The Guardian |date=4 February 1985}}</ref> Grade was also determined to end the dated and inept BBC1 scheduling which was hampering the network and which was holding back good programmes. Grade stated \"When I took over BBC1, I discovered there were wonderful things, it was just a case of where to put them.\" ''Wogan'' had been scheduled for a 10&nbsp;pm slot, but Grade moved it to a 7&nbsp;pm slot as he believed the show had potential.<ref name=\"transdiffusion.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tv/tvheroes/michael_grade |title=Michael Grade – Television – Transdiffusion Broadcasting System |publisher=Transdiffusion.org |access-date=1 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nFrom February to August 1985, a high number of American mini-series were broadcast while filming took place of a number of new home grown programmes, including ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'', ''[[In Sickness and in Health]]'', and ''[[Open All Hours]]''. Further improvement came about when the corporation strengthened its drama output costing £30&nbsp;million, with eight new series, including ''[[Howards' Way]]'', ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (1978 TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'', ''Hold the Back Page'', and ''Bluebill'', along with the return of ''Bergerac'' and ''Big Deal''. The increase in the drama department was achieved by switching the money away from the administrative service over a three-year period, after BBC1 was criticised for failing in matching ITV's output in drama.<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC unveils £30m drama season with films galore |work=The Times |date=9 August 1985 |page=2}}</ref> ''EastEnders'' was moved to a 19:30 slot, where it managed to soar to 20 million, helping the BBC1 audience share increase to nearly 50% for the first time since 1982.\n\nOn 27 February 1985, ''[[Doctor Who]]'' was placed on an 18-month hiatus. The BBC originally planned to axe the series as they wished to spend its budgets on new programming for the channel, but was forced to back down from public pressure and Doctor Who returned in September 1986. At the time Michael Grade and Jonathan Powell were blamed for the decision (Grade was the target of death threats<ref name=\"transdiffusion.org\"/>) but it was later revealed that the decision was taken due to the series running out of creative inspiration, making it impossible to find anyone (at the time) who knew what to do with the series.<ref>Michael Grade: On the Box – episode 5: Dishing the Dirt</ref><ref>\"Trials and Tribulations\" – from the DVD of ''The Ultimate Foe'' (''Trial of a Time Lord'').</ref>\n\nOn 9 September 1985, the long-standing children's programming block was overhauled and rebranded as ''[[CBBC (TV channel)|Children's BBC]]'', which gave it dedicated idents for the first time and had a live in-vision presenter, similar to rival ITV's [[CITV|Children's ITV]] block which had been running since January 1983. Previously the BBC had broadcast children's programming using BBC1's team of regular duty announcers. The launch presenter for this block, and thus the first Children's BBC presenter of the current format, was [[Phillip Schofield]].\n\nOn 23 May 1986, long-running lunchtime magazine show ''[[Pebble Mill at One]]'' was broadcast for the last time after 14 years on the air. On 27 October 1986, BBC1 launched its daytime television schedules.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bbctimeline.appspot.com/events/agtiYmN0aW1lbGluZXIMCxIFRXZlbnQY9SMM |title=BBC Timeline – Events – LAUNCH OF DAYTIME TELEVISION SERVICE (BBC-1 & BBC-2) |work=Bbctimeline.appspot.com |date=27 October 1986 |access-date=1 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000624/http://bbctimeline.appspot.com/events/agtiYmN0aW1lbGluZXIMCxIFRXZlbnQY9SMM |archive-date=3 December 2013 }}</ref> In a statement, BBC Daytime head Roger Laughton said:\n\n{{cquote|It was the natural extension of the corporation's commitment to public service broadcasting, since half the population had access to television during the day mainly the retired, unemployed and housewives.}}\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:BBC1-1991.svg|100px|thumbnail|left|Logo of BBC1 from 16 February 1991 to 4 October 1997]]\n\nStereo audio transmissions, using the [[NICAM]] digital stereo sound format began on BBC1 in late 1987, to coincide with the sale of the first consumer NICAM-enabled equipment, a year after BBC2, and were gradually phased in across BBC TV output, although it took until 31 August 1991 for the service to begin officially on both channels. During this time, both commercial analogue broadcasters, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Channel 4]] had officially begun [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] transmissions using the BBC-developed NICAM system. Widescreen programming was introduced on [[Digital television|digital platforms]] in 1998.\n\nFor the first fifty years of its existence, with the exception of films and purchased programmes from the United States and elsewhere, almost all the channel's output was produced by the BBC's in-house production departments. This changed following the passing of the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]], which required that 25% of the BBC's television output be out-sourced to independent production companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who we are and how we commission|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/articles/who-we-are-how-we-commission|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=17 January 2016}}</ref> By 2004 many popular BBC One shows were made for the channel by independents, but the in-house production departments continued to contribute heavily to the schedule.\n\nIn March 1991, as part of the £63&nbsp;million programme package for spring and summer line up on BBC1, it was announced an extra £20&nbsp;million was to be spent on rejuvenating the channels drama and comedy output during peak times, which meant the channel would be in a healthy state once the new [[ITV (TV network)|Channel 3]] licences were awarded.<ref>{{cite news |title=£20m extra for peak-time TV |first=Melinda |last=Wittstock |work=The Times |date=13 March 1991 |page=7}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1991 ''[[Wogan]]'' was to be cancelled, due to falling ratings against a number of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] shows, in which ''Wogan'' only managed six million viewers compared to double for ''[[This Is Your Life (British TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'', ''[[The Krypton Factor]]'' and ''[[The $64,000 Question (British game show)|The $64,000 Question]]''. Additionally an extra £40&nbsp;million a year was spent on narrowing the gap on ITV's ratings lead, since a few months prior to this the channel had been criticised for its Autumn schedule, having tired formats, uninspiring scheduling of new programmes and poor scripts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wogan to host new shows |first=Melinda |last=Wittstock |work=The Times |date=2 December 1991 |page=2}}</ref> ''Wogan'' was replaced with ''[[Eldorado (TV series)|Eldorado]]'', in early July 1992, but this was itself cancelled a year later.\n\n[[Alan Yentob]] launched the 1993 Autumn schedule calling it \"My first try with a lot of help from my friends\", with the channel still under criticism, following the start of new programming Alan introduced a year earlier and the number of summer repeats. £175&nbsp;million was spent on 80 hours of original drama produced, enchantment to the arts with an extended 26-week run for ''[[Omnibus (British TV programme)|Omnibus]]'', and documentaries with ''[[The Downing Street Years]]'', new wildlife series and an eight-month look at Sheffield's Children's hospital, while ''[[Goodnight Sweetheart (TV series)|Goodnight Sweetheart]]'', ''[[Grace & Favour]]'' and ''The Danny Baker Show'' were new comedy series.<ref>Yentob concocts dramatic recipe to lift BBC1 ratings.Alison Roberts, Arts Correspondent.

Efficiency savings of £25&nbsp;million were found which were redeployed on the new productions. The savings were seen as a vindication so for the producer choice, the controversial market-oriented drive introduced in April 1993.<ref>{{cite news |title=£25m savings help BBC curb repeats |first=Alexandera |last=Frean |work=The Times |date=10 March 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=BBC to run repeats throughout year but only by demand |first=Alexandra |last=Frean |work=The Times |date=18 September 1993 |page=3}}</ref>\n\nBy March 1999, the channel admitted defeat in its ratings war with [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], with its Spring line up with a stronger emphasis on serious factual programmes, educations and drama.

All three main news bulletins have a lead over their rival programmes on ITV and other terrestrial or cable channels. During the weekend period, [[BBC Weekend News|three separate bulletins]] around these three time periods are broadcast and vary in length from 10 to 25 minutes. BBC One has broadcast overnight simulcasts from the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News Channel]] (which itself is simulcasting with [[BBC World News]]) since 1997; the latter in turn simulcasts the majority of all regular BBC One bulletins. When BBC One is broadcasting a BBC News special, it hands some of its daytime programming to BBC Two.\n\nEach year 159 hours of current affairs programmes are broadcast on BBC One, including ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' and ''[[Watchdog (TV series)|Watchdog]]''. Politics is also covered, with programmes including ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' and ''[[This Week (BBC TV series)|This Week]]'' shown. ''[[Crimewatch]]'', a programme appealing for help in unsolved crimes, is broadcast monthly.\n\nBBC One shows 1,880 hours of factual and learning programming annually. This includes a wide range of shows such as nature documentaries such as ''[[Planet Earth (franchise)|Planet Earth]]'' as well as lifestyle-format daytime programmes and a number of ''reality television'' formats and the ''One Life'' strand.\n\nBBC One broadcasts 1,036 hours of drama each year, more than any other BBC channel. There are four half-hour episodes of ''[[EastEnders]]'' each week (not shown on Wednesdays), with an [[Omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] episode at the weekend, plus hospital dramas ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'' and ''[[Holby City]]''.

This became more pronounced with the launch of Children's BBC, later renamed \"[[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]]\". This new strand was broadcast primarily on BBC One in the late afternoons, as well as Saturday and Sunday mornings also such as ''[[Going Live!]]'' and ''[[Live & Kicking]]'', each lasting two to three hours. The launch in 2002 of dedicated digital channels for this content —the [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]] channels —did not affect this provision. Combined with BBC Two, the channel broadcast 2,195 hours of children's programmes in 2010, mostly in the late afternoons on weekdays.<ref name=AnnRep2010/> Saturday morning children's programming moved to BBC Two in 2006 following a three-month trial.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4549160.stm BBC mulls Saturday morning switch] ''BBC News'', 21 December 2005</ref>\n\nSports coverage on BBC One includes [[Premier League]] football highlights on ''[[Match of the Day]]'', [[The Championships, Wimbledon]], the [[London Marathon]], and other international [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] and swimming events, the [[Olympic Games]], [[Rugby league]], [[Rugby Union]], [[Snooker]] tournaments, the American [[Super Bowl]], and more.\n\nThe BBC showed the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], splitting the group stage matches with ITV. The 8 BBC had first pick of matches from the second round. Repeats made up 8.4% of peak programming in 2010–11, up from 8.0% for 2008–09.<ref name=AnnRep2010/> Programming on this channel costs an average of £162,900 per hour.\n\nBritish and international films are broadcast for 654 hours each year on BBC One. This is mainly late-night fillers with some box office hits at Christmas and holiday periods.\nSometimes on a Saturday afternoon there is a film on to fill the gap between entertainment shows but very rarely has there been one in that slot.\n\nEntertainment programming on BBC One includes game shows such as the ''[[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]'', ''[[Total Wipeout]]'', ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' and chat shows such as ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]''.\n\nThe annual 92 hours of religious programming comprise weekly editions of live ''[[Songs of Praise]]'', Christian services and other shows from independent production companies. Mentorn Oxford produces ''Heart and Soul'', described as \"a new multi-faith programme featuring a panel and a studio audience\", followed by ''Life from the Loft'' which is made by the Leeds-based company True North.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=38046 |title=New shows to replace Heaven and Earth |work=Church Times |date=27 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030756/http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=38046 |archive-date=28 September 2007 }} {{subscription}}</ref> In 2005 BBC One was criticised for reducing the amount of religious programming, previously 101 hours per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/channel.governors.criticise.bbc1.for.reducing.religious.programming/2818.htm|title=BBC criticised for reducing amount of religious programmes|work=Christian Today|date=9 May 2005}}</ref>\n\nBBC One broadcasts many comedy programmes, often on Friday nights.

Sometimes a drama such as ''[[Land Girls (TV series)|Land Girls]]'' is shown in the afternoons.\n\nBetween 15:05 and 17:05 was the CBeebies/CBBC broadcasting strand, with its own visual identity.
