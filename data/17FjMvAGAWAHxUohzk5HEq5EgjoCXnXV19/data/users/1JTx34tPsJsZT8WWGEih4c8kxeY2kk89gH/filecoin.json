The blockchain is based on both proof-of-replication and [[Proof of space-time|proof-of-spacetime]].\n\nContrary to centralized storage methodology, Filecoin aims to store data in a decentralized manner, which is resistant to problems that occur in centralized storage. Due to Filecoin's decentralized nature, it protects the integrity of data's location making it easily retrievable and hard to censor. It also allows people on their network to be their own custodians of the data that they store. Additionally, Filecoin also rewards the network nodes that mine and store data on their blockchain network.\n\n== History ==\nThe project was launched in August 2017 and raised over $200 million within 30 minutes.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|date=2017-08-21|title=What are initial coin offerings?|work=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/08/21/what-are-initial-coin-offerings|access-date=2019-10-05|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nIn April 2021 the Filecoin Foundation donated 50,000 filecoins worth $10,000,000 to the [[Internet Archive]].
