There are several approaches to [[computer cluster|clustering]], most of which do not employ a clustered file system (only [[direct attached storage]] for each node).  Clustered file systems can provide features like location-independent addressing and redundancy which improve reliability or reduce the complexity of the other parts of the cluster.  '''Parallel file systems''' are a type of clustered file system that spread data across multiple storage nodes, usually for redundancy or performance.<ref name=\"DellClustersWithParallelFileSystems\">{{cite web |last1=Saify |first1=Amina |last2=Kochhar |first2=Garima |last3=Hsieh |first3=Jenwei |last4=Celebioglu |first4=Onur  |title=Enhancing High-Performance Computing Clusters with Parallel File Systems |url=http://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/business/solutions/power/de/Documents/ps2q05-20040179-Saify-OE_de.pdf |website=Dell Power Solutions |publisher=Dell Inc. |access-date=6 March 2019 |date=May 2005}}</ref>\n\n=={{Anchor|SHARED-DISK}}Shared-disk file system==\nA '''shared-disk file system''' uses a [[storage area network]] (SAN) to allow multiple computers to gain  direct disk access at the [[Block (data storage)|block level]].  Access control and translation from file-level operations that applications use to block-level operations used by the SAN must take place on the client node.  The most common type of clustered file system, the shared-disk file system &mdash;by adding mechanisms for [[concurrency control]]&mdash;provides a consistent and [[serialization|serializable]] view of the file system, avoiding corruption and unintended [[data loss]] even when multiple clients try to access the same files at the same time. Shared-disk file-systems commonly employ some sort of [[Fencing (computing)|fencing]] mechanism to prevent data corruption in case of node failures, because an unfenced device can cause data corruption if it loses communication with its sister nodes and tries to access the same information other nodes are accessing.\n\nThe underlying storage area network may use any of a number of block-level protocols, including [[SCSI]], [[iSCSI]], [[HyperSCSI]], [[ATA over Ethernet]] (AoE), [[Fibre Channel]], [[network block device]], and [[InfiniBand]].\n\nThere are different architectural approaches to a shared-disk filesystem. Some distribute file information across all the servers in a cluster (fully distributed).<ref name=\"SDDS 2002 Disk Backup Through Algebraic Signatures in Scalable Distributed Data Structures\">{{cite web |title=Disk Backup Through Algebraic Signatures in Scalable Distributed Data Structures|last1=Mokadem |first1=Riad |last2=Litwin |first2=Witold |last3=Schwarz |first3=Thomas |url=https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~litwin/cours98/Doc-cours-clouds/BackupAlgSign2006.pdf |publisher= DEXA 2006 Springer |access-date=8 June 2006|year=2006}}</ref> \n\n===Examples===\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Blue Whale Clustered file system]] (BWFS)\n* [[Silicon Graphics]] (SGI) clustered file system ([[CXFS]])\n* [[Veritas Cluster File System]]\n* Microsoft [[Cluster Shared Volumes]] (CSV)\n* DataPlow [[Nasan]] File System\n* [[IBM General Parallel File System]] (GPFS)\n* [[OCFS|Oracle Cluster File System]] (OCFS)\n* [[OpenVMS]] [[Files-11]] File System\n* PolyServe storage solutions\n* [[Quantum Corporation|Quantum]] [[StorNext File System|StorNext]] File System (SNFS), ex ADIC, ex CentraVision File System (CVFS)\n* Red Hat [[Global File System]] (GFS2)\n* Sun [[QFS]]\n* TerraScale Technologies TerraFS\n* Veritas CFS (Cluster FS: Clustered VxFS)\n* Versity VSM (SAM-QFS ported to Linux), ScoutFS\n* [[VMware VMFS]]\n* WekaFS\n* Apple [[Xsan]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n=={{Anchor|DISTRIBUTED-FS}}Distributed file systems==\n''Distributed file systems'' do not share [[block-level storage|block level access]] to the same storage but use a network [[protocol (computing)|protocol]].<ref name=\"SilberschatzOperatingSystemConcepts\">{{cite web |last1=Silberschatz |first1=Abraham |last2=Galvin |first2=Peter |last3=Gagne |first3=Greg |title=Operating System Concepts, 8th Edition |url=http://www.uobabylon.edu.iq/download/M.S%202013-2014/Operating_System_Concepts,_8th_Edition%5BA4%5D.pdf |website=University of Babylon |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |access-date=4 March 2019 |pages=705–725 |date=2009}}</ref><ref name=\"ostep-1\">{{citation|title=Sun's Network File System|url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/dist-nfs.pdf|publisher= Arpaci-Dusseau Books|date = 2014|first1 = Remzi H.|last1 =Arpaci-Dusseau|first2=Andrea C.|last2 = Arpaci-Dusseau}}</ref>  These are commonly known as [[distributed file system|network file system]]s, even though they are not the only file systems that use the network to send data.<ref name=\"SunNetworkFileSystem\">{{cite web |last1=Sandberg |first1=Russel |title=The Sun Network Filesystem: Design, Implementation and Experience |url=https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/tkosar/cse710_spring13/papers/nfs.pdf |website=Proceedings of the Summer 1986 USENIX Technical Conference and Exhibition |publisher=Sun Microsystems, Inc. |access-date=6 March 2019 |date=1986 |quote=NFS  was  designed  to  simplify  the  sharing  of  filesystem  resources  in  a  network  of  non-homogeneousmachines.}}</ref>  Distributed file systems can restrict access to the file system depending on [[access list]]s or [[Capability-based security|capabilities]] on both the servers and the clients, depending on how the protocol is designed.\n\nThe difference between a distributed file system and a [[distributed data store]] is that a distributed file system allows files to be accessed using the same interfaces and semantics as local files{{snd}} for example, mounting/unmounting, listing directories, read/write at byte boundaries, system's native permission model.  Distributed data stores, by contrast, require using a different API or library and have different semantics (most often those of a database).<ref name=\"Sobh\">{{cite book |last1=Sobh |first1=Tarek |title=Advances in Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering |date=2008 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |pages=423–440}}</ref>\n\n===Design goals===\nDistributed file systems may aim for \"transparency\" in a number of aspects.  That is, they aim to be \"invisible\" to client programs, which \"see\" a system which is similar to a local file system.  Behind the scenes, the distributed file system handles locating files, transporting data, and potentially providing other features listed below.\n\n* ''Access transparency'': clients are unaware that files are distributed and can access them in the same way as local files are accessed.\n* ''Location transparency'': a consistent namespace exists encompassing local as well as remote files. The name of a file does not give its location.\n* ''Concurrency transparency'': all clients have the same view of the state of the file system. This means that if one process is modifying a file, any other processes on the same system or remote systems that are accessing the files will see the modifications in a coherent manner.\n* ''Failure transparency'': the client and client programs should operate correctly after a server failure.\n* ''Heterogeneity'': file service should be provided across different hardware and operating system platforms.\n* ''Scalability'': the file system should work well in small environments (1 machine, a dozen machines) and also scale gracefully to bigger ones (hundreds through tens of thousands of systems).\n* ''Replication transparency'': Clients should be unaware of the file replication performed across multiple servers to support scalability.\n* ''Migration transparency'': files should be able to move between different servers without the client's knowledge.\n\n===History===\nThe [[Incompatible Timesharing System]] used virtual devices for transparent inter-machine file system access in the 1960s.  More file servers were developed in the 1970s. In 1976 [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] created the [[File Access Listener]] (FAL), an implementation of the [[Data Access Protocol]] as part of [[DECnet]] Phase II which became the first widely used network file system. In 1985 [[Sun Microsystems]] created the file system called \"[[Network File System (protocol)|Network File System]]\" (NFS) which became the first widely used [[Internet Protocol]] based network file system.<ref name=\"ostep-1\" />  Other notable network file systems are [[Andrew File System]] (AFS), [[Apple Filing Protocol]] (AFP), [[NetWare Core Protocol]] (NCP), and [[Server Message Block]] (SMB) which is also known as Common Internet File System (CIFS).\n\nIn 1986, [[IBM]] announced client and server support for Distributed Data Management Architecture (DDM) for the [[System/36]], [[System/38]], and IBM mainframe computers running [[CICS]].  This was followed by the support for [[IBM Personal Computer]], [[AS/400]], IBM mainframe computers under the [[MVS]] and [[VSE (operating system)|VSE]] operating systems, and [[FlexOS]].   DDM also became the foundation for [[DRDA|Distributed Relational Database Architecture]], also known as DRDA.\n\nThere are many [[peer-to-peer]] [[network protocol]]s  for open-source [[distributed file systems for cloud]] or  closed-source clustered file systems, e. g.:  [[9P (protocol)|9P]],  [[Andrew File System|AFS]], [[Coda (file system)|Coda]], [[Server Message Block|CIFS/SMB]], [[DCE Distributed File System|DCE/DFS]],  [http://www.weka.io WekaFS], [[Lustre (file system)|Lustre]], [https://www.panasas.com/panfs-architecture/panfs/ PanFS], [[Google File System]], [[Mnet (peer-to-peer network)|Mnet]], [[Chord (peer-to-peer)|Chord Project]].\n\n===Examples===\n{{Main|List of file systems#Distributed file systems|l1 = List of distributed file systems}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Alluxio]]\n* [[BeeGFS]] (Fraunhofer)\n* [[Ceph (software)#File_system|CephFS]] (Inktank, Red Hat, SUSE)\n* [[Distributed File System (Microsoft)|Windows Distributed File System (DFS)]] (Microsoft)\n* [[Infinit (file system)|Infinit]] (acquired by Docker)\n* [[Gfarm file system|GfarmFS]]\n* [[GlusterFS]] (Red Hat)\n* [[Google file system|GFS]] (Google Inc.)\n* [[Hadoop distributed file system|HDFS]] (Apache Software Foundation)\n* [[InterPlanetary File System|IPFS]] (Inter Planetary File System)\n* iRODS\n* [https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs JuiceFS] (Juicedata)\n* [[LizardFS]] (Skytechnology)\n* [[Lustre (file system)|Lustre]]\n* [[MapR FS]]\n* [[Moose File System|MooseFS]] (Core Technology / Gemius)\n* [[ObjectiveFS]]\n* [[OneFS]] (EMC Isilon)\n* [[OrangeFS]] (Clemson University, Omnibond Systems), formerly [[Parallel Virtual File System]]\n* [[Panasas|PanFS]] (Panasas)\n* [[Parallel Virtual File System]] (Clemson University, Argonne National Laboratory, Ohio Supercomputer Center)\n* [[RozoFS]] (Rozo Systems)\n* Torus (CoreOS)\n* [[WekaFS]] (WekaIO)\n* [[XtreemFS]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Network-attached storage==\n{{Main|Network-attached storage}}\n\nNetwork-attached storage (NAS) provides both storage and a file system, like a shared disk file system on top of a storage area network (SAN).  NAS typically uses file-based protocols (as opposed to block-based protocols a SAN would use) such as [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] (popular on [[UNIX]] systems), SMB/CIFS ([[Server Message Block|Server Message Block/Common Internet File System]]) (used with MS Windows systems), [[Apple Filing Protocol|AFP]] (used with [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] computers), or NCP (used with [[Novell Open Enterprise Server|OES]] and [[NetWare|Novell NetWare]]).\n\n==Design considerations==\n\n===Avoiding single point of failure===\nThe failure of disk hardware or a given storage node in a cluster can create a [[single point of failure]] that can result in [[data loss]] or unavailability.  [[Fault tolerance]] and high availability can be provided through [[Replication (computing)|data replication]] of one sort or another, so that data remains intact and available despite the failure of any single piece of equipment.  For examples, see the lists of [[List of file systems#Distributed fault-tolerant file systems|distributed fault-tolerant file systems]] and [[List of file systems#Distributed parallel fault-tolerant file systems|distributed parallel fault-tolerant file systems]].\n\n===Performance===\nA common [[performance]] [[measurement]] of a clustered file system is the amount of time needed to satisfy service requests.  In conventional systems, this time consists of a disk-access time and a small amount of [[Central processing unit|CPU]]-processing time.  But in a clustered file system, a remote access has additional overhead due to the distributed structure.  This includes the time to deliver the request to a server, the time to deliver the response to the client, and for each direction, a CPU overhead of running the [[communication protocol]] [[software]].\n\n===Concurrency===\nConcurrency control becomes an issue when more than one person or client is accessing the same file or block and want to update it.  Hence updates to the file from one client should not interfere with access and updates from other clients. This problem is more complex with file systems due to concurrent overlapping writes, where different writers write to overlapping regions of the file concurrently.<ref>Pessach, Yaniv (2013). ''Distributed Storage: Concepts, Algorithms, and Implementations''. {{ISBN|978-1482561043}}.</ref> This problem is usually handled by [[concurrency control]] or [[lock (computer science)|locking]] which may either be built into the file system or provided by an add-on protocol.\n\n==History==\nIBM mainframes in the 1970s could share physical disks and file systems if each machine had its own channel connection to the drives' control units. In the 1980s, [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[TOPS-20]] and [[OpenVMS]] clusters (VAX/ALPHA/IA64) included shared disk file systems.<ref name=\"TenexOrigins&Development\">{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=Dan |title=Origins and Development of TOPS-20 |url=http://tenex.opost.com/hbook.html |publisher=Dan Murphy |access-date=6 March 2019 |date=1996 |at=Ambitious Plans for Jupiter |quote=Ultimately, both VMS and TOPS-20 shipped this kind of capability.}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Distributed file system]]\n* [[Network-attached storage]]\n* [[Storage area network]]\n* [[Shared resource]]\n* [[Direct-attached storage]]\n* [[Peer-to-peer file sharing]]\n* [[Disk sharing]]\n* [[Distributed data store]]\n* [[Distributed file system for cloud]]\n* [[Global file system]]\n* [[Gopher (protocol)]]\n* [[List of file systems#Distributed file systems|List of distributed file systems]]\n* [[CacheFS]]\n* [[RAID]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.cloudbus.org/reports/DistributedStorageTaxonomy.pdf A Taxonomy of Distributed Storage Systems]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120756/http://trac.nchc.org.tw/grid/raw-attachment/wiki/jazz/09-05-22/A_Taxonomy_and_Survey_on_Distributed_File_Systems.pdf A Taxonomy and Survey on Distributed File Systems]\n* [http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/courses/dd/papers/satya89survey.ps A survey of distributed file systems]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131224101831/http://www.snia-europe.org/objects_store/Christian_Bandulet_SNIATutorial%20Basics_EvolutionFileSystems.pdf The Evolution of File Systems]\n\n{{File systems|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Computer file systems]]\n[[Category:Data management]]\n[[Category:Distributed data storage]]\n[[Category:Distributed file systems| ]]\n[[Category:Network file systems]]\n[[Category:Shared disk file systems| ]]\n[[Category:Storage area networks]]",
