The process of putting data into blocks is called ''blocking'', while ''deblocking'' is the process of extracting data from blocks. Blocked data is normally stored in a [[data buffer]], and read or written a whole block at a time. Blocking reduces the [[overhead (computing)|overhead]] and speeds up the handling of the data-stream.<ref name=\"Chang\"/> For some devices, such as magnetic tape and [[Count Key Data|CKD disk device]]s, blocking reduces the amount of external storage required for the data. Blocking is almost universally employed when storing data to 9-track [[magnetic tape]], NAND [[flash memory]], and rotating media such as [[floppy disk]]s, [[hard disk]]s, and [[optical disc]]s.\n\nMost [[file system]]s are based on a [[block device]], which is a level of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] for the hardware responsible for storing and retrieving specified blocks of data, though the block size in file systems may be a multiple of the physical block size. This leads to space inefficiency due to [[internal fragmentation]], since file lengths are often not integer multiples of block size, and thus the last block of a file may remain partially empty. This will create [[slack space]]. Some newer file systems, such as [[Btrfs]] and [[FreeBSD]] [[Unix File System|UFS2]], attempt to solve this through techniques called [[block suballocation|block suballocation and tail merging]].  Other file systems such as [[ZFS]] support variable block sizes.<ref name=\"ZFS1\"/><ref name=\"ZFS2\"/>\n\nBlock storage is normally abstracted by a file system or [[database management system]] (DBMS) for use by applications and end users. The physical or logical volumes accessed via ''block I/O'' may be devices internal to a server, directly attached via [[SCSI]] or [[Fibre Channel]], or distant devices accessed via a [[storage area network]] (SAN) using a protocol such as [[iSCSI]], or [[ATA over Ethernet|AoE]]. DBMSes often use their own block I/O for improved performance and recoverability as compared to layering the DBMS on top of a file system.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"CNET14\">{{cite news |author=<!-- staff writer, no byline --> |title=Available hard drive space, block sizes, and size terminology |newspaper=CNET |date=2009-05-05 |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/available-hard-drive-space-block-sizes-and-size-terminology/ |access-date=2014-04-29}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Chang\">{{cite web |author-last=Chang |author-first=S.

A term other than ''[[character (computing)|character]]'' is used here because a given character may be represented in different applications by more than one code, and different codes may use different numbers of bits (i.e., different byte sizes). In input-output transmission the grouping of bits may be completely arbitrary and have no relation to actual characters. (The term is coined from ''[[bite]]'', but respelled to avoid accidental mutation to ''bit''.)<br/>A ''[[word (computer architecture)|word]]'' consists of the number of data bits transmitted in parallel from or to memory in one memory cycle. [[Word size]] is thus defined as a structural property of the memory. (The term ''[[catena (unit)|catena]]'' was coined for this purpose by the designers of the [[Groupe Bull|Bull]] {{ill|Bull Gamma 60{{!}}GAMMA 60|fr|Gamma 60}} computer.)<br/>''Block'' refers to the number of words transmitted to or from an input-output unit in response to a single input-output instruction. Block size is a structural property of an input-output unit; it may have been fixed by the design or left to be varied by the program.
