Up until 2005, the only way to share files was by creating a small text file called a \"[[Torrent file|torrent]]\", that they would upload to a torrent index site. The first uploader acted as a ''[[Terminology of BitTorrent#Seed|seed]]'', and downloaders would initially connect as ''[[Terminology of BitTorrent#Peer|peers]]''. Those who wish to download the file would download the torrent, which their client would use to connect to a tracker which had a list of the IP addresses of other seeds and peers in the swarm. Once a peer completed a download of the complete file, it could in turn function as a seed. These files contain [[metadata]] about the files to be shared and the [[BitTorrent tracker|trackers]] which keep track of the other seeds and peers.\n\nIn 2005, first [[Vuze]] and then the BitTorrent client introduced distributed tracking using distributed hash tables which allowed clients to exchange data on swarms directly without the need for a torrent file.\n\nIn 2006, peer exchange functionality was added allowing clients to add peers based on the data found on connected nodes.\n\nBitTorrent v2 is intended to work seamlessly with previous versions of the BitTorrent protocol. The main reason for the update was that the old [[cryptographic hash function]], [[SHA-1]] is [[SHA-1#Attacks|no longer considered safe from malicious attacks]] by the developers, and as such, v2 uses [[SHA-256]]. To ensure backwards compatibility, the v2 .torrent file format supports a hybrid mode where the torrents are hashed through both the new method and the old method, with the intent that the files will be shared with peers on both v1 and v2 swarms. Another update to the specification is adding a [[Merkle tree|hash tree]] to speed up time from adding a torrent to downloading files, and to allow more granular checks for file corruption. In addition, each file is now hashed individually, enabling files in the swarm to be deduplicated, so that if multiple torrents include the same files, but seeders are only seeding the file from some, downloaders of the other torrents can still download the file. Magnet links for v2 also support a hybrid mode to ensure support for legacy clients.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bittorrent-v2 |url=https://blog.libtorrent.org/2020/09/bittorrent-v2/ |website=libbittorrent.org |publisher=libbittorrent |access-date=28 October 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Torrentcomp small.gif|thumb|Animation of [[Communications protocol|protocol]] use: The colored dots beneath each computer in the animation represent different parts of the [[file sharing|file being shared]]. By the time a copy to a destination computer of each of those parts completes, a copy to another destination computer of that part (or other parts) is already taking place between users.]]\n\nThe BitTorrent protocol can be used to reduce the server and network impact of distributing large files. Rather than downloading a file from a single source server, the BitTorrent protocol allows users to join a \"swarm\" of hosts to upload and download from each other simultaneously. The protocol is an alternative to the older single source, multiple mirror sources technique for distributing data, and can work effectively over networks with lower [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]. Using the BitTorrent protocol, several basic computers, such as home computers, can replace large servers while efficiently distributing files to many recipients. This lower bandwidth usage also helps prevent large spikes in [[internet traffic]] in a given area, keeping internet speeds higher for all users in general, regardless of whether or not they use the BitTorrent protocol.\n\nThe file being distributed is divided into segments called ''pieces''. As each peer receives a new piece of the file, it becomes a source (of that piece) for other peers, relieving the original seed from having to send that piece to every computer or user wishing a copy. With BitTorrent, the task of distributing the file is shared by those who want it; it is entirely possible for the seed to send only a single copy of the file itself and eventually distribute to an unlimited number of peers. Each piece is protected by a [[cryptographic hash]] contained in the torrent descriptor.<ref name=\"Protocol1.0\"/> This ensures that any modification of the piece can be reliably detected, and thus prevents both accidental and malicious modifications of any of the pieces received at other nodes. If a node starts with an authentic copy of the torrent descriptor, it can verify the authenticity of the entire file it receives.\n\nPieces are typically downloaded non-sequentially, and are rearranged into the correct order by the BitTorrent client, which monitors which pieces it needs, and which pieces it has and can upload to other peers. Pieces are of the same size throughout a single download (for example, a 10&nbsp;MB file may be transmitted as ten 1&nbsp;MB pieces or as forty 256&nbsp;KB pieces).\nDue to the nature of this approach, the download of any file can be halted at any time and be resumed at a later date, without the loss of previously downloaded information, which in turn makes BitTorrent particularly useful in the transfer of larger files. This also enables the client to seek out readily available pieces and download them immediately, rather than halting the download and waiting for the next (and possibly unavailable) piece in line, which typically reduces the overall time of the download.  This eventual transition from peers to seeders determines the overall \"health\" of the file (as determined by the number of times a file is available in its complete form).\n\nThe distributed nature of BitTorrent can lead to a [[Flooding algorithm|flood-like]] spreading of a file throughout many peer computer nodes. As more peers join the swarm, the likelihood of a successful download by any particular node increases. Relative to traditional Internet distribution schemes, this permits a significant reduction in the original distributor's hardware and bandwidth resource costs. Distributed downloading protocols in general provide [[wikt:redundancy|redundancy]] against system problems, reduce dependence on the original distributor,<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=1004.0395|title=Estimating Self-Sustainability in Peer-to-Peer Swarming Systems |journal=Performance Evaluation |volume=67 |issue=11 |pages=1243–1258 |last1= Menasche |first1=Daniel S. |last2= Rocha |first2=Antonio A.

However, this protection, theoretically, comes at a cost: downloads can take time to rise to full speed because it may take time for enough peer connections to be established, and it may take time for a node to receive sufficient data to become an effective uploader. This contrasts with regular downloads (such as from an HTTP server, for example) that, while more vulnerable to overload and abuse, rise to full speed very quickly, and maintain this speed throughout. In the beginning, BitTorrent's non-contiguous download methods made it harder to support \"streaming playback\". In 2014, the client [[Popcorn Time]] allowed for streaming of BitTorrent video files. Since then, more and more clients are offering streaming options.\n\n=== Searching ===\n\nThe BitTorrent protocol provides no way to index torrent files. As a result, a comparatively small number of websites have hosted a large majority of torrents, many linking to copyrighted works without the authorization of copyright holders, rendering those sites especially vulnerable to lawsuits.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://torrentfreak.com/publicbt-tracker-set-to-patch-bittorrents-achilles-heel-090712/| title=PublicBT Tracker Set To Patch BitTorrent' Achilles' Heel| date=12 July 2009| publisher=Torrentfreak |author=Ernesto |access-date=14 July 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140326093356/http://torrentfreak.com/publicbt-tracker-set-to-patch-bittorrents-achilles-heel-090712/ | archive-date = 26 March 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> A BitTorrent index is a \"list of [[Torrent file|.torrent files]], which typically includes descriptions\" and information about the torrent's content.<ref>Chwan-Hwa (John) Wu, J. David Irwin. ''Introduction to Computer Networks and Cybersecurity''. Chapter 5.4.: Partially Centralized Architectures. [[CRC Press]]. 4 February 2013. {{ISBN|9781466572133}}</ref> Several types of websites support the discovery and distribution of data on the BitTorrent network. Public torrent-hosting sites such as [[The Pirate Bay]] allow users to search and download from their collection of torrent files. Users can typically also upload torrent files for content they wish to distribute. Often, these sites also run [[BitTorrent tracker]]s for their hosted torrent files, but these two functions are not mutually dependent: a torrent file could be hosted on one site and tracked by another unrelated site. Private host/tracker sites operate like public ones except that they may restrict access to registered users and may also keep track of the amount of data each user uploads and downloads, in an attempt to reduce \"[[leech (computing)|leeching]]\".\n\n[[Web search engine]]s allow the discovery of torrent files that are hosted and tracked on other sites; examples include [[The Pirate Bay]] and [[BTDigg]]. These sites allow the user to ask for content meeting specific criteria (such as containing a given word or phrase) and retrieve a list of links to torrent files matching those criteria. This list can often be sorted with respect to several criteria, relevance (seeders-leechers ratio) being one of the most popular and useful (due to the way the protocol behaves, the download bandwidth achievable is very sensitive to this value). [[Metasearch engine]]s allow one to search several BitTorrent indices and search engines at once.\n\nThe [[Tribler]] BitTorrent client was among the first to incorporate built-in search capabilities.  With Tribler, users can find .torrent files held by random peers and taste buddies.<ref>Zeilemaker, N., Capotă, M., Bakker, A., & Pouwelse, J. (2011). \"Tribler P2P Media Search and Sharing.\" Proceedings of the 19th ACM International Conference on Multimedia - MM ’11.</ref> It adds such an ability to the BitTorrent protocol using a [[gossip protocol]], somewhat similar to the [[eXeem]] network which was shut down in 2005. The software includes the ability to recommend content as well. After a dozen downloads, the Tribler software can roughly estimate the download taste of the user, and recommend additional content.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tribler.org/DecentralizedRecommendation |title=DecentralizedRecommendation – |publisher=Tribler.org |access-date=9 July 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202143338/http://www.tribler.org/DecentralizedRecommendation | archive-date = 2 December 2008| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2007, researchers at [[Cornell University]] published a paper proposing a new approach to searching a peer-to-peer network for inexact strings,<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/papers/hyperspaces.pdf|title=Hyperspaces for Object Clustering and Approximate Matching in Peer-to-Peer Overlays|author=Wong, Bernard|author2=Vigfusson, Ymir|date=2 May 2007<!-- from PDF-->|publisher=Cornell University|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617065142/http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/egs/papers/hyperspaces.pdf|archive-date=17 June 2012|access-date=7 April 2013|author3=Gun Sirer, Emin|df=dmy-all}}\n</ref> which could replace the functionality of a central indexing site.

Whenever two peers using BitComet (with Torrent Exchange enabled) connect to each other they exchange lists of all the torrents (name and info-hash) they have in the Torrent Share storage (torrent files which were previously downloaded and for which the user chose to enable sharing by Torrent Exchange). Thus each client builds up a list of all the torrents shared by the peers it connected to in the current session (or it can even maintain the list between sessions if instructed).\n\nAt any time the user can search into that Torrent Collection list for a certain torrent and sort the list by categories. When the user chooses to download a torrent from that list, the .torrent file is automatically searched for (by info-hash value) in the [[Distributed hash table|DHT Network]] and when found it is downloaded by the querying client which can after that create and initiate a downloading task.\n\n=== Downloading and sharing ===\n\nUsers find a torrent of interest on a torrent index site or by using a search engine built into the client, download it, and open it with a BitTorrent client. The client connects to the tracker(s) or seeds specified in the torrent file, from which it receives a list of seeds and peers currently transferring pieces of the file(s). The client connects to those peers to obtain the various pieces. If the swarm contains only the initial seeder, the client connects directly to it, and begins to request pieces. Clients incorporate mechanisms to optimize their download and upload rates.\n\nThe effectiveness of this data exchange depends largely on the policies that clients use to determine to whom to send data. Clients may prefer to send data to peers that send data back to them (a \"[[tit for tat]]\" exchange scheme), which encourages fair trading. But strict policies often result in suboptimal situations, such as when newly joined peers are unable to receive any data because they don't have any pieces yet to trade themselves or when two peers with a good connection between them do not exchange data simply because neither of them takes the initiative. To counter these effects, the official BitTorrent client program uses a mechanism called \"optimistic unchoking\", whereby the client reserves a portion of its available [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] for sending pieces to random peers (not necessarily known good partners, so called preferred peers) in hopes of discovering even better partners and to ensure that newcomers get a chance to join the swarm.<ref name = \"Tamilmanistudy\" >{{cite web| url=http://mnl.cs.stonybrook.edu/home/karthik/BitTorrent/Robustness_of_BT.doc |title=Studying and enhancing the BitTorrent protocol |first=Karthik |last=Tamilmani |publisher=Stony Brook University |date=25 October 2003 |access-date=6 May 2006 |format=DOC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041119150847/http://mnl.cs.stonybrook.edu/home/karthik/BitTorrent/Robustness_of_BT.doc |archive-date=19 November 2004}}</ref><!-- mnl.cs.stonybrook.edu down, subst archive.org link -->\n\nAlthough \"swarming\" scales well to tolerate \"flash crowds\" for popular content, it is less useful for unpopular or [[niche market]] content. Peers arriving after the initial rush might find the content unavailable and need to wait for the arrival of a \"seed\" in order to complete their downloads.

The exact information contained in the torrent file depends on the version of the BitTorrent protocol.\n\nBy convention, the name of a torrent file has the suffix <code>.torrent</code>. Torrent files have an \"announce\" section, which specifies the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of the tracker, and an \"info\" section, containing (suggested) names for the files, their lengths, the piece length used, and a [[SHA-1]] [[hash code]] for each piece, all of which are used by clients to verify the integrity of the data they receive. Though SHA-1 has shown signs of cryptographic weakness, Bram Cohen did not initially consider the risk big enough for a backward incompatible change to, for example, [[SHA-3]]. As of BitTorrent v2 the hash function has been updated to SHA-256.<ref>{{Cite web|title=» BitTorrent v2|url=https://blog.libtorrent.org/2020/09/bittorrent-v2/|access-date=2020-09-27|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn the early days, torrent files were typically published to torrent index websites, and registered with at least one tracker.

One can usually see the [[IP address]]es of all peers in a swarm in one's own client or firewall program.  This may expose users with insecure systems to attacks.<ref name=\"Tamilmanistudy\" /> In some countries, copyright organizations scrape lists of peers, and send takedown notices to the [[internet service provider]] of users participating in the swarms of files that are under copyright.  In some jurisdictions, copyright holders may launch lawsuits against uploaders or downloaders for infringement, and police may arrest suspects in such cases.\n\nVarious means have been used to promote anonymity.  For example, the BitTorrent client [[Tribler]] makes available a [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]-like [[onion routing|onion network]], optionally routing transfers through other peers to obscure which client has requested the data.  The exit node would be visible to peers in a swarm, but the Tribler organization provides exit nodes.  One advantage of Tribler is that [[Clearnet (networking)|clearnet]] torrents can be downloaded with only a small decrease in download speed from one \"hop\" of routing.\n\n[[i2p]] provides a similar anonymity layer although in that case, one can only download torrents that have been uploaded to the i2p network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://geti2p.net/en/comparison/tor|title=I2P Compared to Tor - I2P|access-date=16 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222000747/https://geti2p.net/en/comparison/tor|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  The bittorrent client [[Vuze]] allows users who are not concerned about anonymity to take [[Clearnet (networking)|clearnet]] torrents, and make them available on the [[i2p]] network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.vuze.com/w/I2PHelper_HowTo#Network_Mixing|title=I2PHelper HowTo - VuzeWiki|access-date=16 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020084042/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/I2PHelper_HowTo#Network_Mixing|archive-date=20 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMost BitTorrent clients are not designed to provide anonymity when used over [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea|title=Bittorrent over Tor isn't a good idea - The Tor Blog|access-date=2 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013120154/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea|archive-date=13 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and there is some debate as to whether torrenting over Tor acts as a drag on the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#FileSharing|title=Tor Project: FAQ|first=The Tor Project|last=Inc.|access-date=2 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022004822/https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#FileSharing|archive-date=22 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n \nPrivate torrent trackers are usually invitation only, and require members to participate in uploading, but have the downside of a single centralized point of failure.

The following month, BitTorrent, Inc. released version 4.2.0 of the Mainline BitTorrent client, which supported an alternative DHT implementation (popularly known as \"[[Mainline DHT]]\", outlined in a draft on their website) that is incompatible with that of Azureus. In 2014, measurement showed concurrent users of Mainline DHT to be from 10 million to 25&nbsp;million, with a daily churn of at least 10&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Liang|last2=Kangasharju|first2=Jussi.|year=2013|title=Measuring Large-Scale Distributed Systems: Case of BitTorrent Mainline DHT|url=https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/lxwang/publications/P2P2013_13.pdf|url-status=live|journal=IEEE Peer-to-Peer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512225743/http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/lxwang/publications/P2P2013_13.pdf|archive-date=12 May 2014|access-date=15 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCurrent versions of the official [[BitTorrent (software)|BitTorrent client]], [[μTorrent]], [[BitComet]], [[Transmission (BitTorrent client)|Transmission]] and BitSpirit all share compatibility with Mainline DHT.

This idea is based on the distributed tracker approach and is used to describe some web resource. Currently, it is used for [[instant messaging]]. It is implemented using a special messaging protocol and requires an appropriate plugin. Anatomic P2P is another approach, which uses a decentralized network of nodes that route traffic to dynamic trackers. Most BitTorrent clients also use [[Peer exchange]] (PEX) to gather peers in addition to [[BitTorrent tracker|trackers]] and [[Distributed hash table|DHT]]. Peer exchange checks with known peers to see if they know of any other peers. With the 3.0.5.0 release of Vuze, all major BitTorrent clients now have compatible peer exchange.\n\n=== Web seeding ===\n\nWeb \"seeding\" was implemented in 2006 as the ability of BitTorrent clients to download torrent pieces from an HTTP source in addition to the \"swarm\". The advantage of this feature is that a website may distribute a torrent for a particular file or batch of files and make those files available for download from that same web server; this can simplify long-term seeding and [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] through the use of existing, cheap, web hosting setups. In theory, this would make using BitTorrent almost as easy for a web publisher as creating a direct HTTP download. In addition, it would allow the \"web seed\" to be disabled if the swarm becomes too popular while still allowing the file to be readily available. This feature has two distinct specifications, both of which are supported by [[Libtorrent]] and the 26+ clients that use it.\n\nThe first was created by John \"TheSHAD0W\" Hoffman, who created BitTornado.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bittornado.com/docs/webseed-spec.txt |title=HTTP-Based Seeding Specification |format=TXT |publisher=BitTornado.com |access-date=9 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040320142756/http://www.bittornado.com/docs/webseed-spec.txt |archive-date=20 March 2004 |url-status=dead|df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0017.html|title=''HTTP Seeding'' – BitTorrent Enhancement Proposal № 17|author=John Hoffman, DeHackEd|date=25 February 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213074432/http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0017.html|archive-date=13 December 2013|access-date=17 February 2012}}</ref> This first specification requires running a web service that serves content by info-hash and piece number, rather than filename.\n\nThe other specification is created by [[GetRight]] authors and can rely on a basic HTTP download space (using [[byte serving]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getright.com/seedtorrent.html|title=HTTP/FTP Seeding for BitTorrent |publisher=GetRight.com|access-date=18 March 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091228072458/http://getright.com/seedtorrent.html |archive-date = 28 December 2009| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html|title=''WebSeed – HTTP/FTP Seeding (GetRight style)'' – BitTorrent Enhancement Proposal № 19|author=Michael Burford|date=25 February 2008|publisher=Bittorrent.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213074337/http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html|archive-date=13 December 2013|access-date=17 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2010, a new service named Burnbit was launched which generates a torrent from any URL using webseeding.<ref name=\"tf-article\">{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/burn-any-web-hosted-file-into-a-torrent-with-burnbit-100913/|title=Burn Any Web-Hosted File into a Torrent With Burnbit|date=13 September 2010|publisher=TorrentFreak|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809053857/http://torrentfreak.com/burn-any-web-hosted-file-into-a-torrent-with-burnbit-100913/|archive-date=9 August 2011|access-date=9 July 2012}}</ref> There are server-side solutions that provide initial seeding of the file from the web server via standard BitTorrent protocol and when the number of external seeders reach a limit, they stop serving the file from the original source.<ref name=\"web-seeders\">{{cite web|url=http://php-tracker.org/ |title=PHP based torrent file creator, tracker and seed server |publisher=PHPTracker |access-date=9 July 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131219084439/http://php-tracker.org/ | archive-date = 19 December 2013| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== RSS feeds ===\n{{Main|Broadcatching}}\n\nA technique called [[broadcatching]] combines [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feeds with the BitTorrent protocol to create a content delivery system, further simplifying and automating content distribution.

There has been much controversy over the use of BitTorrent trackers. BitTorrent metafiles themselves do not store file contents. Whether the publishers of BitTorrent metafiles violate copyrights by linking to copyrighted works without the authorization of copyright holders is controversial. Various jurisdictions have pursued legal action against websites that host BitTorrent trackers.\n\nHigh-profile examples include the closing of [[Suprnova.org]], [[TorrentSpy]], [[LokiTorrent]], [[BTJunkie]], [[Mininova]], [[Oink's Pink Palace]] and [[What.cd]]. [[The Pirate Bay]] torrent website, formed by a Swedish group, is noted for the \"legal\" section of its website in which letters and replies on the subject of alleged copyright infringements are publicly displayed. On 31 May 2006, The Pirate Bay's servers in Sweden were raided by Swedish police on allegations by the MPAA of copyright infringement;<ref>{{cite web| url=http://torrentfreak.com/the-piratebay-is-down-raided-by-the-swedish-police/| date=31 May 2006| publisher=TorrentFreak| title=The Piratebay is Down: Raided by the Swedish Police| access-date=20 May 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140416060632/https://torrentfreak.com/the-piratebay-is-down-raided-by-the-swedish-police/ | archive-date = 16 April 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> however, the tracker was up and running again three days later.

BitTorrent implementations often use [[μTP]] for their communication. To achieve high bandwidths, the underlying protocol used is [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]], which allows spoofing of source addresses of internet traffic.
