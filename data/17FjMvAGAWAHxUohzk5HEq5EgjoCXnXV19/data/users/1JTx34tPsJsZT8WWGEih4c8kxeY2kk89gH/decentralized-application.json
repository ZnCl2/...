A DApp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language that can make calls to its backend.\n\nDecentralized applications are stored on and executed by a [[Blockchain|blockchain system]] such as [[Ethereum]] or [[Bitcoin]].  DApps are typically open-source. Validation of a DApp is incentivized via tokens to, in compliance with a specific protocol agreed upon within the community.{{cn|date=October 2021}}\n\nThe [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] hosted conferences on DApps in 2019 and 2020.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDApps have been utilized in [[decentralized finance]] (DeFi), in which dapps that perform financial functions on [[blockchains]].<ref name=\"bloomberg.com\">{{cite web |title=Why 'DeFi' Utopia Would Be Finance Without Financiers: QuickTake |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-26/why-defi-utopia-would-be-finance-without-financiers-quicktake |website=Bloomberg.com |language=en|date=26 August 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== DApp Browsers ===\nAll the DApps have a unique code that may only work on a specific platform.
