The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.\n\nBlockchains are typically managed by a [[peer-to-peer]] network for use as a publicly [[distributed ledger]], where nodes collectively adhere to a [[communication protocol|protocol]] to communicate and validate new blocks.

Participant and validator access is [[Closed platform|restricted]]. To distinguish between open blockchains and other peer-to-peer decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters, the terminology [[Distributed Ledger]] (DLT) is normally used for private blockchains.\n\n===Hybrid blockchains===\nA hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features.<ref>[Distributed Ledger Technology: Hybrid Approach, Front-to-Back Designing and Changing Trade Processing Infrastructure, By Martin Walker, First published:, 24 OCT 2018 {{ISBN|978-1-78272-389-9}}]</ref> The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization decentralization are used.\n\n===Sidechains===\nA sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary blockchain.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Siraj Raval |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvywDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA22 |title=Decentralized Applications: Harnessing Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology |date=18 July 2016 |publisher=\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\" |isbn=978-1-4919-2452-5 |pages=22–}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Niaz Chowdhury |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HatDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA22 |title=Inside Blockchain, Bitcoin, and Cryptocurrencies |date=16 August 2019 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-00-050770-6 |pages=22–}}</ref> Entries from the primary blockchain (where said entries typically represent [[digital asset]]s) can be linked to and from the sidechain; this allows the sidechain to otherwise operate independently of the primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means of record keeping, alternate [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus algorithm]], etc.).<ref>{{US patent|10438290}}</ref>\n\n==Interoperability==\n\nWith the increasing number of blockchain systems appearing, even only those that support cryptocurrencies, '''blockchain interoperability''' is becoming a topic of major importance. The objective is to support transferring assets from one blockchain system to another blockchain system. Wegner{{R|wegner}} stated that \"interoperability is the ability of two or more software components to cooperate despite differences in language, interface, and execution platform\". The objective of blockchain interoperability is therefore to support such cooperation among blockchain systems, despite those kinds of differences.\n\nThere are already several blockchain interoperability solutions available.{{R|survey}} They can be classified in three categories: cryptocurrency interoperability approaches, blockchain engines, and blockchain connectors.\n\nThe IETF has a recent Blockchain-interop working group that already produced the draft of a blockchain interoperability architecture.{{R|ietf-draft}}\n\n== High energy consumption ==\nBlockchain mining — the peer-to-peer computer computations by which transactions are validated and verified — requires a significant amount of energy.
