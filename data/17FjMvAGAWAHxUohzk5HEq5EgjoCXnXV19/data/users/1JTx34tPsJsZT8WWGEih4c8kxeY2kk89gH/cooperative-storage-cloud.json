For the cooperative scheme to be viable, the total storage contributed in aggregate must be at least equal to the amount of storage needed by end users.  However, some nodes may contribute less storage and some may contribute more.  There may be reward models to compensate the nodes contributing more.\n\nUnlike a traditional [[Cloud storage|storage cloud]], a cooperative does not directly employ dedicated servers for the actual storage of the data, thereby eliminating the need for a significant dedicated hardware investment. Each node in the cooperative runs specialized [[software]] which communicates with a centralized{{cn|date=April 2017}} control and orchestration server, thereby allowing the node to both consume and contribute storage space to the cloud. The centralized control and orchestration server requires several orders of magnitude less resources (storage, computing power, and bandwidth) to operate, relative to the overall capacity of the cooperative.\n\n== Data security ==\nFiles hosted in the cloud are fragmented and [[Encryption|encrypted]] before leaving the local machine. They are then distributed randomly using a [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] and [[geo-distribution]] [[algorithm]] to other nodes in the cooperative. Users can add an additional layer of [[Information security|security]] and reduce storage space by [[Data compression|compressing]] and encrypting files before they are copied to the cloud.\n\n== Data redundancy ==\nIn order to maintain [[data integrity]] and high availability across a relatively unreliable set of computers over a [[wide area network]] like the [[Internet]], the source node will add some level of [[Data redundancy|redundancy]] to each [[Block (data storage)|data block]].<ref name=computerworld/> This allows the system to recreate the entire block even if some nodes are temporarily unavailable (due to loss of network connectivity, the machine being powered off or a hardware failure).  The most storage and [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] efficient forms of redundancy use [[Erasure code|erasure coding]] techniques like [[Reed–Solomon error correction|Reed–Solomon]].  A simple, less [[CPU]] intensive but more expensive form of redundancy is duplicate copies.\n\n== Flexible contribution ==\nDue to bandwidth or hardware constraints some nodes may not be able to contribute as much space as they consume in the cloud. On the other hand, nodes with large storage space and limited or no bandwidth constraints may contribute more than they consume, thereby the cooperative can stay in balance.\n\n== Examples ==\nExamples include MIT's [[Chord_(peer-to-peer)|Chord]],<ref name=computerworld/> [[Filecoin]], [[Siacoin]], and [https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Storj Storj].\n\nA partly centralized system was operated by Symform, Inc., a [[startup company]] based in [[Seattle]].<ref name=\"computerworld\">{{cite web|last=Mearian|first=Lucas|title=Start-up unveils cloud storage co-op|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9138257/Start_up_unveils_cloud_storage_co_op|work=[[Computerworld]]|date=2009-09-21|accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref><ref name=xconomy>{{cite web|last=Huang|first=Gregory T|title=Symform, Founded by Ex-Microsoft Pair, Offers Cheap, Efficient Data Storage in the Cloud|url=http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2009/02/19/symform-founded-by-ex-microsoft-pair-offers-cheap-efficient-data-storage-in-the-cloud/|work=Xconomy|date=2009-02-19|accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref> Symform generated and kept the keys used to encrypt and decrypt, and since it also decided which server will host which parts of a file, users have to trust Symform not to share those with any other party or misuse the information.<ref>{{cite web|title=Symform Security Analysis|date=December 19, 2012|work=VirtualServerGuy|url=http://virtualserverguy.com/blog/2012/12/19/symform-security-analysis|access-date=May 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526171603/http://virtualserverguy.com/blog/2012/12/19/symform-security-analysis|archive-date=May 26, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Symform discontinued its service on July 31, 2016.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cloud computing]]\n*[[Cyber Resilience]]\n*[[Distributed data store]]\n*[[Freenet]]\n*[[InterPlanetary File System]]\n*[[Tahoe-LAFS]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cloud storage]]\n[[Category:Cloud computing]]\n[[Category:Distributed data storage]]",
