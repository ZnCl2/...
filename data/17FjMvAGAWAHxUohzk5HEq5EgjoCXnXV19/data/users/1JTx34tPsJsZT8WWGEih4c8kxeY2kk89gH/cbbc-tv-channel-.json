CBBC broadcasts for fourteen hours per-day from 7:00&nbsp;am to 9:00&nbsp;pm. CBBC was named Channel of the Year at the Children's [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards in November 2008 and 2012 and 2015. The channel averages 300,000 viewers daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7758184.stm|title=Bafta honour for Chuckle Brothers|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe channel originally shared bandwidth on the [[Freeview (UK)|digital terrestrial television]] platform with [[BBC Choice]],<ref>{{cite news|work=Digital Spy|access-date=18 July 2007|date=9 September 2002|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/news/a6198/new-childrens-channels-from-bbc-launch.html|title=New children's channels from BBC launch}}</ref> and later [[BBC Three]], needing that CBBC sign off at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. daily.

BBC Children's was originally based in the East Tower of [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] since the department's inception, but moved to [[MediaCityUK]] in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] in September 2011, and the live presentation links used throughout the day are now recorded and broadcast from there.\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of BBC children's television programmes}}\n\n{{quotation|The remit of CBBC is to provide a wide range of high quality, distinctive content for 6−17–year olds, including comedy, entertainment, drama, animation, news and factual. The great majority of this content should be produced in the UK. CBBC should provide a stimulating, creative and enjoyable environment that is also safe and trusted. The service should have a particular focus on informal learning, with an emphasis on encouraging participation.|2=CBBC Remit<ref>{{cite web|title=CBBC Service License|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/service_licences/tv/2010/cbbc_may10.pdf|publisher=BBC Trust|access-date=11 October 2011}}</ref>}}\n\nCBBC's programming output is very similar to the strand previously shown on BBC One. CBBC often complements this strand with programmes shown earlier than on the terrestrial channels, repeats or whole series shown in a day,{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} alongside other exclusive commissions.\n\n===Most viewed programmes===\nThe following is a list of the ten most watched shows on CBBC, based on Live +7 data supplied by [[BARB]].<ref name=\"barb\">[[BARB]], via [http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-10?]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Much of this programming was old [[BBC Schools]] programming shown, in some cases, decades before and which was for the most part still relevant. Very little new schools programmes were commissioned. Class TV ended in April 2010, following a change to CBBC's remit. However, in December 2019, CBBC brought back Class TV with 'Live Lessons' presented by the CBBC presenting team on late weekday mornings.\n\nDue to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom]] and the closure of schools around the country during the first & third national lockdowns, CBBC broadcast shows from the [[Bitesize|BBC Bitesize]] service for [[primary school|primary-school]]-aged children. These shows featured a mix of archive, live and newly filmed content. Many CBBC TV shows played regular repeats from old episodes, however the children's magazine TV show [[Blue Peter]] still aired on Thursdays. Changes was made to [[Blue Peter]] and weekly live episodes stopped due to [[COVID-19]] . Blue Peter in 2020 had a new presenter [[Adam Beales]] known as Adam B who is also a YouTuber and actor. This was to attract more children to the children's magazine show during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and also to the CBBC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-55552962|title=BBC to put lessons on TV during lockdown|work=[[BBC News]]|date=5 January 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Presentation==\n{{see also|BBC Children's idents}}\nCBBC has had a relatively similar presentation to that of its strand counterpart. The logo has consistently remained the same until 2016 as the service; green coloured blobs at the beginning of its life and the green and white logo from September 2007 until now. The logo today is all different colours unlike the last one. CBBC has mainly utilised presenters from the main service, with a few presenters appearing mostly on the new channel; [[Gemma Hunt]] and [[Anne Foy]] being notable examples and appearing consistently until August 2007. At the beginning of September 2007, along with the relaunch, the same presenters of CBBC would also feature on CBBC on BBC One and Two.\n\nWhen CBBC launched, presentation was located in [[TC1 studio|TC2]] at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]], where the channel shared studio facilities with CBBC's original magazine show ''[[Xchange (TV series)|Xchange]]''. This changed in Autumn 2004, when CBBC moved to [[TC1 studio|TC9]] following the normal CBBC links move to [[TC1 studio|TC1]]0; however, this was changed in March 2006 so that all CBBC and CBBC channel links were located in TC9. A further change was to take place in December 2006 when all output moved to a [[Chroma key]] set within [[TC1 studio|TC1]]2, and was presented by only one presenter. This short live decision lasted until the relaunch in 2007, which involved a new 'office' set being constructed, initially in TC12 and then in a new studio facility in the East Tower of Television Centre.\n\nIn 2011, CBBC moved to [[MediaCityUK]], and has been presented from there since September 2011. The Office has been through a number of revamps since then, two in 2015, the first one being a minor change because of the Go CBBC app, and another one in May which entirely changed some of the structure, adding a post chute and an Up Next screen, and one so far in 2016, due to CBBC's new look, gaining a smaller desk, an extra Up Next screen, and renaming it 'CBBC HQ'.\n\n==Other services==\n===CBBC Extra===\nCBBC Extra is a free interactive television service from CBBC provided by the [[BBC Red Button]]. It is accessible from CBBC by pressing red and then selecting CBBC Extra from the main menu. It can also be accessed from any other BBC channel by pressing red and going to page number 570. The service differs across digital platforms, for example [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky]] viewers can access a video loop. After a brief stint with a temporary producer the channel really took off under producer and director Brendan Sheppard who spearheaded its success. After Sheppard had finished work on the BAFTA nominated ''Nelly Nut Live'' he was asked by CBBC controller Gary August to work on CBBC Extra and under Sheppard the show received a new brand look, idents, graphics and it introduced feature items such as Ask Aaron and a Halloween special with Basil Brush, there was a ''Doctor Who'' special with sequences featuring K9 that had to be cut at the last minute and a documentary series called ''Really Living It!'' Sheppard was then asked to direct ''DinoSapien'' in Canada and a new producer was installed with Sheppard later moving on to ''Doctor Who''. Its availability on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] is dependent upon [[BBC Red Button]] not showing other interactive services, such as major sports events coverage.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=CBBC |access-date=21 May 2007 |date=21 May 2007 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/content/articles/2005/11/09/otherservices_cbbcextra_feature.shtml |title=CBBC- CBBC extra |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222002619/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/content/articles/2005/11/09/otherservices_cbbcextra_feature.shtml |archive-date=22 February 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The service offers numerous features including ''[[Newsround]]'', horoscopes, Chris/Dodge's blog, viewer content and jokes and other interactive elements.\n\nAs of May 2016, CBBC Extra was closed down along with its rebrand.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/topics/cbbc-extra-behind-the-scenes |title=CBBC Extra |publisher=BBC |access-date=29 January 2014 |archive-date=13 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113040310/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/topics/cbbc-extra-behind-the-scenes |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===CBBC Online===\n{{main|BBC Online}}\nThe CBBC website provides a wide range of activities for viewers aged 6–15, such as games, videos, puzzles, printable pages, pre-moderated message boards and frequently updated news feeds. It contains pages for the majority of its current programming with various content on each. There are also micro-sites from ''[[Newsround]]'' and ''[[MOTD Kickabout]]'', providing children with news and sport, as well as the CBBC on [[BBC iPlayer]] to replay CBBC programmes for up to thirty days.\n\n===CBBC HD===\nIn July 2013, BBC announced that CBBC HD would be launched by early 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23326709|title=BBC to launch five new HD channels|date=16 July 2013|work=BBC News|access-date=16 July 2013}}</ref> The channel launched on 10 December 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/new-hd-channels.html|title=BBC to launch five new subscription-free HD channels on Tuesday 10 December|date=9 December 2013|publisher=BBC|access-date=9 December 2013|archive-date=11 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211204948/http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/new-hd-channels.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> CBBC HD broadcasts on the BBC's existing HD multiplex on Freeview and shares its stream with [[BBC Three|BBC Three HD]] as they air at different times.\n\nPrior to launch, the majority of CBBC HD output was broadcast on [[BBC HD]] before its closure in March 2013. CBBC HD was added to the Sky EPG in Ireland in 2017.\n\nFrom July to August 2014, CBBC HD was temporarily removed from Freeview during the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] to let [[BBC Three]] and BBC Three HD broadcast 24 hours a day, similar to how [[BBC Parliament]] was removed during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics]].\n\nFrom March to April 2018, CBBC HD used downtime mode to let [[BBC Red Button HD]] broadcast 9pm to 5:30am on Sky and Freeview. After the close, CBBC HD began to use 24 hours again.\n\nSince BBC Scotland launched, CBBC HD finishes at 19:00 in Scotland, due to it timesharing with BBC Scotland HD, which starts at 19:00, however CBBC SD still finishes at 21:00 in Scotland.\n\n===CBBC Alba===\nIn September 2018 as part of a branding strategy, the unbranded 2-hour children's block on [[BBC Alba]] was split into [[CBeebies|CBeebies Alba]] and CBBC Alba, with the former airing during the first hour and the latter airing during the second hour. This block features its own presentation, presenters and shows all dubbed into [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nPreviously, a similar block called ''Children's BBC Scotland'' was aired in the Scottish school holidays throughout the 1990s. The block consisted of repeats and local programming as well as regional versions of the summer holiday mid-morning slot and the Children's BBC Breakfast Show.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VewFEow48ps</ref>\n\n==International Versions==\n===Australia===\nOn 15 March 2021, it was announced by Australian provider Fetch TV that they would launch a channel called \"[[BBC Kids (Australian TV channel)|BBC Kids]]\"<ref name=\"fetch\">{{Cite web|last=Brzoznowski|first=Kristin|date=22 March 2021|title=BBC Kids to Launch on Fetch in Australia|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvkids/bbc-kids-to-launch-on-fetch-in-australia/|access-date=6 April 2021|website=TVKIDS|language=en-US}}</ref> (unrelated to a Canadian [[BBC Kids|BBC-branded channel of the same name]]) on 24 April 2021 to replace [[Cartoon Network (Australian and New Zealand TV channel)|Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (Australian and New Zealand TV channel)|Boomerang]].
