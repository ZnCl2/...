            "text": "History\n\nRosmarinic acid was first isolated and characterized in 1958 by the Italian chemists M. L. Scarpatti and G. Oriente from rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis).\n\nChemistry\n\nChemically, rosmarinic acid is a caffeic acid ester of salvianic acid A (3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid).\n\nNatural occurrences\n\nRosmarinic acid accumulation is shown in hornworts, in the fern family Blechnaceae and in species of several orders of mono- and dicotyledonous angiosperms.\n\nIt is found most notably in many Lamiaceae (dicotyledons in the order Lamiales), especially in the subfamily Nepetoideae.[4] It is found in species used commonly as culinary herbs such as Ocimum basilicum (basil), Ocimum tenuiflorum (holy basil), Melissa officinalis (lemon balm), Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary), Origanum majorana (marjoram), Salvia officinalis (sage), thyme and peppermint[5] or in plants with medicinal properties such as common self-heal (Prunella vulgaris) or species in the genus Stachys.\n\nIt is also found in other Lamiales such as Heliotropium foertherianum, a plant in the family Boraginaceae.\n\nIt is also found in plants in the family Marantaceae (monocotyledons in the order Zingiberales)[3] such as species in the genera Maranta (Maranta leuconeura, Maranta depressa) and Thalia (Thalia geniculata).[6]\n\nRosmarinic acid and the derivative rosmarinic acid 3′-O-β-D-glucoside can be found in Anthoceros agrestis, a hornwort (Anthocerotophyta).\n\nBiosynthesis\n\nThe biosyntheses of rosmarinic acid uses 4-coumaroyl-CoA from the general phenylpropanoid pathway as hydroxycinnamoyl donor. The hydroxycinnamoyl acceptor substrate comes from the shikimate pathway: shikimic acid, quinic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid derived from L-tyrosine. Thus, chemically, rosmarinic acid is an ester of caffeic acid with 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid, but biologically, it is formed from 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactate. Rosmarinate synthase is an enzyme that uses caffeoyl-CoA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid to produce CoA and rosmarinate. Hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase is also an enzyme involved in this biosynthesis.\n\nThe enzymes involved in the biosynthesis pathway probably evolved from those used in the formation of chlorogenic and caffeoylshikimic acids.\n\nIn plants, rosmarinic acid is supposed to act as a preformed constitutively accumulated defense compound.\n\nBiochemical activities\n\nRosmarinic acid is a potential anxiolytic as it acts as a GABA transaminase inhibitor, more specifically on 4-aminobutyrate transaminase. Rosmarinic acid also inhibits the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase via its cyclooxygenase-inhibiting properties.\n\nSenescent leaves of Heliotropium foertherianum (Boraginaceae) also known as octopus bush, a plant used in many Pacific islands as a traditional medicine to treat ciguatera fish poisoning, contain rosmarinic acid and derivatives. Rosmarinic acid may remove the ciguatoxins from their sites of action.[citation needed]\n\nThe use of rosmarinic acid is effective in a mouse model of Japanese encephalitis.",

She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of [[COBOL]], an early [[high-level programming language]] still in use today.\n\nHopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during [[World War II]], but she was rejected by the military because she was 34 years of age and too old to enlist. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team that was led by [[Howard H. Aiken]]. In 1949, she joined the [[Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation]] and was part of the development team that designed the [[UNIVAC I]] computer in 1944.  It was at Eckert–Mauchly that she began developing the compiler. She believed that computer code could be written in English by using a programming language that was based on English words. The compiler would convert that code into [[machine code]] that would be understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper finished her program [[Linker_(computing)|linker]] (originally called a compiler), which was written for the [[A-0 System]].<ref name=\"Spencer85\">{{cite book|title=Computers and Information Processing|publisher=C.E.

If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It’s much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say “Subtract income tax from pay” instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols.

Hopper was initially offered the job position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on applying for the position at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], and going through the typical formal interview process. She also sent a letter to Yavinsky's boss explaining that she would be available on alternating Thursdays, receiving a high salary, and have access to an unlimited expense account if she were to be exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer. After the proposal from Hopper, she was hired as a full-time senior consultant. As part of her position, she would report to Yavinsky. In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Grace Hopper : admiral of the cyber sea|last=Williams|first=Kathleen|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Annapolis, Md|pages=}}</ref> She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992.\n\nHopper was a goodwill ambassador in her primary activity in this capacity. She lectured widely about the early days of computing, her career, and on efforts that computer vendors could take to make life easier for their users. She visited most of Digital's engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks.\n\nShe often recounted that during her service she was frequently asked by admirals and generals why satellite communication would take so long.  So during many of her lectures, she illustrated a nanosecond using salvaged obsolete Bell System 25 pair telephone cable, cut it to 11.8&nbsp; inch (30&nbsp; cm) lengths, [[Light-nanosecond|the distance that light travels in one nanosecond]], and handed out the individual wires to her listeners. Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures, which is allowed by US Navy uniform regulations.\n\n{{quote|The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people.
