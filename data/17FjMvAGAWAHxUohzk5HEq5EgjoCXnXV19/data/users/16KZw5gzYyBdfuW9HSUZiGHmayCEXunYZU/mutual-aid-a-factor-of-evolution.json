The essays, initially published in the English periodical ''[[The Nineteenth Century]]'' between 1890 and 1896, explore the role of mutually-beneficial cooperation and reciprocity (or \"[[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]]\") in the animal kingdom and human societies both past and present. It is an argument against theories of [[social Darwinism]] that emphasize competition and [[survival of the fittest]], and against the romantic depictions by writers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who thought that cooperation was motivated by universal love. Instead Kropotkin argues that mutual aid has pragmatic advantages for the survival of human and animal communities and, along with the [[conscience]], has been promoted through natural selection.  \n\n''Mutual Aid'' is considered a fundamental text in [[anarchist communism]]. It presents a scientific basis for communism as an alternative to the [[historical materialism]] of the [[Marxism|Marxists]]. Kropotkin considers the importance of mutual aid for prosperity and survival in the animal kingdom, in indigenous and early European societies, in the Medieval [[Free imperial city|free cities]] (especially through the [[Guild|guilds]]), and in the late 19th century village, labor movement, and poor folk.  He criticizes the [[State (polity)|State]] for destroying historically important mutual aid institutions, particularly through the imposition of [[private property]]. \n\nMany biologists also consider it an important catalyst in the scientific study of cooperation. \n\n==Discussion==\n[[Daniel P. Todes]], in his account of Russian naturalism in the 19th century, concludes that Kropotkin's work \"cannot be dismissed as the idiosyncratic product of an anarchist dabbling in biology\" and that his views \"were but one expression of a broad current in Russian evolutionary thought that pre-dated, indeed encouraged, his work on the subject and was by no means confined to leftist thinkers.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Daniel P. |last=Todes |title=Darwin Without Malthus: The Struggle for Existence in Russian Evolutionary Thought |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |pages=104, 123}}</ref>\n\nKropotkin emphasizes the distinction between competitive struggle between individual organisms over limited resources and collective struggle between organisms and the environment. He drew from his first hand observations of [[Siberia]] and [[Northeast Asia]], where he saw that animal populations were limited not by food sources, which were abundant, but rather by harsh weather. For example, predatory birds may compete by stealing food from one another while migratory birds cooperate in order to survive harsh winters by traveling long distances.  He did not deny the competitive form of struggle, but argued that the cooperative counterpart has been under-emphasized: \"There is an immense amount of warfare and extermination going on amidst various species; there is, at the same time, as much, or perhaps even more, of mutual support, mutual aid, and mutual defense...Sociability is as much a law of nature as mutual struggle.\"<ref>Kropotkin, Peter (1902). [[s:Mutual Aid a Factor of Evolution/Chapter I|Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution, Chapter I]]</ref>\n\nAs a description of biology, Kropotkin's perspective is consistent with contemporary understanding. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] admired Kropotkin's observations, noting that cooperation, if it increases individual survival, is not ruled out by [[natural selection]], and is in fact encouraged.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=June 1997 |title=Kropotkin was no crackpot |work=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |number=106 |pages=12–21 |url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/science/essays/kropotkin.htm}}</ref>  Kropotkin's ideas anticipate the now recognized importance of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] (a beneficial relationship between two different species) and [[Altruism in animals|altruism]] (when one member of a species aids another) in biology. Examples of altruism in animals include [[kin selection]] and [[reciprocal altruism]]. [[Douglas H. Boucher]] places Kropotkin's book as a precursor to the development of the biological theory of altruism.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=The Idea of Mutualism, Past and Future |title=The Biology of Mutualism: Ecology and Evolution |publisher=Croom Helm |year=1985 |editor-first=Douglas H. |editor-last=Boucher |page=17 |isbn=9780709932383}}</ref>\n\n==Editions==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n|title     = Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution\n|publisher = Extending Horizons Books, Porter Sargent Publishers\n|location  = [[Boston]]\n|edition   = 1955 paperback (reprinted 2005), includes Kropotkin's 1914 preface, Foreword and Bibliography by [[Ashley Montagu]], and [[The Struggle for Existence]], by [[Thomas H.
