These included the writer [[M. I.

The expeditions yielded valuable geographical results. The impossibility of obtaining any real administrative reforms in [[Siberia]] now induced Kropotkin to devote himself almost entirely to scientific exploration, in which he continued to be highly successful.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin & Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=214}}</ref>\n\nKropotkin continued his political reading, including works by such prominent liberal thinkers as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Alexander Herzen]].

During this work, he was offered the secretaryship of the Society, but he had decided that it was his duty not to work at fresh discoveries but to aid in diffusing existing knowledge among the people at large. Accordingly, he refused the offer and returned to St. Petersburg, where he joined the revolutionary party.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin & Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=235–236}}</ref>\n\n===Activism in Switzerland and France===\n\nKropotkin visited [[Switzerland]] in 1872 and became a member of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA) at [[Geneva]]. However, he found that he did not like IWA's style of socialism. Instead, he studied the programme of the more radical [[Jura federation]] at [[Neuchâtel]] and spent time in the company of the leading members, and adopted the creed of anarchism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin & Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=282–287}}</ref>\n\n===Activism in Russia and arrest===\n\nOn returning to Russia, Kropotkin's friend Dmitri Klements introduced him to the [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]], a socialist/populist group created in 1872. Kropotkin worked to spread revolutionary propaganda among peasants and workers, and acted as a bridge between the Circle and the aristocracy.

Because of his aristocratic background, he received special privileges in prison, such as permission to continue his geographical work in his cell. He delivered his report on the subject of the [[Ice Age]] in 1876, where he argued that it had taken place in not as distant a past as originally thought.<ref>{{cite book |author=Todes, Daniel Philip|title=Darwin Without Malthus: The Struggle for Existence in Russian Evolutionary Thought|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=9780195058307|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjVskyJh6TgC&pg=PA125}}</ref>\n\n=== Escape and exile ===\n\nIn 1876, just before his trial, Kropotkin was moved to a low-security prison in St. Petersburg, from which he escaped with the help of his friends. On the night of the escape, Kropotkin and his friends celebrated by dining in one of the finest restaurants in St. Petersburg, assuming correctly that the police would not think to look for them there.

Soon he was arrested by the French government, tried at [[Lyon]], and sentenced by a police-court magistrate (under a special law passed on the fall of the [[Paris Commune]]) to five years' imprisonment, on the ground that he had belonged to the IWA (1883). The French Chamber repeatedly agitated on his behalf, and he was released in 1886. He was invited to Britain by [[Charlotte Wilson]], with whom he co-founded the [[Freedom Press]], an anarchist newspaper which continues to this day. Kropotkin was a regular contributor. He settled near London, living at various times in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], then [[Bromley]], where his daughter and only child, Alexandra, was born on April 15, 1887. <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8z8mdUYp-6gC&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=%22Peter+Kropotkin%22+1887+Alexandra&source=bl&ots=cXFi9ZZ2vP&sig=OQyj3kHr6IPR7ymhnSYh0YThNpE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwil8LKz9ODTAhXIhVQKHbQCDyoQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&q=%22Peter%20Kropotkin%22%201887%20Alexandra&f=false \"Alexandra Kropotkin\"] ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'' by [[Paul Avrich]] (2005) [[AK Press]] pps. 16-18; Retrieved May 8, 2017</ref> <ref>Bromley Council guide to blue plaques</ref> He also lived for a number of years in [[Brighton]].<ref>Peter Marshall [[Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism]]'', London: Fontana, 1993, p.315</ref> While living in London, Kropotkin became friends with a number of prominent English-speaking socialists, including [[William Morris]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1h9DAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA365&dq=kropotkin%20george%20bernard%20shaw&pg=PA365#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Bernard Shaw Chronology|last=Gibbs|first=A.|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=9780230599581|location=|pages=365}}</ref>\n\n===Return to Russia===\n[[File:Krapotkin in Haparanda.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Kropotkin in [[Haparanda]], 1917]]\n\nIn 1917, after the [[February Revolution]], Kropotkin returned to Russia after 40 years of exile.

He had this to say about the October Revolution: \"During all the activities of the present revolutionary political parties we must never forget that the October movement of the proletariat, which ended in a revolution, has proved to everybody that a social revolution is within the bounds of possibility. And this struggle, which takes place worldwide, has to be supported by all means - all the rest is secondary. The party of the Bolsheviks was right to adopt the old, purely proletarian name of \"Communist Party\". Even if it does not achieve everything that it would like to, it will nevertheless enlighten the path of the civilised countries for at least a century. Its ideas will slowly be adopted by the peoples in the same way as in the nineteenth century the world adopted the ideas of the Great French Revolution. That is the colossal achievement of the October Revolution.\" ....\n\"I see the October Revolution as an attempt to bring the preceding February Revolution to its logical conclusion with a transition to communism and federalism.\" <ref>https://www.bolshevik.info/meeting-lenin-kropotkin-bonc-brujevic1919.htm</ref>\n\nEven though he led a life on the margins of the revolutionary upheaval, Kropotkin became increasingly critical of the methods of the Bolshevik dictatorship, and went on to express these feelings in writing. “Unhappily, this effort has been made in Russia under a strongly centralized party dictatorship. This effort was made in the same way as the extremely centralized and [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] endeavor of [[François-Noël Babeuf|Babeuf]]. I owe it to you to say frankly that, according to my view, this effort to build a communist republic on the basis of a strongly centralized state communism under the iron law of party dictatorship is bound to end in failure. We are learning to know in Russia how not to introduce communism, even with a people tired of the old regime and opposing no active resistance to the experiments of the new rulers.”<ref>{{cite book |title=\"Letter to the Workers of Western Europe\", in Kropotkin’s Revolutionary Pamphlets|publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|year=1970|isbn=9780486225197|page=254}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Emma Goldman gives eulogy at Peter Kropotkin's funeral.jpg|thumb|250px|Kropotkin's friend and comrade [[Emma Goldman]], accompanied by [[Alexander Berkman]], delivers a eulogy before crowds at Kropotkin's funeral in Moscow.]]\nKropotkin died of pneumonia on February 8, 1921, in the city of [[Dmitrov]], and was buried at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow.

He believed they create poverty and [[artificial scarcity]] while promoting [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]]. Instead, he proposed a more decentralized economic system based on mutual aid, [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual support]], and [[cooperation|voluntary cooperation]], asserting that the tendencies for this kind of organization already exist, both in evolution and in human society.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mutual_Aid.html?id=uDAaAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|publisher=|year=1902|isbn=|location=|pages=223}}</ref>\n\nHe disagreed with the Marxian critique of capitalism, including the [[labour theory of value]], believing there was no necessary link between work performed and the prices of commodities. His attacks on the institution of wage-labour were based more on the power employers exerted over employees – which he claimed was made possible by the state protecting private ownership of productive resources – than the extraction of [[surplus value]] from their labour.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Cooperation and competition===\nIn 1902, Kropotkin published his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', which provided an alternative view of animal and human survival, beyond the claims of interpersonal [[competition]] and natural hierarchy proffered at the time by some \"[[social Darwinism|social Darwinists]]\" such as [[Francis Galton]]. He argued that \"it was an evolutionary emphasis on cooperation instead of competition in the Darwinian sense that made for the success of species, including the human\".<ref name=Sale>[[Kirkpatrick Sale|Sale, Kirkpatrick]] (July 1, 2010) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00045/ Are Anarchists Revolting?], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> Kropotkin explored the widespread use of [[cooperation]] as a survival mechanism in human societies - through their many stages - and among animals. He used many real-life examples in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating [[evolution]] is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups, without central control, authority, or compulsion. He did so in order to counteract the concept of fierce competition as the core of [[evolution]], which concept provided a rationalization for the dominant political, economic, and social theories{{which|date=July 2014}} of the time and for the prevalent interpretations of [[Social darwinism|Darwinism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} In the last chapter, he wrote:<ref>{{cite book |author = Kropotkin, Peter | title = quotation from ''Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution'' | year = 1902 | url = http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Kropotkin#Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution_.281902.29 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense{{spaced ndash}}not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species[...] in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits[...] and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development[...] are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.|source=Peter Kropotkin, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' (1902), Conclusion.}}\n\nKropotkin did not deny the presence of competitive urges in humans, but did not see them as the driving force of history (as did [[capitalist]]s and social Darwinists).<ref name=Gallaher>{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Carolyn |author-link1=Carolyn Gallaher |last2=Dahlman |first2=Carl T. |last3=Gilmartin |first3=Mary |last4=Mountz |first4=Alison |last5=Shirlow |first5=Peter |date=2009 |title=Key Concepts in Political Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpBJclVnVdQC&pg=PA262 |publisher=SAGE |location=London |pages=392 |isbn=978-1-4129-4672-8 |oclc= |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}</ref>{{rp|262}} He believed that seeking out conflict proved to be socially beneficial only in attempts to destroy unjust, authoritarian institutions such as the State or [[organized religion|the Church]], which he saw as stifling human [[creativity]] and freedom and impeding human instinctual drive towards sociality and cooperation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Vucinich, Alexander|title=Darwin in Russian Thought|publisher=University of California Press|year=1988|isbn=9780520062832|page=349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dh1NvIxiaIIC&pg=PA349}}</ref>\n\nKropotkin's observations of cooperative tendencies in [[indigenous people]]s (pre-feudal, feudal, and those remaining in modern societies) led him to conclude that not all human societies were based on competition, such as those of industrialized Europe, and that many societies exhibited cooperation among individuals and groups as the norm. He also concluded that most pre-industrial and pre-authoritarian societies (where he claimed that [[leadership]], central government and class did not exist) actively defend against the accumulation of private property by, for example, equally distributing within the community a person's possessions when he died, or by not allowing a gift to be sold, bartered or used to create wealth (see [[Gift economy]]).<ref>\nMorris, David.

He believed that should a society be socially, culturally, and industrially developed enough to produce all the goods and services required by it, then no obstacle, such as preferential distribution, pricing or monetary exchange will prevent everyone to take what they need from the social product. He supported the eventual abolition of money or tokens of exchange for goods and services.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Conquest_of_Bread.html?id=TB2ul8NVVPcC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Conquest of Bread|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|publisher=|year=1892|isbn=|location=|pages=201}}</ref>\n\nKropotkin believed that [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]'s [[collectivist]] economic model was simply a wage system by a different name,<ref>Kropotkin wrote: \"After the Collectivist Revolution instead of saying 'twopence' worth of soap, we shall say 'five minutes' worth of soap.\" (quoted in {{cite book |author=Brauer, Fae|chapter=Wild Beasts and Tame Primates: 'Le Douanier' Rosseau's Dream of Darwin's Evolution|editor=Larsen, Barbara Jean|title=The Art of Evolution: Darwin, Darwinisms, and Visual Culture|publisher=UPNE|year=2009|isbn=9781584657750|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZisTVt0GJQC&pg=PA211}})</ref> and that such a system would breed the same type of centralization and inequality as a capitalist wage system. He stated that it is impossible to determine the value of an individual's contributions to the products of social [[Wage labour|labor]], and thought that anyone who was placed in a position of trying to make such determinations would wield authority over those whose wages they determined.<ref>{{cite book |author=Avrich, Paul|title=[[The Russian Anarchists]]|publisher=AK Press|year=2005|isbn=9781904859482|pages=28–29}}</ref> He further developed these ideas in ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAccording to [[Kirkpatrick Sale]]:<ref name=Sale/>\n\n{{quote|With ''Mutual Aid'' especially, and later with ''[[Fields, Factories, and Workshops]]'', Kropotkin was able to move away from the absurdist limitations of [[Individualist anarchism|individual anarchism]] and no-laws anarchism that had flourished during this period and provide instead a vision of communal anarchism, following the models of independent cooperative communities he discovered while developing his theory of mutual aid. It was an anarchism that opposed centralized government and state-level laws as traditional anarchism did, but understood that at a certain small scale, communities and communes and co-ops could flourish and provide humans with a rich material life and wide areas of liberty without centralized control.}}\n\n===Self-sufficiency===\nKropotkin's focus on local production led to his view that a country should strive for [[autarky|self-sufficiency]]{{spaced ndash}}manufacture its own goods and grow its own food, lessening dependence on imports.  To these ends he advocated irrigation and greenhouses to boost local food production ability.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=bFFOCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=Kropotkin+on+self-sufficiency&source=bl&ots=qrxobXVwl-&sig=Xodu31FhJ3bXTtE1kacgSINWvg8&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_1eTouOPWAhVC6yYKHeWPBF0Q6AEIZDAM#v=onepage&q=Kropotkin%20on%20self-sufficiency&f=false|title=Kropotkin, Read, and the Intellectual History of British Anarchism: Between Reason and Romanticism|last=Adams|first=M.|date=2015-06-04|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137392626|language=en}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Works==\n[[File:La conquête du pain.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' by Peter Kropotkin, influential work which presents the economic vision of [[anarcho-communism]]]]\n\n===Books===\n* ''In Russian and French Prisons'', London: Ward and Downey; 1887.

During this work, he was offered the secretaryship of the Society, but he had decided that it was his duty not to work at fresh discoveries but to aid in diffusing existing knowledge among the people at large.

The French Chamber repeatedly agitated on his behalf, and he was released in 1886. He was invited to Britain by [[Charlotte Wilson]], with whom he co-founded the [[Freedom Press]], an anarchist newspaper which continues to this day. Kropotkin was a regular contributor.

He had this to say about the October Revolution: \"During all the activities of the present revolutionary political parties we must never forget that the October movement of the proletariat, which ended in a revolution, has proved to everybody that a social revolution is within the bounds of possibility. And this struggle, which takes place worldwide, has to be supported by all means - all the rest is secondary. The party of the Bolsheviks was right to adopt the old, purely proletarian name of \"Communist Party\". Even if it does not achieve everything that it would like to, it will nevertheless enlighten the path of the civilised countries for at least a century. Its ideas will slowly be adopted by the peoples in the same way as in the nineteenth century the world adopted the ideas of the Great French Revolution. That is the colossal achievement of the October Revolution.\" ....\n\"I see the October Revolution as an attempt to bring the preceding February Revolution to its logical conclusion with a transition to communism and federalism.\" <ref>https://www.bolshevik.info/meeting-lenin-kropotkin-bonc-brujevic1919.htm</ref>\n\nEven though he led a life on the margins of the revolutionary upheaval, Kropotkin became increasingly critical of the methods of the Bolshevik dictatorship, and went on to express these feelings in writing. “Unhappily, this effort has been made in Russia under a strongly centralized party dictatorship. This effort was made in the same way as the extremely centralized and [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] endeavor of [[François-Noël Babeuf|Babeuf]]. I owe it to you to say frankly that, according to my view, this effort to build a communist republic on the basis of a strongly centralized state communism under the iron law of party dictatorship is bound to end in failure. We are learning to know in Russia how not to introduce communism, even with a people tired of the old regime and opposing no active resistance to the experiments of the new rulers.”<ref>{{cite book |title=\"Letter to the Workers of Western Europe\", in Kropotkin’s Revolutionary Pamphlets|publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|year=1970|isbn=9780486225197|page=254}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Emma Goldman gives eulogy at Peter Kropotkin's funeral.jpg|thumb|250px|Kropotkin's friend and comrade [[Emma Goldman]], accompanied by [[Alexander Berkman]], delivers a eulogy before crowds at Kropotkin's funeral in Moscow.]]\nKropotkin died of pneumonia on February 8, 1921, in the city of [[Dmitrov]], and was buried at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow.

Instead, he proposed a more decentralized economic system based on mutual aid, [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual support]], and [[cooperation|voluntary cooperation]], asserting that the tendencies for this kind of organization already exist, both in evolution and in human society.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mutual_Aid.html?id=uDAaAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|publisher=|year=1902|isbn=|location=|pages=223}}</ref>\n\nHe disagreed with the Marxian critique of capitalism, including the [[labour theory of value]], believing there was no necessary link between work performed and the prices of commodities. His attacks on the institution of wage-labour were based more on the power employers exerted over employees – which he claimed was made possible by the state protecting private ownership of productive resources – than the extraction of [[surplus value]] from their labour.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Cooperation and competition===\nIn 1902, Kropotkin published his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', which provided an alternative view of animal and human survival, beyond the claims of interpersonal [[competition]] and natural hierarchy proffered at the time by some \"[[social Darwinism|social Darwinists]]\" such as [[Francis Galton]]. He argued that \"it was an evolutionary emphasis on cooperation instead of competition in the Darwinian sense that made for the success of species, including the human\".<ref name=Sale>[[Kirkpatrick Sale|Sale, Kirkpatrick]] (July 1, 2010) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00045/ Are Anarchists Revolting?], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> Kropotkin explored the widespread use of [[cooperation]] as a survival mechanism in human societies - through their many stages - and among animals. He used many real-life examples in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating [[evolution]] is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups, without central control, authority, or compulsion. He did so in order to counteract the concept of fierce competition as the core of [[evolution]], which concept provided a rationalization for the dominant political, economic, and social theories{{which|date=July 2014}} of the time and for the prevalent interpretations of [[Social darwinism|Darwinism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} In the last chapter, he wrote:<ref>{{cite book |author = Kropotkin, Peter | title = quotation from ''Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution'' | year = 1902 | url = http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Kropotkin#Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution_.281902.29 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense{{spaced ndash}}not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species[...] in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits[...] and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development[...] are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.|source=Peter Kropotkin, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' (1902), Conclusion.}}\n\nKropotkin did not deny the presence of competitive urges in humans, but did not see them as the driving force of history (as did [[capitalist]]s and social Darwinists).<ref name=Gallaher>{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Carolyn |author-link1=Carolyn Gallaher |last2=Dahlman |first2=Carl T. |last3=Gilmartin |first3=Mary |last4=Mountz |first4=Alison |last5=Shirlow |first5=Peter |date=2009 |title=Key Concepts in Political Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpBJclVnVdQC&pg=PA262 |publisher=SAGE |location=London |pages=392 |isbn=978-1-4129-4672-8 |oclc= |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}</ref>{{rp|262}} He believed that seeking out conflict proved to be socially beneficial only in attempts to destroy unjust, authoritarian institutions such as the State or [[organized religion|the Church]], which he saw as stifling human [[creativity]] and freedom and impeding human instinctual drive towards sociality and cooperation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Vucinich, Alexander|title=Darwin in Russian Thought|publisher=University of California Press|year=1988|isbn=9780520062832|page=349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dh1NvIxiaIIC&pg=PA349}}</ref>\n\nKropotkin's observations of cooperative tendencies in [[indigenous people]]s (pre-feudal, feudal, and those remaining in modern societies) led him to conclude that not all human societies were based on competition, such as those of industrialized Europe, and that many societies exhibited cooperation among individuals and groups as the norm. He also concluded that most pre-industrial and pre-authoritarian societies (where he claimed that [[leadership]], central government and class did not exist) actively defend against the accumulation of private property by, for example, equally distributing within the community a person's possessions when he died, or by not allowing a gift to be sold, bartered or used to create wealth (see [[Gift economy]]).<ref>\nMorris, David.

He believed that should a society be socially, culturally, and industrially developed enough to produce all the goods and services required by it, then no obstacle, such as preferential distribution, pricing or monetary exchange will prevent everyone to take what they need from the social product. He supported the eventual abolition of money or tokens of exchange for goods and services.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Conquest_of_Bread.html?id=TB2ul8NVVPcC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Conquest of Bread|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|publisher=|year=1892|isbn=|location=|pages=201}}</ref>\n\nKropotkin believed that [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]'s [[collectivist]] economic model was simply a wage system by a different name,<ref>Kropotkin wrote: \"After the Collectivist Revolution instead of saying 'twopence' worth of soap, we shall say 'five minutes' worth of soap.\" (quoted in {{cite book |author=Brauer, Fae|chapter=Wild Beasts and Tame Primates: 'Le Douanier' Rosseau's Dream of Darwin's Evolution|editor=Larsen, Barbara Jean|title=The Art of Evolution: Darwin, Darwinisms, and Visual Culture|publisher=UPNE|year=2009|isbn=9781584657750|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZisTVt0GJQC&pg=PA211}})</ref> and that such a system would breed the same type of centralization and inequality as a capitalist wage system. He stated that it is impossible to determine the value of an individual's contributions to the products of social [[Wage labour|labor]], and thought that anyone who was placed in a position of trying to make such determinations would wield authority over those whose wages they determined.<ref>{{cite book |author=Avrich, Paul|title=[[The Russian Anarchists]]|publisher=AK Press|year=2005|isbn=9781904859482|pages=28–29}}</ref> He further developed these ideas in ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAccording to [[Kirkpatrick Sale]]:<ref name=Sale/>\n\n{{quote|With ''Mutual Aid'' especially, and later with ''[[Fields, Factories, and Workshops]]'', Kropotkin was able to move away from the absurdist limitations of [[Individualist anarchism|individual anarchism]] and no-laws anarchism that had flourished during this period and provide instead a vision of communal anarchism, following the models of independent cooperative communities he discovered while developing his theory of mutual aid. It was an anarchism that opposed centralized government and state-level laws as traditional anarchism did, but understood that at a certain small scale, communities and communes and co-ops could flourish and provide humans with a rich material life and wide areas of liberty without centralized control.}}\n\n===Self-sufficiency===\nKropotkin's focus on local production led to his view that a country should strive for [[autarky|self-sufficiency]]{{spaced ndash}}manufacture its own goods and grow its own food, lessening dependence on imports.  To these ends he advocated irrigation and greenhouses to boost local food production ability.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=bFFOCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=Kropotkin+on+self-sufficiency&source=bl&ots=qrxobXVwl-&sig=Xodu31FhJ3bXTtE1kacgSINWvg8&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_1eTouOPWAhVC6yYKHeWPBF0Q6AEIZDAM#v=onepage&q=Kropotkin%20on%20self-sufficiency&f=false|title=Kropotkin, Read, and the Intellectual History of British Anarchism: Between Reason and Romanticism|last=Adams|first=M.|date=2015-06-04|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137392626|language=en}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Works==\n[[File:La conquête du pain.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' by Peter Kropotkin, influential work which presents the economic vision of [[anarcho-communism]]]]\n\n===Books===\n* ''In Russian and French Prisons'', London: Ward and Downey; 1887.
