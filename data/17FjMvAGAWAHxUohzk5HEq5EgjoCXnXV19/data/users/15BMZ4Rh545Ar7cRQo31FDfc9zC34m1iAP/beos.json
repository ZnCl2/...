It was first written to run on [[BeBox]] hardware. BeOS was built for digital media work and was written to take advantage of modern hardware facilities such as [[symmetric multiprocessing]] by utilizing modular I/O bandwidth, pervasive multithreading, [[preemptive multitasking]] and a [[64-bit]] [[journaling file system]] known as [[Be File System|BFS]]. The BeOS GUI was developed on the principles of clarity and a clean, uncluttered design.\n\nThe [[application programming interface|API]] was written in [[C++]] for ease of programming. It has partial [[POSIX]] compatibility and access to a [[command-line interface]] through [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]], although internally it is not a [[Unix]]-derived operating system.\n\nBeOS used [[Unicode]] as the default encoding in the GUI, though support for input methods such as [[bidirectional text]] input was never realized.\n\nBeOS was positioned as a multimedia platform that  could be used by a substantial population of desktop users and a competitor to [[Classic Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was ultimately unable to achieve a significant market share, however, and proved commercially unviable for Be Inc. The company was acquired by [[Palm Inc.]] and today BeOS is mainly used and developed by a small population of enthusiasts.\n\nThe open-source OS [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]], a complete reimplementation of BeOS, is designed to start up where BeOS left off. Beta 1 of Haiku was released in September 2018, six years after Alpha 4.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Haiku Release 1 Beta 1|date=September 28, 2018|url=https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2018_09_28_haiku_r1_beta1/|work=Haiku-OS.org|volume=|pages=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929134523/https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2018_09_28_haiku_r1_beta1/|archivedate=2018-09-29}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nInitially designed to run on [[AT&T Hobbit]]-based hardware, BeOS was later modified to run on [[PowerPC]]-based processors: first Be's own systems, later [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[PowerPC Reference Platform]] and [[Common Hardware Reference Platform]], with the hope that Apple would purchase or license BeOS as a replacement for its aging [[Classic Mac OS]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://macreate.net/reloaded/?q=node/view/149 | title=BeOS @ MaCreate | date=2004-11-24 | author=Tom | accessdate=2006-11-16 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324220739/http://macreate.net/reloaded/?q=node%2Fview%2F149 | archivedate=2005-03-24 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Apple CEO [[Gil Amelio]] started negotiations to buy Be Inc., but negotiations stalled when Be CEO [[Jean-Louis Gassée]] wanted $300 million;<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tom|first1=Hormby|title=The Rise and Fall of Apple’s Gil Amelio|url=http://lowendmac.com/2013/the-rise-and-fall-of-apples-gil-amelio/|website=Low End Mac|publisher=Cobweb Publishing, Inc.|accessdate=28 March 2015}}</ref> Apple was unwilling to offer any more than $125 million.
