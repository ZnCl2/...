He took charge of his family's real-estate business in 1971, renamed it [[The Trump Organization]], and expanded its operations from Queens and [[Brooklyn]] into [[Manhattan]]. The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started [[The Trump Organization#Other ventures and investments|various side ventures]], mostly by licensing his name.

He appointed [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In foreign policy, Trump has pursued an [[America First (policy)|America First]] agenda, withdrawing the U.S. from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] trade negotiations, the [[Paris Agreement]] on climate change, and the [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]].

We understood coordination to require an agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests.

A [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|2019 House impeachment inquiry]] found that in the [[Trump–Ukraine scandal]], Trump solicited [[Foreign interference in the 2020 United States elections|foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election]] to help his [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|re-election bid]], and then obstructed the inquiry itself. The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid and a White House invitation in order to influence Ukraine to announce investigations into Trump's political rivals.
