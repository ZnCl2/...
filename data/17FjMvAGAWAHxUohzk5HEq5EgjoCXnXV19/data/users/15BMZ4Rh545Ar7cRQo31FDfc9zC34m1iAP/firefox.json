These improvements came in the wake of decreasing market share to [[Google Chrome]], as well as concerns that its performance was lapsing in comparison. Despite its improvements, these changes required existing [[Add-on (Mozilla)|add-ons]] for Firefox to be made incompatible with newer versions, in favor of a new [[Browser extension|extension]] system that is designed to be similar to Chrome and other recent browsers. Firefox 57, which was released in November 2017, was the first version to contain enhancements from Quantum, and has thus been named ''Firefox Quantum''.

This switch, often used for alphas (\"Auroras\") of future Firefox versions, allows the code to be compiled without the official logo and name, and can allow a derivative work unencumbered by restrictions on the Firefox trademark to be produced. In the unbranded build the trademarked logo and name are replaced with a freely distributable generic globe logo and the name of the release series from which the modified version was derived.\n\nDistributing modified versions of Firefox under the \"Firefox\" name required explicit approval from Mozilla for the changes made to the underlying code, and required the use of ''all'' of the official branding. For example, it was not permissible to use the name \"Firefox\" without also using the official logo. When the [[Debian]] project decided to stop using the official Firefox logo in 2006 (because Mozilla's copyright restrictions at the time were incompatible with [[Debian Free Software Guidelines|Debian's guidelines]]), they were told by a representative of the Mozilla Foundation that this was not acceptable, and were asked either to comply with the published trademark guidelines or cease using the \"Firefox\" name in their distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=354622|title=Debian Bug report logs â€“ #354622: Uses Mozilla Firefox trademark without permission|website=|publisher=Debian|accessdate=January 30, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206164312/http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=354622|archive-date=February 6, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> <!-- is this important enough to include in the context of this article? - Some Debian developers had misunderstood previous communication to be an agreement that allowed them to do this, but Mozilla disputed this assertion. --> Ultimately, Debian switched to branding their modified version of Firefox \"[[Mozilla Corporation software rebranded by the Debian project|Iceweasel]]\" (but in 2016 switched back to Firefox), along with other Mozilla software.

The release of Firefox 0.8 in February 2004 saw the introduction of the new branding efforts. Included were new icon designs by silverorange, a group of web developers with a long-standing relationship with Mozilla.

Lifehacker timed how long browsers took to start and reach a page (both right after boot-up and after running at least once already), timed how long browsers took to load nine tabs at once, tested JavaScript speeds using Mozilla's Dromaeo online suite (which implements Apple's [[SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark|SunSpider]] and Google's V8 tests) and measured memory usage using Windows 7's process manager. They concluded that Firefox 3.5 and 3.6 were the fifth- and sixth-fastest browsers, respectively, on startup, 3.5 was third- and 3.6 was sixth-fastest to load nine tabs at once, 3.5 was sixth- and 3.6 was fifth-fastest on the JavaScript tests.

''Tom's Hardware'' summarized their tests into four categories: Performance, Efficiency, Reliability, and Conformance. In the performance category they tested [[HTML5]], [[Java (software platform)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Document Object Model|DOM]], [[CSS 3]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Silverlight]], and [[WebGL]] ([[WebGL 2]] is current as of version 51; and Java and Silverlight stop working as of version 52)â€”they also tested start up time and page load time. The performance tests showed that Firefox was either \"acceptable\" or \"strong\" in most categories, winning three categories (HTML5, HTML5 [[hardware acceleration]], and Java) only finishing \"weak\" in CSS performance. In the efficiency tests, ''Tom's Hardware'' tested memory usage and management. In this category, it determined that Firefox was only \"acceptable\" at performing light memory usage, while it was \"strong\" at performing heavy memory usage. In the reliability category, Firefox performed a \"strong\" amount of proper page loads. In the final category, conformance, it was determined that Firefox had \"strong\" conformance for JavaScript and HTML5. In conclusion, ''Tom's Hardware'' determined that Firefox was the best browser for Windows 7 OS, but that it only narrowly beat Google Chrome.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/chrome-17-firefox-10-ubuntu,3129-17.html|title=Benchmark Analysis: Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.10|last=Overa|first=Adam|date=February 21, 2012|website=|publisher=Tom's Hardware |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2013, ''Tom's Hardware'' again performance tested Firefox 22, Chrome 27, Opera 12, and [[Internet Explorer 10]]. They found that Firefox slightly edged out the other browsers in their \"performance\" index, which examined wait times, JavaScript execution speed, HTML5/CSS3 rendering, and hardware acceleration performance. Firefox also scored the highest on the \"non-performance\" index, which measured memory efficiency, reliability, security, and standards conformance, finishing substantially ahead of Chrome, the runner-up. ''Tom's Hardware'' concluded by declaring Firefox the \"sound\" winner of the performance benchmarks.<ref name=\"Overa13\">{{cite news|url=https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/chrome-27-firefox-21-opera-next,3534-12.html|title=Chrome 27, Firefox 22, IE10, And Opera Next, Benchmarked|last=Overa|first=Adam|date=June 30, 2013|newspaper=Tom's Hardware|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2014, a benchmark testing the memory usage of Firefox 29, Google Chrome 34, and [[Internet Explorer 11]] indicated that Firefox used the least memory when a substantial number of tabs were open.<ref name=\"Brinkmann14\">{{cite news|url=https://www.ghacks.net/2014/01/02/chrome-34-firefox-29-internet-explorer-11-memory-use-2014/|title=Chrome 34, Firefox 29, Internet Explorer 11: Memory Use 2014|last=Brinkmann|first=Martin|date=January 2, 2014|newspaper=gHacks Technology News|accessdate=May 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505225706/http://www.ghacks.net/2014/01/02/chrome-34-firefox-29-internet-explorer-11-memory-use-2014/|archive-date=May 5, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn benchmark testing in early 2015 on a \"high-end\" Windows machine, comparing [[Microsoft Edge]], Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera, Firefox achieved the highest score on three of the seven tests. Four different Javascript performance tests gave conflicting results. Firefox bested the others on the [[Browser speed test|Peacekeeper benchmark]], but was behind the Microsoft products when tested with SunSpider. Measured with Mozilla's Kraken, it came second place to Chrome, while on Google's [[Browser speed test#Octane|Octane]] challenge it took third behind Chrome and Opera. Firefox took the lead with WebXPRT, which runs several typical HTML5 and Javascript tasks. Firefox, Chrome, and Opera all achieved the highest possible score on the Oort Online test, measuring WebGL rendering speed (WebGL 2 is now current). In terms of HTML5 compatibility testing, Firefox was ranked in the middle of the group.<ref name=\"TekRevue-2015-04-01\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tekrevue.com/spartan-benchmarks-ie-chrome-firefox-opera/|title=Spartan Benchmarks: Spartan vs. IE, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera|last=Tanous|first=Jim|date=April 1, 2015|website=TekRevue|accessdate=January 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226174659/http://www.tekrevue.com/spartan-benchmarks-ie-chrome-firefox-opera/|archive-date=December 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA similar set of benchmark tests in 2016 showed Firefox's Javascript performance on Kraken and the newer [[Browser speed test#JetStream|Jetstream]] tests trailing slightly behind all other tested browsers except Internet Explorer (IE), which performed relatively poorly. On Octane, Firefox came ahead of IE and Safari, but again slightly behind the rest, including [[Vivaldi (web browser)|Vivaldi]] and Microsoft Edge.
