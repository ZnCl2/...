The lower part of the comb has a number of unoccupied cells.|thumb]]\nA '''honeycomb''' is a mass of [[Triangular_prismatic_honeycomb#Hexagonal_prismatic_honeycomb|hexagonal prismatic]] [[Beeswax|wax]] cells built by [[honey bee]]s in their [[beehive|nests]] to contain their [[larva]]e and stores of [[honey]] and [[pollen]].\n\n[[beekeeping|Beekeepers]] may remove the entire honeycomb to harvest honey. Honey bees consume about 8.4&nbsp;lb (3.8&nbsp;kg) of honey to secrete 1&nbsp;lb (454 g) of wax,<ref>Graham, Joe. The Hive and the Honey Bee. Hamilton/IL: Dadant & Sons; 1992; ISBN.</ref> so it makes economic sense to return the wax to the hive after harvesting the honey. The structure of the comb may be left basically intact when honey is extracted from it by uncapping and spinning in a centrifugal machine—the [[honey extractor]]. If the honeycomb is too worn out, the wax can be reused in a number of ways, including making sheets of comb [[Wax foundation|foundation]] with hexagonal pattern. Such foundation sheets allow the bees to build the comb with less effort, and the hexagonal pattern of worker-sized cell bases discourages the bees from building the larger [[Drone (bee)|drone]] cells.\n[[File:Bienenwabe Ausbau der Mittelwand 79a.jpg|\"Artificial honeycomb\" plate where bees have already completed some cells|thumb]]\n\nFresh, new comb is sometimes sold and used intact as [[comb honey]], especially if the honey is being spread on bread rather than used in cooking or as a sweetener.\n\n[[Brood (honey bee)|Broodcomb]] becomes dark over time, because of the cocoons embedded in the cells and the tracking of many feet, called travel stain{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} by beekeepers when seen on frames of comb honey. Honeycomb in the \"[[honey super|supers]]\" that are not allowed to be used for brood (e.g. by the placement of a [[queen excluder]]) stays light-colored.\n\nNumerous [[wasp]]s, especially [[Polistinae]] and [[Vespinae]], construct hexagonal prism-packed combs made of paper instead of wax; in some species (such as ''[[Brachygastra mellifica]]''), honey is stored in the nest, thus technically forming a paper honeycomb.  However, the term \"honeycomb\" is not often used for such structures.\n\n==Honeycomb geometry==\n[[File:BDHoneycomb.JPG|thumb|Natural honeycombs on a building]]\n[[File:Bienenwabe mit Eiern und Brut 5.jpg|thumb|left|Honeycomb with eggs and [[larva]]e]] [[Image:Honeycomb-Process.png|thumb|The bees begin to build the comb from the top of each section. When a cell is filled with honey, the bees seal it with wax.]]\n[[File:Apis florea nest closeup2.jpg|thumb|right|Closeup of an abandoned ''[[Apis florea]]'' nest, [[Thailand]] – the hexagonal grid of wax cells on either side of the nest are slightly offset from each other. This increases the strength of the comb and reduces the amount of wax required to produce a robust structure.]]\n{{further|Patterns in nature}}\n\nThe axes of honeycomb cells are always quasihorizontal, and the nonangled rows of honeycomb cells are always horizontally (not vertically) aligned.  Thus, each cell has two vertically oriented walls, with the upper and lower parts of the cells composed of two angled walls. The open end of a cell is typically referred to as the top of the cell, while the opposite end is called the bottom. The cells [[slope]] slightly upwards, between 9 and 14°, towards the open ends.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nTwo possible explanations exist as to why honeycomb is composed of hexagons, rather than any other shape. First, the hexagonal [[Tessellation|tiling]] creates a partition with equal-sized cells, while minimizing the total [[perimeter]] of the cells. Known in [[geometry]] as the [[honeycomb conjecture]], this was given by [[Jan Brożek]] and proved much later by [[Thomas Callister Hales|Thomas Hales]]. Thus, a hexagonal structure uses the least material to create a lattice of cells within a given [[volume]].  A second reason, given by [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]], is that the shape simply results from the process of individual bees putting cells together: somewhat analogous to the boundary shapes created in a field of [[soap bubble]]s. In support of this, he notes that queen cells, which are constructed singly, are irregular and lumpy with no apparent attempt at efficiency.<ref>Thompson, D'Arcy Wentworth (1942). ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. Dover Publications. ISBN.</ref>\n\nThe closed ends of the honeycomb cells are also an example of geometric efficiency, albeit three-[[dimension]]al.<ref name=\"nazzi\">{{cite journal|pmc=4913256|year=2016|author1=Nazzi|first1=F|title=The hexagonal shape of the honeycomb cells depends on the construction behavior of bees|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=28341|doi=10.1038/srep28341|pmid=27320492}}</ref>  The ends are trihedral (i.e., composed of three planes) sections of [[rhombic dodecahedron|rhombic dodecahedra]], with the [[dihedral angle]]s of all adjacent surfaces measuring 120°, the angle that minimizes [[surface area]] for a given volume.  (The angle formed by the edges at the pyramidal apex, known as the [[tetrahedral angle]], is approximately 109° 28' 16\" ({{nowrap|{{=}} arccos(−1/3)}}).)\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">[[image:Honeycomb cell 3d rot.svg|A computer-generated model of a honeycomb cell, showing a hexagonal tube terminating in three equal rhombuses that meet at a point on the axis of the cell]]<br>The three-dimensional geometry of a honeycomb cell</div>\n\nThe shape of the cells is such that two opposing honeycomb layers nest into each other, with each facet of the closed ends being shared by opposing cells.<ref name=nazzi/>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">[[image:Honeycomb 3d rot.svg|A computer-generated model of two opposing honeycomb layers, showing three cells on one layer fitting together with three cells on the opposing layer]]<br>Opposing layers of honeycomb cells fit together</div>\n\nIndividual cells do not show this geometric perfection: in a regular comb, deviations of a few [[percent]] from the \"perfect\" hexagonal shape occur.<ref name=nazzi/> In transition zones between the larger cells of drone comb and the smaller cells of worker comb, or when the bees encounter obstacles, the shapes are often distorted.  Cells are also angled up about 13° from horizontal to prevent honey from dripping out.<ref>{{cite book|last=Frisch|first=Karl von|title=Animal Architecture|year=1974|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TransitionalHoney.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Honeycomb section containing transition from worker to drone (larger) cells – here bees make irregular and five-cornered cells (marked with red dots).]]\n\n[[File:Western Honey Bees and Honeycomb.JPG|thumb|Western honeybees and honeycomb]]\n\nIn 1965, [[László Fejes Tóth]] discovered the trihedral pyramidal shape (which is composed of three [[rhombus|rhombi]]) used by the honeybee is not the theoretically optimal three-dimensional geometry.  A cell end composed of two hexagons and two smaller rhombuses would actually be .035% (or about one part per 2850) more efficient. This difference is too minute to measure on an actual honeycomb, and irrelevant to the hive economy in terms of efficient use of wax, considering wild comb varies considerably from any mathematical notion of \"ideal\" geometry.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Bessiere\n | first = Gustavo\n | authorlink =\n | title = Il Calcolo Differenziale e Integrale—Reso Facile ed Attraente.IL\n | publisher = Hoepli\n | edition = VII\n | year = 1987\n | location = Milan\n | pages =\n | language = Italian\n | url = http://www.hoepli.it/libro/il-calcolo-differenziale-e-integrale-/9788820310110.html\n | isbn = 9788820310110\n}}</ref><ref>\nGianni A.
