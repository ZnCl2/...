It is distinct from [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]] in that it searches a single [[Server (computing)|server]] at a time. \n\nJughead was developed by [[Rhett Jones]] in 1993 at the [[University of Utah]].\n\nThe name \"Jughead\" was originally chosen to match the [[Archie search engine]], as [[Jughead Jones]] is Archie's friend in [[Archie Comics]]. Later a [[backronym]] was developed: ''Jonzy's Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation And Display''.\n\nIt was released by the original author under the [[GNU General Public License]] in 2006, and its [[source code]] has been modernized to better run on current [[POSIX]] systems.\n\nDue to trademark issues, the modified version was called Jugtail, and has been made available for download on [[GNU Savannah]] (see [[#External links|external links]]).\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060404205924/http://hal3000.cx:70/Software/Unix/jughead Jughead Source]\n*[http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/jugtail Jugtail Project]\n\n{{gopher clients}}\n\n[[Category:Internet protocols]]\n[[Category:Internet Standards]]\n[[Category:Unix Internet software]]\n[[Category:Gopher (protocol)]]\n[[Category:Internet search engines]]\n\n\n{{Web-stub}}",
