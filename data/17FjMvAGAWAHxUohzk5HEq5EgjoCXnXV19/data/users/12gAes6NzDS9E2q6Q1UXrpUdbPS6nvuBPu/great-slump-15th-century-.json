Certain groups were particularly badly affected: cloth exports fell by 35 percent in just four years at the end of the 1440s, for example, collapsing by up to 90 percent in some parts of the South-West.<ref>Hicks, p.51.</ref> Prices of remaining trade goods fell dramatically as well.<ref>Hatcher, p.243.</ref> Popular rebellions ensued in 1450 under [[Jack Cade]], and the events contributed to the outbreak of the [[Wars of the Roses]] in the 1460s.<ref>Hicks, pp.52â€“54.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Economy of England in the Middle Ages]]\n*[[John and William Merfold]]\n*[[Hundred Years' War]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Hatcher\n  | first1 = John\n  | editor-last=Britnell\n  | editor-first=Richard \n  | editor2-last=Hatcher \n  | editor2-first=John \n  | year = 2002\n  | chapter = The Great Slump of the Mid-Fifteenth Century\n  | title = Progress and Problems in Medieval England: Essays in Honour of Edward Miller\n  | edition = \n  | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n  | location= Cambridge, UK\n  | isbn = 978-0-521-52273-1\n  | url = \n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Hicks\n  | first = Michael\n  | year = 2012\n  | title = The Wars of the Roses\n  | publisher = Yale University Press\n  | location= New Haven and London\n  | isbn = 978-0-300-18157-9\n  | url = \n  }}\n{{History-stub}}\n{{Middle Ages}}\n[[Category:Economy of medieval England]]\n[[Category:Recessions]]\n[[Category:15th century in England]]\n[[Category:15th-century economic history]]",
