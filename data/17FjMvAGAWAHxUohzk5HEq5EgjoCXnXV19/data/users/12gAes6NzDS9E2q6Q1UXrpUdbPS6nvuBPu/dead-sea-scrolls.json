He thus creates a strong link between the Scrolls and the pre-Pauline Jewish Christian community.\n\nOwing to the poor condition of some of the scrolls, scholars have not identified all of their texts. The identified texts fall into three general groups:\n# Some 40% are copies of texts from the Hebrew Scriptures.\n# Approximately another 30% are texts from the [[Second Temple Period]] which ultimately were not [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|canonized in the Hebrew Bible]], like the [[Book of Enoch]], the [[Book of Jubilees]], the [[Book of Tobit]], the [[Sirach|Wisdom of Sirach]], [[Psalms 152–155]], etc.\n# The remainder (roughly 30%) are [[sectarianism|sectarian]] manuscripts of previously unknown documents that shed light on the rules and beliefs of a particular group ([[sect]]) or groups within greater [[Judaism]], like the [[Community Rule]], the [[War Scroll]], the [[Habakkuk Commentary|Pesher on Habakkuk]], and [[The Rule of the Blessing]].<ref>Abegg, Jr., Martin, Peter Flint, and [[Eugene Ulrich]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20180411174946/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jmm8Mvjw2WQC | ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible: The Oldest Known Bible Translated for the First Time into English''], San Francisco: Harper, 2002.</ref>{{qn|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Discovery==\n{{See also|Qumran}}\n[[File:Qumran.jpeg|thumb|right|Qumran cave 4, where ninety percent of the scrolls were found]]\n\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in a series of twelve [[cave]]s around the site known as Wadi [[Qumran]] near the Dead Sea in the [[West Bank]] (of the [[Jordan River]]) between 1946 and 1956 by [[Bedouin people|Bedouin shepherds]] and a team of [[Archaeology|archeologists]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://virtualreligion.net/iho/dss.html#ASOR|title=Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=virtualreligion.net}}</ref> The practice of storing worn-out sacred manuscripts in earthenware vessels buried in the earth or within caves is related to the ancient Jewish custom of [[Genizah]].\n\n===Initial discovery (1946–1947)===\nThe initial discovery, by Bedouin shepherd Muhammed edh-Dhib, his cousin Jum'a Muhammed, and Khalil Musa, took place between November 1946 and February 1947.<ref>Humphries, Mark. ''Early Christianity''. 2006.</ref><ref name=\"Evans, Craig 2010\">Evans, Craig. ''Guide to the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 2010.</ref> The shepherds discovered seven scrolls (See [[#Scrolls and fragments|Scrolls and fragments]]) housed in jars in a cave near what is now known as the Qumran site. [[John C. Trever]] reconstructed the story of the scrolls from several interviews with the [[Bedouin]]. Edh-Dhib's cousin noticed the caves, but edh-Dhib himself was the first to actually fall into one (the cave now called Cave 1). He retrieved a handful of scrolls, which Trever identifies as the [[Isaiah scroll|Isaiah Scroll]], [[Habakkuk Commentary]], and the [[Community Rule]], and took them back to the camp to show to his family. None of the scrolls were destroyed in this process, despite popular rumor.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">John C. Trever. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls''. Gorgias Press LLC, 2003.</ref> The Bedouin kept the scrolls hanging on a tent pole while they figured out what to do with them, periodically taking them out to show to their people. At some point during this time, the Community Rule was split in two. The Bedouin first took the scrolls to a dealer named Ibrahim 'Ijha in [[Bethlehem]]. 'Ijha returned them, saying they were worthless, after being warned that they might have been stolen from a synagogue. Undaunted, the Bedouin went to a nearby market, where a Syrian Christian offered to buy them. A sheikh joined their conversation and suggested they take the scrolls to Khalil Eskander Shahin, \"Kando\", a cobbler and part-time antiques dealer. The Bedouin and the dealers returned to the site, leaving one scroll with Kando and selling three others to a dealer for 7 Jordanian pounds (approximately $28, or ${{inflation|US|28|1947}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"VanderKamFlint2005\">{{cite book|author1=James VanderKam|author2=Peter Flint|title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC|accessdate=15 March 2013|date=10 July 2005|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-567-08468-2}}</ref>{{rp|5}} The original scrolls continued to change hands after the Bedouin left them in the possession of a third party until a sale could be arranged. (See [[#Ownership|Ownership]].)\n\nIn 1947 the original seven scrolls caught the attention of Dr. [[John C. Trever]], of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (ASOR), who compared the script in the scrolls to that of ''The [[Nash Papyrus]]'', the oldest biblical manuscript then known, and found similarities between them. In March the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] prompted the move of some of the scrolls to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], for safekeeping. On 11 April 1948, [[Millar Burrows]], head of the ASOR, announced the discovery of the scrolls in a general press release.\n\n===Search for the Qumran caves (1948–1949)===\nEarly in September 1948, Metropolitan bishop Mar Samuel brought some additional scroll fragments that he had acquired to Professor [[Ovid R. Sellers]], the new Director of ASOR. By the end of 1948, nearly two years after their discovery, scholars had yet to locate the original cave where the fragments had been found. With unrest in the country at that time, no large-scale search could be undertaken safely. Sellers  tried to get the [[Syrian people|Syrians]] to assist in the search for the cave, but he was unable to pay their price. In early 1948, the government of Jordan gave permission to the [[Arab Legion]] to search the area where the original Qumran cave was thought to be. Consequently, Cave 1 was rediscovered on 28 January 1949, by Belgian [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|observer]] Captain Phillipe Lippens and Arab Legion Captain Akkash el-Zebn.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Archaeological Site OF Qumran and the Personality Of Roland De Vaux |url=http://www.biblicaltheology.com/Research/TrstenskyF01.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Qumran caves rediscovery and new scroll discoveries (1949–1951)===\n[[File:View of the Dead Sea from a Cave at Qumran.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the Dead Sea from a cave at Qumran in which some of the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered.]]\nThe rediscovery of what became known as \"Cave 1\" at Qumran prompted the initial excavation of the site from 15 February to 5 March 1949 by the Jordanian Department of Antiquities led by [[Gerald Lankester Harding]] and [[Roland de Vaux]].<ref>VanderKam, James C., The Dead Sea Scrolls Today, Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1994. p. 9.</ref> The Cave 1 site yielded discoveries of additional Dead Sea Scroll fragments, linen cloth, jars, and other artifacts.<ref name=\"biblicaltheology.com\">{{cite web |author=S.S.L.

It is now 26.7&nbsp;feet (8.15&nbsp;m) long. Its original length may have been over 28&nbsp;feet (8.75&nbsp;m). [[Temple Scroll|The Temple Scroll]] was regarded by [[Yigael Yadin]] as \"The Torah According to the Essenes\". On the other hand, Hartmut Stegemann, a contemporary and friend of Yadin, believed the scroll was not to be regarded as such, but was a document without exceptional significance. Stegemann notes that it is not mentioned or cited in any known Essene writing.<ref>Stegemann, Hartmut. \"The Qumran Essenes: Local Members of the Main Jewish Union in Late Second Temple Times.\" Pages 83–166 in ''The Madrid Qumran Congress: Proceedings of the International Congress on the Dead Sea Scrolls, Madrid, 18–21 March 1991'', Edited by J.

The dominant theory remains that the scrolls were the product of a sect of Jews living at nearby Qumran called the [[Essenes]], but this theory has come to be challenged by several modern scholars.\n\n===Qumran–Essene theory===\n{{main|Qumran#Qumran-Essene hypothesis}}\nThe view among scholars, almost universally held until the 1990s, is the \"Qumran–Essene\" hypothesis originally posited by [[Roland De Vaux|Roland Guérin de Vaux]]<ref>de Vaux, Roland, ''Archaeology and the Dead Sea Scrolls'' (Schweich Lectures of the British Academy, 1959). Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1973.</ref> and [[Józef Milik|Józef Tadeusz Milik]],<ref>Milik, Józef Tadeusz, ''Ten Years of Discovery in the Wilderness of Judea'', London: SCM, 1959.</ref> though independently both [[Eliezer Sukenik]] and Butrus Sowmy of St Mark's Monastery connected scrolls with the Essenes well before any excavations at Qumran.<ref>For Sowmy, see: Trever, John C., ''The Untold Story of Qumran'', (Westwood: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1965), p. 25.</ref> The Qumran–Essene theory holds that the scrolls were written by the Essenes, or by another Jewish sectarian group, residing at [[Qumran|Khirbet Qumran]]. They composed the scrolls and ultimately hid them in the nearby caves during the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish Revolt]] sometime between 66 and 68&nbsp;CE. The site of Qumran was destroyed and the scrolls never recovered.\nA number of arguments are used to support this theory.\n* There are striking similarities between the description of an initiation ceremony of new members in the [[Community Rule]] and descriptions of the Essene initiation ceremony mentioned in the works of Flavius [[Josephus]] – a Jewish–Roman historian of the Second Temple Period.\n* Josephus mentions the Essenes as sharing property among the members of the community, as does the Community Rule.\n* During the excavation of [[Qumran|Khirbet Qumran]], two inkwells and plastered elements thought to be tables were found, offering evidence that some form of writing was done there. More inkwells were discovered nearby. [[Roland de Vaux|De Vaux]] called this area the \"[[scriptorium]]\" based upon this discovery.\n* Several Jewish [[Mikvah|ritual baths]] (Hebrew: ''[[Mikvah|miqvah]]'' = מקוה) were discovered at Qumran, offering evidence of an observant [[Jew]]ish presence at the site.\n* [[Pliny the Elder]] (a geographer writing after the fall of [[Jerusalem]] in 70&nbsp;CE) describes a group of Essenes living in a desert community on the northwest shore of the [[Dead Sea]] near the ruined town of '[[Ein Gedi]].\n\n===Qumran–Sectarian theory===\nQumran–Sectarian theories are variations on the Qumran–Essene theory. The main point of departure from the Qumran–Essene theory is hesitation to link the Dead Sea Scrolls specifically with the Essenes. Most proponents of the Qumran–Sectarian theory understand a group of Jews living in or near Qumran to be responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls, but do not necessarily conclude that the sectarians are Essenes.\n\n====Qumran–Sadducean theory====\nA specific variation on the Qumran–Sectarian theory that has gained much recent popularity is the work of [[Lawrence Schiffman|Lawrence H. Schiffman]], who proposes that the community was led by a group of Zadokite priests ([[Sadducees]]).<ref>Schiffman, Lawrence H., ''Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls: their True Meaning for Judaism and Christianity'', Anchor Bible Reference Library (Doubleday) 1995.</ref> The most important document in support of this view is the \"[[4QMMT|Miqsat Ma'ase Ha-Torah]]\" ([[4QMMT]]), which cites purity laws (such as the transfer of impurities) identical to those attributed in rabbinic writings to the Sadducees. [[4QMMT]] also reproduces a festival calendar that follows [[Sadducee]] principles for the dating of certain festival days.\n\n===Christian origin theory===\n[[Spain|Spanish]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[José O'Callaghan Martínez]] argued in the 1960s that one fragment ([[7Q5]]) preserves a portion of text from the [[New Testament]] [[Gospel of Mark]] 6:52–53.<ref>O'Callaghan–Martínez, Josep, ''Cartas Cristianas Griegas del Siglo V'', Barcelona: E. Balmes, 1963.</ref> This theory was [[Falsifiability|falsified]] in the year 2000 by paleographic analysis of the particular fragment.<ref>Enste, Stefan. (2000). ''Kein Markustext in Qumran: Eine Untersuchung der These; Qumran-Fragment 7Q5 = Mk 6, 52–53 (No Mark text: an enquiry of the thesis; Qumran fragment 7Q5 = Gospel of Mark 6: 52–53)''. Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht. {{ISBN|978-3-525-53945-3}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Eisenman]] has advanced the theory that some scrolls describe the [[early Christian]] community. Eisenman also argued that the careers of [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]] and [[Paul the Apostle]] correspond to events recorded in some of these documents.<ref>Eisenman, Robert H. J''ames, the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 1st American ed. New York: Viking, 1997.</ref>\n\n===Jerusalem origin theory===\nSome scholars have argued that the scrolls were the product of [[Judaism|Jews]] living in [[Jerusalem]], who hid the scrolls in the caves near Qumran while fleeing from the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] during the destruction of Jerusalem in 70&nbsp;CE.<ref>Chernoivanenko, Vitaly. \"[http://history.ukma.edu.ua/docs/faculty/chernoivanenko/publications/chernoivanenko_jerusalem-theoryen.pdf The Jerusalem Theory of the Dead Sea Scrolls Authorship: Origins, Evolution, and Discussions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317215902/http://history.ukma.edu.ua/docs/faculty/chernoivanenko/publications/chernoivanenko_jerusalem-theoryen.pdf |date=17 March 2016 }},\" in ''Ukrainian Orientalistics: Special Issue on Jewish Studies'', Кyiv: NaUKMA Omeljan Pritsak Center for Oriental Studies, 2011: 9–29.</ref> Karl Heinrich Rengstorf first proposed that the Dead Sea Scrolls originated at the library of the Jewish [[Temple in Jerusalem]].<ref>Rengstorf, Karl Heinrich. ''Hirbet Qumran und die Bibliothek vom Toten Meer''. Translated by J. R. Wilkie. Stuttgart: W. Kohlhammer, 1960.</ref> Later, [[Norman Golb]] suggested that the scrolls were the product of multiple libraries in Jerusalem, and not necessarily the Jerusalem Temple library.<ref>Golb, Norman, On the Jerusalem Origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls, University of Chicago Oriental Institute, 5 June 2009.</ref> <ref>Golb, Norman, ''Who Wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls? The Search for the Secret of Qumran'', New York: Scribner, 1995.</ref> Proponents of the Jerusalem Origin theory point to the diversity of thought and handwriting among the scrolls as evidence against a Qumran origin of the scrolls. Several archaeologists have also accepted an origin of the scrolls other than Qumran, including [[Yizhar Hirschfeld]]<ref>Hirschfeld, Yizhar, ''Qumran in Context: Reassessing the Archaeological Evidence'', Peabody: Hendrickson Publishers, 2004.</ref> and most recently Yizhak Magen and Yuval Peleg,<ref>{{cite web |first1=Magen|last1= Yizhak |first2= Yuval |last2=Peleg |title=The Qumran Excavations 1993–2004: Preliminary Report'', JSP 6 |publisher=Jerusalem: Israel Antiquities Authority |year=2007 |url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/images/shop/jsp/JSP6_Qumran_color.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> who all understand the remains of Qumran to be those of a [[Hasmonean]] fort that was reused during later periods.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n===Age===\n\n====Radiocarbon dating====\n{{Main article|Carbon dating the Dead Sea Scrolls}}\nParchment from a number of the Dead Sea Scrolls has been [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dated]]. The initial test performed in 1950 was on a piece of linen from one of the caves. This test gave an indicative dating of 33&nbsp;CE plus or minus 200 years, eliminating early hypotheses relating the scrolls to the medieval period.<ref>Doudna, G. \"Carbon-14 Dating\", in ''Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', Schiffman, Lawrence, Tov, Emanuel, & VanderKam, James, eds., Vol.1 (Oxford: 2000)</ref> Since then two large series of tests have been performed on the scrolls themselves. The results were summarized by VanderKam and Flint, who said the tests give \"strong reason for thinking that most of the Qumran manuscripts belong to the last two centuries BCE and the first century CE.\"<ref name=\"VanderKamFlint2005\"/>{{rp|32}}\n\n====Paleographic dating====\nAnalysis of letter forms, or [[palaeography]], was applied to the texts of the Dead Sea Scrolls by a variety of scholars in the field.

During a portion of the conflict during the [[Suez Crisis|1956 war]] waged by Israel, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] against [[Egypt]], the scrolls collection of the Palestine Archaeological Museum was stored in the [[bank vault|vault]] of the [[Ottoman Bank]] in Amman, Jordan.<ref name=\"Fitzmyer, Joseph A 1992\">Fitzmyer, Joseph A.

Most of the longer, more complete scrolls were published soon after their discovery. All the writings in Cave 1 appeared in print between 1950 and 1956; those from eight other caves were released in 1963; and 1965 saw the publication of the Psalms Scroll from Cave 11. Their translations into English soon followed.\n\n==== Controversy ====\nPublication of the scrolls has taken many decades, and delays have been a source of academic controversy.  The scrolls were controlled by a small group of scholars headed by [[John Strugnell]], while a majority of scholars had access neither to the scrolls nor even to photographs of the text. Scholars such as [[Hershel Shanks]], [[Norman Golb]], and many others argued for decades for publishing the texts, so that they become available to researchers. This controversy only ended in 1991, when the Biblical Archaeology Society was able to publish the \"Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls\", after an intervention of the Israeli government and the Israeli Antiquities Authority (IAA).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910922&slug=1306832 |title=Copies Of Dead Sea Scrolls To Go Public – Release Would End Scholars' Dispute' |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=22 September 1991}}</ref> In 1991 [[Emanuel Tov]] was appointed as the chairman of the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation, and publication of the scrolls followed in the same year.\n\n====Physical description====\nThe majority of the scrolls consist of tiny, brittle fragments, which were published at a pace considered by many to be excessively slow.

The biblical manuscripts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls push that date back a full thousand years, to the 2nd century BCE.<ref>{{cite book|title=Radiocarbon dating and the dead sea scrolls: A comment on \"REDATING\"|author=Johannes Van Der Plitch|publisher=Center for Isotope Research, Groningen University and Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University|url=http://ehacksandcheats.com/pdf/2007DeadSeaDiscovvdPlicht.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914023047/http://ehacksandcheats.com/pdf/2007DeadSeaDiscovvdPlicht.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-09-14}}</ref> This was a significant discovery for Old Testament scholars who anticipated that the Dead Sea Scrolls would either affirm or repudiate the reliability of textual transmission from the original texts to the oldest Masoretic texts at hand. The discovery demonstrated the unusual accuracy of transmission over a thousand-year period, rendering it reasonable to believe that current Old Testament texts are reliable copies of the original works.\n\nAccording to ''The Dead Sea Scrolls'' by Hebrew scholar Millar Burrows, <blockquote>Of the 166 ''words'' in Isaiah 53, there are only seventeen ''letters'' in question. Ten of these letters are simply a matter of spelling, which does not affect the sense. Four more letters are minor stylistic changes, such as conjunctions. The remaining three letters comprise the word \"light,\" which is added in verse 11, and does not affect the meaning greatly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls|last=Burrows|first=Millar|publisher=Moody Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=304}}</ref></blockquote>It is important to note that some differences were found among fragments of texts. According to ''The Oxford Companion to Archaeology'':{{Quote|While some of the Qumran biblical manuscripts are nearly identical to the Masoretic, or traditional, Hebrew text of the Old Testament, some manuscripts of the books of Exodus and Samuel found in Cave Four exhibit dramatic differences in both language and content. In their astonishing range of textual variants, the Qumran biblical discoveries have prompted scholars to reconsider the once-accepted theories of the development of the modern biblical text from only three manuscript families: of the Masoretic text, of the Hebrew original of the [[Septuagint]], and of the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]]. It is now becoming increasingly clear that the Old Testament scripture was extremely fluid until [[Development of the Old Testament canon|its canonization]] around A.D. 100.<!-- NOTE: this is a quotation so the value should stay \"A.D. 100\" as quoted --><ref>Fagan, Brian M., and Charlotte Beck, ''The Oxford Companion to Archeology'', entry on the \"Dead sea scrolls\", Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref>|sign=|source=}}The conclusion, then, is that the Dead Sea scrolls have taken Biblical scholarship to a new era where much of what was previously believed can now be confirmed, and some of what was accepted as fact should now be reexamined so Biblical texts can correspond precisely with what was originally written.\n\nTo quote Gleason Archer's ''A Survey of Old Testament Introduction:''<blockquote>In conclusion, we should accord to the Masoretes the highest praise for their meticulous care in preserving so sedulously the consonantal text of the Sopherim which had been entrusted to them. They, together with the Sopherim themselves, gave the most diligent attention to the accurate preservation of the Hebrew Scriptures that has ever been devoted to any ancient literature, secular or religious, in the history of human civilization... </blockquote><blockquote>Because of their faithfulness, we have today a form of the Hebrew text which in all essentials duplicates the recension which was considered authoritative in the days of Christ and the apostles, if not a century earlier. And this in turn, judging from Qumran evidence, goes back to an authoritative revision of the Old Testament text which was drawn up on the basis of the most reliable manuscripts available for collation from previous centuries. These bring us very close in all essentials to the original autographs themselves, and furnish us with an authentic record of God's revelation. As W. F. Albright has said, \"We may rest assured that the consonantal text of the Hebrew Bible, though not infallible has been preserved with an accuracy perhaps unparalleled in any other Near Eastern literature.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Survey of Old Testament Introduction|last=Archer|first=Gleason|publisher=Moody Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=65}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n===Biblical books found===\nThere are 225 Biblical texts included in the Dead Sea Scroll documents, or around 22% of the total, and with [[deuterocanonical books]] the number increases to 235.<ref name=\"AbeggFlint2012\"/><ref>Abegg et al. \"The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible: The Oldest Known Bible Translated for the First Time into English.\" 1999.</ref> The Dead Sea Scrolls contain parts of all but one of the books of the [[Tanakh]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Old Testament]] [[Protocanonical books|protocanon]].

After examining the scrolls and suspecting their antiquity, Mar Samuel expressed an interest in purchasing them.

More scrolls soon surfaced in the antiquities market, and Professor [[Eleazer Sukenik]] and Professor [[Benjamin Mazar]], Israeli archaeologists at Hebrew University, soon found themselves in possession of three, ''The [[War Scroll]]'', ''[[Thanksgiving Hymns]]'', and another, more fragmented, Isaiah scroll (1QIsa<sup>b</sup>).\n\nFour of the Dead Sea Scrolls eventually went up for sale in an advertisement in the 1 June 1954, ''[[Wall Street Journal]].''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls – Discovery and Publication|url=http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/learn-about-the-scrolls/discovery-and-publication?locale=en_US|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> On 1 July 1954, the scrolls, after delicate negotiations and accompanied by three people including the Metropolitan, arrived at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York.

This ambiguity arises from differences in [[copyright]] law across different countries and the variable interpretation of such law.\n\n====Copyright of the original scrolls and translations, Qimron v. Shanks (1992)====\nIn 1992 a copyright case ''[[Qimron v. Shanks]]'' was brought before the Israeli District court by scholar [[Elisha Qimron]] against [[Hershel Shanks]] of the [[Biblical Archaeology Society]] for violations of United States copyright law regarding his publishing of reconstructions of Dead Sea Scroll texts done by Qimron in ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls'' which were included without his permission. Qimron's suit against the Biblical Archaeology Society was done on the grounds that the research they had published was his intellectual property as he had reconstructed about 40% of the published text. In 1993, the district court Judge [[Dalia Dorner]] ruled for the plaintiff, Elisha Qimron, in context of both United States and Israeli copyright law and granted the highest compensation allowed by law for aggravation in compensation against Hershel Shanks and others.<ref name=\"houstonlawreview.org\">{{cite web |last=Nimmer|first=David|work=Houston Law Review |title=Copyright in the Dead Sea Scrolls |url=http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/38-1_pdf/HLR38P1.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= 15 June 2012}}</ref> In an appeal in 2000 in front of Judge [[Aharon Barak]], the verdict was upheld in [[Israeli Supreme Court]] in Qimron's favor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/d/dead_sea_scrolls/index.html?query=SHANKS,%20HERSHEL&field=per&match=exact|title=Dead Sea Scrolls|work=New York Times}}</ref> The court case established the two main principles from which facsimiles are examined under copyright law of the United States and Israel: authorship and originality.\n\nThe courts ruling not only affirms that the \"deciphered text\" of the scrolls can fall under copyright of individuals or groups, but makes it clear that the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves do not fall under this copyright law and scholars have a degree of, in the words of U.S. copyright law professor [[David Nimmer]], \"freedom\" in access. Nimmer has shown how this freedom was in the theory of law applicable, but how it did not exist in reality as the Israeli Antiquities Authority tightly controlled access to the scrolls and photographs of the scrolls.<ref name=\"houstonlawreview.org\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ancient Hebrew writings]]\n* ''[[Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls]]''\n* [[Cairo Geniza]]\n* [[École Biblique]] – from which came one of the initial translation teams\n* [[Nag Hammadi library]]\n* [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]\n* [[Teacher of Righteousness]]\n* [[The Book of Mysteries]]\n* [[Jordan Lead Codices]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Abegg, Jr., Martin, Peter Flint, and [[Eugene Ulrich]], ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible: The Oldest Known Bible Translated for the First Time into English'', San Francisco: Harper, 2002. {{ISBN|0-06-060064-0}}, (contains the biblical portion of the scrolls)\n* Abegg, Jr. Martin, [[James E.
