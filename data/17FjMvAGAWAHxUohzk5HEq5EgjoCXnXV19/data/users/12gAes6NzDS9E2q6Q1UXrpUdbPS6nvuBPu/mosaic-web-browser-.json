In general, non-commercial use was free of charge for all versions (with certain limitations). Additionally, the X Window System/Unix version publicly provided [[source code]] (source code for the other versions was available after agreements were signed).

These browsers, however, did not have the same effect as Mosaic on public use of the Internet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ref.web.cern.ch/ref/CERN/CNL/2001/001/www-history/ |title=A Little History of the World Wide Web From 1960s to 1995 |date=2001-05-05|accessdate=2006-12-16|publisher=[[CERN]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the October 1994 issue of Wired Magazine, Gary Wolfe notes in the article titled \"The (Second Phase of the) Revolution Has Begun: Don't look now, but [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], [[AOL]], and [[CompuServe]] are all suddenly obsolete – and Mosaic is well on its way to becoming the world's standard interface\":\n\n{{quote | text=When it comes to smashing a paradigm, pleasure is not the most important thing. It is the only thing. If this sounds wrong, consider Mosaic. Mosaic is the celebrated graphical \"browser\" that allows users to travel through the world of electronic information using a point-and-click interface. Mosaic's charming appearance encourages users to load their own documents onto the Net, including color photos, sound bites, video clips, and hypertext \"links\" to other documents. By following the links - click, and the linked document appears - you can travel through the online world along paths of whim and intuition. Mosaic is not the most direct way to find online information. Nor is it the most powerful. It is merely the most pleasurable way, and in the 18 months since it was released, Mosaic has incited a rush of excitement and commercial energy unprecedented in the history of the Net.<ref name=\"The Second Phase\"/>}}\n\n==Impact of Mosaic==<!-- This section is linked from [[History of the Internet]] -->\nMosaic was the web browser that led to the [[Internet boom]] of the 1990s. Robert Reid underscores this importance stating, \"while still an undergraduate, Marc wrote the Mosaic software&nbsp;... that made the web popularly relevant and touched off the revolution\".<ref name=\"Architects of the Web\"/>{{rp|xlii}} Reid notes that Andreessen's team hoped:\n\n{{quote | text=... to rectify many of the shortcomings of the very primitive prototypes then floating around the Internet. Most significantly, their work transformed the appeal of the Web from niche uses in the technical area to mass-market appeal. In particular, these University of Illinois students made two key changes to the Web browser, which hyper-boosted its appeal: they added graphics to what was otherwise boring text-based software, and, most importantly, they ported the software from so-called [[Unix]] computers that are popular only in technical and academic circles, to the [Microsoft] Windows operating system, which is used on more than 80 percent of the computers in the world, especially personal and commercial computers.<ref name=\"Architects of the Web\">{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Robert H. |title=Architects of the Web: 1000 Days That Built the Future of Business |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=1997 |isbn=0-471-17187-5}}</ref>{{rp|xxv}}}}\n\nMosaic is not the first web browser for Microsoft Windows; this is [[Thomas R. Bruce]]'s little-known [[Cello (web browser)|Cello]]. The Unix version of Mosaic was already famous before the Microsoft Windows and Mac versions were released. Other than displaying images embedded in the text rather than in a separate window, Mosaic's original feature set is not greater than of the browsers on which it was modeled, such as ViolaWWW.<ref name=\"faq\" /> But Mosaic was the first browser written and supported by a team of full-time programmers, was reliable and easy enough for novices to install, and the inline graphics reportedly proved immensely appealing. Mosaic is said to have made the Web accessible to the ordinary person for the first time and already had 53% [[Usage share of web browsers|market share]] in 1995.<ref name=\"CiteSeerX\">{{cite journal|last1=Cockburn|first1=Andy|title=Which Way Now?

Gray]]'s website, [http://www.mit.edu/~mkgray/net/ Internet Statistics: Growth and Usage of the Web and the Internet], which indicates a dramatic leap in web use around the time of Mosaic's introduction.<ref name=\"Architects of the Web\"/>{{rp|xxv}}\n\nIn addition, David Hudson concurs with Reid, noting that:\n\n{{quote | text=Marc Andreessen's realization of Mosaic, based on the work of [[Tim Berners-Lee|Berners-Lee]] and the hypertext theorists before him, is generally recognized as the beginning of the web as it is now known. Mosaic, the first web browser to win over the Net masses, was released in 1993 and made freely accessible to the public. The adjective phenomenal, so often overused in this industry, is genuinely applicable to the... 'explosion' in the growth of the web after Mosaic appeared on the scene. Starting with next to nothing, the rates of the web growth (quoted in the press) hovering around tens of thousands of percent over ridiculously short periods of time were no real surprise.<ref name=\"Rewired\">{{cite book | last=Hudson | first=David | title=Rewired: A Brief and Opinionated Net History |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Macmillan Technical Publishing |year=1997 |isbn=1-57870-003-5 }}</ref>{{rp|42}}}}\n\nUltimately, web browsers such as Mosaic became the ''[[killer application]]s'' of the 1990s. Web browsers were the first to bring a graphical interface to search tools the Internet's burgeoning wealth of distributed information services. A mid-1994 guide lists Mosaic alongside the traditional, text-oriented information search tools of the time, [[Archie search engine|Archie]] and [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]], [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]], and [[Wide area information server|WAIS]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lucey|first=Sean|title=Internet tools help navigate the busy virtual highway.|journal=MacWeek|date=9 May 1994|page=51}}</ref> but Mosaic quickly subsumed and displaced them all. Joseph Hardin, the director of the NCSA group within which Mosaic was developed, said downloads were up to 50,000 a month in mid-1994.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Levitt|first=Jason|title=A Matter of Attribution: Can't Forget to Give Credit for Mosaic Where Credit is Due|journal=Open Systems Today|date=9 May 1994|page=71}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1992, there were twenty-six websites in the world<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.cern.ch/|title=home of the first website|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2014-06-16}}</ref> and each one attracted attention. In its release year of 1993, Mosaic had a What's New page, and about one new link was being added per day. This was a time when access to the Internet was expanding rapidly outside its previous domain of academia and large industrial research institutions. Yet it was the availability of Mosaic and Mosaic-derived graphical browsers themselves that drove the explosive growth of the Web to over 10,000 sites by Aug 1995 and millions by 1998.<ref>[http://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/ Web Server Survey | Netcraft].

This was noted at the time in ''The HTML Sourcebook: The Complete Guide to HTML'': \"Netscape Communications has designed an all-new WWW browser Netscape, that has significant enhancements over the original Mosaic program.\"<ref name=\"The HTML Sourcebook\"/>{{rp|332}}\n\nBy 1998 its user base had almost completely evaporated, being replaced by other web browsers. After NCSA stopped work on Mosaic, development of the NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System source code was continued by several independent groups. These independent development efforts include mMosaic (multicast Mosaic)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/9610_Workshop/paper05/paper05.html |title=W3C mMosaic |last=dauphin |first=Gilles |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |year=1996 |accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref> which ceased development in early 2004, and Mosaic-CK and VMS Mosaic.\n\n'''VMS Mosaic''', a version specifically targeting [[OpenVMS]] operating system, was one of the longest-lived efforts to maintain Mosaic.
