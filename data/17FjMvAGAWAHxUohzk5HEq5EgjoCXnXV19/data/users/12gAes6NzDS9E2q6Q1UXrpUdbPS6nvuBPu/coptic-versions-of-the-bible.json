Several different versions were made in the ancient world, with different editions of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]] in all four of the major dialects of [[Coptic language|Coptic]]: [[Bohairic]] (northern), [[Fayyumic]], [[Sahidic]] (southern), [[Akhmimic]], and Mesokemic. Biblical books were translated from the Alexandrian Greek version.\n\nThe Sahidic was the leading dialect in the pre-[[Islam]]ic period, after the 11th century Bohairic became dominant and only used dialect of the Coptic language.\n\nPartial copies of a number of Coptic Bibles survive. A considerable number of [[apocryphal]] texts also survive in Coptic, most notably the [[Gnostic]] [[Nag Hammadi library]]. Coptic remains the liturgical language of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] and Coptic editions of the Bible are central to that faith.\n\n== Old Testament ==\n\n[[File:NaplesBibVittEmanIIIMS1B18Fol4vLotAndDaughters.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Job and his daughter from folio 4v of [[Old Testament fragment (Naples, Biblioteca Vittorio Emanuele III, I B 18)|Biblioteca Vittorio Emanuele III, MS I B 18]].]]\nTranslators of books of the Old Testament into Egyptian dialects were naturally made from the Alexandrian Greek version ([[Septuagint]]), and there is no reason to doubt that they were translated at as early a date as the Gospels and Epistles, if not indeed before them.

The Sahidic was the leading dialect in the pre-[[Islam]]ic period. The earliest Bohairic manuscripts date to the 4th century \n, but most texts come from the 9th century and later.\n\n=== Sahidic ===\n\nThe collection of manuscripts of Sahidic translations is often designated by cop<sup>sa</sup> in academic writing and [[critical apparatus]] (\"Sa\" for \"versio Sahidica\" in BHS). The first translation into the Sahidic dialect was made at the end of the 2nd century in Upper Egypt, where Greek was less well understood. So the Sahidic is famous for being the first major literary development of the Coptic language, though literary work in the other dialects soon followed. By the ninth century, Sahidic was gradually replaced by neighbouring Bohairic, and disappeared. Knowledge of the Sahidic manuscripts was lost until they were rediscovered in the 18th century. In 1778 [[Carl Gottfried Woide|Woide]] issued a prospectus in which he announced his intention of publishing from Oxford manuscripts the fragments of the New Testament \"iuxta interpretationem dialecti Superioris Aegypti, quae Thebaidica seu Sahidica appellantur\".<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Scrivener\n | first = Frederick Henry Ambrose\n | authorlink = Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener\n |author2=Edward Miller\n | title = [[A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament]]\n | publisher = [[George Bell & Sons]]\n | year = 1894\n | location = London\n | edition = 4\n | volume = 1\n | pages = 127–128\n | url = \n | doi = \n | id = \n | isbn = }}</ref> Another fragments were published in 1884 by [[Émile Amélineau]].<ref>E.

Probably, it was made in the beginning of the 3rd century. It was a very literal translation; many Greek words, and even some grammatical forms (e.g. syntactic construction μεν — δε) were incorporated to this translation. For this reason, the Bohairic translation is more helpful in the reconstruction of the early Greek text than any other ancient translation. It should also be noted that the Bohairic translation was influenced by several variables, including the other dialects, primarily Sahidic and Fayyumic. When the patriarchate moved from [[Alexandria]] to [[Cairo]] in the 11th century, Bohairic was the dominant language of the Coptic church. As the official dialect of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]], Bohairic seems to enjoy a strong relationship with mainly the other dialects, [[Egyptian Arabic]] and—as it was for several centuries—Greek. The text is mainly Alexandrian, somewhat influenced by the [[Western text-type]].
