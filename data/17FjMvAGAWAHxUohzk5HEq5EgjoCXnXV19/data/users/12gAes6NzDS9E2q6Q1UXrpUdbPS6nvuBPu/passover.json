[[Jews]] celebrate Passover as a commemoration of their liberation by [[names of god in Judaism|God]] from slavery in [[ancient Egypt]]  and their freedom as a nation under the leadership of [[Moses]]. It commemorates the story of [[the Exodus]] as described in the [[Hebrew Bible]], especially in the [[Book of Exodus]], in which the [[Israelites]] were freed from slavery in Egypt. According to standard [[biblical chronology]], this event would have taken place at about 1300 BCE ([[Anno Mundi|AM]] 2450).<ref>The [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] calculates the lifespan of Moses as 1391–1271 BCE, which would correspond to a date of the Exodus of 40 years before 1271, i.e. 1311 BCE.</ref>\n\nPassover is a spring festival which during the existence of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] was connected to the offering of the \"first-fruits of the barley\", barley being the first grain to ripen and to be harvested in the [[Land of Israel]].<ref name=Barley>Josephus, Antiquities 3.250–251, in Josephus IV Jewish Antiquities Books I–IV, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1930, pp.&nbsp;437–439.</ref>\n\nPassover commences on the 15th of the [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew month]] of [[Nisan]] and lasts for either seven days (in [[Israel]] and for [[Reform Jews]] and other progressive Jews around the world who adhere to the Biblical commandment) or eight days for [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]], and most [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews (in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]]).<ref>{{cite web| last1= Shapiro| first1= Mark Dov|title=How Long is Passover?|url=http://www.sinai-temple.org/passover/length.php |website= sinai-temple.org| publisher= Sinai Temple |accessdate=April 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.reformjudaism.org/passover-7-or-8-days|last1=Dreyfus|first1=Ben|title=Is Passover 7 or 8 Days?|website= ReformJudaism.org|publisher=Union for Reform Judaism|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}</ref> In [[Judaism]], a [[Day#Boundaries of the day|day]] commences at [[dusk]] and lasts until the following dusk, thus the first day of Passover begins after dusk of the 14th of Nisan and ends at dusk of the 15th day of the month of Nisan.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]] Passover takes place in [[spring (season)|spring]] as the [[Torah]] prescribes it: \"in the month of [the] spring\" ({{lang|he|בחדש האביב}} {{bibleverse||Exodus|23:15|HE}}). It is one of the most widely celebrated [[Jewish holidays]].\n\nIn the narrative of the Exodus, the Bible tells that God helped the [[Israelites|Children of Israel]] escape from their slavery in Egypt by inflicting [[Plagues of Egypt|ten plagues]] upon the ancient Egyptians before the Pharaoh would release his Israelite slaves; the tenth and worst of the plagues was the [[Plagues of Egypt#10. Death of the firstborn (מַכַּת בְּכוֹרוֹת): Ex. 11:1–12:36|death of the Egyptian first-born]].\n\nThe Israelites were instructed to mark the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a slaughtered spring lamb and, upon seeing this, the spirit of the Lord knew to ''pass over'' the first-born in these homes, hence the English name of the holiday.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:11–13|HE}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Pharaoh freed the Israelites, it is said that they left in such a hurry that they could not wait for bread dough to rise (leaven).

Diaspora Jews historically celebrated the festival for eight days. [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] Jews and Israeli Jews, wherever they are, usually celebrate the holiday over seven days. The reason for this extra day is due to enactment of the ancient Jewish sages.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is thought by many scholars that Jews outside of Israel could not be certain if their local calendars fully conformed to practice of the Temple at Jerusalem, so they added an extra day. But as this practice attaches only to certain (major) sacred days, others posit the extra day may have been added to accommodate people who had to travel long distances to participate in communal worship and ritual practices; or the practice may have evolved as a compromise between conflicting interpretations of Jewish Law regarding the calendar; or it may have evolved as a safety measure in areas where Jews were commonly in danger, so that their enemies would not be certain on which day to attack.<ref>De Lange, Nicholas (2000).

However, once Israel was in the wilderness and the tabernacle was in operation, a change was made in those two original requirements ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|16:2–6|HE}}).  Passover lambs were to be sacrificed at the door of the tabernacle and no longer in the homes of the Jews.  No longer, therefore, could blood be smeared on doorways.\n\nThe biblical commandments concerning the Passover (and the Feast of Unleavened Bread) stress the importance of remembering:\n\n*And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt; and thou shalt observe and do these statutes\" ({{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|16:12|HE}}).\n*{{Bibleverse||Exodus|12:14|HE}} commands, in reference to God's sparing of the firstborn from the [[Plagues of Egypt#10.

The removal (or \"sealing up\") of the leaven is referred to in the [[Elephantine papyri]], an [[Aramaic]] papyrus from 5th century BCE Elephantine in Egypt.<ref>James B. Prichard, ed., The Ancient Near East – An Anthology of Texts and Pictures, Volume 1, Princeton University Press, 1958, p.&nbsp;278.</ref> The slaughter of the lambs on the 14th is mentioned in ''[[Jubilees|The Book of Jubilees]]'', a Jewish work of the [[Ptolemaic period]], and by the [[Herodian]]-era writers [[Josephus]] and [[Philo]]. These sources also indicate that \"between the two evenings\" was taken to mean the afternoon.<ref>\"On the feast called Passover...they sacrifice from the ninth to the eleventh hour\", Josephus, ''Jewish War'' 6.423–428, in ''Josephus III, The Jewish War, Book IV–VII'', Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1979. Philo in one place (''Special Laws'' 2.148) states that the victims are sacrificed \"from noon till eventide\", and in another place (''Questions on Exodus'' 1.11) that the sacrifices begin at the ninth hour. According to Jubilees 49.12, \"it is not fitting to sacrifice [the Passover] during any time of light except during the time of the border of evening.\"</ref> ''Jubilees'' states the sacrifice was eaten that night,<ref>Jubilees 49.1.</ref> and together with Josephus states that nothing of the sacrifice was allowed to remain until morning.<ref>\"And what is left of its flesh from the third of the night and beyond, they shall burn with fire,\" ''Jubilees'' 49.12. \"We celebrate [the Passover] by fraternities, nothing of the sacrificial victims being kept for the morrow,\" Josephus, ''Antiquities'' 3.248.</ref> Philo states that the banquet included hymns and prayers.<ref>\"The guests assembled for the banquet have been cleansed by purificatory lustrations, and are there...to fulfill with prayers and hymns the custom handed down by their fathers.\" Philo, Special Laws 2.148, in ''Philo VII: On the Decalog; On the Special Laws I–III'', Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1937.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}\nThe English term \"Passover\" is first known to be recorded in the [[English language]] in [[William Tyndale]]'s translation of the Bible, later appearing in the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Version]] as well. It is a literal translation of the Hebrew term.\n\nThe [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|פֶּסַח}} is rendered as [[Tiberian Hebrew|Tiberian]] {{IPA-he|pɛsaħ||He-Pesach.ogg}}, and [[Modern Hebrew]]: {{IPA-he|ˈpesaχ|}} ''Pesah, Pesakh;'' The [[Yiddish]] word is Latinized variously as  ''Peysekh, Paysakh, Paysokh''. The etymology is disputed, and hypotheses are divided whether to connect it to ''psh'' (to protect, save) or to a word meaning 'limp, dance with limping motions.' Cognate languages yield similar terms with distinct meanings, such as 'make soft, soothe, placate' ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian ''passahu'']]), 'harvest, commemoration, blow' ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]), or 'separate' ([[Arabic language|Arabic ''fsh'']]'')''.<ref>Prosic, p.&nbsp;32.</ref>\n\nThe verb \"''pasàch''\" ({{lang|he|פָּסַח}}) is first mentioned in the [[Torah]]'s account of [[the Exodus]] from Egypt ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:23|HE}}), and there is some debate about its exact meaning: the commonly held assumption that it means \"He passed over\" ([[:wikt:פסח|פסח]]), in reference to God \"passing over\" (or \"skipping\") the houses of the Hebrews during the final of the Ten [[Plagues of Egypt]], stems from the translation provided in the [[Septuagint]] (παρελευσεται in {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:23|HE}}, and εσκεπασεν in {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:27|HE}}).\n[[Targum Onkelos]] translates ''pesach'' as וְיֵחוֹס \"he had pity\" coming from the Hebrew root ‘'''חסה'''’ meaning to have pity.<ref>https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.12.23?with=Onkelos%20Exodus&lang=bi&aliyot=0</ref>\n\nJudging from other instances of the verb, and instances of [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]],{{clarify|date=January 2013}} a more faithful translation may be \"he hovered over, guarding.\" Indeed, this is the image invoked by the verb in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 31:5: \"As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem; He will deliver it as He protecteth it, He will rescue it as He ''passeth over''\" (כְּצִפֳּרִים עָפוֹת – כֵּן יָגֵן יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת, עַל-יְרוּשָׁלִָם; גָּנוֹן וְהִצִּיל, פָּסֹחַ וְהִמְלִיט.) ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|31:5|HE}}) Both meanings become apparent in Exodus 12:23 when parsed as: the Lord will pass (hover, guard) over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer (destroying angel is commanded to pass by the children of Israel) to come in unto your houses to smite.\n\nThe term ''Pesach'' (Hebrew: {{lang|he|פֶּסַח}}) may also refer to the [[Domestic sheep|lamb]] or [[Domestic goat|goat]] which was designated as the Passover sacrifice (called the ''[[Korban Pesach]]'' in Hebrew). Four days before the Exodus, the Hebrews were commanded to set aside a lamb ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:3|HE}}), and inspect it daily for blemishes. During the day on the 14th of Nisan, they were to slaughter the animal and use its blood to mark their [[Post and lintel|lintels and door posts]]. Up until midnight on the 15th of Nisan, they were to consume the lamb. On the night of the first Passover at the start of the original Exodus, each family (or group of families) gathered together to eat a meal that included the meat of the ''Korban Pesach'' while the Tenth Plague ravaged Egypt.\n\n==Passover offering, ''Korban Pesach''==\n{{main|Korban Pesach}}\nThe main entity in Passover according to Judaism is the [[Korban Pesach|sacrificial lamb]].<ref name=\"Bokser\"/>\n\nDuring the existence of the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]] and later the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], the focus of the Passover festival was the Passover sacrifice (Hebrew ''korban Pesach''), also known as the Paschal lamb, eaten during the [[Passover Seder]] on the 15th of Nisan. Every family large enough to completely consume a young lamb or wild goat was required to offer one for sacrifice at the Jewish Temple on the afternoon of the 14th day of Nisan ({{bibleverse||Numbers|9:11|HE}}), and eat it that night, which was the 15th of Nisan  ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:6|NIV}}). If the family was too small to finish eating the entire offering in one sitting, an offering was made for a group of families. The sacrifice could not be offered with anything leavened ({{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}), and had to be roasted, without its head, feet, or inner organs being removed ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:9|HE}}) and eaten together with unleavened bread (''[[matzo]]'') and bitter herbs (''[[maror]]'').  One had to be careful not to break any bones from the offering ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:46|HE}}), and none of the meat could be left over by morning ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:10|HE}} {{bibleverse||Exodus|23:18|HE}}).\n\nBecause of the Passover sacrifice's status as a sacred offering, the only people allowed to eat it were those who had the obligation to bring the offering. Among those who could not offer or eat the Passover lamb were an [[apostate]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:43|HE}}), a [[Indentured servant|servant]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:45|HE}}), an [[Brit milah|uncircumcised man]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}), a person in a state of [[Tumah and taharah|ritual impurity]], except when a majority of Jews are in such a state (''[[Pesahim]]'' 66b), and a non-Jew. The offering had to be made before a [[quorum]] of 30 (''Pesahim'' 64b). In the Temple, the [[Levites]] sang [[Hallel]] while the [[Kohen|priests]] performed the sacrificial service. Men and women were equally obligated regarding the offering (''Pesahim'' 91b).\n\nWomen were obligated, as men, to perform the Korban Pesach and to participate in a Seder.\n\n===Today===\nToday, in the absence of the Temple, when no sacrifices are offered or eaten, the [[mitzvah]] of the ''Korban Pesach'' is memorialized in the ''Seder Korban Pesach'', a set of scriptural and Rabbinic passages dealing with the Passover sacrifice, customarily recited after the ''[[Mincha]]'' (afternoon prayer) service on the 14th on Nisan,<ref name=Kitov>{{cite book|first=Eliyahu|last=Kitov|title=The Book of Our Heritage: The Jewish Year and Its Days of Significance|publisher=Feldheim|year=1997|page=562}}</ref> and in the form of the ''[[zeroa]]'', a symbolic food placed on the [[Passover Seder Plate]] (but not eaten), which is usually a roasted [[humerus|shankbone]] (or a chicken wing or neck). The eating of the [[afikoman]] substitutes for the eating of the ''Korban Pesach'' at the end of the Seder meal ([[Mishnah]] Pesachim 119a). Many [[Sephardi Jews]] have the custom of eating lamb or goat meat during the Seder in memory of the ''Korban Pesach''.\n\n==Removing all chametz==\n{{see also|Chametz#Removal of chametz}}\n[[File:BiurChametz2010.jpg|thumb|250px|Burning chametz on the morning before Passover begins]]\n[[Chametz#What is chametz?|Chametz]] (חמץ, \"[[leavening]]\") is made from one of five types of grains<ref name=Pomerantz/> combined with water and left to stand for more than eighteen minutes. The consumption, keeping, and owning of ''chametz'' is forbidden during Passover. Yeast and fermentation are not themselves forbidden as seen for example by wine, which is required, rather than merely permitted. According to Halakha, the ownership of such ''chametz'' is also proscribed.\n\n''Chametz'' does not include [[baking soda]], [[baking powder]] or like products. Although these are defined in English as leavening agents, they leaven by chemical reaction, not by biological fermentation. Thus, bagels, waffles and pancakes made with baking soda and matzo meal are considered permissible, while bagels made with sourdough and pancakes and waffles made with yeast are prohibited.\n\nThe Torah commandments regarding ''chametz'' are:\n*To remove all ''chametz'' from one's home, including things made with chametz, before the first day of Passover ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:15|HE}}). It may be simply used up, thrown out (historically, destroyed by burning), or given or sold to non-Jews (or non-Samaritans, as the case may be).\n*To refrain from eating ''chametz'' or mixtures containing ''chametz'' during Passover ({{bibleverse||Exodus|13:3|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:20|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|16:3|HE}}).\n*Not to possess ''chametz'' in one's domain (i.e. home, office, car, etc.) during Passover ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:19|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|16:4|HE}}).\n\nObservant Jews spend the weeks before Passover in a flurry of thorough housecleaning, to remove every morsel of ''chametz'' from every part of the home. [[Halakha|Jewish law]] requires the elimination of [[olive]]-sized or larger quantities of leavening from one's possession, but most housekeeping goes beyond this. Even the cracks of kitchen counters are thoroughly scrubbed, for example, to remove any traces of flour and yeast, however small. Any item or implement that has handled ''chametz'' is generally put away and not used during Passover.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/ultra-orthodox-burn-leavened-food-before-passover-begins-1.356761 |title=Ultra Orthodox burn leavened food before Passover |work=Haaretz |date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome [[hotel]]s, [[resort]]s, and even [[cruise ship]]s across [[United States|America]], [[Europe]] and [[Israel]] also undergo a thorough housecleaning to make their premises \"kosher for Pesach\" to cater to observant Jews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thespruce.com/guide-to-kosher-travel-4050383|title=Get Out Of Town: Your Guide to Kosher Travel|first=Miri|last=Rotkovitz|date=May 6, 2016|accessdate=April 10, 2017|website=The Spruce}}</ref>\n\n===Interpretations for abstinence from leaven or yeast===\nSome scholars suggest that the command to abstain from leavened food or yeast suggests that sacrifices offered to God involve the offering of objects in \"their least altered state\", that would be nearest to the way in which they were initially made by God.<ref name=\"Bokser\">Bokser, Baruch M.

In some cases, they may never leave the house, instead being formally sold while remaining in the original owner's possession in a locked cabinet until they can be repurchased after the holiday. Modern observance may also include sealing cabinets and drawers which contain \"Chametz\" shut by using adhesive tape, which serves a similar purpose to a lock but also shows evidence of tampering. Although the practice of selling \"Chametz\" dates back many years, some Reform rabbinical authorities have come to regard it with disdain – since the supposed \"new owner\" never takes actual possession of the goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://louisjacobs.org/jewish-holidays/the-laws-of-pesach/|title=The Laws of Pesach|first1=Louis|last1=Jacobs|first2=Michael|last2=Rose|date=March 23, 1983|accessdate=April 10, 2017|website=Friends of Louis Jacobs}}</ref>\n\nThe sale of ''chametz'' may also be conducted communally via a [[rabbi]], who becomes the \"agent\" for all the community's Jews through a halakhic procedure called a ''kinyan'' (acquisition). Each householder must put aside all the ''chametz'' he is selling into a box or cupboard, and the rabbi enters into a contract to sell all the ''chametz'' to a non-Jew (who is not obligated to celebrate the commandments) in exchange for a small [[down payment]] (''e.g.'' $1.00), with the remainder due after Passover. This sale is considered completely binding according to Halakha, and at any time during the holiday, the buyer may come to take or partake of his property. The rabbi then re-purchases the goods for less than they were sold at the end of the holiday.<ref>[http://www.torahlearningcenter.com/jhq/question169.html Pesach questions and answers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928143423/http://www.torahlearningcenter.com/jhq/question169.html |date=September 28, 2007}} by the Torah Learning Center.\nRetrieved on March 31, 2018</ref>\n\n==Search for leaven {{anchor|Formal search for chametz}} ==\n{{main|bedikat chametz}}\n{{Wikisource|1=Translation:Talmud/Seder Moed/Tractate Pesachim/2a|2=Talmud's introduction to checking for chametz and defining ''or'' (literally, \"light\") (Tractate Pesachim 2a)}}\n\nOn the night of the fourteenth of [[Nisan]], the night before the [[Passover Seder]] (after nightfall on the evening before Passover eve), Jews do a formal search in their homes known as ''[[bedikat chametz]]'' for any possible remaining leaven (''[[chametz]]''). The [[Talmud]]ic sages instructed that a search for ''chametz'' be made in every home, place of work, or any place where ''chametz'' may have been brought during the year.<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\">{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Avie |last2=Zlotowitz|first2=Meir |last3=Scherman|first3=Nosson |title=The Complete ArtScroll Machzor: Pesach|date=1990–2002|publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd|location=Brooklyn, New York|isbn=0-89906-696-8|pages=2–3}}</ref>  When the first Seder is on a Saturday night, the search is conducted on the preceding Thursday night (thirteenth of Nisan) as [[Eve of Passover on Shabbat|''chametz'' cannot be burned during Shabbat]].\n\nThe [[Talmud]] in [[Pesahim]] (p.&nbsp;2a) derives from the [[Torah]] that the search for ''chametz'' be conducted by the light of a candle and therefore is done at night, and although the final destruction of the ''chametz'' (usually by burning it in a small bonfire) is done on the next morning, the blessing is made at night because the search is both in preparation for and part of the commandments to remove and destroy all ''chametz'' from one's possession.<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n===Blessing for search of chametz and nullification of chametz===\nBefore the search is begun there is a special [[Berakhah|blessing]]. If several people or family members assist in the search then only one person, usually the head of that family recites the blessing having in mind to include everyone present:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\n:Blessed are You, Hashem our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and has commanded us concerning the removal of chametz.\n\nIn Hebrew:\n\nברוך אתה יהוה אלהינו מלך העולם אשר קדשנו במצותיו וצונו על בעור חמץ\n\nThe search is then usually conducted by the head of the household joined by his family including children under the supervision of their parents.\n\nIt is customary to turn off the lights and conduct the search by [[candle]]light, using a feather and a wooden spoon: candlelight effectively illuminates corners without casting shadows; the feather can dust crumbs out of their hiding places; and the wooden spoon which collects the crumbs can be burned the next day with the ''chametz''. However, most contemporary Jewish-Orthodox authorities permit using a flashlight, while some strongly encourage it due to the danger coupled with using a candle.\n\nBecause the house is assumed to have been thoroughly cleaned by the night before Passover, there is some concern that making a blessing over the search for ''chametz'' will be in vain (''bracha l'vatala'') if nothing is found. Thus, 10 morsels of bread or cereal smaller than the size of an olive are traditionally hidden throughout the house in order to ensure that some ''chametz'' will be found.\n\nUpon conclusion of the search, with all the small pieces safely wrapped up and put in one bag or place, to be burned the next morning, the following is said:\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\nכל חמירא וחמיעא דאכא ברשותי דלא חמתה ודלא בערתה ודלא ידענא לה לבטל ולהוי הפקר כעפרא דארעא\n\n==Morning of 14th of Nissan==\nNote that if the 14th of Nissan is [[Shabbat]], many of the below will be celebrated on the 13th instead [[Eve of Passover on Shabbat|due to restrictions in place during Shabbat]].\n===Fast of the Firstborn===\n{{main|Fast of the Firstborn|siyum}}\nOn the day preceding the first Passover seder (or on Thursday morning preceding the seder, when the first seder falls on [[Motza'ei Shabbat]]), firstborn sons are commanded to celebrate the [[Fast of the Firstborn]] which commemorates the salvation of the Hebrew firstborns. According to {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:29|HE}}, God struck down all Egyptian firstborns while the Israelites were not affected. However, it is customary for synagogues to conduct a ''[[siyum]]'' (ceremony marking the completion of a section of [[Torah learning]]) right after [[Shacharit|morning prayers]], and the [[Seudat mitzvah|celebratory meal]] that follows cancels the firstborn's obligation to fast.\n\n===Burning and nullification of chametz===\nOn the morning of the 14th of [[Nisan]], any leavened products that remain in the householder's possession, along with the 10 morsels of bread from the previous night's search, are burned (''s'rayfat chametz''). The head of the household repeats the declaration of ''biyur chametz'', declaring any ''chametz'' that may not have been found to be null and void \"as the dust of the earth\":\n\n:Any chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\n\nOriginal declaration as recited in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]:<ref name=\"ArtScroll Pesach Machzor\" />\n\nכל חמירא וחמיעא דאכא ברשותי דלא חמתה ודלא בערתה ודלא ידענא לה לבטל ולהוי הפקר כעפרא דארעא\n\nShould more ''chametz'' actually be found in the house during the Passover holiday, it must be burnt as soon as possible.\n\nUnlike ''chametz'', which can be eaten any day of the year except during Passover, kosher for Passover foods can be eaten year-round. They need not be burnt or otherwise discarded after the holiday ends.\n\nThe historic \"Paschal lamb\" [[Passover sacrifice]] (''Korban Pesach'') has not been brought following the Romans' destruction of the [[Second Temple|Second Jewish temple]] approximately two thousand years ago, and it is therefore still not part of the modern Jewish holiday.\n\nHowever, the Paschal lamb is still a principal feature of Falashah, Karaite and Samaritan observance.\n\nIn the times when the Jewish Temples stood, the lamb was slaughtered and cooked on the evening of Passover and was completely consumed before the morning as described in {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:3–11|HE}}.\n\n==Separate kosher for Passover utensils and dishes==\n\nDue to the Torah injunction not to eat ''chametz'' during Passover ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:15|HE}}), observant families typically own complete sets of serving dishes, glassware and silverware (and in some cases, even separate dishwashers and sinks) which have never come into contact with ''chametz'', for use only during Passover. Under certain circumstances, some ''chametz'' utensils can be immersed in boiling water (''[[Hagalah|hagalat keilim]]'') to purge them of any traces of ''chametz'' that may have accumulated during the year. Many [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] families thoroughly wash their year-round glassware and then use it for Passover, as the Sephardic position is that [[glass]] does not absorb enough traces of food to present a problem. Similarly, ovens may be used for Passover either by setting the self-cleaning function to the highest degree for a certain period of time, or by applying a [[blow torch]] to the interior until the oven glows red hot (a process called ''libun gamur'').<ref name=\"WSJblowtorch\">{{Cite news\n  | last = Lagnado\n  | first = Lucette\n  | title = As Passover Nears, These Rabbis Are Getting Out Their Blowtorches\n  | pages = A1\n  | newspaper = The Wall Street Journal\n  | location = New York\n  | date = April 18, 2011\n  | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704628404576264751651607740\n}}</ref>\n\n==Matzah==\n{{main|Matzo}}\n[[Image:Machine-made Shmura Matzo.jpg|thumb|250px|Machine made ''shmura matza'']]\n\nA symbol of the Passover holiday is [[matzo]], an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is continually worked from mixing through baking, so that it is not allowed to rise. Matzo may be made by machine or by hand. The Torah contains an instruction to eat matzo, specifically, on the first night of Passover and to eat only unleavened bread (in practice, matzo) during the entire week of Passover.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:18|HE}}</ref> Consequently, the eating of matzo figures prominently in the [[Passover Seder]]. There are several explanations for this.\n\nThe Torah says that it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that there was no time to allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, matzo, is a reminder of the rapid departure of the Exodus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=107&o=60495 |title=Thought For Food: An Overview of the Seder | work =AskMoses.com – Judaism, Ask a Rabbi – Live}}</ref> Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to [[hardtack]]), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.\n\nMatzo has also been called ''Lechem Oni'' (Hebrew: \"bread of poverty\"). There is an attendant explanation that matzo serves as a symbol to remind Jews what it is like to be a poor slave and to promote humility, appreciate freedom, and avoid the inflated ego symbolized by more luxurious leavened bread.<ref>[http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=107&o=450 What is the kabbalistic view on chametz?] by Rabbi Yossi Marcus</ref>\n\n[[File:Shmura Matzo2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Hand made ''shmura matzo'']]\n\n''Shmura matzo'' (\"watched\" or \"guarded\" matzo), is the bread of preference for the Passover Seder in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] communities. Shmura matzo is made from wheat that is guarded from contamination by chametz from the time of summer harvest<ref name=Pomerantz>{{cite news|first=Batsheva|last=Pomerantz|title=Making matzo: A time-honored tradition|date=April 22, 2005|work=Jewish News of Greater Phoenix|url=http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/050422/matzo.shtml|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114082457/http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/050422/matzo.shtml|archive-date=January 14, 2013}}</ref> to its baking into matzos five to ten months later.\n\nIn the weeks before Passover, matzos are prepared for holiday consumption. In many Orthodox Jewish communities, men traditionally gather in groups (\"''[[Chavurah|chaburas]]''\") to bake handmade matzo for use at the Seder, the dough being rolled by hand, resulting in a large and round matzo. ''Chaburas'' also work together in machine-made matzo factories, which produce the typically square-shaped matzo sold in stores.\n\nThe baking of matzo is labor-intensive,<ref name=Pomerantz/> as only 18–22 minutes is permitted between the mixing of flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven. Consequently, only a small number of matzos can be baked at one time, and the ''chabura'' members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 | deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402170657/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=42416 |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |title=Making Matzah the Old-Fashioned Way |publisher=The Jewish Federations of North America |date= |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.\n\nAfter the matzos come out of the oven, the entire work area is scrubbed down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old, potentially leavened dough remain, as any stray pieces are now ''chametz'', and can contaminate the next batch of matzo.\n\nSome machine-made matzos are completed within 5 minutes of being kneaded.<ref name=Pomerantz/>\n\n==Passover seder==\n[[File:Sedertable.jpg|thumb|250px|Table set for the Passover Seder]]\n{{Main|Passover Seder}}\nIt is traditional for Jewish families to gather on the first night of Passover (first two nights in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities outside [[Land of Israel|Israel]]) for a special dinner called a [[Passover seder|seder]] (סדר – derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for \"order\" or \"arrangement\", referring to the very specific order of the ritual). The table is set with the finest china and silverware to reflect the importance of the meal. During this meal, the story of the Exodus from Egypt is retold using a special text called the [[Haggadah]]. Four cups of wine are consumed at various stages in the narrative. The Haggadah divides the night's procedure into 15 parts:\n\n#''Kadeish'' קדש – recital of [[Kiddush]] blessing and drinking of the first cup of wine\n#''Urchatz'' ורחץ – the [[Handwashing in Judaism|washing of the hands]] – without blessing\n#''Karpas'' כרפס – dipping of the ''[[karpas]]'' in salt water\n#''Yachatz'' יחץ – breaking the middle matzo; the larger piece becomes the ''[[afikoman]]'' which is eaten later during the ritual of ''Tzafun''\n#''Maggid'' מגיד – retelling the Passover story, including the recital of \"[[the four questions]]\" and drinking of the second cup of wine\n#''Rachtzah'' רחצה – second washing of the hands – with blessing\n#''Motzi'' מוציא – traditional blessing before eating [[bread]] products\n#''Matzo'' מצה – blessing before eating [[matzo]]\n#''Maror'' מרור – eating of the [[maror]]\n#''Koreich'' כורך – eating of a sandwich made of matzo and maror\n#''Shulchan oreich'' שולחן עורך – lit. \"set table\" – the serving of the holiday meal\n#''Tzafun'' צפון – eating of the ''[[afikoman]]''\n#''Bareich'' ברך – [[Birkat Hamazon|blessing after the meal]] and drinking of the third cup of wine\n#''[[Hallel]]'' הלל – recital of the Hallel, traditionally recited on festivals; drinking of the fourth cup of wine\n#''Nirtzah'' נירצה – conclusion\n\nThese 15 parts parallel the 15 steps in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] on which the [[Levite]]s stood during Temple services, and which were memorialized in the 15 [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]] (#120–134) known as ''Shir HaMa'alot'' (Hebrew: {{lang|he|שיר המעלות}}, \"[[Song of Ascents|Songs of Ascent]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kolhator.org.il/shir_hamaalot.php |title=Shir Ha Ma'a lot |publisher=Kolhator.org.il |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe seder is replete with questions, answers, and unusual practices (e.g. the recital of [[Kiddush]] which is not immediately followed by the blessing over bread, which is the traditional procedure for all other holiday meals) to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children at the table. The children are also rewarded with nuts and candies when they ask questions and participate in the discussion of the Exodus and its aftermath. Likewise, they are encouraged to search for the ''[[afikoman]]'', the piece of matzo which is the last thing eaten at the seder. Audience participation and interaction is the rule, and many families' seders last long into the night with animated discussions and much singing. The seder concludes with additional songs of praise and faith printed in the Haggadah, including ''[[Chad Gadya]]'' (\"One Little Kid\" or \"One Little Goat\").\n\n===Maror===\n[[File:3TypesMaror.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Types of maror: grated [[horseradish]], [[romaine lettuce]], whole horseradish root]]\n[[Maror]] (bitter herbs) symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The following verse from the [[Torah]] underscores that symbolism: \"And they embittered (''ve-yimareru'' וימררו) their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 1:14).\n\n[[File:SederPlate.jpg|thumb|250px|Silver seder plate]]\n\n===Four cups of wine===\nThere is a Rabbinic requirement that four cups of wine are to be drunk during the seder meal. This applies to both men and women. The Mishnah says (Pes. 10:1) that even the poorest man in Israel has an obligation to drink. Each cup is connected to a different part of the seder: the first cup is for Kiddush, the second cup is connected with the recounting of [[the Exodus]], the drinking of the third cup concludes [[Birkat Hamazon]] and the fourth cup is associated with Hallel.\n\n===The four questions and participation of children===\n{{See also|The four questions}}\nChildren have a very important role in the Passover seder. Traditionally the youngest child is prompted to ask questions about the Passover seder, beginning with the words, ''Mah Nishtana HaLeila HaZeh'' (Why is this night different from all other nights?). The questions encourage the gathering to discuss the significance of the symbols in the meal. The questions asked by the child are:\n\n:Why is this night different from all other nights?\n:On all other nights, we eat either unleavened or leavened bread, but tonight we eat only unleavened bread?\n:On all other nights, we eat all kinds of vegetables, but tonight, we eat only bitter herbs?\n:On all other nights, we do not dip [our food] even once, but tonight we dip twice?\n:On all other nights, we eat either sitting or reclining, but tonight we only recline?\n\nOften the leader of the seder and the other adults at the meal will use prompted responses from the Haggadah, which states, \"The more one talks about [[The Exodus|the Exodus from Egypt]], the more praiseworthy he is.\" Many readings, prayers, and stories are used to recount the story of the Exodus. Many households add their own commentary and interpretation and often the story of the Jews is related to the theme of liberation and its implications worldwide.\n\n===Afikoman===\n\n[[File:Haggadah 15th cent.jpg|thumb|200px|14th century Haggadah]]\nThe ''afikoman'' – an integral part of the Seder itself – is used to engage the interest and excitement of the children at the table. During the fourth part of the Seder, called ''Yachatz'', the leader breaks the middle piece of matzo into two. He sets aside the larger portion as the ''afikoman''. Many families use the ''afikoman'' as a device for keeping the children awake and alert throughout the Seder proceedings by hiding the ''afikoman'' and offering a prize for its return.<ref name=Pomerantz/> Alternatively, the children are allowed to \"steal\" the ''afikoman'' and demand a reward for its return. In either case, the ''afikoman'' must be consumed during the twelfth part of the Seder, ''Tzafun''.\n\n===Concluding songs===\n\nAfter the Hallel, the fourth glass of wine is drunk, and participants recite a prayer that ends in \"[[Next year in Jerusalem]]!\".  This is followed by several lyric prayers that expound upon God's mercy and kindness, and give thanks for the survival of the Jewish people through a history of exile and hardship.  \"[[Echad Mi Yodea]]\" (\"Who Knows One?\") is a playful song, testing the general knowledge of the children (and the adults). Some of these songs, such as \"[[Chad Gadya]]\" are allegorical.\n\n==Counting of the Omer==\nBeginning on the second night of Passover, the 16th day of Nisan,<ref>[[Karaite Jews]] begin the count on the Sunday within the holiday week. This leads to Shavuot for the Karaites always falling on a Sunday.</ref> Jews begin the practice of the [[Counting of the Omer]], a nightly reminder of the approach of the holiday of [[Shavuot]] 50 days hence. Each night after the [[Maariv|evening prayer service]], men and women recite a special blessing and then enumerate the day of the Omer. On the first night, for example, they say, \"Today is the first day in (or, to) the Omer\"; on the second night, \"Today is the second day in the Omer.\" The counting also involves weeks; thus, the seventh day is commemorated, \"Today is the seventh day, which is one week in the Omer.\" The eighth day is marked, \"Today is the eighth day, which is one week and one day in the Omer,\" etc.<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding Jewish Holidays and Customs: Historical and Contemporary|first=Sol|last=Scharfstein|page=36–37|year=1999|isbn=0881256269}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple stood in Jerusalem]], a sheaf of new-cut barley was presented before the altar on the second day of Unleavened Bread. [[Josephus]] writes:<blockquote>\nOn the second day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom they owe the abundance of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way. After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an ''assaron'' for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest for the use of the priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest.<ref name=Barley/></blockquote> Since the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.\n\nOne explanation for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt was only the beginning of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. Another explanation is that the newborn nation which emerged after the Exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis Torah and [[mitzvot]] before accepting God's law. The distinction between the Omer offering – a measure of barley, typically animal fodder – and the Shavuot offering – two loaves of wheat bread, human food – symbolizes the transition process.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=In Search of the Omer|first=Ellen|last=Cohn|title=Ecology and the Jewish Spirit: Where Nature and the Sacred Meet|editor-first=Ellen|editor-last=Bernstein|page=164|year=2000|isbn=1580230822|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8qvQcZeAv4C&pg=PA164}}</ref>\n\n==Chol HaMoed: The intermediate days of Passover==\nIn [[Land of Israel|Israel]], Passover lasts for seven days with the first and last days being major [[Jewish holidays]]. In [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities, no work is performed on those days, with most of the rules relating to the observances of [[Shabbat]] being applied.\n\nOutside Israel, in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] communities, the holiday lasts for eight days with the first two days and last two days being major holidays. In the intermediate days necessary work can be performed. [[Reform Judaism]] observes Passover over seven days, with the first and last days being major holidays.\n\nLike the holiday of [[Sukkot]], the intermediary days of Passover are known as [[Chol HaMoed]] (festival weekdays) and are imbued with a semi-festive status. It is a time for family outings and picnic lunches of matzo, hardboiled eggs, fruits and vegetables, and Passover treats such as [[macaroon]]s and homemade candies.\n\nPassover cake recipes call for [[potato starch]] or Passover cake flour made from finely granulated matzo instead of regular flour, and a large amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness. Cookie recipes use [[matzo farfel]] (broken bits of matzo) or ground nuts as the base.

Outside the [[Land of Israel]], in the [[Jewish diaspora]], ''Shvi'i shel Pesach'' is celebrated on both the seventh and eighth days of Passover.<ref>The eighth day is known as ''Acharon shel Pesach,'' \"last [day] of Passover\".</ref> This holiday commemorates the day the [[Israelites|Children of Israel]] reached the [[Red Sea]] and witnessed both the miraculous \"Splitting of the Sea\" ([[Passage of the Red Sea]]), the drowning of all the Egyptian chariots, horses and soldiers that pursued them. According to the [[Midrash]], only the [[Pharaoh]] was spared to give testimony to the miracle that occurred.\n\n[[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Rebbe]]s traditionally hold a ''[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|tish]]'' on the night of ''Shvi'i shel Pesach'' and place a cup or bowl of water on the table before them. They use this opportunity to speak about the Splitting of the Sea to their disciples, and sing songs of praise to God.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Second Passover==\nThe \"Second Passover\" ([[Pesach Sheni]]) on the 14th of Iyar in the [[Hebrew Calendar]] is mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 9:6–13) as a make-up day for people who were unable to offer the pesach sacrifice at the appropriate time due to [[Tumah and taharah|ritual impurity]] or distance from [[Jerusalem]]. Just as on the first Pesach night, breaking bones from the second Paschal offering (Numbers 9:12) or leaving meat over until morning (Numbers 9:12) is prohibited.\n\nToday, Pesach Sheni on the 14th of Iyar has the status of a very minor holiday (so much so that many of the Jewish people have never even heard of it, and it essentially does not exist outside of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and traditional [[Conservative Judaism]]). There are not really any special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities ''[[Tachanun]]'', a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is not said. There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torah.org/learning/yomtov/omer/5755/vol1no21.html|title=Pesach Sheini}}</ref>\n\n==Traditional foods==\n[[File:Matzah brei serving.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Matzah brei]] (fried [[matzo]] and egg), a popular Passover dish]]\nBecause the house is free of chametz for eight days, the Jewish household typically eats different foods during the week of Passover. Some include:\n\n'''Ashkenazi foods'''\n* ''[[Matzah brei]]'' – Matzo softened in milk or water and fried with egg and fat; served either savory or sweet\n* Matzo [[kugel]] – A kugel made with matzo instead of noodles\n* ''[[Charoset]]'' – A sweet mixture of fruit, fresh, dried or both; nuts; spices; honey; and sometimes wine. The charoset is a symbol of the mortar the Israelites used for building while enslaved in Egypt (See [[Passover seder]])\n* ''Chrain'' – Horseradish and beet relish\n* [[Gefilte fish]] – Poached fish patties or fish balls made from a mixture of ground, de-boned fish, mostly [[carp]] or [[pike (fish)|pike]]\n* [[Chicken soup]] with [[matzah ball]]s (''kneydlach'') – Chicken soup served with matzo-meal dumplings\n*  Passover noodles – Noodles prepared from potato flour and eggs, served in soup.

Alstat]], an early leader of [[Conservative Judaism]], known for his fiery rhetoric and powerful oratory skills, wrote and spoke in 1939 about the power of the Passover story during the rise of Nazi persecution and terror:<ref>[[Canadian Jewish Chronicle|The Canadian Jewish Chronicle]], March 31, 1939</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Perhaps in our generation the counsel of our Talmudic sages may seem superfluous, for today the story of our enslavement in Egypt is kept alive not only by ritualistic symbolism, but even more so by tragic realism. We are the contemporaries and witnesses of its daily re-enactment. Are not our hapless brethren in the German Reich eating \"the bread of affliction\"?  Are not their lives embittered by complete disenfranchisement and forced labor? Are they not lashed mercilessly by brutal taskmasters behind the walls of concentration camps? Are not many of their men-folk being murdered in cold blood? Is not the ruthlessness of the Egyptian Pharaoh surpassed by the sadism of the Nazi dictators?<br />And yet, even in this hour of disaster and degradation, it is still helpful to \"visualize oneself among those who had gone forth out of Egypt.\" It gives stability and equilibrium to the spirit. Only our estranged kinsmen, the assimilated, and the de-Judaized, go to pieces under the impact of the blow....But those who visualize themselves among the groups who have gone forth from the successive Egypts in our history never lose their sense of perspective, nor are they overwhelmed by confusion and despair.... It is this faith, born of racial experience and wisdom, which gives the oppressed the strength to outlive the oppressors and to endure until the day of ultimate triumph when we shall \"be brought forth from bondage unto freedom, from sorrow unto joy, from mourning unto festivity, from darkness unto great light, and from servitude unto redemption.</blockquote>\n\n==Influence on other religions==\n\n===Christianity===\n[[File:The two disciples, Peter and John, are sent to prepare the Passover (f. 32) Cropped.jpg|thumb|The two disciples, [[st Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], were sent by Christ to prepare the Passover]]\n{{see also|Easter|Passover (Christian holiday)}}\n\nThe Christian celebration of [[Good Friday]] finds its roots in the Jewish feast of Passover, the evening on which Jesus was crucified as the [[Lamb of God|Passover Lamb]].<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Er-QZeW12tUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title = The Jewish Pesach and the Origins of the Christian Easter|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|first1=Clemens|last1=Leonhard |year=2012|accessdate = June 14, 2018|isbn = 9783110927818}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PB-zfFmR0I0C&pg=PA21&dq=%22Pascha%22+name&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FqKAT_eTKMfA0AG7xMHXBw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Pascha%22%20name&f=false|title = The Antenicene Pascha: A Rhetorical History|author=Karl Gerlach|publisher = Peeters Publishers|quote=Long before this controversy, Ex 12 as a story of origins and its ritual expression had been firmly fixed in the Christian imagination. Though before the final decades of the second century only accessible as an exegetical tradition, already in the Paulin letters the Exodus saga is deeply involved with the celebration of bath and meal. Even here, this relationship does not suddenly appear, but represents developments in ritual narrative that mus have begun at the very inception of the Christian message. Jesus of Nazareth was crucifed during Pesach-Mazzot, an event that a new covenant people of Jews and Gentiles both saw as definitive and defining.

''Christ as the Passover Lamb from Exodus'' A number of features throughout Revelation seem to correspond to Exodus 12: The connection of Lamb and Passover, a salvific effect of the Lamb's blood and the punishment of God's (and His people's) opponents from Exodus 12 may possibly be reflected within the settings of the Apocalypse. The concept of Christ as a Passover lamb is generally not unknown in NT or early Christian literature, as can for instance be seen in 1 Corinthians 5:7, 1 Peter 1:19 or Justin Martyr's writing (''Dial''. 111:3). In the Gospel of John, especially, this connection between Christ and Passover is made very explicit.|ISBN=3-16-148778-8|page=117|year= 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Islam===\n{{see also |Day of Ashura#Significance of Ashura for Sunni Muslims}}\n\nIn the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] sect of [[Islam]], it is recommended to fast on the day of Ashura (10th of [[Muharram]]) based on [[hadith|narrations]] attributed to [[Muhammad]]. The fast is celebrated in order to commemorate the day when Moses and his followers were saved from Pharaoh by [[God in Islam|God]] by creating a path in the Red Sea (i.e. [[The Exodus]]). According to [[Muslim]] tradition, the Jews of [[Medina|Madinah]] used to fast on the tenth of Muharram in observance of Passover.  In narrations recorded in the al-Hadith (sayings of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad) of Sahih al-Bukhari, it is recommended that Muslims fast on this day. It is also stipulated that its observance should differ from the feast of Passover which is celebrated by the Jews, and he stated that Muslims should fast for two days instead of one, either on the 9th and 10th day or on the 10th and 11th day of Muharram.<ref name=\"Volume 3, Book 31, Number 222\">{{cite book|author=[[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]]|title=[[Sahih Bukhari]]}}</ref>{{rp|Volume 3, Book 31, Number 222}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gebrochts]]\n* [[Haggadah of Pesach]]\n* [[Jewish greetings#Holidays|Jewish greetings]]\n* [[Kitniyot]]\n* [[Quartodecimanism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Passover}}\n{{NIE Poster|year=1905}}\n*[http://www.reformjudaism.org/jewish-holidays/passover/ Passover Resources – ReformJudaism.org]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081011124755/http://www.passover.net/ Guide to Passover – chabad.org]\n*[http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/category/pesah/ 'Peninei Halachah' Jewish Law – Yhb.org.il ]\n*[http://www.aish.com/h/pes/mm/48972121.html Aish.com Passover Primer]\n*[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11933-passover Jewish Encyclopedia: Passover]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100304151058/http://www.akhlah.com/holidays/pesach/passover.php Akhlah: The Jewish Children's Learning Network]\n*[http://www.yeshiva.co/collection/default.aspx/Pesach All about Pesach]\n*[http://jewishholidaysonline.com/pesach Secular dates for passover]\n* {{NYTtopic|subjects/p/passover}}\n\n{{Passover Footer}}\n{{Jewish and Israeli holidays}}\n{{US Holidays}}\n{{Time in religion and mythology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hallel]]\n[[Category:Passover| ]]\n[[Category:Three Pilgrimage Festivals]]\n[[Category:Non-Gregorian March observances]]\n[[Category:Non-Gregorian April observances]]\n[[Category:Observances set by the Hebrew calendar]]\n[[Category:Jewish festivals]]\n[[Category:Moses]]\n[[Category:Spring (season) events in Israel]]",
