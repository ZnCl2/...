            "text": "The [[root (linguistics)|roots]] of verbs and most nouns in the [[Semitic languages]] are characterized as a sequence of [[consonant]]s or \"[[wikt:radical|radicals]]\" (hence the term '''consonantal root'''). Such abstract consonantal roots are used in the formation of actual words by adding the vowels and non-root consonants (or \"[[transfix]]es\") which go with a particular [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] category around the root consonants, in an appropriate way, generally following specific patterns.  It is a peculiarity of Semitic linguistics that a large majority of these consonantal roots are triliterals (although there are a number of quadriliterals, and in some languages also biliterals).\n\n==Triconsonantal roots==\n\nA '''triliteral''' or triconsonantal root ({{lang-he-n|שרש תלת-עצורי}}, ''{{transl|he|šoreš təlat-ʻiṣuri}}''; {{lang-ar|جذر ثلاثي}}, ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|jiḏr ṯulāṯī}}''; {{lang-syr|ܫܪܫܐ}}, ''{{transl|syr|šeršā}}'') is a root containing a sequence of three consonants.\n\nThe following are some of the forms which can be derived from the triconsonantal root [[K-T-B|k-t-b]] (general overall meaning \"to write\") in Hebrew and Arabic:\n\nNote: The Hebrew [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] transcribed as \"ḵ\" and \"ḇ\" can also be transcribed in a number of other ways, such as \"ch\" and \"v\" , which are pronounced {{IPAblink|χ}} and {{IPAblink|v}}, respectively.  They are transliterated \"ḵ\" and \"ḇ\" on this page to retain the connection with the pure consonantal root k-t-b. Also notice that in Modern Hebrew, there is no [[gemination]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n![[Akkadian language#Verb patterns|Semitological abbreviation]]!!

The Arabic terms, called {{lang|ar|وزن}} ''wazn'' (plural {{lang|ar|أوزان}}, ''awzān'') for the pattern and {{lang|ar|جذر}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|jiḏr}}'' (plural {{lang|ar|جذور}}, ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|juḏūr}}'') for the root have not gained the same currency as the Hebrew equivalents, and Western grammarians continue to use \"stem\"/\"form\"/\"pattern\" for the former and \"root\" for the latter—though \"form\" and \"pattern\" are accurate translations of the [[Arabic grammar|Arabic grammatical]] term ''wazn'' (originally meaning 'weight, measure'), and \"root\" is a literal translation of ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|jiḏr}}''.\n\n{{See also|Category:Triconsonantal roots}}\n\n===Biliteral origin of some triliteral roots===\nAlthough most roots in Hebrew seem to be tri-radical, many of them were originally bi-radical, cf. the relation between:\n{|\n|-\n| {{Hebrew|ג־ז־ז}} || √g-z-z || shear\n|-\n| {{Hebrew|ג־ז־ם}} || √g-z-m || prune\n|-\n| {{Hebrew|ג־ז־ר}} || √g-z-r || cut\n|}\nas well as between:<br />\n{|\n|-\n| {{Hebrew|פ־ר־ז}} || √p-r-z || divide a city\n|-\n| {{Hebrew|פ־ר־ט}} || √p-r-ţ || give change\n|-\n| {{Hebrew|פ־ר־ע}} || √p-r-‘ || pay a debt <ref name=Zuckermann >See p. 1 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] 2003, [http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232 ‘‘Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew’’], Houndmills: [[Palgrave Macmillan]], (Palgrave Studies in Language History and Language Change, Series editor: Charles Jones). {{ISBN|1-4039-1723-X}}.</ref>\n|}\nThe [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] root {{Hebrew|ש־ק־ף}} - √sh-q-p \"look out/through\"  deriving from {{Hebrew|ק־ף}} - √q-p \"bend, arch, lean towards\" and similar verbs fit into the shaCCéC verb-pattern.<br />\n{|\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|\"arch, bend\"\n|-\n|{{Hebrew|ק־פ־א}} || √q-p-'\n|-\n|{{Hebrew|ק־פ־ה}} || √q-p-h\n|-\n|{{Hebrew|ק־פ־ח}} || √q-p-ħ\n|-\n|{{Hebrew|ק־פ־י}} || √q-p-y\n|}\n\nThis verb-pattern is usually [[causative]], cf.\n{|\n|-\n| {{Hebrew|ש־ט־ף}} - √sh-ţ-p ‘wash, rinse, make wet’, from {{Hebrew|ט־ף}} - √ţ-p ‘wet’\n|-\n| {{Hebrew|ש־ל־ך}} - √sh-l-k ‘cast off, throw down, cause to go’ from {{Hebrew|ל־ך}} - √l-k ‘go’\".<ref name=Zuckermann />\n|}\n\n===History===\nAccording to a study of the [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic]] lexicon,<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Agmon|2010|pp=23}}</ref> biconsonantal roots are more abundant for words denoting [[Stone Age]] materials, whereas materials discovered during the [[Neolithic]] are uniquely triconsonantal. This implies a change in Proto-Semitic language structure concomitant with the transition to [[agriculture]]. In particular monosyllabic biconsonantal names are associated with a [[Natufian culture|pre-Natufian]] cultural background, more than 16,500 years ago.\n\n==Quadriliteral roots==\nA  '''quadriliteral''' is a consonantal root containing a sequence of four consonants (instead of [[#Triconsonantal roots|three consonants]], as is more often the case).  A quadriliteral form is a word derived from such a four-consonant root.  For example, the abstract quadriliteral root t-r-g-m / t-r-j-m gives rise to the verb forms {{Hebrew|תרגם}} ''tirgem'' in Hebrew and {{lang|ar|ترجم}} ''tarjama'' in Arabic, meaning \"he translated\".  In some cases, a quadriliteral root is actually a reduplication of a two-consonant sequence.  So in Hebrew {{Hebrew|דגדג}} ''digdeg'' means \"he tickled\", and in Arabic {{lang|ar|زلزال}} ''zilzāl'' means \"earthquake\".\n\nGenerally, only a subset of the verb derivations formed from [[#Triconsonantal roots|triliteral]] roots are allowed with quadriliteral roots.  For example, in Hebrew, the [[Modern Hebrew verb conjugation#Binyanim or derived stems|Piʿel, Puʿal, and Hiṯpaʿel]], and in Arabic, forms similar to [[Arabic verbs#Formation of derived stems (\"forms\")|the stem II and stem V forms of triliteral roots]].\n\nAnother set of quadrilateral roots in modern Hebrew is the set of secondary roots.  A secondary root is a root derived from word that was derived from another root. For example, the root {{Hebrew|מ-ס-פ-ר}} ''m-s-p-r'' is secondary to the root {{Hebrew|ס-פ-ר}} ''s-p-r''. {{Hebrew|סָפַר}} ''saphar'', from the root ''s-p-r'', means \"counted\"; {{Hebrew|מִסְפָּר}} ''mispar'', from the same root, means \"number\"; and {{Hebrew|מִסְפֶּר}} ''misper'', from the secondary root {{Hebrew|מ-ס-פ-ר}}, means \"numbered\".\n\nAn irregular quadriliteral verb made from a loanword is:\n* {{Hebrew|נַשְׁפְּרִיץ}}<span style=\"unicode-bidi:bidi-override\">[http://morfix.mako.co.il/default.aspx?q=%u05D4%u05E9%u05E4%u05E8%u05D9%u05E5]</span> ({{IPA|/naʃˈprit͡s/}}) – \"we will sprinkle\", from English and [[Yiddish]] ''spritz''\n\n==Quinqueliteral roots==\nTraditionally in the Semitic languages, forms with more than four basic consonants (i.e. consonants not introduced by morphological inflection or derivation) were occasionally found in nouns — mainly loanwords from other languages — but never in verbs.<ref>''A New Arabic Grammar of the Written Language'' by J.A. Haywood and H.M. Nahmad (London: Lund Humphries, 1965), {{ISBN|0-85331-585-X}}, p. 261.</ref>  However, in modern Israeli Hebrew, [[syllable]]s are allowed to begin with a sequence of two consonants (a relaxation of the situation in early Semitic, where only one consonant was allowed), and this has opened the door for a very small set of loan words to manifest apparent five root-consonant forms, such as {{Hebrew|טלגרף}} ''tilgref'' \"he telegraphed\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~ussishkin/papers/PDF/UssishkinPhonology16.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722192708/http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~ussishkin/papers/PDF/UssishkinPhonology16.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-22 |df= }}.</ref>  But, ''-lgr-'' always appears as an indivisible cluster in the derivation of this verb, so that these five root-consonant forms do not display any fundamentally different morphological patterns from four root-consonant forms (and the term \"quinqueliteral\" or \"quinquiliteral\" would be misleading if it implied otherwise).\n\nOther examples are:\n* {{Hebrew|סִנְכְּרֵן}}<span style=\"unicode-bidi:bidi-override\">[http://morfix.mako.co.il/default.aspx?q=%u05E1%u05E0%u05DB%u05E8%u05DF]</span> ({{IPA|/sinˈkren/}} – \"he synchronized\"), via the English word from Greek\n* {{Hebrew|חִנְטְרֵשׁ}}<span style=\"unicode-bidi:bidi-override\">[http://morfix.mako.co.il/default.aspx?q=%u05D7%u05E0%u05D8%u05E8%u05E9]</span> ({{IPA|/χinˈtreʃ/}} – \"he did stupid things\")\n* {{Hebrew|הִתְפְלַרְטֵט}}<span style=\"unicode-bidi:bidi-override\">[http://morfix.mako.co.il/default.aspx?q=%u05E4%u05B0%u05DC%u05B4%u05E8%u05B0%u05D8%u05B5%u05D8]</span> ({{IPA|/hitflarˈtet/}} – \"he had a flirt\"), from the English or Yiddish past tense of the English word\n\nIn [[Amharic language|Amharic]], there is a very small set of verbs which are conjugated as quinquiliteral roots. One example is ''wäšänäffärä'' 'rain fell with a strong wind'<ref>p. 153. Thomas Leiper Kane. 1990. Amharic-English Dictionary. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz.</ref>  The conjugation of this small class of verb roots is explained by Leslau.<ref>pp. 566-569, 1043. Wolf Leslau. ''Reference Grammar of Amharic. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz.</ref> Unlike the Hebrew examples, these roots conjugate in a manner more like regular verbs, producing no indivisible clusters.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Apophony]]\n* [[Arabic grammar]]\n* [[Broken plural]]\n* [[Indo-European ablaut]]\n* [[Khuzdul]]\n* [[Modern Hebrew grammar]]\n* [[Nonconcatenative morphology]]\n* [[Phono-semantic matching]]\n* [[Proto-Indo-European root]]\n* [[Transfix]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|title=Materials and Language: Pre-Semitic Root Structure Change Concomitant with Transition to Agriculture |first=Noam |last=Agmon |journal=Brill’s Annual of Afroasiatic Languages and Linguistics |volume=2 |year=2010 |pages=23–79 |url=http://www.fh.huji.ac.il/~agmon/Fullpaper/AALL_002_online_23-79.pdf |format=PDF}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|quadriliteral}}\n{{Wiktionary|triliteral}}\n*[http://www.semiticroots.net Semitic Roots Repository]\n*[http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp Roots in Quranic Arabic]\n*[http://www.studyquran.co.uk/PRLonline.htm Project Root List]\n*[http://www.hebrew-verbs.co.il/ Learn Hebrew Verbs]\n*[https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00831338 ''Alexis Amid Neme  and Eric Laporte (2013), Pattern-and-root inflectional morphology: the Arabic broken plural'' |year=]\n*[https://www.academia.edu/13002690/Do_computer_scientists_deeply_understand_the_traditional_Arabic_morphology_%D9%87%D9%84_%D9%8A%D9%81%D9%87%D9%85_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%87%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%86_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%91%D9%88%D9%86_%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%81_%D9%81%D9%87%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8B_%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%8B_   ''Alexis Amid Neme  and Eric Laporte (2015), Do computer scientists deeply understand Arabic morphology? - هل يفهم المهندسون الحاسوبيّون علم الصرف فهماً عميقاً؟'', available also in Arabic, Indonesian, French]\n\n{{Semitic roots|state=show}}\n{{Arabic language}}\n{{Hebrew language}}\n\n[[Category:Triconsonantal roots| ]]\n[[Category:Linguistic morphology]]\n[[Category:Semitic linguistics]]\n[[Category:Linguistic root]]",
