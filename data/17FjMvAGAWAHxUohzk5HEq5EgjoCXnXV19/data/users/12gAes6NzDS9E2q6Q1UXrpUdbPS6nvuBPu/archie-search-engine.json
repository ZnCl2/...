It is considered to be the first [[Internet]] [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]].<ref>{{ cite web|title=The First Search Engine, Archie |url=http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/~chip/projects/timeline/1990archie.htm |accessdate=2007-05-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621141150/http://isrl.uiuc.edu/~chip/projects/timeline/1990archie.htm |archivedate=21 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> The original implementation was written in 1990 by [[Alan Emtage]], then a postgraduate student at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], and [[Bill Heelan]], who studied at [[Concordia University]] in Montreal and worked at McGill University at the same time.<ref>{{ cite web | title = In Russian: History of the Internet.

These listings were stored in local files to be searched using the [[Unix]] <tt>[[grep]]</tt> command.\n\nBill Heelan and Peter Deutsch wrote a script allowing people to log in and search collected information using the [[Telnet]] protocol at the host \"archie.mcgill.ca\" [132.206.2.3].<ref name=peter /> Later, more efficient front- and back-ends were developed, and the system spread from a local tool, to a network-wide resource, and a popular service available from multiple sites around the [[Internet]]. The collected data would be exchanged between the neighbouring Archie servers. The servers could be accessed in multiple ways: using a local client (such as ''archie'' or ''xarchie''); [[telnet]]ting to a server directly; sending queries by [[electronic mail]]; and later via a [[World Wide Web]] interface. At the zenith of its fame the Archie search engine accounted for 50% of Montreal Internet traffic.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn 1992, Emtage along with Peter Deutsch and some financial help of [[McGill University]] formed [[Bunyip Information Systems]] the world's first company expressly founded for and dedicated to providing Internet information services with a licensed commercial version of the Archie search engine used by millions of people worldwide. Bill Heelan followed them into Bunyip soon after, where he together with [[Bibi Ali]] and [[Sandro Mazzucato]] was a part of so-called [[Archie Group]]. The group significantly updated the archie database and indexed web-pages. Work on the search engine was ceased in the late 1990s.\n\nThe name derives from the word \"archive\" without the v. Alan Emtage has said that contrary to popular belief, there was no association with the [[Archie Comics]] and that he despised them.<ref>[[BBC Radio 4]] - [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nmz7x Saturday Live], 7 November 2009</ref> Despite this, other early Internet search technologies such as [[Jughead (search engine)|Jughead]] and [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]] were named after characters from the comics. [[Interarchy|Anarchie]], one of the earliest graphical ftp clients was named for its ability to perform Archie searches.\n\nA legacy Archie server is still maintained active for historic purposes in Poland at [[University of Warsaw]]'s [[Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jughead (search engine)|Jughead]]\n* [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]]\n* [[Wide area information server]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Archieâ€”A Darwinian Development Process.
