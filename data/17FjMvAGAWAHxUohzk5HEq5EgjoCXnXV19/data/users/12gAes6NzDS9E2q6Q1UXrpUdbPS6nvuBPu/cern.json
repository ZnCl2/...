This [[Particle accelerator|accelerator]] was commissioned in 2005, after having been reconfigured from the previous [[Low Energy Antiproton Ring]] (LEAR).\n* The 28 [[Gigaelectronvolt|GeV]] [[Proton Synchrotron]] (PS), built during 1954—1959 and still operating as a feeder to the more powerful [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]].\n* The [[Super Proton Synchrotron]] (SPS), a circular accelerator with a diameter of 2 kilometres built in a tunnel, which started operation in 1976. It was designed to deliver an energy of 300&nbsp;GeV and was gradually upgraded to 450&nbsp;GeV. As well as having its own beamlines for fixed-target experiments (currently [[COMPASS experiment|COMPASS]] and [[NA62 experiment|NA62]]), it has been operated as a [[proton]]–[[antiproton]] [[collider]] (the Sp{{overline|p}}S collider), and for accelerating high energy [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s which were injected into the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]] (LEP). Since 2008, it has been used to inject protons and [[heavy ion]]s into the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC).\n* The [[On-Line Isotope Mass Separator]] (ISOLDE), which is used to study [[radioactive decay|unstable nuclei]]. The radioactive ions are produced by the impact of protons at an energy of 1.0–1.4&nbsp;GeV from the Proton Synchrotron Booster. It was first commissioned in 1967 and was rebuilt with major upgrades in 1974 and 1992.\n* The [[Antiproton Decelerator]] (AD), which reduces the velocity of antiprotons to about 10% of the [[speed of light]] for research of [[antimatter]].\n* The [[Compact Linear Collider]] Test Facility, which studies feasibility for the future normal conducting linear collider project.\n* The [[AWAKE]] experiment, which is a proof-of-principle [[plasma acceleration|plasma wakefield accelerator]].\n\n==== Large Hadron Collider ====\n{{Main|Large Hadron Collider}}\n\nMany activities at CERN currently involve operating the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) and the experiments for it. The LHC represents a large-scale, worldwide scientific cooperation project.\n[[File:Construction of LHC at CERN.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Construction of the [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] detector for [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] at CERN]]\n\nThe LHC tunnel is located 100 metres underground, in the region between the [[Geneva International Airport]] and the nearby [[Jura mountains]]. The majority of its length is on the French side of the border. It uses the 27&nbsp;km circumference circular tunnel previously occupied by the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]] (LEP), which was shut down in November 2000. CERN's existing PS/SPS accelerator complexes are used to pre-accelerate protons and lead ions which are then injected into the LHC.\n\nSeven experiments ([[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]], [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]], [[LHCb]], [[MoEDAL experiment|MoEDAL]],<ref>CERN Courier, [http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/42329 \"MoEDAL becomes the LHC's magnificent seventh\"], 5 May 2010</ref> [[TOTEM]], [[LHCf|LHC-forward]] and [[A Large Ion Collider Experiment|ALICE]]) are located along the collider; each of them studies particle collisions from a different aspect, and with different technologies. Construction for these experiments required an extraordinary engineering effort. For example, a special [[Crane (machine)|crane]] was rented from Belgium to lower pieces of the CMS detector into its underground cavern, since each piece weighed nearly 2,000 tons. The first of the approximately 5,000 magnets necessary for construction was lowered down a special shaft at 13:00&nbsp;[[GMT]] on 7 March 2005.\n\nThe LHC has begun to generate vast quantities of data, which CERN streams to laboratories around the world for distributed processing (making use of a specialized [[grid computing|grid]] infrastructure, the [[LHC Computing Grid]]). During April 2005, a trial successfully streamed 600&nbsp;MB/s to seven different sites across the world.\n\nThe initial particle beams were injected into the LHC August 2008.<ref name=\"NYT2008/07/29\">Overbye, Dennis (29 July 2008). \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/science/29cernrap.html Let the Proton Smashing Begin.

''The New York Times''.</ref> The first beam was circulated through the entire LHC on 10 September 2008,<ref name=\"CERNPR06.08\">{{cite web|url=http://press.cern/past-events/lhc-first-beam |title=LHC First Beam |publisher=CERN |accessdate=12 November 2016}}</ref> but the system failed 10 days later because of a faulty magnet connection, and it was stopped for repairs on 19 September 2008.\n\nThe LHC resumed operation on 20 November 2009 by successfully circulating two beams, each with an energy of 3.5&nbsp;tera[[electronvolts]] (TeV). The challenge for the engineers was then to try to line up the two beams so that they smashed into each other. This is like \"firing two needles across the Atlantic and getting them to hit each other\" according to Steve Myers, director for accelerators and technology.\n\nOn 30 March 2010, the LHC successfully collided two proton beams with 3.5 TeV of energy per proton, resulting in a 7 TeV collision energy. However, this was just the start of what was needed for the expected discovery of the [[Higgs boson]]. When the 7 TeV experimental period ended, the LHC revved to 8 TeV (4 TeV per proton) starting March 2012, and soon began particle collisions at that energy. In July 2012, CERN scientists announced the discovery of a new sub-atomic particle that was later confirmed to be the [[Higgs boson]].<ref>{{cite journal|author= Adrian Cho|title=Higgs Boson Makes Its Debut After Decades-Long Search|journal=Science|pages=141–143|volume=337|date=13 July 2012|doi= 10.1126/science.337.6091.141|pmid= 22798574|issue= 6091|ref= harv}}</ref>\nIn March 2013, CERN announced that the measurements performed on the newly found particle allowed it to conclude that this is a Higgs boson.<ref name=\"intersitetunnel\">{{cite web|url=http://press.cern/press-releases/2013/03/new-results-indicate-particle-discovered-cern-higgs-boson |title=New results indicate that particle discovered at CERN is a Higgs boson |publisher=CERN |accessdate=12 November 2016}}</ref> In early 2013, the LHC was deactivated for a two-year maintenance period, to strengthen the electrical connections between magnets inside the accelerator and for other upgrades.\n\nOn 5 April 2015, after two years of maintenance and consolidation, the LHC restarted for a second run.

Named \"Porte Charles de Gaulle\" in recognition of his role in the creation of CERN.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/800591|title=Red Carpet for CERN's 50th|journal=CERN Bulletin|date=November 2004}}</ref>\n* ''Inter-site tunnel'', in France, for equipment transfer to and from CERN sites in France by personnel with a specific permit. This is the only permitted route for such transfers. By the CERN treaty, no taxes are payable when such transfers are made. Controlled by customs personnel.<ref name=\"intersitetunnel\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hoststates.web.cern.ch/hoststates/en/Access/Welcome.html |title=CERN Host relations service page |publisher=CERN |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:CERN-aerial 1.jpg|thumb|left|CERN's main site, from [[Switzerland]] looking towards [[France]]]]\nThe SPS and LEP/LHC tunnels are almost entirely outside the main site, and are mostly buried under French farmland and invisible from the surface. However, they have surface sites at various points around them, either as the location of buildings associated with experiments or other facilities needed to operate the colliders such as cryogenic plants and access shafts. The experiments are located at the same underground level as the tunnels at these sites.\n\nThree of these experimental sites are in France, with ATLAS in Switzerland, although some of the ancillary cryogenic and access sites are in Switzerland. The largest of the experimental sites is the [[Prévessin]] site, also known as the North Area, which is the target station for non-collider experiments on the SPS accelerator. Other sites are the ones which were used for the [[UA1 experiment|UA1]], [[UA2 experiment|UA2]] and the LEP experiments (the latter are used by LHC experiments).\n\nOutside of the LEP and LHC experiments, most are officially named and numbered after the site where they were located. For example, [[NA32 experiment|NA32]] was an experiment looking at the production of so-called \"[[Charm quark|charmed]]\" particles and located at the [[Prévessin]] (North Area) site while [[WA22 experiment|WA22]] used the [[Big European Bubble Chamber]] (BEBC) at the Meyrin (West Area) site to examine neutrino interactions. The [[UA1 experiment|UA1]] and [[UA2 experiment|UA2]] experiments were considered to be in the Underground Area, i.e. situated underground at sites on the SPS accelerator.\n\nMost of the [[List of streets at CERN|roads on the CERN Meyrin and Prévessin sites]] are named after famous physicists, such as Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, and Albert Einstein.\n\n== Participation and funding ==\n\n=== Member states and budget ===\n\nSince its foundation by 12 members in 1954, CERN regularly accepted new members. All new members have remained in the organization continuously since their accession, except Spain and Yugoslavia. Spain first joined CERN in 1961, withdrew in 1969, and rejoined in 1983. Yugoslavia was a founding member of CERN but quit in 1961. Of the 22 members, Israel joined CERN as a full member on 6 January 2014,<ref name=ISR /> becoming the first (and currently only) non-European full member.<ref>Rahman, Fazlur.
