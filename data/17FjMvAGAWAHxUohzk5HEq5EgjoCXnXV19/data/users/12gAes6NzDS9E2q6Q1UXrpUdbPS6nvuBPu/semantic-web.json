The following [[HTML]]-fragment shows how a small graph is being described, in [[RDFa]]-syntax using a [[schema.org]] vocabulary and a [[Wikidata]] ID:\n[[File:RDF example.svg|framed|anchor|{{anchor|graph1}}Graph resulting from the RDFa example]]\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\" enclose=\"div\">\n<div vocab=\"http://schema.org/\" typeof=\"Person\">\n  <span property=\"name\">Paul Schuster</span> was born in\n  <span property=\"birthPlace\" typeof=\"Place\" href=\"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731\">\n    <span property=\"name\">Dresden</span>.\n  </span>\n</div>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe example defines the following five [[Semantic triple|triples]] (shown in [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]] Syntax). Each triple represents one edge in the resulting graph: the first element of the triple (the ''subject'') is the name of the node where the edge starts, the second element (the ''predicate'') the type of the edge, and the last and third element (the ''object'') either the name of the node where the edge ends or a literal value (e.g. a text, a number, etc.).\n<div class=\"plainlinks\">\n _:a <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://schema.org/Person> .\n _:a <http://schema.org/name> \"Paul Schuster\" .\n _:a <http://schema.org/birthPlace> <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731> .\n <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731> <http://schema.org/itemtype> <http://schema.org/Place> .\n <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731> <http://schema.org/name> \"Dresden\" .\n</div>\n\nThe triples result in the graph shown in [[#graph1|the given figure]].\n\n[[File:RDF example extended.svg|framed|Graph resulting from the RDFa example, enriched with further data from the Web]]\n\nOne of the advantages of using [[Uniform Resource Identifier|Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)]] is that they can be dereferenced using the [[HTTP]] protocol. According to the so-called [[Linked Open Data]] principles, such a dereferenced URI should result in a document that offers further data about the given URI. In this example, all URIs, both for edges and nodes (e.g. <tt><nowiki>http://schema.org/Person</nowiki></tt>, <tt><nowiki>http://schema.org/birthPlace</nowiki></tt>, <tt><nowiki>http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731</nowiki></tt>) can be dereferenced and will result in further RDF graphs, describing the URI, e.g. that Dresden is a city in Germany, or that a person, in the sense of that URI, can be fictional.\n\nThe second graph shows the previous example, but now enriched with a few of the triples from the documents that result from dereferencing <tt><nowiki>http://schema.org/Person</nowiki></tt> (green edge) and <tt><nowiki>http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731</nowiki></tt> (blue edges).\n\nAdditionally to the edges given in the involved documents explicitly, edges can be automatically [[Inference|inferred]]: the triple\n<div class=\"plainlinks\">\n _:a <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://schema.org/Person> .\n</div>\n\nfrom the original RDFa fragment and the triple\n<div class=\"plainlinks\">\n <http://schema.org/Person> <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#equivalentClass> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> .\n</div>\n\nfrom the document at <tt><nowiki>http://schema.org/Person</nowiki></tt> (green edge in the Figure) allow to infer the following triple, given [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] semantics (red dashed line in the second Figure):\n<div class=\"plainlinks\">\n _:a <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> .\n</div>\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe concept of the ''[[Semantic network|Semantic Network Model]]'' was formed in the early 1960s by the cognitive scientist [[Allan M. Collins]], linguist [[M. Ross Quillian]] and psychologist [[Elizabeth F. Loftus]] as a form to represent semantically structured knowledge. When applied in the context of the modern internet, it extends the network of [[hyperlink]]ed human-readable [[web pages]] by inserting machine-readable [[metadata]] about pages and how they are related to each other.  This enables automated agents to access the Web more intelligently and perform more tasks on behalf of users. The term \"Semantic Web\" was coined by [[Tim Berners-Lee]],<ref name=\"Berners-Lee\"/> the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (\"[[W3C]]\"), which oversees the development of proposed Semantic Web standards. He defines the Semantic Web as \"a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines\".\n\nMany of the technologies proposed by the W3C already existed before they were positioned under the W3C umbrella. These are used in various contexts, particularly those dealing with information that encompasses a limited and defined domain, and where sharing data is a common necessity, such as scientific research or data exchange among businesses. In addition, other technologies with similar goals have emerged, such as [[microformat]]s.\n\n=== Limitations of HTML ===\nMany files on a typical computer can also be loosely divided into human readable [[document]]s and machine readable [[data]]. Documents like mail messages, reports, and brochures are read by humans. Data, such as calendars, addressbooks, playlists, and spreadsheets are presented using an application program that lets them be viewed, searched and combined.\n\nCurrently, the World Wide Web is based mainly on documents written in [[Hypertext Markup Language]] ([[HTML]]), a markup convention that is used for coding a body of text interspersed with multimedia objects such as images and interactive forms. Metadata tags provide a method by which computers can categorise the content of web pages, for example:\n\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"computing, computer studies, computer\" />\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Cheap widgets for sale\" />\n<meta name=\"author\" content=\"John Doe\" />\n</source>\n\nWith HTML and a tool to render it (perhaps [[web browser]] software, perhaps another [[user agent]]), one can create and present a page that lists items for sale. The HTML of this catalog page can make simple, document-level assertions such as \"this document's title is 'Widget Superstore{{'\"}}, but there is no capability within the HTML itself to assert unambiguously that, for example, item number X586172 is an Acme Gizmo with a retail price of €199, or that it is a consumer product. Rather, HTML can only say that the span of text \"X586172\" is something that should be positioned near \"Acme Gizmo\" and \"€199\", etc. There is no way to say \"this is a catalog\" or even to establish that \"Acme Gizmo\" is a kind of title or that \"€199\" is a price. There is also no way to express that these pieces of information are bound together in describing a discrete item, distinct from other items perhaps listed on the page.\n\n[[Semantic HTML]] refers to the traditional HTML practice of markup following intention, rather than specifying layout details directly. For example, the use of {{tag|em|o}} denoting \"emphasis\" rather than {{tag|i|o}}, which specifies [[italics]]. Layout details are left up to the browser, in combination with [[Cascading Style Sheets]]. But this practice falls short of specifying the semantics of objects such as items for sale or prices.\n\n[[Microformat]]s extend HTML syntax to create [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]] semantic markup about objects including people, organisations, events and products.<ref>{{cite book |last=Allsopp |first=John | title=Microformats: Empowering Your Markup for Web 2.0 |date=March 2007 |publisher=[[Apress|Friends of ED]] |isbn=978-1-59059-814-6 |page=368}}</ref> Similar initiatives include [[RDFa]], [[Microdata (HTML)|Microdata]] and [[Schema.org]].\n\n=== Semantic Web solutions ===\nThe Semantic Web takes the solution further. It involves publishing in languages specifically designed for data: [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL), and Extensible Markup Language ([[XML]]). HTML describes documents and the links between them. RDF, OWL, and XML, by contrast, can describe arbitrary things such as people, meetings, or airplane parts.\n\nThese technologies are combined in order to provide descriptions that supplement or replace the content of Web documents. Thus, content may manifest itself as descriptive data stored in Web-accessible [[database]]s,<ref>Artem Chebotko and Shiyong Lu, \"Querying the Semantic Web: An Efficient Approach Using Relational Databases\", [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]], {{ISBN|978-3-8383-0264-5}}, 2009.</ref> or as markup within documents (particularly, in Extensible HTML ([[XHTML]]) interspersed with XML, or, more often, purely in XML, with layout or rendering cues stored separately). The machine-readable descriptions enable content managers to add meaning to the content, i.e., to describe the structure of the knowledge we have about that content. In this way, a machine can process knowledge itself, instead of text, using processes similar to human [[deductive reasoning]] and [[inference]], thereby obtaining more meaningful results and helping computers to perform automated information gathering and research.\n\nAn example of a tag that would be used in a non-semantic web page:\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n<item>blog</item>\n</source>\n\nEncoding similar information in a semantic web page might look like this:\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n<item rdf:about=\"http://example.org/semantic-web/\">Semantic Web</item>\n</source>\n\nTim Berners-Lee calls the resulting network of [[Linked Data]] the [[Giant Global Graph]], in contrast to the HTML-based [[World Wide Web]]. Berners-Lee posits that if the past was document sharing, the future is data sharing. His answer to the question of \"how\" provides three points of instruction. One, a URL should point to the data. Two, anyone accessing the URL should get data back. Three, relationships in the data should point to additional URLs with data.\n\n=== Web 3.0 ===\n\n[[Tim Berners-Lee]] has described the semantic web as a component of \"Web 3.0\".<ref>{{cite news\n | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/technology/23iht-web.html\n | title=A 'more revolutionary' Web\n | accessdate=May 24, 2006\n | author=Victoria Shannon\n | date=June 26, 2006\n | work=International Herald Tribune}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|People keep asking what Web 3.0 is.

[[Automated reasoning system]]s will have to deal with all of these issues in order to deliver on the promise of the Semantic Web.\n* Vastness: The World Wide Web contains many billions of pages. The [[SNOMED CT]] medical terminology [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] alone contains 370,000 class names, and existing technology has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms. Any automated reasoning system will have to deal with truly huge inputs.\n* Vagueness: These are imprecise concepts like \"young\" or \"tall\". This arises from the vagueness of user queries, of concepts represented by content providers, of matching query terms to provider terms and of trying to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts. [[Fuzzy logic]] is the most common technique for dealing with vagueness.\n* Uncertainty: These are precise concepts with uncertain values. For example, a patient might present a set of symptoms that correspond to a number of different distinct diagnoses each with a different probability. [[Probabilistic logic|Probabilistic]] reasoning techniques are generally employed to address uncertainty.\n* Inconsistency: These are logical contradictions that will inevitably arise during the development of large ontologies, and when ontologies from separate sources are combined. [[Deductive reasoning]] fails catastrophically when faced with inconsistency, because [[Principle of explosion|\"anything follows from a contradiction\"]]. [[Defeasible reasoning]] and [[Paraconsistent logic|paraconsistent reasoning]] are two techniques that can be employed to deal with inconsistency.\n* Deceit: This is when the producer of the information is intentionally misleading the consumer of the information. [[Cryptography]] techniques are currently utilized to alleviate this threat. By providing a means to determine the information's integrity, including that which relates to the identity of the entity that produced or published the information, however [[credibility]] issues still have to be addressed in cases of potential deceit.\n\nThis list of challenges is illustrative rather than exhaustive, and it focuses on the challenges to the \"unifying logic\" and \"proof\" layers of the Semantic Web. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) Incubator Group for Uncertainty Reasoning for the World Wide Web (URW3-XG) [http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/urw3/XGR-urw3-20080331/ final report] lumps these problems together under the single heading of \"uncertainty\". Many of the techniques mentioned here will require extensions to the Web Ontology Language (OWL) for example to annotate conditional probabilities. This is an area of active research.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lukasiewicz |first=Thomas |author2=Umberto Straccia |title=Managing uncertainty and vagueness in description logics for the Semantic Web |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826808000395|doi=10.1016/j.websem.2008.04.001 |volume=6 |issue=4 |journal=Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web |pages=291–308|year=2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Standards ==\nStandardization for Semantic Web in the context of Web 3.0 is under the care of W3C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/Main_Page|title=Semantic Web Standards|author=|date=|website=www.w3.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Components ===\nThe term \"Semantic Web\" is often used more specifically to refer to the formats and technologies that enable it.<ref name=\"W3C-SWA\" /> The collection, structuring and recovery of linked data are enabled by technologies that provide a [[description logic|formal description]] of concepts, terms, and relationships within a given [[knowledge domain]]. These technologies are specified as W3C standards and include:\n* [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), a general method for describing information\n* [[RDF Schema]] (RDFS)\n* [[Simple Knowledge Organization System]] (SKOS)\n* [[SPARQL]], an RDF query language\n* [[Notation3]] (N3), designed with human-readability in mind\n* [[N-Triples]], a format for storing and transmitting data\n* [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]] (Terse RDF Triple Language)\n* [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL), a family of knowledge representation languages\n* [[Rule Interchange Format]] (RIF), a framework of web rule language dialects supporting rule interchange on the Web\n\n[[File:Semantic_web_stack.svg|frame |right | |The [[Semantic Web Stack]].]]\n\nThe [[Semantic Web Stack]] illustrates the architecture of the Semantic Web. The functions and relationships of the components can be summarized as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/ |title=OWL Web Ontology Language Overview |date=February 10, 2004 |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) |accessdate=November 26, 2011}}</ref>\n* XML provides an elemental syntax for content structure within documents, yet associates no semantics with the meaning of the content contained within. XML is not at present a necessary component of Semantic Web technologies in most cases, as alternative syntaxes exists, such as [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]]. Turtle is a de facto standard, but has not been through a formal standardization process.\n* [[W3C XML Schema|XML Schema]] is a language for providing and restricting the structure and content of elements contained within XML documents.\n* RDF is a simple language for expressing [[data model]]s, which refer to objects (\"[[web resource]]s\") and their relationships. An RDF-based model can be represented in a variety of syntaxes, e.g., RDF/XML, N3, Turtle, and RDFa. RDF is a fundamental standard of the Semantic Web.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/RDF/ | title=Resource Description Framework (RDF) | publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | isbn=978-0-12-385965-5 | doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-385965-5.10003-2 | author1=Allemang, D. | author2=Hendler, J.| chapter=RDF –The basis of the Semantic Web | title = Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist | edition= 2nd | publisher=Morgan Kaufmann | year=2011}}</ref>\n* RDF Schema extends RDF and is a vocabulary for describing properties and classes of RDF-based resources, with semantics for generalized-hierarchies of such properties and classes.\n* OWL adds more vocabulary for describing properties and classes: among others, relations between classes (e.g. disjointness), cardinality (e.g. \"exactly one\"), equality, richer typing of properties, characteristics of properties (e.g. symmetry), and enumerated classes.\n* SPARQL is a protocol and query language for semantic web data sources.\n* RIF is the W3C Rule Interchange Format. It's an XML language for expressing Web rules that computers can execute. RIF provides multiple versions, called dialects. It includes a RIF Basic Logic Dialect (RIF-BLD) and RIF Production Rules Dialect (RIF PRD).\n\n=== Current state of standardization ===\nWell-established standards:\n* [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]\n* [[RDFS]]\n* [[Rule Interchange Format]] (RIF)\n* [[SPARQL]]\n* [[Unicode]]\n* [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]\n* [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL)\n* [[XML]]\n\nNot yet fully realized:\n* Unifying Logic and Proof layers\n* [[Semantic Web Rule Language]] (SWRL)\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe intent is to enhance the [[usability]] and usefulness of the Web and its interconnected [[resource (computer science)|resources]] by creating [[Semantic Web Services]], such as:\n* Servers that expose existing data systems using the RDF and SPARQL standards. Many [http://esw.w3.org/topic/ConverterToRdf converters to RDF] exist from different applications. [[Relational database]]s are an important source. The semantic web server attaches to the existing system without affecting its operation.\n* Documents \"marked up\" with semantic information (an [[Extensibility|extension]] of the HTML <tt>&lt;meta&gt;</tt> [[HTML element|tags]] used in today's Web pages to supply information for [[Web search engine]]s using [[web crawler]]s). This could be [[Artificial intelligence|machine-understandable]] information about the human-understandable content of the document (such as the creator, title, description, etc.) or it could be purely [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] representing a set of facts (such as resources and services elsewhere on the site). Note that ''anything'' that can be identified with a ''Uniform Resource Identifier'' (URI) can be described, so the semantic web can reason about animals, people, places, ideas, etc.  There are four semantic annotation formats that can be used in HTML documents; [[Microformat]], [[RDFa]], [[Microdata (HTML)|Microdata]] and [[JSON-LD]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Mastering Structured Data on the Semantic Web: From HTML5 Microdata to Linked Open Data|last = Sikos|first = Leslie F.|publisher = Apress|year = 2015|isbn = 1484210492|location = |pages = 23}}</ref> Semantic markup is often generated automatically, rather than manually.\n* Common metadata vocabularies ([[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]]) and maps between vocabularies that allow document creators to know how to mark up their documents so that agents can use the information in the supplied metadata (so that ''Author'' in the sense of 'the Author of the page' won't be confused with ''Author'' in the sense of a book that is the subject of a book review).\n* Automated agents to perform tasks for users of the semantic web using this data.\n* Web-based services (often with agents of their own) to supply information specifically to agents, for example, a [[Trust service]] that an agent could ask if some online store has a history of poor service or [[spamming]].\n\nSuch services could be useful to public search engines, or could be used for [[knowledge management]] within an organization.

In a 2003 paper, Marshall and Shipman point out the cognitive overhead inherent in formalizing knowledge, compared to the authoring of traditional web [[hypertext]]:<ref name=\"which\">{{cite conference |title=Which semantic web? |last1=Marshall |first1=Catherine C. |last2=Shipman |first2=Frank M. |conference=Proc.

For example, understanding the class-instance relationship, or the superclass-subclass relationship, is more than understanding that one concept is a “type of” another concept. […] These abstractions are taught to computer scientists generally and knowledge engineers specifically but do not match the similar natural language meaning of being a \"type of\" something. Effective use of such a formal representation requires the author to become a skilled knowledge engineer in addition to any other skills required by the domain. […] Once one has learned a formal representation language, it is still often much more effort to express ideas in that representation than in a less formal representation […]. Indeed, this is a form of programming based on the declaration of semantic data and requires an understanding of how reasoning algorithms will interpret the authored structures.}}\n\nAccording to Marshall and Shipman, the [[tacit knowledge|tacit]] and changing nature of much knowledge adds to the knowledge engineering problem, and limits the Semantic Web's applicability to specific domains. A further issue that they point out are domain- or organisation-specific ways to express knowledge, which must be solved through community agreement rather than only technical means.{{r|which}} As it turns out, specialized communities and organizations for intra-company projects have tended to adopt semantic web technologies greater than peripheral and less-specialized communities.<ref name=\"Herman000\">{{cite conference |url=http://www.w3.org/2007/Talks/0424-Stavanger-IH/Slides.pdf |title=State of the Semantic Web |accessdate=July 26, 2007 |author=Ivan Herman |year=2007 |conference=Semantic Days 2007}}</ref> The practical constraints toward adoption have appeared less challenging where domain and scope is more limited than that of the general public and the World-Wide Web.{{r|Herman000}}\n\nFinally, Marshall and Shipman see pragmatic problems in the idea of ([[Knowledge Navigator]]-style) intelligent agents working in the largely manually curated Semantic Web:{{r|which}}\n\n{{quote|In situations in which user needs are known and distributed information resources are well described, this approach can be highly effective; in situations that are not foreseen and that bring together an unanticipated array of information resources, the Google approach is more robust. Furthermore, the Semantic Web relies on inference chains that are more brittle; a missing element of the chain results in a failure to perform the desired action, while the human can supply missing pieces in a more Google-like approach. […] cost-benefit tradeoffs can work in favor of specially-created Semantic Web metadata directed at weaving together sensible well-structured domain-specific information resources; close attention to user/customer needs will drive these federations if they are to be successful.}}\n\n[[Cory Doctorow]]'s critique (\"[[metacrap]]\") is from the perspective of human behavior and personal preferences. For example, people may include spurious metadata into Web pages in an attempt to mislead Semantic Web engines that naively assume the metadata's veracity. This phenomenon was well-known with metatags that fooled the [[Altavista]] ranking algorithm into elevating the ranking of certain Web pages: the Google indexing engine specifically looks for such attempts at manipulation. [[Peter Gärdenfors]] and [[Timo Honkela]] point out that logic-based semantic web technologies cover only a fraction of the relevant phenomena related to semantics.<ref name=\"Gardenfors04\">{{Cite book\n | title=How to make the Semantic Web more semantic\n | first=Peter\n | last=Gärdenfors\n | pages=17–34\n | publisher=IOS Press\n | year=2004\n | work=Formal Ontology in Information Systems: proceedings of the third international conference (FOIS-2004)}}</ref><ref name=\"Honkela08\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a903999101\n | title=Simulating processes of concept formation and communication\n | year=2008\n | first1=Timo\n | last1=Honkela\n | first2=Ville\n | last2=Könönen\n | first3=Tiina\n | last3=Lindh-Knuutila\n | first4=Mari-Sanna\n | last4=Paukkeri\n | work=Journal of Economic Methodology}}</ref>\n\n=== Censorship and privacy ===\nEnthusiasm about the semantic web could be tempered by concerns regarding [[Internet censorship|censorship]] and [[privacy]]. For instance, [[Intelligent text analysis|text-analyzing]] techniques can now be easily bypassed by using other words, metaphors for instance, or by using images in place of words. An advanced implementation of the semantic web would make it much easier for governments to control the viewing and creation of online information, as this information would be much easier for an automated content-blocking machine to understand. In addition, the issue has also been raised that, with the use of [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] files and geolocation [[meta-data]], there would be very little anonymity associated with the authorship of articles on things such as a personal blog. Some of these concerns were addressed in the \"Policy Aware Web\" project<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policyawareweb.org/ |title=Policy Aware Web Project |publisher=Policyawareweb.org |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> and is an active research and development topic.\n\n=== Doubling output formats ===\nAnother criticism of the semantic web is that it would be much more time-consuming to create and publish content because there would need to be two formats for one piece of data: one for human viewing and one for machines. However, many [[web application]]s in development are addressing this issue by creating a machine-readable format upon the publishing of data or the request of a machine for such data. The development of [[microformat]]s has been one reaction to this kind of criticism. Another argument in defense of the feasibility of semantic web is the likely falling price of human intelligence tasks in digital labor markets, such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s [[Amazon Mechanical Turk|Mechanical Turk]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nSpecifications such as [[eRDF (data format)|eRDF]] and [[RDFa]] allow arbitrary RDF data to be embedded in HTML pages. The [[GRDDL]] (Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Language) mechanism allows existing material (including microformats) to be automatically interpreted as RDF, so publishers only need to use a single format, such as HTML.\n\n== Research activities on corporate applications ==\n\nThe first research group explicitly focusing on the Corporate Semantic Web was the ACACIA team at [[Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique|INRIA-Sophia-Antipolis]], founded in 2002.
