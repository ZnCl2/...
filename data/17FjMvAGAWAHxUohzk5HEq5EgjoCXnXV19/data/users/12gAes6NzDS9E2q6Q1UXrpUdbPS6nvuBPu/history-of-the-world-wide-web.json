The term is often mistakenly used as a synonym for the Internet itself, but the Web is a service that operates over the Internet, just as [[e-mail]] also does. The [[history of the Internet]] dates back significantly further than that of the [[World Wide Web]]. Web is the global information  system.\n\n==Precursors==\nThe [[hypertext]] portion of the Web in particular has an intricate intellectual history; notable influences and precursors include [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[Memex]],<ref name=\"faq\">{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions - Start of the web: Influences|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#Influences|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=22 July 2010|authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee|first=Tim|last=Berners-Lee}}</ref> [[IBM Generalized Markup Language|IBM's Generalized Markup Language]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions - Why the //, #, etc?|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#etc|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=22 July 2010|authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee|first=Tim|last=Berners-Lee}}</ref> and [[Ted Nelson]]'s [[Project Xanadu]].<ref name=\"faq\" />\n\n[[Paul Otlet]]'s [[Mundaneum]] project has also been named as an early 20th century precursor of the Web.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = OUP USA| isbn = 9780199931415| last = Wright| first = Alex| title = Cataloging the World: Paul Otlet and the Birth of the Information Age| location = Oxford ; New York| date = 2014-07-10| pages = 8–15}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of a global information system connecting homes is prefigured in \"[[A Logic Named Joe]]\", a 1946 short story by [[Murray Leinster]], in which computer terminals, called \"logics,\" are present in every home. Although the computer system in the story is centralized, the story anticipates a ubiquitous information environment similar to the Web. The cultural impact of the web was imagined even further back in a short story by [[E. M. Forster]], \"[[The Machine Stops]],\" first published in 1909.\n\n== 1980–1991: Invention and implementation of the Web ==\n[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[NeXTcube]] used by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at CERN became the first Web server.]]\nIn 1980, [[Tim Berners-Lee]], an English independent contractor at the [[CERN|European Organization for Nuclear Research]] (CERN) in [[Switzerland]], built [[ENQUIRE]], as a personal database of people and software models, but also as a way to play with [[hypertext]]; each new page of information in ENQUIRE had to be linked to an existing page.<ref name=\"faq\" />\n\nBerners-Lee's contract in 1980 was from June to December, but in 1984 he returned to CERN in a permanent role, and considered its problems of information management: physicists from around the world needed to share data, yet they lacked common machines and any shared presentation software.\n\nShortly after Berners-Lee's return to CERN, [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] protocols were installed on some key non-Unix machines at the institution, turning it into the largest Internet site in Europe within a few years. As a result, CERN's infrastructure was ready for Berners-Lee to create the Web.<ref name=\"Ben\">{{cite web|first=Ben|last=Segal|date=1995 |url=http://ben.home.cern.ch/ben/TCPHIST.html|title=A Short History of Internet Protocols at CERN| work=W3C.org}}</ref>\n\nBerners-Lee wrote a proposal on March 13, 1989 for \"a large hypertext database with typed links\".<ref name=information-management>{{cite web|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|title=Information Management: A Proposal|url=http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|access-date=24 August 2010|authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee|date=March 1989}}</ref> Although the proposal attracted little interest, Berners-Lee was encouraged by his boss, Mike Sendall, to begin implementing his system on a newly acquired [[NeXT]] workstation.<ref name=\"NetValley\">{{cite web |url=http://www.netvalley.com/intvalnext.html |title=The Next Crossroad of Web History| work=Net Valley| date=2011 |first=Gregory |last=Gromov}}</ref> He considered several names, including ''Information Mesh'',<ref name=information-management /> ''The Information Mine'' or ''Mine of Information'', but settled on ''World Wide Web''.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Harper | isbn = 9780062515872 | last = Berners-Lee | first = Tim | title = Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web | location = San Francisco | date = 2000-11-07| page=23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cailliau Abramatic Berners-Lee 10 years WWW consortium.png|right|thumb|250px|[[Robert Cailliau]], Jean-François Abramatic and [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at the 10th anniversary of the [[World Wide Web Consortium|WWW Consortium]].]]\nBerners-Lee found an enthusiastic supporter in [[Robert Cailliau]]. Berners-Lee and Cailliau pitched Berners-Lee's ideas to the European Conference on Hypertext Technology in September 1990, but found no vendors who could appreciate his vision of marrying hypertext with the Internet.<ref name=\"cailliau-role\" />\n\nBy Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the [[HyperText Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) 0.9,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html|first=Tim|last=Berners-Lee| title=The Original HTTP as defined in 1991|work=W3C.org}}</ref> the [[HyperText Markup Language]] (HTML), the first [[Web browser]] (named [[WorldWideWeb]], which was also a [[HTML editor|Web editor]]), the first HTTP [[server application|server software]] (later known as [[CERN httpd]]), the first [[web server]] (http://info.cern.ch), and the first Web pages that described the project itself. The browser could access [[Usenet]] newsgroups and [[FTP]] files as well. However, it could run only on the NeXT; [[Nicola Pellow]] therefore created a simple text browser, called the [[Line Mode Browser]], that could run on almost any computer.<ref name=\"timblhistory\">{{cite web|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|title=A Brief History of the Web|url=http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/TimBook-old/History.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|access-date=17 August 2010|authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee|date=c. 1993}}</ref> To encourage use within CERN, Bernd Pollermann put the CERN telephone directory on the web — previously users had to log onto the mainframe in order to look up phone numbers.<ref name=\"timblhistory\" />\n\nWhile inventing and working on setting up the Web, Berners-Lee spent most of his working hours in Building 31 (second floor) at CERN ({{Coord|46.2325|6.0450|type:landmark|display=inline|name=CERN Building 31, Birthplace of the ''World Wide Web''}}), but also at his two homes, one in France, one in Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web| first=David|last=Galbraith| title=Tim Berners-Lee: Confirming the exact location of the invention of the web| date=July 8, 2010|url=http://davidgalbraith.org/uncategorized/the-exact-location-where-the-web-was-invented/2343/ |work= DavidGalbraith.org}}</ref> In January 1991 the first Web servers outside CERN itself were switched on.<ref name=Raggett21>{{Cite book | publisher = Addison-Wesley | isbn = 9780201876932 | last = Raggett | first = Dave |author2=Jenny Lam |author3=Ian Alexander | title = HTML 3: Electronic Publishing on the World Wide Web | location = Harlow, England ; Reading, Mass | date = April 1996| page=21}}</ref>\n\nThe first web page may be lost, but Paul Jones of [[UNC-Chapel Hill]] in North Carolina revealed in May 2013 that he has a copy of a page sent to him in 1991 by Berners-Lee which is the oldest known web page.

He brought the NeXT software back to SLAC, where librarian Louise Addis adapted it for the [[VM/CMS]] operating system on the [[IBM mainframe]] as a way to display SLAC's catalog of online documents;<ref name=\"timblhistory\" /> this was the first Web server outside of Europe and the first in North America.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Harper | isbn = 9780062515872 | last = Berners-Lee | first = Tim | title = Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web | location = San Francisco | date = 2000-11-07| page=46}}</ref> The www-talk mailing list was started in the same month.<ref name=Raggett21 />\n\nIn 1992 the Computing and Networking Department of CERN, headed by David Williams, did not support Berners-Lee's work. A two-page email sent by Williams stated that the work of Berners-Lee, with the goal of creating a facility to exchange information such as results and comments from CERN experiments to the scientific community, was not the core activity of CERN and was a misallocation of CERN's IT resources. Following this decision, Tim Berners-Lee left CERN despite many of his peers in the IT center advocating for his support, in particular, M. Ben Segal from the distributed computing SHIFT project. He left for the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), where he continued to develop the HTTP protocol.\n\nAn early CERN-related contribution to the Web was the parody band [[Les Horribles Cernettes]], whose promotional image is believed to be among the Web's first five pictures.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1294,17821,00.html | work = [[Wired magazine]] | date = 1999-02-09 | title = Grrl Geeks Rock Out | author = Heather McCabe}}</ref>\n\n== 1992–1995: Growth of the Web ==\nIn keeping with its birth at [[CERN]] and the [[First website ever made|first page opened]], early adopters of the World Wide Web were primarily university-based scientific departments or physics laboratories such as [[Fermilab]] and [[SLAC]]. By January 1993 there were fifty Web servers across the world. In April 1993 CERN made the World Wide Web available on a royalty-free basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cern/about/updates/2013/04/twenty-years-free-open-web|title=Twenty years of a free, open web {{!}} CERN|website=home.cern|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref> By October 1993 there were over five hundred servers online.<ref name=Raggett21/> Two of the [[List of early webcomics|earliest]] [[webcomics]] started on the World Wide Web in 1993: ''[[Doctor Fun]]'' and ''[[NetBoy]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The History of Webcomics|publisher=[[Antarctic Press]]|last=Campbell|first=T.|date=2006-06-08|isbn=0976804395}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/article.php?id=850|publisher=''Sequential Tart''|title=A Brief History of Webcomics &mdash; The Third Age of Webcomics|last=Atchison|first=Lee|date=2008-01-07}}</ref>\n\nEarly websites intermingled links for both the [[HTTP]] web protocol and the then-popular [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]], which provided access to content through [[hypertext]] menus presented as a [[file system]] rather than through [[HTML]] files. Early Web users would navigate either by bookmarking popular directory pages, such as Berners-Lee's first site at <nowiki>http://info.cern.ch/</nowiki>, or by consulting updated lists such as the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications|NCSA]] \"What's New\" page. Some sites were also indexed by [[Wide area information server|WAIS]], enabling users to submit full-text searches similar to the capability later provided by [[search engine]]s.\n\nBy the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still minute compared to present figures, but quite a number of [[List of websites founded before 1995|notable websites]] were already active, many of which are the precursors or inspiring examples of today's most popular services.\n\n=== Early browsers ===\nInitially, a web browser was available only for the NeXT operating system. This shortcoming was discussed in January 1992,<ref name=Raggett21/> and alleviated in April 1992 by the release of [[Erwise]], an application developed at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]], and in May by [[ViolaWWW]], created by [[Pei-Yuan Wei]], which included advanced features such as embedded graphics, scripting, and animation.<ref name=\"timblhistory\" /> ViolaWWW was originally an application for [[HyperCard]]. Both programs ran on the [[X Window System]] for [[Unix]].<ref name=\"timblhistory\" /> In 1992, the first tests between browsers on different platforms were concluded successfully between buildings 513 and 31 in CERN, between browsers on the NexT station and the X11-ported Mosaic browser.\n\nStudents at the [[University of Kansas]] adapted an existing text-only hypertext browser, [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]], to access the web. Lynx was available on Unix and DOS, and some web designers, unimpressed with glossy graphical websites, held that a website not accessible through Lynx wasn’t worth visiting.\n\nThe first [[Microsoft Windows]] browser was [[Cello (web browser)|Cello]], written by Thomas R. Bruce for the Legal Information Institute at [[Cornell Law School]] to provide legal information, since access to Windows was more widespread amongst lawyers than access to Unix. Cello was released in June 1993.<ref name=\"timblhistory\" />\n\nThe Web was first popularized by [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/w/wi_mosaic.htm|first=William|last=Stewart| title=Mosaic: The First Global Web Browser|work=The Living Internet}}</ref> a graphical browser launched in 1993 by [[Marc Andreessen]]'s team at the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (NCSA) at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (UIUC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totic.org/nscp/demodoc/demo.html|title=NCSA Mosaic -- September 10, 1993 Demo|publisher=}}</ref> \nThe origins of Mosaic date to 1992. In November 1992, the NCSA at the University of Illinois (UIUC) established a website. In December 1992, Andreessen and [[Eric Bina]], students attending UIUC and working at the NCSA, began work on Mosaic with funding from the [[High Performance Computing Act of 1991|High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative]], a US-federal research and development program.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/lazowska/faculty.lecture/innovation/gore.html|title=The Technology Challenge: How Can America Spark Private Innovation? |first=Al |last=Gore| date=February 14, 1996}}</ref> Andreessen and Bina released a Unix version of the browser in February 1993; Mac and Windows versions followed in August 1993.<ref name=Raggett21/> The browser gained popularity due to its strong support of integrated [[multimedia]], and the authors’ rapid response to user bug reports and recommendations for new features.\n\nAfter graduation from UIUC, Andreessen and [[James H. Clark]], former CEO of [[Silicon Graphics]], met and formed [[Mosaic Communications Corporation]] in April 1994, to develop the Mosaic Netscape browser commercially. The company later changed its name to [[Netscape]], and the browser was developed further as [[Netscape Navigator]].\n\n=== Web governance ===\nIn May 1994, the [[World Wide Web Conference 1|first International WWW Conference]], organized by Robert Cailliau,<ref>{{cite web|title=A Short History of the Web: Text of a speech delivered at the launching of the European branch of the W3 Consortium|url=http://www.netvalley.com/archives/mirrors/robert_cailliau_speech.htm|publisher=Net Valley|accessdate=21 July 2010|author=[[Robert Cailliau]]|date=November 2, 1995}}</ref><ref name=\"cailliau-role\">{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions - Robert Cailliau's role|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#Cailliau|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=22 July 2010|author=[[Tim Berners-Lee]]}}</ref> was held at CERN;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iw3c2.org/conferences|title=IW3C2 - Past and Future Conferences|date=2010-05-02|publisher=International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee|accessdate=16 May 2010}}</ref> the conference has been held every year since. In April 1993, CERN had agreed that anyone could use the Web protocol and code royalty-free; this was in part a reaction to the perturbation caused by the [[University of Minnesota]]'s announcement that it would begin charging license fees for its implementation of the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]].\n\nIn September 1994, Berners-Lee founded the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] with support from the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) and the [[European Commission]]. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made the Web available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The W3C decided that its standards must be based on royalty-free technology, so they can be easily adopted by anyone.\n\n== 1996–1998: Commercialization of the Web ==\n{{Main|Web marketing}}\nBy 1996 it became obvious to most publicly traded companies that a public Web presence was no longer optional.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Though at first people saw mainly{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} the possibilities of free publishing and instant worldwide information, increasing familiarity with two-way communication over the \"Web\" led to the possibility of direct Web-based commerce ([[e-commerce]]) and instantaneous group communications worldwide.\nMore [[Dot-com company|dotcoms]], displaying products on hypertext webpages, were added into the Web.\n\n== 1999–2001: \"Dot-com\" boom and bust ==\nLow interest rates in 1998–99 facilitated an increase in start-up companies. Although a number of these new entrepreneurs had realistic plans and administrative ability, most of them lacked these characteristics but were able to sell their ideas to investors because of the novelty of the [[dot-com company|dot-com]] concept.\n\nHistorically, the [[dot-com boom]] can be seen as similar to a number of other technology-inspired booms of the past including [[Railway mania|railroads]] in the 1840s, automobiles in the early 20th century, radio in the 1920s, television in the 1940s, transistor electronics in the 1950s, computer time-sharing in the 1960s, and [[home computer]]s and [[biotechnology]] in the 1980s.\n\nIn 2001 the bubble burst, and many dot-com startups went out of business after burning through their [[venture capital]] and failing to become [[Profit (accounting)|profitable]]. Many others, however, did survive and thrive in the early 21st century. Many companies which began as online retailers blossomed and became highly profitable. More conventional retailers found online merchandising to be a profitable additional source of revenue. While some online entertainment and news outlets failed when their seed capital ran out, others persisted and eventually became economically self-sufficient. Traditional media outlets (newspaper publishers, broadcasters and cablecasters in particular) also found the Web to be a useful and profitable additional channel for content distribution, and an additional means to generate advertising revenue. The sites that survived and eventually prospered after the bubble burst had two things in common; a sound business plan, and a niche in the marketplace that was, if not unique, particularly well-defined and well-served.\n\n== 2002–present: The Web becomes ubiquitous ==\nIn the aftermath of the [[dot-com bubble]], telecommunications companies had a great deal of overcapacity as many Internet business clients went bust. That, plus ongoing investment in local cell infrastructure kept connectivity charges low, helped to make high-speed Internet connectivity more affordable. During this time, a handful of companies found success developing business models that helped make the World Wide Web a more compelling experience. These include airline booking sites, [[Google]]'s [[search engine]] and its profitable approach to keyword-based advertising, as well as [[eBay]]'s auction site and [[Amazon.com]]'s online department store.\n\nThis new era also begot [[social network service|social networking websites]], such as [[MySpace]] and [[Facebook]], which gained acceptance rapidly and became a central part of [[youth culture]]. The 2010s also saw the emergence of various controversial trends, such as the expansion of [[cybercrime]], of the [[manosphere]] and of internet censorship.<ref>Owen, Tim, Wayne Noble, and Faye Christabel Speed. \"Virtual Violence: Cyberspace, Misogyny and Online Abuse.\" New Perspectives on Cybercrime. Palgrave Macmillan, Cham, 2017. 141–158.</ref>\n\n=== Web 2.0 ===\n{{Main|Web 2.0}}\nBeginning in 2002, new ideas for sharing and exchanging content ad hoc, such as [[Blog|Weblogs]] and [[RSS]], rapidly gained acceptance on the Web. This new model for information exchange, primarily featuring user-generated and user-edited websites, was dubbed [[Web 2.0]]. The Web 2.0 boom saw many new service-oriented startups catering to a newly democratized Web.\n\nAs the Web became easier to query, it attained a greater ease of use overall and gained a sense of organization which ushered in a period of rapid popularization. Many new sites such as [[Wikipedia]] and its [[Wikimedia Foundation]] sister projects were based on the concept of [[Wiki|user-edited content]]. In 2005, three former [[PayPal]] employees created a video viewing website called [[YouTube]], which quickly became popular and introduced a new concept of user-submitted content in major events.\n\nThe popularity of YouTube, Facebook, etc., combined with the increasing availability and affordability of high-speed connections has made video content far more common on all kinds of websites. Many video-content hosting and creation sites provide an easy means for their videos to be embedded on third party websites without payment or permission.\n\nThis combination of more user-created or edited content, and easy means of sharing content, such as via RSS widgets and video embedding, has led to many sites with a typical \"Web 2.0\" feel. They have articles with embedded video, user-submitted comments below the article, and RSS boxes to the side, listing some of the latest articles from other sites.\n\nContinued extension of the Web has focused on connecting devices to the Internet, coined [[Intelligent Device Management]]. As Internet connectivity becomes ubiquitous, manufacturers have started to leverage the expanded computing power of their devices to enhance their usability and capability. Through Internet connectivity, manufacturers are now able to interact with the devices they have sold and shipped to their customers, and customers are able to interact with the manufacturer (and other providers) to access new content.\n\n\"Web 2.0\" has found a place in the English lexicon.<ref>{{cite news |title='Millionth English Word' declared | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8092549.stm | date=June 19, 2009|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n===The semantic web===\n{{main|Semantic Web}}\nPopularized by Berners-Lee's book ''[[Weaving the Web]]''<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Harper | isbn = 9780062515872 | last = Berners-Lee | first = Tim | title = Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web | location = San Francisco | date = 2000-11-07| pages=177–198 }}</ref> and a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by Berners-Lee, [[James Hendler]], and [[Ora Lassila]],<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=March 13, 2008 |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00048144-10D2-1C70-84A9809EC588EF21 |title=The Semantic Web |publisher=Scientific American |date=May 1, 2001 |author=Berners-Lee, Tim |author2= James Hendler |author3=Ora Lassila}}</ref> the term [[Semantic Web]] describes an evolution of the existing Web in which the network of hyperlinked human-readable web pages is extended by machine-readable [[metadata]] about documents and how they are related to each other, enabling automated agents to access the Web more intelligently and perform tasks on behalf of users.
