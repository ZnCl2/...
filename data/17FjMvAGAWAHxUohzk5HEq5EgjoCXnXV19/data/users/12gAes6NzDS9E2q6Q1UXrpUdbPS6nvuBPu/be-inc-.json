Be was founded by former [[Apple Computer]] executive [[Jean-Louis Gassée]] with capital from [[Seymour Cray]].\n\nBe's corporate offices were located in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], [[California]]; as well as regional sales offices in [[France]] and [[Japan]]. The company later relocated to [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] in [[California]] for the duration of its dissolution.\n\nThe main intent of Be was to develop a new operating system using the [[C++]] programming language on a proprietary hardware platform. The BeOS ran on the BeBox, but was later ported to [[Apple Computer]]'s [[Power Mac]]s despite resistance from Apple, due to the hardware specifications assistance of [[Power Computing]]. In 1998, the system was ported to the Intel [[x86]] architecture, and PowerPC support was reduced, finally being dropped after [[BeOS R5]].\n\n== History ==\nBe was founded by former [[Apple Computer]] executive [[Jean-Louis Gassée]] in 1990 with [[Steve Sakoman]] after being ousted by Apple CEO [[John Sculley]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Pollack|first=Andrew|title=Apple Official Says He Will Leave|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/03/business/apple-official-says-he-will-leave.html|accessdate=31 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 March 1990}}</ref>  Be aimed to create a modern computer operating system written in C++ on a proprietary hardware platform. In 1995, the [[BeBox]] personal computer was released by Be, with its distinctive strips of lights up the front that indicated the load of each [[Central processing unit|CPU]], and the combined analogue/digital, 37-pin [[GeekPort]] has made it a highly desirable item for collectors{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. In addition to BeOS and BeBox, Be also produced [[BeIA]], an ill-fated OS for [[internet appliance]]s. It was however used commercially by [[Sony]] (with the [[Sony eVilla|eVilla]]) and [[DT Research]], amongst others, during its short lifespan.\n\nIn 1996, Apple was searching for a new operating system to replace the [[classic Mac OS]]. Eventually, the two final options were [[BeOS]] and [[NeXTSTEP]]. The deal swung towards [[NeXT]] due to the persuasive influence of [[Steve Jobs]] and the incomplete state of the BeOS product, criticized at the time for lacking such features as printing capability.\n\nUltimately the assets of the corporation were bought by [[Palm, Inc.]], where Gassée served on the board of directors, for [[United States dollar|US$]]11 million in 2001, at which point the company entered [[dissolution (law)|dissolution]]. The company then initiated [[litigation]] against [[Microsoft]] for [[imperfect competition|anti-competitive]] business practices, specifically the prohibition of [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s to allow dual-boot systems containing both Microsoft and non-Microsoft operating systems. The suit was settled in September 2003 with a US$23.25 million payout to Be, Inc. Palm subsequently spun off a wholly owned subsidiary [[PalmSource]] to develop its Palm OS and related software, with the Be assets being transferred to PalmSource which was subsequently acquired by Japanese-based [[Access Co.|ACCESS]].\n\n==Company name==\nAccording to several sources including ''[[Macworld UK]]'', the company name \"Be\" had its origin in a conversation between Gassée and Be co-founder [[Steve Sakoman]]. Gassée originally thought the company should be called \"United Technoids Inc.\", but Sakoman disagreed and said he would start looking through the dictionary for a better name. A few days later, when Gassée asked if he had made any progress, Sakoman replied that he had got tired and stopped at \"B.\" Gassée said, \"Be is nice. End of story.\"\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{BeOS}}\n\n[[Category:Be Inc.| ]]\n[[Category:Defunct computer companies based in California]]\n[[Category:Defunct computer hardware companies]]\n[[Category:Defunct software companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Home computer hardware companies]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Menlo Park, California]]\n[[Category:Computer companies established in 1990]]\n[[Category:Companies disestablished in 2001]]\n[[Category:1990 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:2001 disestablishments in California]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]",
