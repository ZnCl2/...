In unpointed Biblical Hebrew, most vowels are not written and the rest are written only ambiguously, as certain consonants can double as vowel markers (similar to the [[Latin]] use of V to indicate both U and V). These are referred to as [[Mater lectionis|matres lectionis]] (\"mothers of reading\"). Therefore, it is, in general, difficult to deduce how a word is pronounced only from its spelling, and the tetragrammaton is a particular example: two of its letters can serve as vowels, and two are vocalic place-holders, which are not pronounced. Thus the first-century Jewish historian and philosopher [[Josephus]] said that the sacred name of God consists of \"four vowels\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0148%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D228 Josephus, ''[[The Jewish War]]'', V:235]</ref>\n\nThe original [[abjad|consonantal text]] of the Hebrew Bible was, several centuries later, provided with vowel marks by the [[Masoretes]] to assist reading. In places that the consonants of the text to be read (the [[Qere and Ketiv|''qere'']]) differed from the consonants of the written text (the [[Qere and Ketiv|''ketiv'']]), they wrote the ''qere'' in the margin as a note showing what was to be read. In such a case the vowels of the ''qere'' were written on the ''ketiv''. For a few frequent words, the marginal note was omitted: these are called [[Qere and Ketiv#Qere perpetuum|qere perpetuum]].\n\nOne of the frequent cases was the tetragrammaton, which according to later Jewish practices should not be pronounced but read as \"[[Names of God in Judaism#Adonai|Adonai]]\" (\"My Lord\"), or, if the previous or next word already was [[Adonai]], as \"[[Elohim]]\" (\"God\"). The combination produces {{lang|he|יְהֹוָה|rtl=yes}} and {{lang|he|יֱהֹוה|rtl=yes}} respectively, [[ghost word|non-words]] that would spell \"Yehovah\" and \"Yehovih\" respectively.<ref>{{cite book |title=Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament, Volume 3 |editor=G.

It could be because the ''o'' diacritic point plays no useful role in distinguishing between ''Adonai'' and ''[[Elohim]]'' and so is redundant,  or it could point to the ''qere'' being ''Shema'', which is [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for \"the Name\".\n\n===Adonai===\n[[File:Tetragrammaton-related-Masoretic-vowel-points.png|thumb|right|220px|The spelling of the tetragrammaton and connected forms in the Hebrew Masoretic text of the Bible, with [[niqqud|vowel points]] shown in red]]\nThe vocalisations of {{lang|he|יְהֹוָה|rtl=yes}} (''Yehovah'') and {{lang|he|אֲדֹנָי|rtl=yes}} (''Adonai'') are not identical. The [[shva]] in YHWH (the vowel <big>{{Script/Hebrew|\"ְ \"}}</big> under the first letter) and the [[niqqud|hataf patakh]] in 'DNY (the vowel <big>{{Hebrew|\"ֲ \"}}</big> under its first letter) appear different. The vocalisation can be attributed to Biblical Hebrew phonology,<ref>Lambdin, Thomas O.: ''Introduction to Biblical Hebrew'', London: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1971.</ref> where the hataf patakh is grammatically identical to a shva, always replacing every [[shva|shva naḥ]] under a [[guttural|guttural letter]]. Since the first letter of {{lang|he|אֲדֹנָי|rtl=yes}} is a guttural letter while the first letter of {{lang|he|יְהֹוָה|rtl=yes}} is not, the hataf patakh under the (guttural) [[aleph]] reverts to a regular shva under the (non-guttural) [[yodh|Yod]].\n\nThe table below considers the vowel points for {{lang|he|יְהֹוָה|rtl=yes}} (''Yehovah'') and {{lang|he|אֲדֹנָי|rtl=yes}} (''Adonai''), respectively:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"3\"|Hebrew word No. 3068<br/>YEHOVAH<br/>{{lang|he|יְהֹוָה|rtl=yes}}\n!colspan=\"3\"|Hebrew word No. 136<br/>ADONAY<br/>{{lang|he|אֲדֹנָי|rtl=yes}}\n|-\n| {{hebrew|י}} ||Yod||Y|| {{hebrew|א}} ||Aleph||[[glottal stop]]\n|-\n| {{hebrew|ְ}} ||Simple Shewa||e|| {{hebrew|ֲ}} ||Hataf Patakh||A\n|-\n| {{hebrew|ה}} ||Heh||H|| {{hebrew|ד}} ||Daleth||D\n|-\n| {{hebrew|ֹ}} ||Holem||O|| {{hebrew|ֹ}} ||Holem||O\n|-\n| {{hebrew|ו}} ||Waw||W|| {{hebrew|נ}} ||Nun||N\n|-\n| {{hebrew|ָ}} ||Kametz||A|| {{hebrew|ָ}} ||Kametz||A\n|-\n| {{hebrew|ה}} ||Heh||H|| {{hebrew|י}} ||Yod||Y\n|}\n\nIn the table directly above,  the \"simple shewa\" in ''Yehovah'' and the ''hataf patakh'' in ''Adonai'' are not the same vowel. The difference being, the \"simple shewa\" is an \"a\" sound as in \"alone\", whereas the ''hataf patakh'' is more subtle, as the \"a\" in \"father\". The same information is displayed in the table above and to the right, where ''YHWH'' is intended to be pronounced as ''Adonai'', and ''Adonai'' is shown to have different vowel points.\n\n===Yahweh===\n{{Main article|Yahweh}}\n[[File:YHWH pronunciation.svg|frame|150px|left|[[Wilhelm Gesenius]]'s Hebrew punctuation (i.e., Yahweh)]]\n[[File:YHVH.jpg|thumb|Tetragrammaton (with the vowel points for Adonai) on a Wittenberg University debate lectern]]\nThe Hebrew scholar [[Wilhelm Gesenius]] [1786–1842] suggested that the Hebrew punctuation {{lang|he|יַהְוֶה|rtl=yes}}, which is transliterated into English as ''[[Yahweh]]'', might more accurately represent the pronunciation of the tetragrammaton than the Biblical Hebrew punctuation \"{{lang|he|יְהֹוָה|rtl=yes}}\", from which the English name ''[[Jehovah]]'' has been derived. His proposal to read ''YHWH'' as \"{{Hebrew|יַהְוֶה}}\" (see image to the left) was based in large part on various Greek transcriptions, such as ιαβε, dating from the first centuries CE but also on the forms of theophoric names. In his ''Hebrew Dictionary,'' Gesenius supports ''Yahweh'' (which would have been pronounced {{IPA|[jahwe]}}, with the final letter being silent) because of the Samaritan pronunciation {{lang|grc|Ιαβε}} reported by [[Theodoret]], and because the [[theophoric name]] prefixes ''YHW'' {{IPA|[jeho]}} and ''YW'' {{IPA|[jo]}}, the [[theophoric name]] suffixes ''YHW'' {{IPA|[jahu]}} and ''YH'' {{IPA|[jah]}}, and the abbreviated form ''YH'' {{IPA|[jah]}} can be derived from the form ''Yahweh''.<ref>[http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:A_Hebrew_and_English_Lexicon_%28Brown-Driver-Briggs%29.djvu/242&action=edit&redlink=1 ''A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament with an appendix containing the Biblical Aramaic''], written by Francis Brown, Samuel Rolles Driver and Charles Augustus Briggs, based on the Hebrew lexicon of Wilhelm Gesenius as translated by Edward Robinson, Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1906, s. 218.</ref> Gesenius's proposal to read ''YHWH'' as {{Hebrew|יַהְוֶה}} is accepted as the best scholarly reconstructed vocalised Hebrew spelling of the tetragrammaton.<ref name=Jouon>Paul Joüon and T.

A Hebrew tetractys in a similar way has the letters of the tetragrammaton (the four lettered name of God in Hebrew scripture) inscribed on the ten positions of the tetractys, from right to left. It has been argued that the Kabbalistic [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]], with its ten spheres of emanation, is in some way connected to the tetractys, but its form is not that of a triangle. The occult writer [[Dion Fortune]] says: \n: \"The [[Point (geometry)|point]] is assigned to Kether; \n: the [[Line (geometry)|line]] to Chokmah;\n: the two-dimensional [[plane (geometry)|plane]] to Binah; \n: consequently the three-dimensional [[Solid geometry|solid]] naturally falls to Chesed.\"<ref>The Mystical Qabalah, Dion Fortune, Chapter XVIII, 25</ref>\n\n(The first three-dimensional solid is the [[tetrahedron]].)\n\nThe relationship between geometrical shapes and the first four [[Sephirot]] is analogous to the geometrical correlations in tetractys, shown above under <span style=\"font-size:0.9em; font-weight:bold;\">Pythagorean Symbol</span>, and unveils the relevance of the Tree of Life with the tetractys.\n\n===Samaritans===\nThe [[Samaritans]] shared the taboo of the Jews about the utterance of the name, and there is no evidence that its pronunciation was common Samaritan practice.<ref name=Moore/><ref>The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman culture: Volume 3 – Page 152 [[Peter Schäfer]], Catherine Hezser – 2002 \" In fact, there is no proof in any other rabbinic writing that Samaritans used to pronounce the Divine Name when they took an oath.

It therefore directed that, \"in liturgical celebrations, in songs and prayers the name of God in the form of the ''tetragrammaton'' YHWH is neither to be used or pronounced\"; and that translations of Biblical texts for liturgical use are to follow the practice of the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, replacing the divine name with \"the Lord\" or, in some contexts, \"God\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/Scripture/Name_CDW.pdf|title=Letter of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (PDF)|format=PDF|accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref> The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] welcomed this instruction, adding that it \"provides also an opportunity to offer catechesis for the faithful as an encouragement to show reverence for the Name of God in daily life, emphasizing the power of language as an act of devotion and worship\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/cdwtetragram.pdf |title=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Divine Worship (PDF) |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[God in Judaism]]\n* [[Names of God in Islam]]\n* [[Pi (film)|Pi]] - Film in which a man stumbles upon the \"true\" hidden name of God through mathematics\n* [[Shemhamphorasch]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book\n|last = Van der Toorn\n|first = Karel\n|chapter = Yahweh\n|editor1-last = Van der Toorn\n|editor1-first = Karel\n|editor2-last = Becking\n|editor2-first = Bob\n|editor3-last = Van der Horst\n|editor3-first = Pieter Willem\n|title = Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible\n|publisher = Eerdmans\n|year = 1999\n|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&pg=PA912&dq=%22If+the+Kenite+hypothesis+is+to+be+maintained%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3_sHVYefGeS6mQWjyoHABA&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22If%20the%20Kenite%20hypothesis%20is%20to%20be%20maintained%22&f=false\n|ref = harv\n}}\n\n;Attribution\n*{{EB1911 |last=Moore |first=George Foot |wstitle=Jehovah |volume=Volume 15 |pages=[https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri15chisrich#page/311/mode/1up 311]–314 |ref=harv}}\n\n{{Commons|Tetragrammaton}}\n{{Names of God}}\n\n[[Category:Tetragrammaton| ]]<!--please leave the empty space as standard-->\n[[Category:Kabbalistic words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Yahweh]]\n\n[[es:Yahveh#Escritura]]",
