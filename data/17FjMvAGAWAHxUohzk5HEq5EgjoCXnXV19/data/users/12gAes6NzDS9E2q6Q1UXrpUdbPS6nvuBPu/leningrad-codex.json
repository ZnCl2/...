Weil to ''[[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]]'', 1977.</ref> The [[Aleppo Codex]], against which the Leningrad Codex was corrected, is several decades older, but parts of it have been missing since 1947, making the Leningrad Codex the oldest complete codex of the Tiberian mesorah that has survived intact to this day.\n\nIn modern times, the Leningrad Codex is significant as the Hebrew text reproduced in ''[[Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)|Biblia Hebraica]]'' (1937) and ''[[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]]'' (1977). It also serves as a primary source for the recovery of details in the missing parts of the Aleppo Codex.\n\n==Name==\nThe Leningrad Codex (a codex is a handwritten book as opposed to a [[scroll]]) is so named because it has been housed at the [[National Library of Russia]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] since 1863. In 1924, after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], Petrograd (formerly Saint Petersburg) was renamed Leningrad, and, because the codex was used as the basic text for the Biblia Hebraica since 1937, it became internationally known as the \"Leningrad Codex\". Although in 1991, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the city's original name was restored to St Petersburg, the National Library of Russia requested that \"Leningrad\" be retained in the name of the codex. Nonetheless, the Codex is occasionally referred to as the Codex Petersburgensis or Petropolitanus, or the St. Petersburg Codex. This is ambiguous as, since 1876, these appellations refer to a different biblical codex (MS. Heb B 3) which is even older (916 CE), but contains only the later Prophets.\n\n==Contents==\nThe biblical text as found in the codex contains the Hebrew letter-text along with Tiberian [[niqqud|vowels]] and [[cantillation]] signs. In addition, there are [[masoretic notes]] in the margins. There are also various technical supplements dealing with textual and linguistic details, many of which are painted in geometrical forms. The codex is written on parchment and bound in leather.\n\nThe Leningrad Codex, in extraordinarily pristine condition after a millennium, also provides an example of medieval Jewish art. Sixteen of the pages contain decorative geometric patterns that illuminate passages from the text. The [[carpet page]] shows a star with the names of the scribes on the edges and a blessing written in the middle.\n\nThe order of the books in the Leningrad Codex follows the Tiberian textual tradition, which is also that of the later tradition of [[Sephardic]] biblical manuscripts. This order for the books differs markedly from that of most printed Hebrew bibles for the books of the [[Ketuvim]]. In the Leningrad Codex, the order of the Ketuvim is: Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah. The full order of the books is given below.\n\n==History==\n[[File:LeningradCodex text.jpg|thumb|Leningrad Codex text sample, portions of Exodus 15:21-16:3]]\n\nAccording to its [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]], the [[codex]] was copied in [[Cairo]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stuhlman|first1=Daniel D.|title=The Leningrad Codex|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ddstuhlman/crc10.htm|publisher=Librarian's Lobby|accessdate=13 October 2014|date=1 March 1998}}</ref> from manuscripts written by [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]]. It has been claimed to be a product of the Asher scriptorium itself; however, there is no evidence that Asher ever saw it. Unusual for a masoretic codex, the same man (Samuel ben Jacob) wrote the consonants, the vowels and the Masoretic notes. In its vocalization system (vowel points and [[cantillation]]) it is considered by scholars to be the most faithful representative of ben Asher's tradition apart from the Aleppo Codex (edited by ben Asher himself). Its letter-text is not superb, however, and contradicts its own masoretic apparatus in many hundreds of places.<ref>On the vocalization and letter-text of the Leningrad Codex see Israel Yeivin, ''The Aleppo Codex of the Bible: A Study of its Vocalization and Accentuation (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1968) pp. 357-359 (Hebrew).</ref> There are numerous alterations and erasures, and it was suggested by [[Moshe Goshen-Gottstein]] that an existing text not following Asher's rules was heavily amended so as to make it conform to these rules.\n\nThe codex is now preserved in the [[National Library of Russia]], accessioned as \"Firkovich B 19 A\". Its former owner, the [[Crimean Karaite]] collector [[Abraham Firkovich]], left no indication in his writings where he had acquired the codex, which was taken to Odessa in 1838 and later transferred to the Imperial Library in St Petersburg.\n\n==Modern editions==\n===Biblia Hebraica===\nIn 1935, the Leningrad Codex was lent to the Old Testament Seminar of the University of Leipzig for two years while [[Paul E. Kahle]] supervised its transcription for the Hebrew text of the third edition of ''[[Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)|Biblia Hebraica]]'' (BHK), published in Stuttgart, 1937. The codex was also used for ''[[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]]'' (BHS) in 1977, and is being used for [[Biblia Hebraica Quinta]] (BHQ).\n\nAs an original work by Tiberian masoretes, the Leningrad Codex was older by several centuries than the other Hebrew manuscripts which had been used for all previous editions of printed Hebrew bibles until [[Biblia Hebraica (disambiguation)|Biblia Hebraica]].\n\nThe Westminster Leningrad Codex is an online digital version of the Leningrad Codex maintained by the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research at the [[Westminster Theological Seminary]]. This is a verified version of the Michigan-Claremont text, transcribed from BHS at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1981-1982 under the direction of H. Van Dyke Parunak (of the University of Michigan) and Richard E. Whitaker (of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, Claremont Graduate University) with funding from the Packard Foundation and the University of Michigan,<ref>Introductory notes to the Bibleworks WTT text, www.bibleworks.com</ref> with further proofreading and corrections. The online version includes transcription notes and tools for analyzing syntax.\n\n===Jewish editions===\nThe Leningrad Codex also served as the basis for two important modern Jewish editions of the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanakh]]):\n*The [[Aron Dotan|Dotan]] edition, which was distributed to soldiers in mass quantities as the official [[Tanakh]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] throughout the 1990s.\n*The [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|''JPS Hebrew-English Tanakh'']] (Philadelphia, 1999) and the various volumes of the JPS Torah Commentary and JPS Bible Commentary.\n\nFor minute masoretic details, however, Israeli and Jewish scholars have shown a marked preference for modern Hebrew editions based upon the Aleppo Codex. These editions use the Leningrad Codex as the most important source (but not the only one) for the reconstruction of parts of the Aleppo Codex that have been missing since 1947.\n\n==Sequence of the books==\nAs explained in the Contents section above, this is different from most modern Hebrew bibles:\n\nThe [[Torah]]:\n: 1.
