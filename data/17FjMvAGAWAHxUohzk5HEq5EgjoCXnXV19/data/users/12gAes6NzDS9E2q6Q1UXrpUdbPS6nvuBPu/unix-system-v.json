It was originally developed by [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] and first released in 1983. Four major versions of System V were released, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. System V Release 4, or SVR4, was commercially the most successful version, being the result of an effort, marketed as \"Unix System Unification\", which solicited the collaboration of the major Unix vendors. It was the source of several common commercial Unix features. System V is sometimes abbreviated to '''SysV'''.\n\n{{as of|2012}}, the Unix market is divided between five System V variants: [[IBM]]'s [[AIX operating system|AIX]], [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s [[HP-UX]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]'s [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]],<ref name=\"lastdays\">{{cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2168940/servers/the-last-days-of-unix.html |title=The Last Days of Unix |website=Network World |date=19 August 2013 |accessdate=26 Jun 2014}}</ref> [[Xinuos]]'s [[UnixWare]] and [[illumos]] [[Illumos#Current distributions|distributions]] being the [[open-source]] OpenSolaris  continuation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/76669.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926053916/http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/76669.html|title=Whither OpenSolaris?

While AT&T sold their own hardware that ran System V, most customers instead ran a version from a reseller, based on AT&T's [[reference implementation]]. A standards document called the [[System V Interface Definition]] outlined the default features and behavior of implementations.\n\n=== AT&T support ===\nDuring its formative years, AT&T went through several phases of System V software groups, beginning with the Unix Support Group (USG), followed by Unix System Development Laboratory (USDL), followed by AT&T Information Systems (ATTIS), and finally [[Unix System Laboratories]] (USL).\n\n=== Rivalry with BSD ===\n{{Main article|Unix wars}}\nIn the 1980s and early-1990s, System V was considered one of the two major versions of UNIX, the other being the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD). Historically, BSD was also commonly called \"BSD Unix\" or \"Berkeley Unix\".<ref>Garfinkel, Simson. Spafford, Gene. Schwartz, Alan. ''Practical UNIX and Internet Security.'' 2003. pp. 15-20</ref> [[Eric S. Raymond]] summarizes the longstanding relationship and rivalry between System V and BSD during the early period:<ref>Raymond, Eric S. ''The Art of Unix Programming.'' 2003. p. 38</ref>\n\n{{quote|In fact, for years after divestiture the Unix community was preoccupied with the first phase of the [[Unix wars]]&nbsp;– an internal dispute, the rivalry between System V Unix and BSD Unix. The dispute had several levels, some technical ([[Berkeley sockets|sockets]] vs. [[STREAMS|streams]], BSD tty vs. System V termio) and some cultural. The divide was roughly between longhairs and shorthairs; [[programmer]]s and technical people tended to line up with Berkeley and BSD, more business-oriented types with AT&T and System V.}}\n\nWhile HP, IBM and others chose System V as the basis for their Unix offerings, other vendors such as [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] extended BSD. Throughout its development, though, System V was infused with features from BSD, while BSD variants such as DEC's [[Ultrix]] received System V features. AT&T and Sun Microsystems worked together to merge System V with BSD-based [[SunOS]] to produce [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], one of the primary System V descendants still in use today. Since the early 1990s, due to standardization efforts such as [[POSIX]] and the commercial success of [[Linux]], the division between System V and BSD has become less important.\n\n== Releases ==\n[[File:Teletype_DMD_5620.jpg|thumb|[[Blit (computer terminal)|DMD 5620 ''Blit'' terminal]] connected to a SVR3 host, showing the ''Layers'' interface]]\n\n=== SVR1 ===\nSystem V, known inside Bell Labs as Unix 5.0, succeeded AT&T's previous commercial Unix called [[UNIX System III|System III]] in January, 1983.<ref name=\"levenez\">{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.levenez.com/unix/\n| title       = Unix History (Unix Timeline)\n| first       = Éric\n| last        = Lévénez\n| archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/5vLcAHDQ6\n| archivedate = 2010-12-29\n| accessdate  = 2010-12-29\n}}</ref>\nThere was never an external release of Unix 4.0, which would have been System IV.<ref>{{cite book |title=Overview of the XENIX 286 Operating System |publisher=Intel Corporation |date= November 1984 |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/intel/system3xx/xenix-286/174385-001_Overview_of_the_XENIX_286_Operating_System_Nov84.pdf |page=1.10 |quote=There was no System IV.}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup\n  | title = UNIX History\n  | author = Dale Dejager\n  | date = 1984-01-16\n  | newsgroup = net.unix\n  | url = http://groups.google.com/group/net.unix/msg/b80689d4b3bff13f?dmode=source\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Modern Operating Systems |last=Tanenbaum |first=Andrew S. |quote=Whatever happened to System IV is one of the great unsolved mysteries of computer science. |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=2nd |year=2001 |page=675 |isbn=0-13-031358-0 }}</ref>\nThis first release of System V (called System V.0, System V Release 1, or SVR1) was developed by AT&T's UNIX Support Group (USG) and based on the Bell Labs internal USG UNIX 5.0.\n\nSystem V also included features such as the [[vi]] editor and [[curses (programming library)|curses]] from 4.1 BSD, developed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]; it also improved performance by adding buffer and [[inode]] caches.

The relationship between Sun and AT&T was terminated after the release of SVR4, meaning that later versions of Solaris did not inherit features of later SVR4.x releases. Sun would in 2005 release most of the source code for Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10) as the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[OpenSolaris]] project, creating, with its forks, the only open-source (albeit heavily modified) System V implementation available. After [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] took over Sun, Solaris was [[Fork (software development)|fork]]ed into proprietary release, but [[illumos]] as the continuation project is being developed in open-source.\n\nA consortium of Intel-based resellers including [[Unisys]], [[International Computers Limited|ICL]], [[NCR Corporation]], and [[Olivetti]] developed SVR4.0MP with [[multiprocessing]] capability (allowing system calls to be processed from any processor, but interrupt servicing only from a \"master\" processor).<ref>\n{{Citation\n |title=Unix Internatl. and USL release early version of SVR4 multiprocessing software\n |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/technology/computer-software/165194-1.html\n |date=17 June 1991\n |accessdate=2009-04-22\n}}\n</ref>\n\nRelease 4.1 ES (Enhanced Security) added security features required for [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria|Orange Book]] B2 compliance and [[Access Control List]]s and support for dynamic loading of kernel modules.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Unix International reviews the Unix System V.4 story so far |author=William Fellows |date=13 August 1992 |journal=Computer Business Review |url=http://www.cbronline.com/news/unix_international_reviews_the_unix_system_v4_story_so_far |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref><ref>\n{{Citation\n |title=Computer Security\n |first=Matt\n |last=Bishop\n |publisher=Addison Wesley\n |date=December 2, 2002\n |isbn=0-201-44099-7\n |page=505\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== SVR4.2 / UnixWare ===\nIn 1992, AT&T USL engaged in a joint venture with [[Novell]], called [[Univel]].

Novell transferred ownership of the Unix trademark to [[The Open Group]].  Any operating system that meets the [[Single Unix Specification]] (SUS), effectively a successor to the System V Interface Definition, may be granted Unix rights. The SUS is met by Apple's [[macOS]], a BSD derivative, as well as several other operating systems not derived from either BSD or System V.\n\nSystem V Release 5 was developed in 1997 by the [[Santa Cruz Operation]] (SCO) as a merger of [[SCO OpenServer]] (an SVR3-derivative) and UnixWare, with a focus on large-scale servers.<ref name=\"Rosen\">{{cite book |author=Kenneth H.
