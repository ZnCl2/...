The [[codex]] was written in the city of [[Tiberias]], in what is currently northern [[Israel]], in the 10th century C.E.,<ref name=\"haaretz.com\">[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/920915.html Fragment of ancient parchment given to Jewish scholars]</ref> and was endorsed for its accuracy by [[Maimonides]]. Together with the [[Leningrad Codex]], it contains the [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher|Ben-Asher]] [[Masoretic Text|masoretic]] tradition, but the Aleppo Codex lacks most of the Torah section and many other parts.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Overview ===\nThe [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jewish]] community of [[Jerusalem]] purchased the codex about a hundred years after it was made.<ref>[http://hebrewbooks.org/32847 M.

It is rumoured that in 1375 one of Maimonides' descendants brought it to [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]], leading to its present name.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\" />\n\nThe Codex remained in Syria for five hundred years. In 1947, rioters enraged by the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] burned down the [[synagogue]] where it was kept.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\" /> The Codex disappeared, then reemerged in 1958, when it was smuggled into [[Israel]] by [[Syrian Jews|Syrian Jew]] Murad Faham, and presented to the president of the state, [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]]. Some time after arrival, it was found that parts of the codex had been lost. The Aleppo Codex was entrusted to the Ben-Zvi Institute and [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. It is currently (2005) on display in the [[Israel Museum]].\n\n===Ransom===\n[[File:Aleppo Deut 1910 Photo.jpg|thumb|Photograph of missing page<ref>Photo taken in 1910 by Joseph Segall and published in Travels through Northern Syria (London, 1910), p. 99.

It may not be sold and it may not be defiled forever.<ref name=codex/>}}\n\n===In Aleppo===\nThe Aleppo community guarded the Codex zealously for some 600 years: it was kept, together with three other Biblical manuscripts, in a special cupboard (later, an iron safe) in a basement chapel of the [[Central Synagogue of Aleppo]], supposed to have been the [[Cave of Elijah]]. It was regarded as the community's most sacred possession: Those in trouble would pray before it, and oaths were taken by it. The community received queries from Jews around the world, who asked that various textual details be checked, correspondence which is preserved in the [[responsa]] literature, and which allows for the reconstruction of certain details in the parts that are missing today. Most importantly, in the 1850s, [[Shalom Shachne Yellin]] sent his son in law, Moses Joshua Kimchi, to Aleppo, to copy information about the Codex; Kimchi sat for weeks, and copied thousands of details about the codex into the margins of a small handwritten [[Bible]]. The existence of this Bible was known to 20th-century scholars from the book ''‘Ammudé Shesh'' by [[Shemuel Shelomo Boyarski]], and then the actual Bible itself was discovered by [[Yosef Ofer]] in 1989.\n\nHowever, the community limited direct observation of the manuscript by outsiders, especially by scholars in modern times. [[Paul E. Kahle]], when revising the text of the ''[[Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)|Biblia Hebraica]]'' in the 1920s, tried and failed to obtain a photographic copy. This forced him to use the ''[[Leningrad Codex]]'' instead for the third edition, which appeared in 1937.\n\nThe only modern scholar allowed to compare it with a standard printed [[Hebrew Bible]] and take notes on the differences was [[Umberto Cassuto]], who examined it in 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Wandering Bible: The Aleppo Codex|url=http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/page_1358|website=The Israel Museum, Jerusalem|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> This secrecy made it impossible to confirm the authenticity of the Codex, and indeed Cassuto doubted that it was Maimonides' codex, though he agreed that it was 10th-century.\n\nDuring the [[1947 Anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo]], the community's ancient synagogue was burned and the Codex was damaged, so that no more than 294 of the original (estimated) 487 pages survived.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/920915.html One more piece of famed ancient Bible comes to Jerusalem]</ref><ref>Hayim Tawil & Bernard Schneider, ''Crown of Aleppo'' (Philadelphia, Jewish Publication Soc., 2010) page 110; there have been various reports and estimates of the original number of pages; Izhak Ben-Zvi, \"The Codex of Ben Asher\",  ''Textus,''  vol. 1 (1960) page 2, reprinted in Sid Z.

The Jews of Aleppo claim that they were burned. However, scholarly analysis has shown no evidence of fire having reached the codex itself (the dark marks on the pages are due to fungus). Some scholars instead accuse members of the Jewish community of having torn off the missing leaves and keeping them privately hidden. Two \"missing\" leaves have turned up, one in 1982 and the other in 2007, leaving open the possibility that even more may have survived the riots in 1947.<ref name=holy>{{cite news |author=[[Ronen Bergman]] |coauthors= |title=A High Holy Whodunit |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/magazine/the-aleppo-codex-mystery.html?pagewanted=all |quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-26 }}</ref>  In particular, the 2012 book, ''The Aleppo Codex''  by [[Matti Friedman]], calls attention to the fact that eyewitnesses in Aleppo who saw the Codex shortly after the fire consistently reported that it was complete or nearly complete, and then there is no account of it for more than a decade, until after it arrived in Israel and was put in the Ben-Zvi Institute, at which point it was as currently described; his book suggests a number of possibilities for the loss of the pages.<ref>Matti Friedman, ''The Aleppo Codex'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2012) chapt. 24 and ''passim'' (the book would benefit from an index!)</ref>\n\nThe community of Damascus possessed a counterpart of the Aleppo Codex, known as the \"Damascus Keter\", also written in Israel in the 10th century, which is now kept at the [[National Library of Israel]] and numbered ms. Heb 5702. It is available online here [http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11364/]. (This should not be confused with another Damascus Keter, of medieval Spanish origin.)\n\n===In Israel===\n[[File:Jerusalem Schrein des Buches BW 1.JPG|thumb|right|Exterior view of the [[Shrine of the Book]]]]\n\nThe Israeli writer Amnon Shamosh wrote an account of how it was brought to Israel in his ''Ha-Keter: Sippuro shel Keter Aram Soba'' (''The Crown: The Story of the Aleppo Codex''), published in 1987. The codex was entrusted to the Ben-Zvi Institute and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Attempts to recover its missing parts continue to this day.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/930663.html \"Ben-Zvi Institute calls for return of Aleppo Codex fragments\"], ''Haaretz'', December 3, 2007.</ref>\n\nIn January 1958, the Aleppo Codex was smuggled out of Syria and sent to Jerusalem to be placed in the care of the chief rabbi of the Aleppo Jews. But by the influence of then [[President of Israel]], Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, it was secretly taken by the government. In the late 1980s, the codex was placed in the [[Shrine of the Book]] at the [[Israel Museum]].<ref name=holy /><ref name=holy/> This finally gave scholars the chance to examine it and consider the claims that it is indeed the manuscript referred to by Maimonides. The work of [[Moshe Goshen-Gottstein]] on the few surviving pages of the Torah seems to have confirmed these claims beyond reasonable doubt. Goshen-Gottstein suggested (in the introduction to his facsimile reprint of the codex) that not only was it the oldest known masoretic Bible in a single volume, it was the first time ever that a complete ''[[Tanakh]]'' had been produced by one or two people as a unified entity in a consistent style.\n\nLater, after the university denied him access to the codex, [[Mordechai Breuer]] began his own reconstruction of the Masoretic text on the basis of other well-known ancient manuscripts. His results matched the Aleppo Codex almost exactly. Thus today, Breuer's version is used authoritatively for the reconstruction of the missing portions of the Aleppo Codex. The ''[[Jerusalem Crown]]'' (כתר ירושלים, \"Jerusalem Crown\"), printed in Jerusalem in 2000, is a modern version of the Tanakh based on the Aleppo Codex and the work of Breuer: It uses a newly designed typeface based on the calligraphy of the Codex and is based on its page layout.{{cn|date=May 2016}}\n\n[[Documentary film]]maker, Avi Dabach, great grandson of Chacham Ezra Dabach (one of the last caretakers of the Codex when it was still in Syria), announced in December 2015 an upcoming film tracing the history of the Codex and possibly determining the fate of the missing pages.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Maltz|first1=Judy|title=My Great-grandfather, the Man Who Held the Key to the Aleppo Codex|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.693328|website=Haaretz|accessdate=24 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Authoritative text==\nThe consonants in the codex were copied by the scribe Shlomo ben Buya'a in Israel circa 920. The text was then verified, vocalized, and provided with Masoretic notes by [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]], the last and most prominent member of the ben Asher dynasty of grammarians from [[Tiberias]], rivals to the [[ben Naphtali]] school. The tradition of ben Asher has become the one accepted for the [[Hebrew Bible]].<ref name=\"ej2-ben-asher\">{{citation | author=Zeev Ben-Hayyim | contribution=BEN-ASHER, AARON BEN MOSES | title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] | edition=2nd | volume=3 | year=2007 | publisher=Gale | pages=319–321}}</ref> The ben Asher vocalization is late and in many respects artificial, compared to other traditions and tendencies reaching back closer to the period of spoken Biblical Hebrew.<ref name=\"nce2-bible\">{{citation | author=P. W. Skehan | contribution=BIBLE (TEXTS) | title=[[New Catholic Encyclopedia]] | edition=2nd | volume=2 | publisher=Gale | year=2003 | pages=355–362}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Leningrad Codex]]'', which dates to approximately the same time as the Aleppo codex, has been claimed by Paul E. Kahle to be a product of the ben Asher [[scriptorium]]. However, its [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] says only that it was corrected from manuscripts written by ben Asher; there is no evidence that ben Asher himself ever saw it. However, the same holds true for the Aleppo Codex, which was apparently not vocalized by ben Asher himself, although a later colophon, which was added to the manuscript after his death, attributes the vocalization to him.<ref name=\"ej2-masorah\">{{citation | author=[[Aron Dotan]] | contribution=MASORAH | title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] | edition=2nd | volume=13 | year=2007 | publisher=Gale | pages=603–656}}</ref>\n\nThe Aleppo Codex was the manuscript used by Maimonides when he set down the exact rules for writing scrolls of the [[Torah]], ''Hilkhot [[Sefer Torah]]'' (\"the Laws of the Torah Scroll\") in his ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''.<ref name=codex/> This [[halakha|halachic]] ruling gave the Aleppo Codex the seal of supreme textual authority, albeit only with regard to the type of space preceding sections (''petuhot'' and ''setumot'') and for the manner of the writing of the songs in the Pentateuch.<ref name=\"ej2-masorah\" /> \"The codex which we used in these works is the codex known in [[Egypt]], which includes 24 books, which was in [[Jerusalem]],\" he wrote. [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]] testifies to this being the same codex that was later transferred to Aleppo.{{cn|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Contents==\nWhen the Aleppo Codex was complete (until 1947), it followed the Tiberian textual tradition in the order of its books, similar to the ''[[Leningrad Codex]]'', and which also matches the later tradition of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] biblical manuscripts. The [[Torah]] and the [[Nevi'im]] appear in the same order found in most printed Hebrew Bibles, but the order for the books for [[Ketuvim]] differs markedly. In the Aleppo Codex, the order of the Ketuvim is [[Books of Chronicles]], [[Psalms]], [[Book of Job]], [[Book of Proverbs]], [[Book of Ruth]], [[Song of Songs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Book of Lamentations]], [[Book of Esther]], [[Book of Daniel]], and [[Book of Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah]].\n\nThe current text is missing all of the [[Torah#Pentateuch|Pentateuch]] to the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 28.17; [[Books of Kings|II Kings]] 14.21–18.13; [[Book of Jeremiah]] 29.9–31.33; 32.2–4, 9–11, 21–24; [[Book of Amos]] 8.12–[[Book of Micah]] 5.1; So 3.20–Za 9.17; II Chronicles 26.19–35.7; Book of Psalms 15.1–25.2 (MT enumeration); Song of Songs 3.11 to the end; all of Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, and Ezra-Nehemiah.<ref name=\"nce2-bible\" />\n\n== Modern editions ==\nSeveral complete or partial editions of the [[Tanakh]] based on the Aleppo Codex have been published over the past three decades in Israel, some of them under the academic auspices of Israeli universities. These editions incorporate reconstructions of the missing parts of the codex based on the methodology of [[Mordechai Breuer]] or similar systems, and by taking into account all available historical testimony about the contents of the codex.\n\n'''Complete Tanakh:'''\nThese are complete editions of the [[Tanakh]], usually in one volume (but sometimes also sold in three volumes).
