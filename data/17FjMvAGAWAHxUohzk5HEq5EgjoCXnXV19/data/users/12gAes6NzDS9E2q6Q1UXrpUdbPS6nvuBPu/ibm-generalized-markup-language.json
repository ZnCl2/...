SCRIPT/VS is the main component of IBM's Document Composition Facility (DCF). A ''starter set'' of tags in GML is provided with the DCF product. \n==Characteristics==\nGML was developed in 1969 and the early 1970s by [[Charles Goldfarb]], [[Edward Mosher]] and [[Raymond Lorie]] (whose surname initials were used by Goldfarb to make up the term GML).<ref name=\"TheRootsOfSgml\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sgmlsource.com/history/roots.htm|year=1996|title=The Roots of SGML - A Personal Recollection|author=Charles F. Goldfarb|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>\n\nUsing GML, a document is [[Markup (computing)|marked up]] with tags that define what the [[Character (computing)|text]] is, in terms of [[paragraph]]s, [[Page header|header]]s, [[List (composition)|list]]s, [[Table (information)#Tables as features offered by application programs|table]]s, and so forth. The document can then be automatically formatted for various [[Peripheral device|device]]s simply by specifying a profile for the device. For example, it is possible to format a document for a [[laser printer]] or a line ([[dot-matrix printer|dot matrix]]) printer or for a screen simply by specifying a profile for the device without changing the document itself.\n\nThe [[Standard Generalized Markup Language]] (SGML), an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]-standard technology for defining generalized [[markup language]]s for documents, is descended from GML.<ref name=\"TheRootsOfSgml\"/> The [[XML|Extensible Markup Language]] (XML) was initially a streamlined and simplified development of SGML, but has outgrown its parent in terms of worldwide acceptance and support.\n\n==Related programs==\nIn the early 1980s, IBM developed a dedicated publishing tool called Information Structure Identification Language (ISIL) based on GML. ISIL was used to generate much of IBM documentation for the IBM PC and other products at this time. In the late 1980s, a commercial product called BookMaster was developed, based mostly on ISIL.  \n\nDuring the early 1980s, Don Williams at IBM developed DWScript to use the SCRIPT/VS on the IBM PC.<ref>DWScript - Document Composition Facility for the IBM Personal Computer Version 4.6 Updates, DW-04167, Nov 8th, 1985</ref> In 1986, he developed a PC version of ISIL called DWISIL.  These products were used only internally at IBM.\n\n==See also==\n* [[HyperText Markup Language]]\n* [[Standard Generalized Markup Language]]\n* [[XML]]\n* [[SCRIPT (markup)]]\n* [[Information Presentation Facility]] - a descendant of GML and was used by [[IBM]] to write [[OS/2]]'s electronic books and online help.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://publibfp.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr/BOOKS/dsm04m00/CCONTENTS GML Starter Set User's Guide]\n* [http://publibfp.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr/BOOKS/dsm05m00/CCONTENTS GML Starter Set Reference]\n\n[[Category:Markup languages]]\n[[Category:IBM software|Generalized Markup Language]]",
