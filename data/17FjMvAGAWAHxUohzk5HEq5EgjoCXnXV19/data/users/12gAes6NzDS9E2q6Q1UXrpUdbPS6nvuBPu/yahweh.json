over time Baal became the dominant Canaanite deity, so that El became the executive power and Baal the military power in the cosmos.{{sfn|Coogan|Smith|2012|p=7–8}} Baal's sphere was the thunderstorm with its life-giving rains, so that he was also a fertility god, although not quite ''the'' fertility god.{{sfn|Handy|1994|p=101}} Below the seventy second-tier gods was a third tier made up of comparatively minor craftsman and trader deities, with a fourth and final tier of divine messengers and the like.{{sfn|Hess|2007|p=103}} El and his sons made up the Assembly of the Gods, each member of which had a human nation under his care, and a textual variant of [[Deuteronomy]] 32:8–9 describes El dividing the nations of the world among his sons, with Yahweh receiving Israel:{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=32}}\n\n<blockquote>When the Most High (''’elyôn'') gave to the nations their inheritance,<br> when he separated humanity,<br>he fixed the boundaries of the peoples<br>according to the number of divine beings.<br>For Yahweh's portion is his people,<br>Jacob his allotted heritage.<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Deut\">For the varying texts of this verse, see Smith, 2010, pp.139–140 and also chapter 4.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Israelites initially worshipped Yahweh alongside a variety of Canaanite gods and goddesses, including El, Asherah and Baal.{{sfn|Smith|2002|page=7}} In the period of the [[Biblical Judges|Judges]] and the first half of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|monarchy]], El and Yahweh became [[conflation|conflated]] in a process of religious [[syncretism]].{{sfn|Smith|2002|page=8}} As a result, ''’el'' ({{lang-he-n|אל}}) became a generic term meaning \"god\", as opposed to the name of a worshipped deity, and epithets such as [[El Shaddai]] came to be applied to Yahweh alone, diminishing the worship of El and strengthening the position of Yahweh.{{sfn|Smith|2002|page=33-34}} Features of Baal, El and Asherah were absorbed into the Yahweh religion, Asherah possibly becoming embodied in the feminine aspects of the [[Shekinah]] or divine presence, and Baal's nature as a storm and weather god becoming assimilated into Yahweh's own identification with the storm.{{sfn|Smith|2002|page=8,135}} In the next stage the Yahweh religion separated itself from its Canaanite heritage, first by rejecting Baal-worship in the 9th century, then through the 8th to 6th centuries with prophetic condemnation of Baal, the ''asherim'', sun-worship, worship on the \"high places\", practices pertaining to the dead, and other matters.{{sfn|Smith|2002|page=9}}\n\nIn the earliest literature such as the [[Song of the Sea]] (Exodus 15:1–18, celebrating Yahweh's victory over Egypt at [[the exodus]]), Yahweh is a warrior for his people, a storm-god typical of ancient Near Eastern myths, marching out from a region to the south or south-east of Israel with the heavenly host of stars and planets that make up his army.{{sfn|Hackett|2001|p=158–159}} Israel's battles are Yahweh's battles, Israel's victories are his victories, and while other peoples have other gods, Israel's god is Yahweh, who will procure a fertile resting-place for them:{{sfn|Hackett|2001|p=160}}\n\n<blockquote>There is none like God, O Jeshurun (i.e., Israel)<br>who rides through the heavens to your help ...<br>he subdues the ancient gods, shatters the forces of old ...<br>so Israel lives in safety, untroubled is Jacob's abode ...<br>Your enemies shall come fawning to you,<br>and you shall tread on their backs.

This is not to say that he was not represented in some symbolic form, and early Israelite worship probably focused on standing stones, but according to the Biblical texts the temple in Jerusalem featured Yahweh's throne in the form of two cherubim, their inner wings forming the seat and a box (the [[Ark of the Covenant]]) as a footstool, while the throne itself was empty.{{sfn|Mettinger|2006|pp=288–90}} No satisfactory explanation of Israelite aniconism has been advanced, and a number of recent scholars have argued that Yahweh was in fact represented prior to the reforms of [[Hezekiah]] and [[Josiah]] late in the monarchic period: to quote one recent study, \"[a]n early aniconism, ''de facto'' or otherwise, is purely a projection of the [[Second Temple Judaism|post-exilic]] imagination\" (MacDonald, 2007).{{sfn|MacDonald|2007|pp=21, 26–27}}\n\n==Yahweh and the rise of monotheism==\n[[File:Ajrud.jpg|thumb|300px|Image on a [[pithos]] [[sherd]] found at [[Kuntillet Ajrud]] below the inscription \"Yahweh and his Asherah\".{{sfn|Vriezen|van der Woude|2005|page=18}} The two standing figures are sometimes seen as a representation of the divine couple, while the seated lyre-player behind them is an entertainer.{{sfn|Hess|2012|page=472}} Alternatively, many art historians identify the standing figures as representations of the Egyptian dwarf-god [[Bes]], on account of their distinctively bovine faces.{{sfn|Hess|2012|page=472}} [[Ziony Zevit]] has argued that Yahweh was represented as a Bes-figure, though there is little evidence for this.{{sfn|Hess|2012|page=472}} It is also possible that the images on the pot have nothing to do with the inscription at all.{{sfn|Hess|2012|page=472}}]]\n\nPre-exilic Israel, like its neighbours, was [[polytheism|polytheistic]],{{sfn|Albertz|1994|p=61}} and Israelite [[monotheism]] was the result of unique historical circumstances.{{sfn|Gnuse|1997|p=214}} The original god of Israel was El, as the name demonstrates—its probable meaning is \"may El rule\" or some other sentence-form involving the name of El.{{sfn|Romer|2014|p=unpaginated}} In the early tribal period, each tribe would have had its own [[tutelary deity|patron god]]; when kingship emerged, the state promoted Yahweh as the [[national god]] of Israel, supreme over the other gods, and gradually Yahweh absorbed all the positive traits of the other gods and goddesses.{{sfn|Betz|2000|p=917}} Yahweh and El merged at religious centres such as Shechem, Shiloh and Jerusalem,{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=140}} with El's name becoming a generic term for \"god\" and Yahweh, the national god, appropriating many of the older supreme god's titles such as [[El Shaddai]] (Almighty) and [[Elyon]] (Most High).{{sfn|Smith|2002|pp=33, 47}}\n\n[[Asherah]], formerly the wife of El, was worshipped as Yahweh's consort{{sfn|Niehr|1995|pp=54, 57}} or mother;{{sfn|Barker|2012|pages=80–86}} potsherds discovered at Khirbet el-Kôm and Kuntillet Ajrûd make reference to \"Yahweh and his Asherah\",{{sfn|Vriezen|van der Woude|2005|pages=17–18}}{{sfn|Barker|2012|page=32}} and various biblical passages indicate that her statues were kept in his temples in Jerusalem, Bethel, and Samaria.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|p=395}}{{sfn|Barker|2012|pages=154–157}} Yahweh may also have appropriated [[Anat]], the wife of Baal, as his consort, as Anat-Yahu (\"Anat of Yahu,\" i.e., Yahweh) is mentioned in 5th century BCE records from the [[Jews|Jewish]] colony at [[Elephantine]] in Egypt.{{sfn|Day|2002|p=143}} A goddess called the [[Queen of heaven (antiquity)#Hebrew Bible references|Queen of Heaven]] was also worshipped, probably a fusion of [[Astarte]] and the Mesopotamian goddess [[Ishtar]],{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|p=395}} possibly a title of Asherah.{{sfn|Barker|2012|page=41}} Worship of Baal and Yahweh coexisted in the early period of Israel's history, but they were considered irreconcilable after the 9th century BCE, following the efforts of King [[Ahab]] and his queen [[Jezebel]] to elevate Baal to the status of national god,{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=47}} although the cult of Baal did continue for some time.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=74}}\n   \nThe worship of Yahweh alone began at the earliest with [[Elijah]] in the 9th century BCE, but more likely with the prophet [[Hosea]] in the 8th; even then it remained the concern of a small party before gaining ascendancy in the exilic and early [[Second Temple Judaism|post-exilic period]].{{sfn|Albertz|1994|p=61}} The early supporters of this faction are widely regarded as being [[monolatrism|monolatrists]] rather than true [[monotheists]];{{snf|Eakin|1971|pages=70 and 263}} they did not believe that Yahweh was the only god in existence, but instead believed that he was the only god the people of Israel should worship.{{snf|McKenzie|1990|page=1287}} Finally, in the national crisis of the exile, the followers of Yahweh went a step further and outright denied that the other deities aside from Yahweh even existed, thus marking the transition from monolatrism to true monotheism.{{sfn|Betz|2000|p=917}}\n\n==Second Temple Judaism==\n[[File:Jerus-n4i.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|Modern reconstruction of what the [[Second Temple]] of Yahweh would have looked like after its renovation during the reign of [[Herod the Great|Herod I]]]]\n{{main|Second Temple Judaism}}\nIn 539 BCE Babylon itself fell to the Persian conqueror [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], and in 538 BCE the exiles were permitted to return to [[Yehud medinata]], as the Persian province of Judah was known.{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxii}} The Temple is commonly said to have been rebuilt in the period 520–515 BCE, but it seems probable that this is an artificial date chosen so that 70 years could be said to have passed between the destruction and the rebuilding, fulfilling a prophecy of [[book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]].{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|p=2–3}}{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxii}}{{sfn|Davies|Rogerson|2005|p=89}}\n\nIn recent decades, it has become increasingly common among scholars to assume that much of the [[Hebrew bible]] was assembled, revised and edited in the 5th century BCE to reflect the realities and challenges of the Persian era.{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxiii}}{{sfn|Berquist|2007|p=3–4}} The returnees had a particular interest in the history of Israel: the written [[Torah]] (the books of [[book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]]), for example, may have existed in various forms during the Monarchy (the period of the [[history of ancient Israel and Judah|kingdoms of Israel and Judah]]), but it was in the Second Temple that it was edited and revised into something like its current form, and the [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]], a new history written at this time, reflects the concerns of the Persian Yehud in its almost-exclusive focus on [[kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and the Temple.{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxiii}}\n\nProphetic works were also of particular interest to the Persian-era authors, with some works being composed at this time (the last ten chapters of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and the books of [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]], [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]], [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] and perhaps [[Book of Joel|Joel]]) and the older prophets edited and reinterpreted. The corpus of [[Wisdom]] books saw the composition of [[Book of Job|Job]], parts of [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], and possibly [[Ecclesiastes]], while the [[book of Psalms]] was possibly given its modern shape and division into five parts at this time (although the collection continued to be revised and expanded well into Hellenistic and even Roman times).{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxiii}}\n\nSecond Temple Judaism was centered not on synagogues, which began to appear only in the 3rd century BCE, and the reading and study of scripture, but on the Temple itself, and on a cycle of continual blood [[sacrifice]] (meaning the sacrifice of live animals). [[Torah]], or ritual law, was also important, and the Temple priests were responsible for teaching it, but the concept of [[scripture]] developed only slowly. While the written Torah (the Pentateuch) and the Prophets were accepted as authoritative by the 1st century CE, beyond this core the different Jewish groups continued to accept different groups of books as authoritative.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|p=40–42}}\n\nDuring the Second Temple period, speaking the name of Yahweh in public became regarded as [[taboo]].{{sfn|Leech|2002|pages=59–60}} When reading from the scriptures, Jews began to substitute the divine name with the word ''adonai'' (אֲדֹנָי‬), meaning \"Lord\".{{sfn|Leech|2002|page=60}} The High Priest was permitted to speak the name once in the Temple during the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]], but at no other time and in no other place.{{sfn|Leech|2002|page=60}} During the [[Hellenistic period]], the scriptures were translated into Greek by the Jews of the [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Egyptian diaspora]].{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=xxvi}} Greek translations of the Hebrew scriptures render both the tetragrammaton and ''adonai'' as ''[[kyrios]]'' (κύριος), meaning \"the Lord\".{{sfn|Leech|2002|page=60}} After the Temple was destroyed in 70 CE, the original pronunciation of the tetragrammaton was forgotten.{{sfn|Leech|2002|page=60}}\n\nThe period of Persian rule saw the development of expectation in a future human king who would rule purified Israel as Yahweh's representative at the end of time–that is, a messiah. The first to mention this were [[Haggai]] and [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], both prophets of the early Persian period. They saw the messiah in [[Zerubbabel]], a descendant of the House of [[David]] who seemed, briefly, to be about to re-establish the ancient royal line, or in Zerubbabel and the first High Priest, Joshua (Zechariah writes of two messiahs, one royal and the other priestly). These early hopes were dashed (Zerubabbel disappeared from the historical record, although the High Priests continued to be descended from Joshua), and thereafter there are merely general references to a Messiah of (meaning descended from) David.{{sfn|Wanke|1984|p=182-183}}{{sfn|Albertz|2003|p=130}} From these ideas, [[Christianity]], [[Rabbinic Judaism]], and [[Islam]] would later emerge.\n\n==Graeco-Roman syncretism==\nYahweh is frequently invoked in Graeco-Roman magical texts dating from the second century BCE to the fifth century CE, most notably in the [[Greek Magical Papyri]],{{sfn|Betz|1996|p=}}  under the names [[Tetragrammaton|Iao]], [[Adonai]], [[Sabaoth]], and [[Elohim|Eloai]].{{sfn|Smith|Cohen|1996b|pp=242–56}} In these texts, he is often mentioned alongside traditional [[List of Greek mythological figures|Graeco-Roman deities]] and also [[List of Egyptian deities|Egyptian deities]].{{sfn|Smith|Cohen|1996b|pp=242–56}} The [[archangels]] [[Michael]], [[Gabriel]], [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], and [[Uriel|Ouriel]] and Jewish cultural heroes such as [[Abraham]], [[Jacob]], and [[Moses]] are also invoked frequently as well.{{sfn|Arnold|1996|p=}} The frequent occurrence of Yahweh's name is probably due to Greek and Roman folk magicians seeking to make their spells more powerful through the invocation of a prestigious foreign deity.{{sfn|Smith|Cohen|1996b|pp=242–256}}\n\n[[Tacitus]], [[John the Lydian]], and [[Cornelius Labeo]] all identify Yahweh with the Greek god [[Dionysus]].{{sfn|McDonough|1999|page=88}} Jews themselves frequently used symbols that were also associated with Dionysus such as [[kylix]]es, [[amphora|amphorae]], leaves of ivy, and clusters of grapes.{{sfn|Smith|Cohen|1996a|page=233}} In his ''[[Moralia|Quaestiones Convivales]]'', the Greek writer [[Plutarch of Chaeronea]] writes that the Jews hail their god with cries of \"Euoi\" and \"Sabi\", phrases associated with the worship of Dionysus.<ref>[[Plutarch]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0312%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D6 ''Quaestiones Convivales'', Question VI]</ref>{{sfn|McDonough|1999|page=89}}{{sfn|Smith|Cohen|1996a|pages=232–233}} According to Sean M.
