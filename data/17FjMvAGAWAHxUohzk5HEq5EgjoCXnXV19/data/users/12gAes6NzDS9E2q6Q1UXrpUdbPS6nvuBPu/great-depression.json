There are also various [[Heterodox economics|heterodox theories]] that downplay or reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists. The consensus among demand-driven theories is that a large-scale loss of confidence led to a sudden reduction in consumption and investment spending. Once panic and deflation set in, many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets. Holding money became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods, exacerbating the drop in demand. Monetarists believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession, but the shrinking of the money supply greatly exacerbated the economic situation, causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression.\n\nEconomists and economic historians are almost evenly split as to whether the traditional monetary explanation that monetary forces were the primary cause of the Great Depression is right, or the traditional Keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending, particularly investment, is the primary explanation for the onset of the Great Depression.<ref name=\"in JSTOR\">Robert Whaples, ''Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians?

In such a situation, the economy reached equilibrium at low levels of economic activity and high unemployment.\n\nKeynes' basic idea was simple: to keep people fully employed, governments have to run deficits when the economy is slowing, as the private sector would not invest enough to keep production at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession. Keynesian economists called on governments during times of [[Crisis (economic)|economic crisis]] to pick up the slack by increasing [[government spending]] and/or cutting taxes.\n\nAs the Depression wore on, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] tried [[public works]], [[Agricultural subsidy|farm subsidies]], and other devices to restart the U.S. economy, but never completely gave up trying to balance the budget. According to the Keynesians, this improved the economy, but Roosevelt never spent enough to bring the economy out of recession until the start of [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite journal| authorlink=Lawrence Klein|first=Lawrence R.|last=Klein|title=The Keynesian Revolution|year=1947| pages=56–58, 169, 177–79|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->}}; {{Cite book|first=Theodore|last=Rosenof|title=Economics in the Long Run: New Deal Theorists and Their Legacies, 1933–1993|year=1997|location=Chapel Hill|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0-8078-2315-5|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n====Monetarist====\n[[File:Great Depression monetary policy.png|thumb|The Great Depression in the U.S. from a monetary view.

At that time, the amount of credit the Federal Reserve could issue was limited by the [[Federal Reserve Act]], which required 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued. By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit that could be backed by the gold in its possession. This credit was in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes.<ref name=\"text\">Freidel, ''Franklin D. Roosevelt: Launching the New Deal'' (1973) ch 19; [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=14611&st=&st1= text]</ref> A \"promise of gold\" is not as good as \"gold in the hand\", particularly when they only had enough gold to cover 40% of the Federal Reserve Notes outstanding. During the bank panics a portion of those demand notes were redeemed for Federal Reserve gold. Since the Federal Reserve had hit its limit on allowable credit, any reduction in gold in its vaults had to be accompanied by a greater reduction in credit. On April 5, 1933, President Roosevelt signed [[Executive Order 6102]] making the private ownership of [[gold certificate]]s, coins and bullion illegal, reducing the pressure on Federal Reserve gold.<ref name=\"text\"/>\n\n====Common position====\nFrom the point of view of today's mainstream schools of economic thought, government should strive to keep the interconnected macroeconomic aggregates [[money supply]] and/or [[aggregate demand]] on a stable growth path.

Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets.<ref name=\"lhf-30s\"/>\n\nOutstanding debts became heavier, because prices and incomes fell by 20–50% but the debts remained at the same dollar amount. After the panic of 1929, and during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 U.S. banks failed. (In all, 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s). By April 1933, around $7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the [[Emergency Banking Act|March Bank Holiday]].<ref>\"Friedman and Schwartz, Monetary History of the United States\", 352</ref> Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans which the borrowers did not have time or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, [[Investment|capital investment]] and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending.<ref name=\"lhf-30s\"/> Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious cycle]] developed and the downward spiral accelerated.\n\nThe liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices which it caused. The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed, relative to the value of declining asset holdings. The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it. Paradoxically, the more the debtors paid, the more they owed.<ref name=\"Fisher33\"/> This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression.\n\nFisher's debt-deflation theory initially lacked mainstream influence because of the counter-argument that debt-deflation represented no more than a redistribution from one group (debtors) to another (creditors). Pure re-distributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects.\n\nBuilding on both the monetary hypothesis of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]] as well as the debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, [[Ben Bernanke]] developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently leads to lowered [[aggregate demand]], a further decline in the price level then results in a debt deflationary spiral. According to Bernanke, a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions, that in turn leads to a [[credit crunch]] which does serious harm to the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption and results in declining aggregate demand which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.<ref>Randall E.

According to [[Peter Temin]], Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and [[Christina Romer]], the key to recovery and to ending the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. The thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive in March 1933 when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, and investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turn around. Money supply was still falling and short term interest rates remained close to zero. Before March 1933 people expected further deflation and a recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. But when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With these positive expectations, interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crises and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free fall in 1933, and output would have been 30% lower in 1937 than in 1933.<ref>Gauti B.

In their view, much like the monetarists, the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] (of which was created in 1913) shoulders much of the blame; however unlike the [[Monetarism|Monetarists]], they argue that the key cause of the Depression was the expansion of the [[money supply]] in the 1920s, of which led to an unsustainable credit-driven boom.<ref name=\"America's Great Depression, pp. 159-163\">Murray Rothbard, ''America's Great Depression'' (Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2000), pp. 159–163.</ref>\n\nIn the Austrian view it was this inflation of the money supply that led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices (stocks and bonds) and [[capital goods]]. Therefore, by the time the Federal Reserve tightened in 1928 it was far too late to prevent an economic contraction.<ref name=\"America's Great Depression, pp. 159-163\" /> In February 1929 [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] published a paper predicting the Federal Reserve's actions would lead to a crisis starting in the [[Stock market|stock]] and [[Credit market|credit]] markets.<ref>Herman, Arthur, ''The Cave and the Light: Plato versus Aristotle, and the Struggle for the Soul of Western Civilization'', p. 548 (Kindle location 10208).</ref>\n\nAccording to Rothbard, the government support for failed enterprises and efforts to keep wages above their market values actually prolonged the Depression.<ref>Rothbard, ''America's Great Depression'', pp. 19–21.</ref> Unlike [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]], after 1970 [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] believed that the Federal Reserve had further contributed to the problems of the Depression by permitting the money supply to shrink during the earliest years of the Depression.<ref>For Hayek's view, see Diego Pizano, ''Conversations with Great Economists: Friedrich A.

The spectacular crash of 1929 followed five years of reckless credit expansion by the Federal Reserve System under the [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge Administration]]. The passing of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], the passage of [[The Federal Reserve Act]], rising government deficits, the passage of the [[Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act]], and the [[Revenue Act of 1932]], exacerbated and prolonged the crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fee.org/articles/the-great-depression/|title=The Great Depression|accessdate=October 23, 2016|work=[[Foundation for Economic Education]]|first=Hans|last=Sennholz|date=October 1, 1969}}</ref>\n\n[[Ludwig von Mises]] wrote in the 1930s: \"Credit expansion cannot increase the supply of real goods. It merely brings about a rearrangement. It diverts capital investment away from the course prescribed by the state of economic wealth and market conditions. It causes production to pursue paths which it would not follow unless the economy were to acquire an increase in material goods. As a result, the upswing lacks a solid base. It is not a real prosperity. It is illusory prosperity. It did not develop from an increase in economic wealth, i.e. the accumulation of savings made available for productive investment. Rather, it arose because the credit expansion created the illusion of such an increase. Sooner or later, it must become apparent that this economic situation is built on sand.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/causes-economic-crisis-and-other-essays-and-after-great-depression|title=The Causes of the Economic Crisis, and Other Essays Before and After the Great Depression|accessdate=October 24, 2016|work=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|first=Ludwig|last=Mises}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/buying-bad-debt-to-return-bank-solvency-2011-2?op=1|title=Buying Bad Debt to Return Bank Solvency|accessdate=October 24, 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|first=Bill|last=Bonner|date=February 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Inequality====\n[[File:Tenantless farm Texas panhandle 1938.jpg|thumb|[[Mechanised agriculture|Power farming]] displaces tenants from the land in the western dry cotton area.

Wallace]], [[Paul Douglas]], and [[Marriner Eccles]]. It held the economy produced more than it consumed, because the consumers did not have enough income.

The proposed solution was for the government to pump money into the consumers' pockets. That is, it must redistribute purchasing power, maintaining the industrial base, and re-inflating prices and wages to force as much of the inflationary increase in purchasing power into [[consumer spending]]. The economy was overbuilt, and new factories were not needed.

Great Britain was the first to do so. Facing [[speculative attack]]s on the [[pound sterling|pound]] and depleting [[Official gold reserves|gold reserves]], in September 1931 the [[Bank of England]] ceased exchanging pound notes for gold and the pound was floated on foreign exchange markets.\n\nGreat Britain, Japan, and the Scandinavian countries left the gold standard in 1931. Other countries, such as Italy and the U.S., remained on the gold standard into 1932 or 1933, while a few countries in the so-called \"gold bloc\", led by France and including Poland, Belgium and Switzerland, stayed on the standard until 1935–36.\n\nAccording to later analysis, the earliness with which a country left the gold standard reliably predicted its economic recovery. For example, Great Britain and Scandinavia, which left the gold standard in 1931, recovered much earlier than France and Belgium, which remained on gold much longer. Countries such as China, which had a [[silver standard]], almost avoided the depression entirely. The connection between leaving the gold standard as a strong predictor of that country's severity of its depression and the length of time of its recovery has been shown to be consistent for dozens of countries, including [[Developing country|developing countries]].

In dollar terms, American exports declined over the next four (4) years from about $5.2 billion in 1929 to $1.7 billion in 1933; so, not only did the physical volume of exports fall, but also the prices fell by about 1/3 as written. Hardest hit were farm commodities such as wheat, cotton, tobacco, and lumber.\n\nGovernments around the world took various steps into spending less money on foreign goods such as: \"imposing tariffs, import quotas, and exchange controls\". These restrictions formed a lot of tension between trade nations, causing a major deduction during the depression. Not all countries enforced the same measures of protectionism. Some countries raised tariffs drastically and enforced severe restrictions on foreign exchange transactions, while other countries condensed \"trade and exchange restrictions only marginally\":<ref name=\"Eichengreen\">EICHENGREEN, B., & IRWIN, D.

Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England. The funding only slowed the process; it's nothing. Industrial failures began in Germany, a major bank closed in July and a two-day holiday for all German banks was declared. Business failures more frequent in July, and spread to Romania and Hungary.

Total [[Measures of national income and output|national income]] fell to 56% of the 1929 level, again worse than any nation apart from the United States.

Chile initially felt the impact of the Great Depression in 1930, when GDP dropped 14%, mining income declined 27%, and export earnings fell 28%. By 1932, GDP had shrunk to less than half of what it had been in 1929, exacting a terrible toll in unemployment and business failures.\n\nInfluenced profoundly by the Great Depression, many national leaders promoted the development of local industry in an effort to insulate the economy from future external shocks. After six years of government [[Austerity|austerity measures]], which succeeded in reestablishing Chile's creditworthiness, Chileans elected to office during the 1938–58 period a succession of center and left-of-center governments interested in promoting economic growth by means of government intervention.\n\nPrompted in part by the devastating [[1939 Chillán earthquake]], the [[Popular Front (Chile)|Popular Front]] government of [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]] created the Production Development Corporation (Corporación de Fomento de la Producción, [[CORFO]]) to encourage with subsidies and direct investments an ambitious program of [[import substitution industrialization]]. Consequently, as in other Latin American countries, [[protectionism]] became an entrenched aspect of the Chilean economy.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Nanjing Decade}}\nChina was largely unaffected by the Depression, mainly by having stuck to the [[Silver standard]]. However, the U.S. silver purchase act of 1934 created an intolerable demand on China's silver coins, and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in 1935 in favor of the four Chinese national banks' \"legal note\" issues. China and the British colony of Hong Kong, which followed suit in this regard in September 1935, would be the last to abandon the silver standard. In addition, the [[Nationalist Government]] also acted energetically to modernize the legal and penal systems, stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in narcotics and augment industrial and agricultural production. On November 3, 1935, the government instituted the fiat currency (fapi) reform, immediately stabilizing prices and also raising revenues for the government.\n\n===France===\n{{Main|Great Depression in France}}\nThe crisis affected France a bit later than other countries, hitting hard around 1931.<ref>Henry Laufenburger, \"France and the Depression,\" ''International Affairs'' (1936) 15#2 pp. 202–224 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2601740 in JSTOR]</ref> While the 1920s grew at the very strong rate of 4.43% per year, the 1930s rate fell to only 0.63%.<ref>Jean-Pierre Dormois, ''The French Economy in the Twentieth Century'' (2004) p 31</ref>\n\nThe depression was relatively mild: unemployment peaked under 5%, the fall in production was at most 20% below the 1929 output; there was no banking crisis.<ref>Paul Beaudry and Franck Portier, \"The French Depression in the 1930s,\" ''Review of Economic Dynamics'' (2002) 5:73–99 doi:10.1006/redy.2001.0143</ref>\n\nHowever, the depression had drastic effects on the local economy, and partly explains the [[February 6, 1934 riots]] and even more the formation of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], led by [[Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière|SFIO socialist leader]] [[Léon Blum]], which won the elections in 1936. Ultra-nationalist groups also saw increased popularity, although democracy prevailed into [[World War II]].\n\nFrance's relatively high degree of self-sufficiency meant the damage was considerably less than in nations like Germany.\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main|Weimar Republic}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-11-19-12, Adolf Hitler bei Ortsgruppenfeier der NSDAP Rosenheim.jpg|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] speaking in 1935]]\nThe Great Depression hit Germany hard. The impact of the [[Wall Street Crash]] forced American banks to end the new loans that had been funding the repayments under the [[Dawes Plan]] and the [[Young Plan]]. The financial crisis escalated out of control and mid-1931, starting with the collapse of the [[Credit Anstalt]] in Vienna in May.<ref name=\"William Ashworth 1962 pp 237-244\"/> This put heavy pressure on Germany, which was already in political turmoil with the rise in violence of Nazi and communist movements, as well as with investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies.<ref name=\"Isabel Schnabel 1931\"/> Investors withdrew their short-term money from Germany, as confidence spiraled downward. The Reichsbank lost 150 million marks in the first week of June, 540 million in the second, and 150 million in two days, June 19–20. Collapse was at hand. U.S. President Herbert Hoover called for a moratorium on Payment of war reparations. This angered Paris, which depended on a steady flow of German payments, but it slowed the crisis down and the moratorium, was agreed to in July 1931. An international conference in London later in July produced no agreements but on August 19 a standstill agreement froze Germany's foreign liabilities for six months. Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England. The funding only slowed the process. Industrial failures began in Germany, a major bank closed in July and a two-day holiday for all German banks was declared. Business failures became more frequent in July, and spread to Romania and Hungary.<ref name=\"V. Hodson, 1938 pp. 64-76\"/>\n\nIn 1932, 90% of German reparation payments were cancelled. (In the 1950s, Germany repaid all its missed reparations debts.) Widespread unemployment reached 25% as every sector was hurt. The government did not increase government spending to deal with Germany's growing crisis, as they were afraid that a high-spending policy could lead to a return of the [[hyperinflation]] that had affected Germany in 1923. Germany's [[Weimar Republic]] was hit hard by the depression, as American loans to help rebuild the German economy now stopped.<ref>[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/depression/about.htm About the Great Depression], University of Illinois</ref> The unemployment rate reached nearly 30% in 1932, bolstering support for the Nazi (NSDAP) and Communist (KPD) parties, causing the collapse of the politically centrist Social Democratic Party. Hitler ran for the Presidency in 1932, and while he lost to the incumbent Hindenburg in the election, it marked a point during which both Nazi Party and the Communist parties rose in the years following the crash to altogether possess a Reichstag majority following the [[German election, July 1932|general election in July 1932]].<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/lo/countries/de/de_economic.html Germany – Economic], Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/riseofhitler/runs.htm|title=The History Place – Rise of Hitler: Hitler Runs for President|website=www.historyplace.com|access-date=2016-10-23}}</ref>\n\nHitler followed an [[autarky]] economic policy, creating a network of client states and economic allies in central Europe and Latin America. By cutting wages and taking control of labor unions, plus public works spending, unemployment fell significantly by 1935. Large-scale military spending played a major role in the recovery.<ref>[[Adam Tooze]], ''The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy'' (2007)</ref>\n\n===Greece===\n{{Main|Economic history of Greece and the Greek world}}\nThe reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932. The [[Bank of Greece]] tried to adopt deflationary policies to stave off the crises that were going on in other countries, but these largely failed. For a brief period the drachma was pegged to the U.S. dollar, but this was unsustainable given the country's large trade deficit and the only long-term effects of this were Greece's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932. Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April, 1931. This was especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK, France and the Middle East for many necessities. Greece went off the gold standard in April, 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments. The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas, which a number of European countries did during the time period.\n\nProtectionist policies coupled with a weak drachma, stifling imports, allowed Greek industry to expand during the Great Depression. In 1939, Greek Industrial output was 179% that of 1928. These industries were for the most part \"built on sand\" as one report of the Bank of Greece put it, as without massive protection they would not have been able to survive. Despite the global depression, Greece managed to suffer comparatively little, averaging an average growth rate of 3.5% from 1932 to 1939. The dictatorial regime of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] took over the Greek government in 1936, and economic growth was strong in the years leading up to the Second World War.\n\n===Iceland===\nIcelandic post-World War I prosperity came to an end with the outbreak of the Great Depression. The Depression hit Iceland hard as the value of exports plummeted.

This led to a financial crisis peaking in 1932 and major government intervention. The [[Industrial Reconstruction Institute]] (IRI) was formed in January 1933 and took control of the bank-owned companies, suddenly giving Italy the largest state-owned industrial sector in Europe (excluding the USSR). IRI did rather well with its new responsibilities—restructuring, modernising and rationalising as much as it could. It was a significant factor in post-1945 development. But it took the Italian economy until 1935 to recover the manufacturing levels of 1930—a position that was only 60% better than that of 1913.<ref>Fabrizio Mattesini, and Beniamino Quintieri. \"Italy and the Great Depression: An analysis of the Italian economy, 1929–1936.\" ''Explorations in Economic History'' (1997) 34#3 pp: 265–294.</ref><ref>Fabrizio Mattesini and Beniamino Quintieri. \"Does a reduction in the length of the working week reduce unemployment?

The Japanese economy shrank by 8% during 1929–31. Japan's Finance Minister [[Takahashi Korekiyo]] was the first to implement what have come to be identified as [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian economic]] policies: first, by large fiscal stimulus involving [[deficit spending]]; and second, by devaluing [[Yen|the currency]]. Takahashi used the Bank of Japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures. Econometric studies have identified the fiscal stimulus as especially effective.<ref>Myung Soo Cha, \"Did Takahashi Korekiyo Rescue Japan from the Great Depression?\", ''The Journal of Economic History'' 63, No. 1 (March 2003): 127–144.</ref>\n\nThe devaluation of the currency had an immediate effect. Japanese textiles began to displace British textiles in export markets. The deficit spending proved to be most profound and went into the purchase of munitions for the armed forces. By 1933, Japan was already out of the depression. By 1934, Takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating, and to avoid inflation, moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions.\n\nThis resulted in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists, especially those in the army, culminating in his assassination in the course of the [[February 26 Incident]]. This had a [[chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on all civilian bureaucrats in the Japanese government. From 1934, the military's dominance of the government continued to grow. Instead of reducing deficit spending, the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced, but did not eliminate inflation, which remained a problem until the end of World War&nbsp;II.\n\nThe deficit spending had a transformative effect on Japan. Japan's industrial production doubled during the 1930s. Further, in 1929 the list of the largest firms in Japan was dominated by light industries, especially textile companies (many of Japan's automakers, such as [[Toyota]], have their roots in the textile industry). By 1940 [[light industry]] had been displaced by heavy industry as the largest firms inside the Japanese economy.<ref>(For more on the Japanese economy in the 1930s see \"MITI and the Japanese Miracle\" by [[Chalmers Johnson]])</ref>\n\n===Latin America===\n{{Main|Great Depression in Latin America}}\nBecause of high levels of U.S. investment in Latin American economies, they were severely damaged by the Depression. Within the region, [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]] were particularly badly affected.<ref>Rosemary Thorp, ''Latin America in the 1930s: the role of the periphery in world crisis'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2000).</ref>\n\nBefore the 1929 crisis, links between the world economy and [[Latin America]]n economies had been established through American and British investment in Latin American exports to the world. As a result, Latin Americans export industries felt the depression quickly. World prices for commodities such as wheat, coffee and copper plunged. Exports from all of Latin America to the U.S. fell in value from $1.2 billion in 1929 to $335 million in 1933, rising to $660 million in 1940.\n\nBut on the other hand, the depression led the area governments to develop new local industries and expand consumption and production. Following the example of the New Deal, governments in the area approved regulations and created or improved welfare institutions that helped millions of new industrial workers to achieve a better standard of living.\n\n===Netherlands===\n{{Main|Great Depression in the Netherlands}}\n\nFrom roughly 1931 to 1937, the [[The Netherlands|Netherlands]] suffered a deep and exceptionally long depression. This depression was partly caused by the after-effects of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 in the U.S., and partly by internal factors in the Netherlands. Government policy, especially the very late dropping of the Gold Standard, played a role in prolonging the depression. The Great Depression in the Netherlands led to some political instability and riots, and can be linked to the rise of the Dutch national-socialist party [[Nationaal Socialistische Beweging|NSB]]. The depression in the Netherlands eased off somewhat at the end of 1936, when the government finally dropped the Gold Standard, but real economic stability did not return until after World War II.<ref>E. H. Kossmann, ''The Low Countries: 1780–1940'' (1978).</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|History of New Zealand#Great Depression}}\n[[New Zealand]] was especially vulnerable to worldwide depression, as it relied almost entirely on agricultural exports to the United Kingdom for its economy. The drop in exports led to a lack of disposable income from the farmers, who were the mainstay of the local economy. Jobs disappeared and wages plummeted, leaving people desperate and charities unable to cope. Work relief schemes were the only government support available to the unemployed, the rate of which by the early 1930s was officially around 15%, but unofficially nearly twice that level (official figures excluded Māori and women). In 1932, riots occurred among the unemployed in three of the country's main cities ([[Auckland]], [[Dunedin]], and [[Wellington]]). Many were arrested or injured through the tough official handling of these riots by police and volunteer \"special constables\".<ref>\"[http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/whatson/exhibitions/sliceofheaven/exhibition/SocialWelfare/Pages/Greatdepression.aspx Social Welfare and The State: Great Depression]\", [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].</ref>\n\n===Portugal===\n{{Main|Economic history of Portugal}}\n\nAlready under the rule of a dictatorial junta, the [[Ditadura Nacional]], Portugal suffered no turbulent political effects of the Depression, although [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], already appointed Minister of Finance in 1928 greatly expanded his powers and in 1932 rose to [[Prime Minister of Portugal]] to found the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], an [[authoritarian]] [[corporatist]] dictatorship. With the budget balanced in 1929, the effects of the depression were relaxed through harsh measures towards [[budget balance]] and [[autarky]], causing social discontent but stability and, eventually, an impressive economic growth.<ref>José Cardozo, \"The great depression and Portugal\"  in  Michael Psalidopoulos, ed., ''The Great Depression in Europe: Economic Thought and Policy in a National Context'' (Athens: Alpha Bank, 2012), {{ISBN|9789609979368}}. pp. 361–94 [http://www.ics.ul.pt/rdonweb-docs/ICS_JLCardoso_Great_AI.pdf Online]</ref>\n\n===Puerto Rico===\nIn the years immediately preceding the depression, negative developments in the island and world economies perpetuated an unsustainable cycle of subsistence for many Puerto Rican workers. The 1920s brought a dramatic drop in Puerto Rico’s two primary exports, raw sugar and coffee, due to a devastating hurricane in 1928 and the plummeting demand from global markets in the latter half of the decade. 1930 unemployment on the island was roughly 36% and by 1933 Puerto Rico’s per capita income dropped 30% (by comparison, unemployment in the United States in 1930 was approximately 8% reaching a height of 25% in 1933).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A New Deal for the Tropics|last=Rodriguez|first=Manuel|publisher=Markus Wiener|year=2011|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://herb.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/1510|title=Graph of U.S. Unemployment Rate: 1930–1945|last=|first=|date=|website=American Social History Project|access-date=April 19, 2017}}</ref> To provide relief and economic reform, the United States government and Puerto Rican politicians such as [[Carlos E.

The [[Carnegie Commission of Investigation on the Poor White Question in South Africa|Carnegie Commission on Poor Whites]] had concluded in 1931 that nearly one third of [[Afrikaner]]s lived as paupers. The social discomfort caused by the depression was a contributing factor in the 1933 split between the \"gesuiwerde\" (purified) and \"smelter\" (fusionist) factions within the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] and the National Party's subsequent fusion with the [[South African Party]].<ref>Dan O'Meara, ''Volkskapitalisme: class, capital, and ideology in the development of Afrikaner nationalism, 1934–1948'' (Cambridge University Press, 1983).</ref><ref>[http://www.country-studies.com/south-africa/the-great-depression-and-the-1930s.html The Great Depression and the 1930S], Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress.</ref>  Unemployment programs were begun that focused primarily on the white population.<ref>Anthony Minnaar,  \"Unemployment and relief measures during the Great Depression (1929-1934).\" ''Kleio'' 26.1 (1994): 45-85.</ref>\n\n===Soviet Union===\nThe Soviet Union was the world's sole [[communist state]] with very little international trade. Its economy was not tied to the rest of the world and was only slightly affected by the Great Depression.<ref>Robert William Davies, Mark Harrison, and Stephen G. Wheatcroft, eds. ''The economic transformation of the Soviet Union, 1913–1945'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994)</ref> Its forced transformation from a rural to an industrial society succeeded in building up heavy industry, at the cost of millions of lives in rural Russia and Ukraine.<ref>Robert Conquest, ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine'' (1987).</ref>\n\nAt the time of the Depression, the Soviet economy was growing steadily, fuelled by intensive investment in heavy industry. The apparent economic success of the Soviet Union at a time when the capitalist world was in crisis led many Western intellectuals to view the Soviet system favorably. Jennifer Burns wrote:\n{{quote|As the Great Depression ground on and unemployment soared, intellectuals began unfavorably comparing their faltering capitalist economy to Russian Communism. ... More than ten years after the Revolution, Communism was finally reaching full flower, according to ''New York Times'' reporter [[Walter Duranty]], a Stalin fan who vigorously debunked accounts of the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933|Ukraine famine]], a man-made disaster that would leave millions dead.\"<ref>Jennifer Burns (2009).

Soviet Russia was at first happy to help these immigrants settle, because they believed they were victims of capitalism who had come to help the Soviet cause. However, when the Soviet Union entered the war in 1941, most of these Germans and Finns were arrested and sent to Siberia, while their Russian-born children were placed in orphanages. Their fate is unknown.<ref>http://www.genealogia.fi/emi/art/article237e.htm</ref>\n\n===Spain===\n{{Main|Economic history of Spain}}\nSpain had a relatively isolated economy, with high protective tariffs and was not one of the main countries affected by the Depression. The banking system held up well, as did agriculture.<ref>Gabriel Tortella and Jordi Palafox, \"Banking and Industry in Spain 1918–1936,\" ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1984), 13#2 Special Issue, pp. 81–110.</ref>\n\nBy far the most serious negative impact came after 1936 from the heavy destruction of infrastructure and manpower by the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war, 1936–39]]. Many talented workers were forced into permanent exile. By staying neutral in the Second World War, and selling to both sides, the economy avoided further disasters.<ref>R. J. Harrison, ''Economic History of Modern Spain'' (1978), pp. 129–49.</ref>\n\n===Sweden===\n{{Main|Economy of Sweden}}\nBy the 1930s, Sweden had what America's ''Life magazine'' called in 1938 the \"world's highest standard of living\". Sweden was also the first country worldwide to recover completely from the Great Depression. Taking place in the midst of a short-lived government and a less-than-a-decade old Swedish democracy, events such as those surrounding [[Ivar Kreuger]] (who eventually committed suicide) remain infamous in Swedish history. The [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] under [[Per Albin Hansson]] formed their first long-lived government in 1932 based on strong [[Interventionism (economics)|interventionist]] and [[welfare state]] policies, monopolizing the office of [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] until 1976 with the sole and short-lived exception of [[Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp]]'s \"summer cabinet\" in 1936. During forty years of hegemony, it was the most successful political party in the history of Western liberal democracy.<ref>[[Göran Therborn]], \"A Unique Chapter in the History of Democracy: The Swedish Social Democrats\", in K. Misgeld et al (eds), ''Creating Social Democracy'', University Park Pa., Penn State University Press, 1996.</ref>\n\n===Thailand===\nIn Thailand, then known as the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]], the Great Depression contributed to the end of the [[Prajadhipok#Last absolute monarch|absolute monarchy of King Rama VII]] in the [[Siamese revolution of 1932]].\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Main|Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Interwar Britain}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10246, England, Arbeitslose vor Gewerkschaftshaus.jpg|thumb|right|Unemployed people in front of a workhouse in London, 1930]]\nThe World Depression broke at a time when the United Kingdom had still not fully recovered from the effects of the [[World War I|First World War]] more than a decade earlier. The country was driven off the [[gold standard]] in 1931.\n\nThe world financial crisis began to overwhelm Britain in 1931; investors across the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of £2½ millions a day.<ref name=\"David Williams 1963\"/> Credits of £25 millions each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of £15 millions fiduciary note slowed, but did not reverse the British crisis. The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931. With deficits mounting, the bankers demanded a balanced budget; the divided cabinet of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government agreed; it proposed to raise taxes, cut spending and most controversially, to cut unemployment benefits by 20%. The attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the Labour movement. MacDonald wanted to resign, but King George V insisted he remain and form an all-party coalition \"[[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]]\". The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on, along with a small cadre of Labour, but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government. Britain went off the gold standard, and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression. In the 1931 British election, the Labour Party was virtually destroyed, leaving MacDonald as Prime Minister for a largely Conservative coalition.<ref>Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the wars, 1918–1940'' (1955) pp 386–412.</ref><ref name=\"John Oxborrow 1976 pp 67-73\"/>\n\nThe effects on the northern industrial areas of Britain were immediate and devastating, as demand for traditional industrial products collapsed. By the end of 1930 unemployment had more than doubled from 1 million to 2.5 million (20% of the insured workforce), and exports had fallen in value by 50%. In 1933, 30% of [[Glasgow|Glaswegians]] were unemployed due to the severe decline in heavy industry. In some towns and cities in the north east, unemployment reached as high as 70% as shipbuilding fell by 90%.<ref>[http://www.thegreatdepression.co.uk/unemployment-during-the-great-depression/ Unemployment During The Great Depression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124124118/http://thegreatdepression.co.uk/unemployment-during-the-great-depression |date=2009-01-24 }}, thegreatdepression.co.uk</ref> The [[National Hunger March, 1932|National Hunger March]] of September–October 1932 was the largest<ref>Cook, Chris and Bewes, Diccon; ''What Happened Where: A Guide To Places And Events In Twentieth-Century History'' p. 115; Routledge, 1997 {{ISBN|1-85728-533-6}}</ref> of a series of [[hunger marches]] in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s.

The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to $2&nbsp;billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions. But $2&nbsp;billion was not enough to save all the banks, and [[bank run]]s and bank failures continued.<ref name=\"Peter Clemens 1954, p. 114\"/> Quarter by quarter the economy went downhill, as prices, profits and employment fell, leading to the [[Realigning election|political realignment]] in 1932 that brought to power [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]].

From his inauguration onward, Roosevelt argued that restructuring of the economy would be needed to prevent another depression or avoid prolonging the current one. New Deal programs sought to stimulate [[demand]] and provide work and relief for the impoverished through increased government spending and the institution of financial reforms.\n\nDuring a \"bank holiday\" that lasted five days, the [[Emergency Banking Act]] was signed into law. It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under [[United States Department of Treasury|Treasury]] supervision, with federal loans available if needed. The [[Securities Act of 1933]] comprehensively regulated the securities industry. This was followed by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] which created the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. Although amended, key provisions of both Acts are still in force. Federal insurance of [[Deposit account|bank deposits]] was provided by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]], and the [[Glass–Steagall Act]].\n\nThe [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] provided incentives to cut farm production in order to raise farming prices. The [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA) made a number of sweeping changes to the American economy. It forced businesses to work with government to set price codes through the NRA to fight [[deflation]]ary \"cut-throat competition\" by the setting of minimum prices and [[Minimum wage|wages]], labor standards, and competitive conditions in all industries. It encouraged unions that would raise wages, to increase the [[purchasing power]] of the [[working class]]. The NRA [[Schechter v.

Economic stimulus was attempted through a new [[Alphabet agencies|alphabet soup of agencies]] set up in 1933 and 1934 and previously extant agencies such as the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]]. By 1935, the \"[[Second New Deal]]\" added [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] (which was later considerably extended through the [[Fair Deal]]), a jobs program for the unemployed (the [[Works Progress Administration]], WPA) and, through the [[National Labor Relations Board]], a strong stimulus to the growth of labor unions. In 1929, federal expenditures constituted only 3% of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. The national debt as a proportion of GNP rose under Hoover from 20% to 40%. Roosevelt kept it at 40% until the war began, when it soared to 128%.\n\nBy 1936, the main [[economic indicator]]s had regained the levels of the late 1920s, except for unemployment, which remained high at 11%, although this was considerably lower than the 25% unemployment rate seen in 1933. In the spring of 1937, American industrial production exceeded that of 1929 and remained level until June 1937.

[[Keynesianism]] generally remained the most influential economic school in the United States and in parts of Europe until the periods between the 1970s and the 1980s, when [[Milton Friedman]] and other [[neoliberal]] economists formulated and propagated the newly created theories of [[neoliberalism]] and incorporated them into the [[Chicago School of Economics]] as an alternative approach to the study of economics. Neoliberalism went on to challenge the dominance of the Keynesian school of Economics in the mainstream academia and policy-making in the United States, having reached its peak in popularity in the election of the presidency of [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States, and [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>[[Lanny Ebenstein]], ''Milton Friedman: A Biography'' (2007).</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n{{Quote box|quote=And the great owners, who must lose their land in an upheaval, the great owners with access to history, with eyes to read history and to know the great fact: when property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away.

Perhaps the most noteworthy and famous novel written on the subject is ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', published in 1939 and written by [[John Steinbeck]], who was awarded both the [[Nobel Prize]] for literature and the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for the work. The novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers who are forced from their home as drought, economic hardship, and changes in the [[Agriculture|agricultural industry]] occur during the Great Depression. Steinbeck's ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' is another important novella about a journey during the Great Depression. Additionally, Harper Lee's ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' is set during the Great Depression. Margaret Atwood's Booker prize-winning ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' is likewise set in the Great Depression, centering on a privileged socialite's love affair with a Marxist revolutionary. The era spurred the resurgence of social realism, practiced by many who started their writing careers on relief programs, especially the [[Federal Writers' Project]] in the U.S.<ref>David Taylor, ''Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America'' (2009).</ref><ref>Jerre Mangione, ''The Dream and the Deal: The Federal Writers' Project, 1935–1943'' (1996)</ref><ref>Jerrold Hirsch, ''Portrait of America: A Cultural History of the Federal Writers' Project'' (2006)</ref><ref>Stacy I.

Indeed, the first major American economic crisis, the [[Panic of 1819]], was described by then-president [[James Monroe]] as \"a depression\",<ref name=\"hnn\"/> and the most recent economic crisis, the [[Depression of 1920–21]], had been referred to as a \"depression\" by then-president [[Calvin Coolidge]].\n\nFinancial crises were traditionally referred to as \"panics\", most recently the major [[Panic of 1907]], and the minor [[Panic of 1910–11]], though the 1929 crisis was called \"The Crash\", and the term \"panic\" has since fallen out of use. At the time of the Great Depression, the term \"The Great Depression\" was already used to refer to the period 1873–96 (in the United Kingdom), or more narrowly 1873–79 (in the United States), which has retroactively been renamed the [[Long Depression]].<ref>{{Cite journal|first=T.

The previous chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]], [[Ben Bernanke]], had extensively studied the Great Depression as part of his doctoral work at MIT, and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates in ways that were not done in the 1930s. Generally speaking, the recovery of the world's financial systems tended to be quicker during the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the [[late-2000s recession]].\n\n{{quote|<poem>If we contrast the 1930s with the Crash of 2008 where gold went through the roof, it is clear that the U.S. dollar on the gold standard was a completely different animal in comparison to the fiat free-floating U.S. dollar currency we have today. Both currencies in 1929 and 2008 were the U.S. dollar, but in an analogous way it is as if one was a Saber-toothed tiger and the other is a Bengal tiger; they are two completely different animals. Where we have experienced inflation since the Crash of 2008, the situation was much different in the 1930s when deflation set in. Unlike the deflation of the early 1930s, the U.S. economy currently appears to be in a \"liquidity trap,\" or a situation where monetary policy is unable to stimulate an economy back to health.\n\nIn terms of the stock market, nearly three years after the 1929 crash, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|DJIA]] dropped 8.4% on August 12, 1932. Where we have experienced great volatility with large intraday swings in the past two months, in 2011, we have not experienced any record-shattering daily percentage drops to the tune of the 1930s. Where many of us may have that '30s feeling, in light of the DJIA, the CPI, and the national unemployment rate, we are simply not living in the '30s. Some individuals may feel as if we are living in a depression, but for many others the current [[financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]] simply does not feel like a depression akin to the 1930s.<ref>Rabinowitz, Marco (October 6, 2011).
