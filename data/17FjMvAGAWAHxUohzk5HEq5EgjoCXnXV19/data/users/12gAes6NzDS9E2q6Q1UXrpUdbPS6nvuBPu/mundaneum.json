Otlet first called it the Palais Mondial, meaning \"world palace\" in English, and it occupied the left wing of the [[Cinquantenaire|Palais du Cinquantenaire]], a government building in Brussels.<ref>{{cite book|last1=van den Heuvel|first1=Charles|editor1-last=Rayward|editor1-first=W.

Otlet and La Fontaine organized an International Conference of International Associations which was the origin of the [[Union of International Associations]] (UIA).\n\nThe Mundaneum has been identified as a milestone in the history of data collection and management,<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Wolfram | title = Alpha | url = http://www.wolframalpha.com/docs/timeline/computable-knowledge-history-5.html | contribution = Computable knowledge History}}</ref> and (somewhat more tenuously) as a precursor to the internet.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = OUP USA| isbn = 9780199931415| last = Wright| first = Alex| title = Cataloging the World: Paul Otlet and the Birth of the Information Age| location = Oxford ; New York| date = 2014-07-10| pages = 8–15}}</ref>\n\nOtlet regarded the project as the centrepiece of a new 'world city'—a centrepiece which eventually became an [[archive]] with more than 12 million [[index card]]s and documents. Some consider it a forerunner of the [[Internet]] (or, perhaps more appropriately, of systematic knowledge projects such as [[Wikipedia]] and [[WolframAlpha]]) and Otlet himself had dreams that one day, somehow, all the information he collected could be accessed by people from the comfort of their own homes.\n\nAn English pamphlet published in 1914 described it:\n\n{{quote |The International Centre organises collections of world-wide importance. These collections are the International Museum, the International Library, the International Bibliographic Catalogue and the Universal Documentary Archives.  These collections are conceived as parts of one universal body of documentation, as an encyclopedic survey of human knowledge, as an enormous intellectual warehouse of books, documents, catalogues and scientific objects.  Established according to standardised methods, they are formed by assembling cooperative everything that the participating associations may gather or classify. Closely consolidated and coordinated in all of their parts and enriched by duplicates of all private works wherever undertaken, these collections will tend progressively to constitute a permanent and complete representation of the entire world (Union of International Associations, 1914, p. 116).<ref>{{Citation | first = W Boyd | last = Rayward | url = http://people.lis.uiuc.edu/~wrayward/otlet/xanadu.htm | contribution = Visions of Xanadu: Paul Otlet (1868–1944) and Hypertext | title = Jasis | volume = 45 | year = 1994 | pages = 235–50}}.</ref>}}\n\nThe Mundaneum was originally housed at the [[Cinquantenaire Museum|Palais du Cinquantenaire]] in [[Brussels]] (Belgium). Otlet commissioned architect [[Le Corbusier]] to design a Mundaneum project to be built in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] in 1929.  Although never built, the project triggered [[The Mundaneum Affair]], a theoretical argument between Corbusier and Czech critic and architect [[Karel Teige]].\n\nIn 1933, with Otlet's agreement, [[Otto Neurath]] founded the Mundaneum Institute as a branch in [[The Hague]] in 1933,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hegselmann|first=Rainer|article=Introduction|title=Unified Science|date=1987|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|location=Dordrecht}}</ref> which became central to his activities when he moved to the [[Netherlands]] as a refugee following the defeat of the [[Austrian Social Democratic Party]] in the [[Austrian Civil War]]. In 1936 the Mundaneum Institute launched the [[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Neurath|first=Otto|article=An International Encyclopedia of Unified Science (1936)|editor1-last=Cohen|editor1-first=Robert S.|editor2-last=Neurath|editor2-first=Marie|title=Otto Neurath: Philosophical papers 1913-1946|date=1983|publisher=D.
