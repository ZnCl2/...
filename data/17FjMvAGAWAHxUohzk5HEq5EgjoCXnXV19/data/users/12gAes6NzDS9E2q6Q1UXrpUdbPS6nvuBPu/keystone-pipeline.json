These spills could release as much as 180 thousand barrels of oil each.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.desmogblog.com/expert-warns-transcanada-s-keystone-xl-pipeline-assessments-are-misleading|title=Expert Warns That TransCanada's Keystone XL Pipeline Assessments Are Misleading|work=DeSmogBlog}}</ref>\n\nOther items of note in Dr. Stansbury's analysis:\n\n* \"While TransCanada estimates that the Keystone XL will have 11 significant spills (more than 50 barrels of crude oil) over 50 years, a more realistic assessment is 91 significant spills over the pipeline's operational lifetime. TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the {{convert|1,673|mi|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year. (The existing Keystone I pipeline has had one major spill and 11 smaller spills in its first year of operation.)\"\n* \"Analysis of the time needed to shut down the pipeline shows that response to a leak at a river crossing could conservatively take more than ten times longer than the 11 minutes and 30 seconds that TransCanada assumes. (After the June 2010 spill of more than {{convert|800,000|USgal|L}} of crude oil into a tributary of the Kalamazoo River, an Enbridge tar sands pipeline – a {{convert|30|in|mm|adj=on}} pipe compared to the {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} Keystone XL – was not completely shut down for 12 hours.)\"\n* \"Realistic calculations yield worst-case spill estimates of more than {{convert|180000|oilbbl|USgal L}} in the Nebraska Sandhills above the Ogallala Aquifer, more than {{convert|160000|oilbbl|USgal L}} of crude oil at the Yellowstone River crossings, more than {{convert|140000|oilbbl|USgal L}} at the Platte River crossing and more than {{convert|120000|oilbbl|USgal L}} at the Missouri River crossing.\"\n* \"Contaminants from a release at the Missouri or Yellowstone River crossing would enter Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota where they would adversely affect drinking water intakes, aquatic wildlife, and recreation. Contaminants from a spill at the Platte River crossing would travel downstream unabated into the Missouri River for several hundred miles affecting drinking water intakes for hundreds of thousands of people (e.g., Lincoln, NE; Omaha, NE; Nebraska City, NE; St. Joseph, MO; Kansas City, MO) as well as aquatic habitats and recreational activities. In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river.\"\n* \"The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska. The Sandhills are ancient sand dunes that have been stabilized by grasses. Because of their very permeable geology, nearly 100 percent of the annual rainfall infiltrates to a very shallow aquifer, often less than 20 feet below the surface.

In return, due to the [[Petrodollar]] nature of the Canadian currency these same additional revenues will strengthen the [[Canadian dollar]] versus the [[United States dollar]].
