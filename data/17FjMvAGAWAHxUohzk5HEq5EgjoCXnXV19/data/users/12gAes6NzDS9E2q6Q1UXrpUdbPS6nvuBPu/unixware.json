It was originally released by [[Univel]], a jointly owned venture of [[American Telephone & Telegraph|AT&T]]'s [[Unix System Laboratories]] (USL) and [[Novell]]. It was then taken over by Novell. By way of [[Santa Cruz Operation]] (SCO) it went on to [[Caldera Systems]], [[Caldera International]], and [[The SCO Group]] before it was sold to [[UnXis]] (now [[Xinuos]]). UnixWare is typically deployed as a [[Server (computing)|server]] rather than a [[Desktop computer|desktop]]. Binary distributions of UnixWare are available for [[x86 architecture]] computers. UnixWare is primarily marketed as server operating system.<ref>{{ Citation \n| url = http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/unixware/general/\n| title = UnixWare Frequently Asked Questions (General)\n| author = Andrew Josey\n| accessdate = 2008-05-21 }}</ref><ref>{{ Citation \n| url = http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/unixware/developer/\n| title = UnixWare Frequently Asked Questions (Developer)\n| author = Andrew Josey\n| accessdate = 2008-05-21 }}</ref>\n\n== History  ==\n\n=== {{anchor|Univel|1.0.0|Destiny|Personal|Advanced Server}}Univel (1991–1993) ===\n\nAfter the [[SVR4]] effort to merge [[SunOS]] and [[System V]], [[American Telephone & Telegraph|AT&T]]'s [[Unix System Laboratories]] (USL) formed the [[Univel]] partnership with [[Novell]] to develop a desktop version of Unix, codenamed \"Destiny\".<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=Computer Business Review |url=http://www.cbronline.com/news/unix_labs_and_novell_plan_joint_venture_reveal_bones_of_mass_distribution_alliance |title=Unix Labs and Novell plan join venture, reveal bones of mass distribution alliance |date=25 October 1991 |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref>\n\nDestiny was based on the [[System V#SVR4.2|Unix System V release 4.2]] kernel. The [[MoOLIT]] toolkit was used for the [[windowing system]], allowing the user to choose between an [[OPEN LOOK]] or [[Motif (software)|MOTIF]]-like look and feel at run time. In order to make the system more robust on commodity desktop hardware the [[Veritas Software|Veritas]] [[Veritas File System|VXFS]] [[journaling file system]] was used in place of the [[Unix File System|UFS]] file system used in SVR4. Networking support in UnixWare included both [[TCP/IP]] and interoperability with Novell's [[NetWare]] protocols ([[IPX/SPX]]); the former were the standard among Unix users at the time of development, while PC networking was much more commonly based on NetWare.<ref name=\"infoworld\">{{cite news |newspaper=InfoWorld |date=28 June 1993 |first=Alan |last=Radding |title=UnixWare: Bringing shrink-wrapped Unix to the masses |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66 |pages=65–66}}</ref>\n\nDestiny was released in 1992 as UnixWare 1.0, with the intention of unifying the fragmented PC Unix market behind this single variant of the operating system. The system was earlier to reach the corporate computing market than Microsoft's [[Windows NT]], but observers of the period remarked that UnixWare was \"just another flavor of Unix\", Novell's involvement being more a marketing ploy than a significant influx of technology.{{r|infoworld}} The OS existed in two editions: a ''Personal Edition'', which included Novell [[Internetwork Packet Exchange|IPX]] networking but not [[Internet Protocol Suite|TCP/IP]], and an ''Advanced Server'' Edition edition with TCP/IP and other server software.  The personal edition was limited to two active users, while the server edition included an unlimited user license. Around 35,000 copies of UnixWare 1.0 were sold.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://blakeley.com/rooms/my-articles/Unixware.PCW210394.html |title=UnixWare grows up; Novell's revamped SVR4.2 environment proves very workable |first=Michael |last=Blakeley |date=21 March 1994 |newspaper=PC Week}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Novell purchased USL from AT&T and merged USL and Univel into a new [[Unix Systems Group]].<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.cbronline.com/news/novell_formally_announces_the_unix_systems_group |title=Novell formally announces the Unix Systems Group |journal=Computer Business Review |date=7 July 1993 |accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Novell|1.1.0|1.1.1|1.1.2|1.1.3|1.1.4|2.0.0|SuperNOS}}Novell (1993–1995) ===\n\nIn 1994 Novell released UnixWare 1.1, which included TCP/IP in both the personal and advanced server editions.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |url=http://www.cbronline.com/news/novell_releases_version_11_of_unixware_1\n |title=NOVELL RELEASES VERSION 1.1 OF UNIXWARE\n |date=13 January 1994\n |accessdate=2008-10-31\n |publisher=Computergram\n}}\n</ref>\nThe MOTIF 1.2 runtime libraries were included for [[Common Open Software Environment|COSE]] compliance.

This, however, never materialized. Instead, a NetWare 4.10 server on Linux was offered as [[Caldera NetWare for Linux]] for [[OpenLinux]] since 1998, and Novell's [[Open Enterprise Server]] finally came in 2005.\n\n=== {{anchor|SCO|2.1.0|2.1.1|2.1.2|2.1.3|7.0.0|7.0.1|7.1.0|7.1.1|Gemini|Business|Department|Enterprise}}Santa Cruz Operation (1995–2001) ===\n\nIn 1995, the [[Santa Cruz Operation]] (SCO) acquired UnixWare from Novell.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/1995/12/pr95274.html |title=Novell Completes Sale of UnixWare Business to The Santa Cruz Operation |accessdate=2007-07-14 |work= }}</ref> The exact terms of this transaction were disputed (see [[SCO vs Novell]]); courts have subsequently determined that Novell retained the ownership of Unix.\n\nWhen the transfer was made public SCO announced that it would work towards merging UnixWare with its [[OpenServer]] [[System V#SVR3|SVR3.2]] based OS,<ref>\n{{Citation\n |url=http://www.cbronline.com/news/santa_cruz_hp_novell_carve_up_unix_between_them\n |title=SANTA CRUZ, HP, NOVELL CARVE UP UNIX BETWEEN THEM\n |publisher=Computergram\n |date=September 21, 1995\n |access-date=November 1, 2008\n}}\n</ref>\nbut the first release of UnixWare from SCO was version 2.1 in 1996.\nAt the release of UnixWare 2.1 it was announced that the proposed UnixWare/OpenServer merger was known as project '''Gemini''', to be available in 1997 and a 64-bit version of UnixWare was to be developed for 1998.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_Feb_12/ai_17963591\n |title=SCO Unveils Enterprise Class Operating System; Release of SCO UnixWare 2.1 Paves Way for Next-Generation UNIX Systems\n |publisher=Business Wire\n |date=12 February 1996 \n |access-date=November 1, 2008\n}}\n</ref>\n\nOne controversial change was the adoption of an OpenServer like user licensing policy.  The Univel and Novell releases of UnixWare allowed 2 users on the personal edition or unlimited numbers of users on the server edition.
