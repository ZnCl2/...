Jacob's name is changed to Israel, and through the agency of his son [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], the [[children of Israel]] descend into Egypt, 70 people in all with their households, and God promises them a future of greatness. Genesis ends with Israel in Egypt, ready for the coming of [[Moses]] and [[the Exodus]]. The narrative is punctuated by a series of [[Covenant (biblical)|covenants with God]], successively narrowing in scope from all mankind (the [[Noahic Covenant|covenant with Noah]]) to a special relationship with one people alone (Abraham and his descendants through Isaac and Jacob).<ref name=\"Bandstra28-29\"/>\n\nIn [[Judaism]], the theological importance of Genesis centers on the covenants linking [[God in Judaism|God]] to his [[Jews as the chosen people|chosen people]] and the people to the [[Promised Land]]. Christianity has interpreted Genesis as the prefiguration of certain cardinal Christian beliefs, primarily the need for [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] (the hope or [[Assurance (theology)|assurance]] of all Christians) and the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|redemptive act]] of [[Christ]] on the Cross as the [[Supersessionism|fulfillment of covenant promises]] as the [[Son of God]].\n\nTradition credits Moses as the [[Mosaic authorship|author of Genesis]], as well as [[book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus]], [[book of Numbers|Numbers]] and most of [[Book of Deuteronomy]], but modern scholars increasingly see them as a product of the 6th and 5th centuries BC.<ref>Van Seters (1998), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"Davies37\">Davies (1998), p. 37</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\nGenesis appears to be structured around the recurring phrase ''elleh toledot'', meaning \"these are the generations,\" with the first use of the phrase referring to the \"generations of heaven and earth\" and the remainder marking individuals—Noah, the \"sons of Noah\", Shem, etc., down to Jacob.<ref>Hamilton (1990), p. 2</ref> It is not clear, however, what this meant to the original authors, and most modern commentators divide it into two parts based on subject matter, a \"primeval history\" (chapters 1–11) and a \"patriarchal history\" (chapters 12–50).<ref>Whybray (1997), p. 41</ref>{{refn|group=note|The [[Weekly Torah portion]]s, [[Parashah|Parashot]], divide the book into 12 readings.}} While the first is far shorter than the second, it sets out the basic themes and provides an interpretive key for understanding the entire book.<ref>McKeown (2008), p. 2</ref> The \"primeval history\" has a symmetrical structure hinging on chapters 6–9, the flood story, with the events before the flood mirrored by the events after;<ref>Walsh (2001), p. 112</ref> the \"ancestral history\" is structured around the three patriarchs [[Abraham]], [[Jacob]] and [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]].{{sfn|Bergant|2013|p=45}} (The stories of [[Isaac]] do not make up a coherent cycle of stories and function as a bridge between the cycles of Abraham and Jacob).{{sfn|Bergant|2013|p=103}}\n\n== Summary ==\n{{See also|Primeval history|Patriarchal age}}\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 035.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Angel Hinders the Offering of Isaac ([[Rembrandt]], 1635)]]\n[[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] [[Genesis creation narrative|creates the world]] in six days and consecrates the seventh as a [[Biblical Sabbath|day of rest]]. God creates the first [[humans]] [[Adam and Eve]] and all the animals in the [[Garden of Eden]] but instructs them not to eat the fruit of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|tree of knowledge of good and evil]]. A talking [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]]  portrayed as a deceptive creature or [[trickster]], entices Eve into eating it anyway, and she entices Adam, whereupon God throws them out and curses them—Adam to getting what he needs only by sweat and work, and Eve to giving birth in pain. This is interpreted by Christians as [[fall of man|the fall]] of humanity. Eve bears two sons, [[Cain and Abel]]. Cain kills Abel after God accepts Abel's offering but not Cain's. God then [[Curse and mark of Cain|curses Cain]]. Eve bears another son, [[Seth]], to take Abel's place.\n\nAfter many [[generations of Adam]] have passed from the lines of Cain and Seth, the world becomes corrupted by human [[sin]] and [[Nephilim]], and God determines to wipe out humanity. First, he instructs the righteous [[Noah]] and his family to build an [[Noah's ark|ark]] and put examples of all the animals on it, seven pairs of every clean animal and one pair of every unclean. Then God sends a [[Genesis flood narrative|great flood]] to wipe out the rest of the world. When the waters recede, God promises that he will not destroy the world a second time with water with the [[Rainbows in mythology|rainbow as a symbol of his promise]]. God sees mankind cooperating to build a great tower city, the [[Tower of Babel]], and divides humanity with many languages and sets them apart with confusion.\n\nGod instructs Abram to travel from his home in [[Mesopotamia]] to the land of [[Canaan]]. There, God makes a covenant with Abram, promising that his descendants shall be as numerous as the stars, but that people will suffer oppression in a foreign land for four hundred years, after which they will inherit the land \"from the [[Brook of Egypt|river of Egypt]] to the great river, the river [[Euphrates]]\". Abram's name is changed to Abraham and that of his wife Sarai to [[Sarah]], and [[circumcision]] of all males is instituted as the sign of the covenant. Because Sarah is old, she tells Abraham to take her Egyptian handmaiden, [[Hagar]], as a second wife. Through Hagar, Abraham fathers [[Ishmael]].\n\nGod resolves to destroy the cities of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] for the sins of their people. Abraham protests and gets God to agree not to destroy the cities if 10 righteous men can be found. Angels save Abraham's nephew [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] and his family, but [[Lot's wife|his wife]] looks back on the destruction against their command and is turned into a pillar of salt. Lot's daughters, concerned that they are fugitives who will never find husbands, get him drunk to become pregnant by him, and give birth to the ancestors of the [[Moab]]ites and [[Ammon]]ites.\n\nAbraham and Sarah go to the Philistine town of [[Gerar]], pretending to be brother and sister (they are half-siblings). The King of Gerar takes Sarah for his wife, but God warns him to return her, and he obeys. God sends Sarah a son to be named [[Isaac]], through whom the covenant will be established. At Sarah's insistence, Ishmael and his mother Hagar are driven out into the wilderness, but God saves them and promises to make Ishmael a great nation.\n\nGod tests Abraham by demanding that he [[Binding of Isaac|sacrifice Isaac]]. As Abraham is about to lay the knife upon his son, God restrains him, promising him numberless descendants. On the death of Sarah, Abraham purchases [[Cave of the Patriarchs|Machpelah]] (believed to be modern [[Hebron]]) for a family tomb and sends his servant to Mesopotamia to find among his relations a wife for Isaac, and Rebekah is chosen. Other children are born to Abraham by another wife, [[Keturah]], among whose descendants are the [[Midian]]ites, and he dies in a prosperous old age and is buried in his tomb at Hebron.\n\nIsaac's wife [[Rebecca]] gives birth to the twins [[Esau]], father of the [[Edom]]ites, and [[Jacob]]. Through deception, Jacob becomes the heir instead of Esau and gains his father's blessing. He flees to [[Laban (Bible)|his uncle]] where he prospers and earns his two wives, [[Rachel]] and [[Leah]]. Jacob's name is changed to Israel, and by his wives and their handmaidens he has twelve sons, the ancestors of the twelve tribes of the Children of Israel, and a daughter, [[Dinah]].\n\n[[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], Jacob's favorite son, is sold into slavery in [[Egypt]] by his jealous brothers. But Joseph prospers, after hardship, with God's guidance of [[Dream interpretation|interpreting Pharaoh's dream]] of upcoming famine. He is then reunited with his father and brothers, who fail to recognize him, and plead for food. After much manipulation, he reveals himself and lets them and their households into Egypt, where [[Pharaoh]] assigns to them the [[land of Goshen]]. Jacob calls his sons to his bedside and [[Blessing of Jacob|reveals their future]] before he dies. Joseph lives to an old age and exhorts his brethren, if God should lead them out of the country, to take his bones with them.\n\n== Composition ==\n[[File:Molnár Ábrahám kiköltözése 1850.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Abram's Journey from [[Ur Kaśdim|Ur]] to [[Canaan]] ([[József Molnár (painter)|József Molnár]], 1850)]]\n\n=== Title and textual witnesses ===\nGenesis takes its Hebrew title from the first word of the first sentence, ''Bereshit'', meaning \"In the beginning [of]\"; in the Greek [[Septuagint]] it was called ''Genesis'', from the phrase \"the generations of heaven and earth\".{{sfn|Carr|2000|p=491}} There are four major textual witnesses to the book: the [[Masoretic Text]], the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], the [[Septuagint]], and fragments of Genesis found at [[Qumran]]. The Qumran group provides the oldest manuscripts but covers only a small proportion of the book; in general, the Masoretic Text is well preserved and reliable, but there are many individual instances where the other versions preserve a superior reading.<ref>Hendel, R. S. (1992). \"Genesis, Book of\". In D. N. Freedman (Ed.), ''The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary'' (Vol. 2, p. 933). New York: Doubleday</ref>\n\n=== Origins ===\n{{Main|Documentary hypothesis}}\nFor much of the 20th century most scholars agreed that the five books of the [[Pentateuch]]—Genesis, [[book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]]—came from four sources, the [[Yahwist]], the [[Elohist]], the [[Deuteronomist]] and the [[Priestly source]], each telling the same basic story, and joined together by various editors.<ref>Gooder (2000), pp. 12–14</ref> Since the 1970s there has been a revolution in scholarship: the Elohist source is now widely regarded as no more than a variation on the Yahwist, while the Priestly source is increasingly seen not as a document but as a body of revisions and expansions to the Yahwist (or \"non-Priestly\") material. (The Deuteronomistic source does not appear in Genesis).<ref>Van Seters (2004), pp. 30–86</ref>\n\nExamples of repeated and duplicate stories are used to identify the separate sources.  In Genesis these include three different accounts of a Patriarch claiming that his wife was his sister, the two creation stories, and the two versions of Abraham sending Hagar and Ishmael into the desert.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Lawrence Boadt|author2=Richard J. Clifford |author3=Daniel J. Harrington |date= 2012 |title=Reading the Old Testament: An Introduction |url= |location= |publisher=Paulist Press|page= |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref>\n\nThis leaves the question of when these works were created. Scholars in the first half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that the Yahwist was produced in the monarchic period, specifically at the court of [[Solomon]], 10th century BC, and the Priestly work in the middle of the 5th century BC (the author was even identified as [[Ezra]]), but more recent thinking is that the Yahwist was written either just before or during the [[Babylonian exile]] of the 6th century BC, and the Priestly final edition was made late in the Exilic period or soon after.<ref name=\"Davies37\"/>\n\nAs for why the book was created, a theory which has gained considerable interest, although still controversial is \"Persian imperial authorisation\". This proposes that the Persians of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], after their conquest of Babylon in 539&nbsp;BC, agreed to grant Jerusalem a large measure of local autonomy within the empire, but required the local authorities to produce a single law code accepted by the entire community. The two powerful groups making up the community—the priestly families who controlled the Temple and who [[Myth of origins|traced their origin]] to Moses and the wilderness wanderings, and the major landowning families who made up the \"elders\" and who traced their own origins to Abraham, who had \"given\" them the land—were in conflict over many issues, and each had its own \"history of origins\", but the Persian promise of greatly increased local autonomy for all provided a powerful incentive to cooperate in producing a single text.<ref>Ska (2006), pp. 169, 217–18</ref>\n\n=== Genre ===\nGenesis is perhaps best seen as an example of a [[creation myth]], a type of literature telling of the first appearance of humans, the stories of ancestors and heroes, and the origins of culture, cities and so forth.<ref>Van Seters (2004) pp. 113–14</ref> The most notable examples are found in the work of Greek historians of the 6th century BC: their intention was to connect notable families of their own day to a distant and heroic past, and in doing so they did not distinguish between [[myth]], [[legend]], and facts.<ref>Whybray (2001), p. 39</ref> Professor Jean-Louis Ska of the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] calls the basic rule of the antiquarian historian the \"law of conservation\": everything old is valuable, nothing is eliminated.<ref name=\"Ska169\">Ska (2006), p. 169</ref> Ska also points out the purpose behind such antiquarian histories: antiquity is needed to prove the worth of Israel's traditions to the nations (the neighbours of the Jews in early Persian Palestine), and to reconcile and unite the various factions within Israel itself.<ref name=\"Ska169\"/>\n\n== Themes ==\n[[File:Bourgeois Joseph recognized by his brothers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Joseph recognized by his brothers (Léon Pierre Urban Bourgeois, 1863)]]\n\n=== Promises to the ancestors ===\nIn 1978 [[David Clines]] published his influential ''The Theme of the Pentateuch'' – influential because he was one of the first to take up the question of the theme of the entire five books. Clines' conclusion was that the overall theme is \"the partial fulfillment – which implies also the partial nonfulfillment – of the promise to or blessing of the Patriarchs\". (By calling the fulfillment \"partial\" Clines was drawing attention to the fact that at the end of Deuteronomy the people are still outside Canaan).<ref>Clines (1997), p. 30</ref>\n\nThe [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]], or ancestors, are Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, with their wives (Joseph is normally excluded).<ref name=\"Hamilton50\">Hamilton (1990), p. 50</ref> Since the name YHWH had not been revealed to them, they worshipped El in his various manifestations.<ref>{{Citation|title= A Short Introduction to the Hebrew Bible | author = John J Collins | publisher = Fortress Press | date = 2007 | page = 47}}</ref> (It is, however, worth noting that in the Jahwist source the patriarchs refer to deity by the name YHWH, for example in Genesis 15.) Through the patriarchs God announces the election of Israel, meaning that he has chosen Israel to be his special people and committed himself to their future.<ref>Brueggemann (2002), p. 61</ref> God tells the patriarchs that he will be faithful to their descendants (i.e. to Israel), and Israel is expected to have faith in God and his promise. (\"Faith\" in the context of Genesis and the Hebrew Bible means agreement to the promissory relationship, not a body of belief).<ref>Brueggemann (2002), p. 78</ref>\n\nThe promise itself has three parts: offspring, blessings, and land.<ref>McKeown (2008), p. 4</ref> The fulfilment of the promise to each patriarch depends on having a male heir, and the story is constantly complicated by the fact that each prospective mother – [[Sarah]], [[Rebekah]] and [[Rachel]] – is barren. The ancestors, however, retain their faith in God and God in each case gives a son – in Jacob's case, twelve sons, the foundation of the chosen [[Israelites]]. All three promises are more richly fulfilled in each succeeding generation, until through Joseph \"all the world\" is saved from famine,<ref>Wenham (2003), p. 34</ref> and by bringing the children of Israel down to Egypt he becomes the means through which the promise can be fulfilled.<ref name=\"Hamilton50\"/>\n\n=== God's chosen people ===\nScholars generally agree that the theme of divine promise unites the patriarchal cycles, but many would dispute the efficacy of trying to examine Genesis' theology by pursuing a single overarching theme, instead citing as more productive the analysis of the Abraham cycle, the Jacob cycle, and the Joseph cycle, and the [[Yahwist]] and [[Priestly source]]s.<ref>Hamilton (1990), pp. 38–39</ref> The problem lies in finding a way to unite the patriarchal theme of divine promise to the stories of Genesis 1–11 (the [[primeval history]]) with their theme of God's forgiveness in the face of man's evil nature.<ref>Hendel, R. S. (1992). \"Genesis, Book of\". In D. N. Freedman (Ed.), ''The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary'' (Vol. 2, p. 935). New York: Doubleday</ref><ref name=\"KuglerHartin9\">Kugler, Hartin (2009), p.9</ref> One solution is to see the patriarchal stories as resulting from God's decision not to remain alienated from mankind:<ref name=\"KuglerHartin9\"/> God creates the world and mankind, mankind rebels, and God \"elects\" (chooses) Abraham.<ref name=\"Bandstra28-29\">Bandstra (2004), pp. 28–29</ref>\n\nTo this basic plot (which comes from the [[Yahwist]]) the [[Priestly source]] has added a series of [[covenant (biblical)|covenants]] dividing history into stages, each with its own distinctive \"sign\". The [[Covenant (biblical)#Noahic covenant|first covenant]] is between God and all living creatures, and is marked by the sign of the rainbow; the second is with the descendants of Abraham ([[Ishmaelites]] and others as well as Israelites), and its sign is [[Brit milah|circumcision]]; and the last, which doesn't appear until the [[book of Exodus]], is with Israel alone, and its sign is [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]. Each covenant is mediated by a great leader ([[Noah]], Abraham, [[Moses]]), and at each stage God progressively reveals himself by his name ([[Elohim]] with Noah, [[El Shaddai]] with Abraham, [[Yahweh]] with Moses).<ref name=\"Bandstra28-29\"/>\n\n== Judaism's weekly Torah portions ==\n{{main|Weekly Torah portion}}\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - f 2v.png|thumb|right|250px|First Day of Creation (from the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'')]]\n:*''[[Bereshit (parsha)|Bereshit]], on Genesis 1–6: Creation, Eden, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Lamech, wickedness''\n:*''[[Noach (parsha)|Noach]], on Genesis 6–11: Noah's Ark, the Flood, Noah's drunkenness, the Tower of Babel''\n:*''[[Lech-Lecha]], on Genesis 12–17: Abraham, Sarah, Lot, covenant, Hagar and Ishmael, circumcision''\n:*''[[Vayeira (parsha)|Vayeira]], on Genesis 18–22: Abraham's visitors, Sodomites, Lot's visitors and flight, Hagar expelled, binding of Isaac''\n:*''[[Chayei Sarah (parsha)|Chayei Sarah]], on Genesis 23–25: Sarah buried, Rebekah for Isaac''\n:*''[[Toledot (parsha)|Toledot]], on Genesis 25–28: Esau and Jacob, Esau's birthright, Isaac's blessing''\n:*''[[Vayetze (parsha)|Vayetze]], on Genesis 28–32: Jacob flees, Rachel, Leah, Laban, Jacob's children and departure''\n:*''[[Vayishlach (parsha)|Vayishlach]], on Genesis 32–36: Jacob's reunion with Esau, the rape of Dinah''\n:*''[[Vayeshev (parsha)|Vayeshev]], on Genesis 37–40: Joseph's dreams, coat, and slavery, Judah with Tamar, Joseph and Potiphar''\n:*''[[Miketz (parsha)|Miketz]], on Genesis 41–44: Pharaoh's dream, Joseph's in government, Joseph's brothers visit Egypt\n:*''[[Vayigash (parsha)|Vayigash]], on Genesis 44–47: Joseph reveals himself, Jacob moves to Egypt\n:*''[[Vaychi]], on Genesis 47–50: Jacob's blessings, death of Jacob and of Joseph\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Bible}}\n* [[Dating the Bible]]\n* [[Enûma Eliš]]\n* [[Genesis creation narrative]]\n* [[Genesis 1:1]]\n* [[Historicity of the Bible]]\n* [[Mosaic authorship]]\n* ''[[Paradise Lost]]''\n* [[Protevangelium]]\n* [[Wife–sister narratives in the Book of Genesis]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Commentaries on Genesis ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n|last=Bandstra\n|first=Barry L.\n|title=Reading the Old Testament\n|publisher=Cengage Learning\n|year=2008\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Barry+Bandstra+2004#v=onepage&q=Barry%20Bandstra%202004&f=false\n|ref=harv\n|isbn=0495391050\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n|last=Bergant\n|first=Dianne\n|title=Genesis: In the Beginning\n|publisher=Liturgical Press\n|year=2013\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mRCwAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Bergant+Genesis+in+the+beginning#v=onepage&q=Bergant%20Genesis%20in%20the%20beginning&f=false\n|ref=harv\n|isbn=9780814682753\n}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Blenkinsopp|first=Joseph|title=Creation, Un-creation, Re-creation: A Discursive Commentary on Genesis 1–11|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B12qwOSMD20C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780567372871}}\n* {{cite book |last=Brueggemann |first=Walter |date=1986 |title=Genesis|series=Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJh1BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Walter+Brueggemann+Genesis#v=onepage&q=Walter%20Brueggemann%20Genesis&f=false |location=Atlanta |publisher=John Knox Press |page= |isbn=0-8042-3101-X |author-link=Walter Brueggemann }}\n* {{Cite book\n|last=Carr\n|first=David M.\n|ref=harv\n|chapter=Genesis, Book of\n|editor1-last=Freedman\n|editor1-first=David Noel\n|editor2-last=Myers\n|editor2-first=Allen C.\n|title=Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible\n|publisher=Amsterdam University Press\n|year=2000\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B12qwOSMD20C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|isbn=9780567372871\n}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Cotter|first=David W|title=Genesis|publisher=[[Liturgical Press]]|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6lCVzr4cT9QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Genesis+David+W.+Cotter#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780814650400}}\n* {{cite book |last=De La Torre |first=Miguel |date=2011 |title=Genesis|series=Belief: A Theological Commentary on the Bible |url= |location= |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |page= |isbn= |author-link=Miguel A.
