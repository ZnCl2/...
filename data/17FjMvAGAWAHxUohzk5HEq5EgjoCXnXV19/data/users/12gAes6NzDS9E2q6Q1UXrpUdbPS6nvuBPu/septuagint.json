The Hebrew bible, also called Tanakh, has three divisions: the Torah (Law), the Neviʾim (Prophets), and the Ketuvim (Writings). The Septuagint has four: law, history, poetry, and prophets, with the books of the Apocrypha inserted where appropriate. <ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia Britannica: Septuagint |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Septuagint |accessdate=14 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Torah ([[Pentateuch]] in Greek) always maintained its preeminence as the basis of the canon, it is not known when the [[Ketuvim]] (\"writings\"), the final part of the Tanakh, was established, although some sort of selective processes must have been employed because the Septuagint did not include other well-known Jewish documents such as [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]] or [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]] or other writings that are not part of the Jewish canon, and which are now classified as ''[[pseudepigrapha]]''. \n\nHowever, the [[Psalms of Solomon]],  [[3 Maccabees]], [[4 Maccabees]], the [[Epistle of Jeremiah]], the [[Book of Odes (Bible)|Book of Odes]], the [[Prayer of Manasseh]] and [[Psalm 151]] are included in some copies of the Septuagint,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Old Testament Canon and Apocrypha|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/canon2.html|website=BibleResearcher|accessdate=27 November 2015}}{{better source|date=November 2015|reason=This statement should be based on reliable sources.}}</ref> some of which are accepted as canonical by Eastern Orthodox and some other churches. (The differences can be seen [[Biblical canon#Old Testament|here.]])\n\nThe Septuagint includes books called ''[[anagignoskomena]]'' in Greek, known in English as [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanon]] (\"second canon\")  because they are not included in the [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Jewish canon]]. Among these are the first two books of [[Books of the Maccabees|Maccabees]], Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Baruch (including the Letter of Jeremiah), additions to Esther and additions to Daniel, all these books are considered by the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church as canonical books, for Protestantism are Apocrypha.

Several reasons have been given for this. First, some mistranslations were ascertained.<ref>\"The translation, which shows at times a peculiar ignorance of Hebrew usage, was evidently made from a codex which differed widely in places from the text crystallized by the Masorah.\" {{cite web|title=Bible Translations&nbsp;– The Septuagint|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3269-bible-translations|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> Second, the Hebrew source texts, in some cases (particularly the Book of Daniel), used for the Septuagint differed from the [[Masoretic]] tradition of Hebrew texts, which was affirmed as canonical by the Jewish rabbis.\nThird, the rabbis wanted to distinguish their tradition from the newly emerging tradition of Christianity.<ref name=\"ndq\">\"[...] die griechische Bibelübersetzung, die einem innerjüdischen Bedürfnis entsprang [...] [von den] Rabbinern zuerst gerühmt (..)

This is comparable to the authority claimed for the original Arabic Koran according to Islamic teaching.</ref> As a result of this teaching, translations of the [[Torah]] into Koine Greek by early Jewish [[Rabbi]]s have survived as rare fragments only.\n\nIn time the Septuagint became synonymous with the \"Greek Old Testament\", i.e. a Christian canon of writings which incorporated all the books of the Hebrew canon, along with additional texts. The [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches include most of the books that are in the Septuagint in their canons. [[Protestant]] churches, however, usually do not. After the [[Protestant Reformation]], many [[Protestant Bible]]s began to follow the Jewish [[Biblical canon|canon]] and exclude the additional texts, which came to be called \"[[Biblical Apocrypha|Apocrypha]]\" (originally meaning \"hidden\" but became synonymous with \"of questionable authenticity\"), with some arguing against them being classed as Scripture.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Blocher|first1=Henri|title=Helpful or Harmful?

The Septuagint version was discarded in favor of Theodotion's version in the 2nd to 3rd centuries CE. In Greek-speaking areas, this happened near the end of the 2nd century, and in Latin-speaking areas (at least in North Africa), it occurred in the middle of the 3rd century. History does not record the reason for this, and St. [[Jerome]] reports, in the preface to the Vulgate version of Daniel, ''This thing 'just' happened.''<ref name=\"EncBibTV\">{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=TEXT AND VERSIONS|section=Text and Versions}}</ref> Several Old Greek texts of the Book of Daniel have been rediscovered recently and work is ongoing in reconstructing the original form of the book.<ref name=\"Dines\"/>\n\nThe canonical [[Ezra-Nehemiah]] is known in the Septuagint as \"Esdras B\", and 1 Esdras is \"Esdras A\". 1 Esdras is a very similar text to the books of Ezra-Nehemiah, and the two are widely thought by scholars to be derived from the same original text. It has been proposed, and is thought highly likely by scholars, that \"Esdras B\"—the canonical Ezra-Nehemiah—is Theodotion's version of this material, and \"Esdras A\" is the version which was previously in the Septuagint on its own.<ref name=\"EncBibTV\"/>\n\n==Use==\n\n===Jewish use===\n{{see also|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon}}\nPre-Christian Jews [[Philo]] and [[Josephus]] considered the Septuagint on equal standing with the Hebrew text.<ref name=\"Dines\"/><ref>Alexander Zvielli, Jerusalem Post, June 2009, pp. 37</ref> Manuscripts of the Septuagint have been found among the [[Qumran Scrolls]] in the Dead Sea, and were thought to have been in use among Jews at the time.\n\nStarting approximately in the 2nd century CE, several factors led most Jews to abandon use of the Septuagint. The earliest [[gentile]] Christians of necessity used the Septuagint, as it was at the time the only Greek version of the Bible, and most, if not all, of these early non-[[Jewish Christians]] could not read Hebrew. The association of the Septuagint with a rival religion may have rendered it suspect in the eyes of the newer generation of Jews and Jewish scholars.<ref name=\"Würthwein\"/> Instead, Jews used Hebrew/Aramaic [[Targum]] manuscripts later compiled by the [[Masoretes]] and authoritative Aramaic translations, such as those of [[Targum Onkelos|Onkelos]] and [[Targum Jonathan|Rabbi Yonathan ben Uziel]].<ref>Greek-speaking Judaism (see also [[Hellenistic Judaism]]), survived, however, on a smaller scale into the medieval period. Cf. Natalio Fernández Marcos, ''The Septuagint in Context: Introduction to the Greek Bible,'' Leiden: Brill, 2000.</ref>\n\nWhat was perhaps most significant for the Septuagint, as distinct from other Greek versions, was that the Septuagint began to lose Jewish sanction after{{When|date=October 2014}} differences between it and contemporary Hebrew scriptures were discovered (see [[Septuagint#Disputes over canonicity|Disputes over canonicity]]). Even [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek-speaking Jews]] tended less to the Septuagint, preferring other Jewish versions in Greek, such as that of the 2nd-century [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]] translation, which seemed to be more concordant with contemporary Hebrew texts.<ref name=\"Würthwein\"/>\n\n===Christian use===\n{{see also|Development of the Old Testament canon}}\nThe [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] Church used the Greek texts<ref name=lxxshift>\"The translation, which shows at times a peculiar ignorance of Hebrew usage, was evidently made from a codex which differed widely in places from the text crystallized by the Masorah (..) Two things, however, rendered the Septuagint unwelcome in the long run to the Jews. Its divergence from the accepted text (afterward called the [[Masoretic]]) was too evident; and it therefore could not serve as a basis for theological discussion or for homiletic interpretation. This distrust was accentuated by the fact that it had been adopted as Sacred Scripture by the new faith [Christianity] (..) In course of time it came to be the canonical Greek Bible (..)

The Septuagint seems to have been a major source for the [[Apostles]], but it is not the only one.

(Matt 2:23 is not present in current Masoretic tradition either, though according to St. Jerome it was in Hosea 11:1.) The New Testament writers, when citing the Jewish scriptures, or when quoting Jesus doing so, freely used the Greek translation, implying that Jesus, his Apostles and their followers considered it reliable.<ref name=paul-septuagint /><ref name=\"Swete\">H.

For example, [[Irenaeus]] concerning [[Isaiah 7:14]]: The Septuagint clearly writes of a ''virgin'' (Greek ''παρθένος'', ''bethulah'' in Hebrew) that shall conceive.,<ref name=\"Paulkovich\">{{Citation|title=No Meek Messiah|author= Paulkovich, Michael| year=2012|publisher=Spillix Publishing|isbn=0988216116| page=24}}</ref> while the word ''almah'' in the Hebrew text was, according to Irenaeus, at that time interpreted by Theodotion and [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]] (both [[proselyte]]s of the Jewish faith) as a ''young woman'' that shall conceive. According to Irenaeus, the [[Ebionites]] used this to claim that Joseph was the (biological) father of Jesus. From Irenaeus' point of view that was pure heresy, facilitated by (late) anti-Christian alterations of the scripture in Hebrew, as evident by the older, pre-Christian, Septuagint.<ref name=\"Irenaeus\">Irenaeus, ''Against Herecies Book III''.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Jerome]] undertook the revision of the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] translations of the Septuagint, he checked the Septuagint against the Hebrew texts that were then available. He broke with church tradition and translated most of the [[Old Testament]] of his Vulgate from Hebrew rather than Greek. His choice was severely criticized by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], his contemporary;<ref>Jerome, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf101.vii.1.LXXII.html From Jerome, Letter LXXI] (404&nbsp;CE), NPNF1-01.

While on the one hand he argued for the superiority of the Hebrew texts in correcting the Septuagint on both philological and theological grounds, on the other, in the context of accusations of heresy against him, Jerome would acknowledge the Septuagint texts as well.<ref name=\"Rebenich2013p58\">Rebenich, S., ''Jerome'' (Routledge, 2013), p. 58. {{ISBN|9781134638444}}</ref>  With the passage of time, acceptance of Jerome's version gradually increased until it displaced the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin translations]] of the Septuagint.<ref name=\"Würthwein\"/>\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Church]] still prefers to use the Septuagint as the basis for translating the Old Testament into other languages. The Eastern Orthodox also use Septuagint untranslated where Greek is the liturgical language, e.g. in the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]], the [[Church of Greece]] and the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]]. Critical translations of the [[Old Testament]], while using the  [[Masoretic Text]] as their basis, consult the Septuagint as well as other versions in an attempt to reconstruct the meaning of the Hebrew text whenever the latter is unclear, undeniably corrupt, or ambiguous.<ref name=\"Würthwein\"/> For example, the [[New Jerusalem Bible]] Foreword says, \"Only when this (the Masoretic Text) presents insuperable difficulties have emendations or other versions, such as the ...

The Septuagint here denotes the original septuagint.]]\nModern scholarship holds that the Septuagint was written during the 3rd through 1st centuries BCE. But nearly all attempts at dating specific books, with the exception of the Pentateuch (early- to mid-3rd century BCE), are tentative and without consensus.<ref name=\"Dines\"/>\n\nLater Jewish revisions and [[recension]]s of the Greek against the Hebrew are well attested, the most famous of which include ''the Three:'' [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]] (128&nbsp;CE), [[Symmachus the Ebionite|Symmachus]], and Theodotion. These three, to varying degrees, are more literal renderings of their contemporary Hebrew scriptures as compared to the Old Greek (the original Septuagint). Modern scholars consider one or more of the 'three' to be totally new Greek versions of the Hebrew Bible.<ref>Compare Dines, who is certain only of Symmachus being a truly new version, with Würthwein, who considers only Theodotion to be a revision, and even then possibly of an earlier non-LXX version.</ref>\n\nAround 235&nbsp;CE, [[Origen]], a Christian scholar in [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]], completed the [[Hexapla]], a comprehensive comparison of the ancient versions and Hebrew text side-by-side in six columns, with diacritical markings (a.k.a. \"editor's marks\", \"critical signs\" or \"Aristarchian signs\"). Much of this work was lost, but several compilations of the fragments are available. In the first column was the contemporary Hebrew, in the second a Greek transliteration of it, then the newer Greek versions each in their own columns. Origen also kept a column for the Old Greek (the Septuagint), which included readings from all the Greek versions into a critical apparatus with diacritical marks indicating to which version each line (Gr. στίχος) belonged. Perhaps the voluminous Hexapla was never copied in its entirety, but Origen's combined text (\"the fifth column\") was copied frequently, eventually without the editing marks, and the older uncombined text of the Septuagint was neglected. Thus this combined text became the first major Christian recension of the Septuagint, often called the ''Hexaplar recension''. In the century following Origen, two other major recensions were identified by [[Jerome]], who attributed these to [[Lucian of Antioch|Lucian]] (Lucianic or Antiochene recension) and [[Hesychius of Jerusalem|Hesychius]] (Hesychian or Alexandrian recension).<ref name=\"Dines\"/>\n\n====Manuscripts====\n{{main|Septuagint manuscripts}}\nThe oldest manuscripts of the Septuagint include 2nd century BCE fragments of Leviticus and Deuteronomy (Rahlfs nos. 801, 819, and 957), and 1st century BCE fragments of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and the Minor Prophets ([[Alfred Rahlfs]] nos. 802, 803, 805, 848, 942, and 943). Relatively complete manuscripts of the Septuagint postdate the Hexaplar recension and include the [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] from the 4th century CE and the [[Codex Alexandrinus]] of the 5th century. These are indeed the oldest surviving nearly complete manuscripts of the Old Testament in any language; the oldest extant complete Hebrew texts date some 600 years later, from the first half of the 10th century.<ref name=\"Würthwein\"/><ref>Due to the practice of burying Torah scrolls invalidated for use by age, commonly after 300–400 years.</ref> The 4th century [[Codex Sinaiticus]] also partially survives, still containing many texts of the Old Testament.<ref>Würthwein, op. cit., pp. 73 & 198.</ref> While there are differences between these three codices, scholarly consensus today holds that one Septuagint—that is, the original pre-Christian translation—underlies all three. The various Jewish and later Christian revisions and recensions are largely responsible for the divergence of the codices.<ref name=\"Dines\"/> The [[Codex Marchalianus]] is another notable manuscript.\n\n====Differences with the Latin Vulgate and the Masoretic text====\nThe sources of the many differences between the Septuagint, the Latin Vulgate and the Masoretic Text have long been discussed by scholars. Following the [[Renaissance]], a common opinion among some humanists was that the Septuagint translators bungled the translation from the Hebrew and that the Septuagint became more corrupt with time. The most widely accepted view today is that the Septuagint provides a reasonably accurate record of an early Hebrew textual variant that differed from the ancestor of the Masoretic text as well as those of the Latin Vulgate, where both of the latter seem to have a more similar textual heritage. This view is supported by comparisons with Biblical texts found at the [[Essene]] settlement at [[Qumran]] (the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThese issues notwithstanding, the text of the Septuagint is generally close to that of the Masoretes and Vulgate. For example, Genesis 4:1–6 is identical in both the Septuagint, Vulgate and the Masoretic Text. Likewise, Genesis 4:8 to the end of the chapter is the same. There is only one noticeable difference in that chapter, at 4:7, to wit:\n\n{| cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"10\"\n|-\n| <center>'''Genesis 4:7, LXX and English Translation ([[New English Translation of the Septuagint|NETS]])'''</center>||<center>'''Genesis 4:7, Masoretic and English Translation from MT ([[Judaica Press]])'''</center>||<center>'''Genesis 4:7, Latin Vulgate and English Translation (Douay-Rheims)'''</center>\n|-\n| οὐκ ἐὰν ὀρθῶς προσενέγκῃς, ὀρθῶς δὲ μὴ διέλῃς, ἥμαρτες; ἡσύχασον· πρὸς σὲ ἡ ἀποστροφὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ σὺ ἄρξεις αὐτοῦ.<br><br>If you offer correctly but do not divide correctly, have you not sinned?

Despite the striking divergence of meaning here between the Septuagint and later texts, nearly identical consonantal Hebrew source texts can be reconstructed. The readily apparent semantic differences result from alternative strategies for interpreting the difficult verse and relate to differences in vowelization and punctuation of the consonantal text.\n\nThe differences between the Septuagint and the MT thus fall into four categories.<ref>See, Jinbachian, ''Some Semantically Significant Differences Between the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20040514084024/http://210.107.99.8/appendage/labhwp/Jinbachian.doc].</ref>\n\n:# ''Different Hebrew sources for the MT and the LXX''. Evidence of this can be found throughout the Old Testament. Most obvious are major differences in Jeremiah and Job, where the Septuagint is much shorter and chapters appear in different order than in the MT, and Esther where almost one third of the verses in the Septuagint text have no parallel in the MT. A more subtle example may be found in Isaiah 36.11; the meaning ultimately remains the same, but the choice of words evidences a different text. The MT reads ''\"...al tedaber yehudit be-'ozne ha`am al ha-homa\"'' [speak not the Judean language in the ears of (or—which can be heard by) the people on the wall]. The same verse in the Septuagint reads according to the translation of Brenton \"and speak not to us in the Jewish tongue: and wherefore speakest thou in the ears of the men on the wall.\" The MT reads \"people\" where the Septuagint reads \"men\". This difference is very minor and does not affect the meaning of the verse. Scholars at one time had used discrepancies such as this to claim that the Septuagint was a poor translation of the Hebrew original. With the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, variant Hebrew texts of the Bible were found. In fact this verse is found in Qumran (1QIsa''a'') where the Hebrew word \"haanashim\" (the men) is found in place of \"haam\" (the people). This discovery, and others like it, showed that even seemingly minor differences of translation could be the result of variant Hebrew source texts.\n:# ''Differences in interpretation'' stemming from the same Hebrew text. A good example is Genesis 4.7, shown above.\n:# ''Differences as a result of idiomatic translation issues'' (i.e. a Hebrew idiom may not easily translate into Greek, thus some difference is intentionally or unintentionally imparted). For example, in Psalm 47:10 the MT reads \"The shields of the earth belong to God\". The Septuagint reads \"To God are the mighty ones of the earth.\" The metaphor \"shields\" would not have made much sense to a Greek speaker; thus the words \"mighty ones\" are substituted in order to retain the original meaning.\n:# ''Transmission changes in Hebrew or Greek'' (Diverging revisionary/recensional changes and copyist errors)\n\n====Dead Sea Scrolls====\nThe Biblical manuscripts found in [[Qumran]], commonly known as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (DSS), have prompted comparisons of the various texts associated with the Hebrew Bible, including the Septuagint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bib-arch.org/e-features/searching-for-better-text.asp |title=Searching for the Better Text – Biblical Archaeology Society |publisher=Bib-arch.org |date= |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref> Peter Flint<ref>[http://twu.ca/research/academic/faculty-research/chairs-and-professorships/canada-research-chairs/peter-flint/curriculum-vitae-dr-peter-flint.html Dr. Peter Flint.

About 60% of the Biblical scrolls fall into this category (e.g. 1QIsa-b)\n:# Pre-Septuagint: These are the manuscripts which have distinctive affinities with the Greek Bible. These number only about 5% of the Biblical scrolls, for example, 4QDeut-q, 4QSam-a, and 4QJer-b, 4QJer-d. In addition to these manuscripts, several others share distinctive individual readings with the Septuagint, although they do not fall in this category.\n:# The Qumran \"Living Bible\": These are the manuscripts which, according to Tov, were copied in accordance with the \"Qumran practice\" (i.e. with distinctive long [[orthography]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], frequent errors and corrections, and a free approach to the text. Such scrolls comprise about 20% of the Biblical corpus, including the [[Great Isaiah Scroll]] (1QIsa-a):\n:# Pre-Samaritan: These are DSS manuscripts which reflect the textual form found in the Samaritan Pentateuch, although the Samaritan Bible itself is later and contains information not found in these earlier scrolls, (e.g. God's holy mountain at Shechem rather than Jerusalem).

The text is closer to Codex Vaticanus than the Complutensian. The editor says he collated ancient manuscripts but does not specify them.

It was published in 1587 under the direction of Cardinal [[Antonio Carafa]], with the help of a group of Roman scholars (Cardinal [[Gugliemo Sirleto]], [[Antonio Agelli]] and [[Petrus Morinus]]), by the authority of Sixtus V, to assist the revisers who were preparing the Latin Vulgate edition ordered by the Council of Trent. It has become the textus receptus of the Greek Old Testament and has had many new editions, such as that of [[Robert Holmes (priest)|Robert Holmes]] and [[James Parsons (clergyman)|James Parsons]] (Oxford, 1798–1827), the seven editions of [[Constantin von Tischendorf]], which appeared at Leipzig between 1850 and 1887, the last two, published after the death of the author and revised by Nestle, the four editions of [[Henry Barclay Swete]] (Cambridge, 1887–95, 1901, 1909), etc. A detailed description of this edition has been made by H.

It is based primarily upon the [[Codex Vaticanus]] and contains the Greek and English texts in parallel columns. Considering the dated English of Brenton's translation, there is also a revision of the Brenton Septuagint available through Stauros Ministries, called ''The Complete Apostles' Bible'', translated by Paul W. Esposito, Th.D, and released in 2007.
