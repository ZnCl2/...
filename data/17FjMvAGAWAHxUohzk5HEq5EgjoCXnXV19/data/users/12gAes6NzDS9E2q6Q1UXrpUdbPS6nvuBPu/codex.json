The term is now usually only used of [[manuscript]] books, with hand-written contents,<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed: Codex: \"a manuscript volume\"</ref> but describes the format that is now near-universal for printed books in the Western world.  The book is usually bound by stacking the pages and fixing one edge to a [[bookbinding]], which may just be thicker paper ([[paperback]] or [[softback]]), or with stiff boards, called a [[hardback]], or in elaborate historical examples a [[treasure binding]]. \n\nAt least in the Western world, the main alternative to the paged codex format for a long document is the continuous [[scroll]], which was the dominant book form in the [[Classical antiquity|ancient world]].  Some codices are continuously folded like a [[concertina]], in particular the [[Maya codices|Maya]] and [[Aztec codices]], which are actually long sheets of paper or animal skin folded into pages.  These do not really meet most current definitions of the \"codex\" form, but are so called by convention. \n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] developed the form from wooden [[Wax tablet|writing tablets]]. The codex's gradual replacement of the scroll has been called the most important advance in book making before the invention of [[Printing press|printing]].<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=1}}</ref> The codex transformed the shape of the book itself, and offered a form that lasted until present day (and continues to be used alongside [[e-paper]]).<ref> Lyons, M., (2011). ''Books: A Living History'', London: Thames & Hudson, p. 8</ref> The spread of the codex is often associated with the rise of [[Christianity]], which adopted the format for use with the [[Bible]] early on.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=38−67}}</ref> First described by the 1st-century AD Roman poet [[Martial]], who praised its convenient use, the codex achieved numerical parity with the scroll around AD 300,<ref name=Oxf>\"Codex\" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York & Oxford, 1991, p. 473. {{ISBN|0195046528}}</ref> and had completely replaced it throughout what was by then a Christianized [[Greco-Roman world]] by the 6th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=75}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:The War Scroll - Dead Sea Scroll.jpg|thumb|Codices largely replaced scrolls similar to this.]]\nThe codex provides considerable advantages over other book formats:\n* Compactness\n* Sturdiness\n* Economic use of materials by using both sides ([[recto and verso]])\n* Ease of reference (a codex accommodates [[random access]], as opposed to a scroll, which uses [[sequential access]].)<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=45−53}}</ref>\n\nThe change from rolls to codices roughly coincides with the transition from [[papyrus]] to [[parchment]] as the preferred writing material, but the two developments are unconnected. In fact, any combination of codices and scrolls with papyrus and parchment is technically feasible and common in the historical record.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=5}}</ref>\n\nThe codex began to replace the [[scroll]] almost as soon as it was invented. In [[Egypt]], by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered the scroll by ten to one based on surviving examples. By the sixth century, the scroll had almost vanished as a medium for literature.<ref>Roberts, Colin H., and Skeat, T.C. (1987), ''The Birth of the Codex''. London: [[Oxford University Press]] for the [[British Academy]], p. 75.</ref>\n\nTechnically, even modern [[paperback]]s are codices, but publishers and scholars reserve the term for [[manuscript]] (hand-written) books produced from [[Late antiquity]] until the [[Middle Ages]]. The scholarly study of these manuscripts from the point of view of the [[bookbinding]] craft is called [[codicology]]. The study of ancient documents in general is called [[paleography]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Wachstafel rem.jpg|thumb|Reproduced Roman-style [[wax tablet]], from which the codex evolved]]\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used precursors made of reusable [[Wax tablet|wax-covered tablets of wood]] for taking notes and other informal writings. Two ancient [[polyptych]]s, a ''pentatych'' and ''octotych'', excavated at [[Herculaneum]] used a unique connecting system that presages later sewing on of thongs or cords.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carratelli|first=Giovanni Pugliese|title= \"L'instrvmentvm Scriptorivm Nei Monumenti Pompeiani Ed Ercolanesi.\" in Pompeiana.

He wrote a series of five [[couplet]]s meant to accompany gifts of literature that Romans exchanged during the festival of [[Saturnalia]]. Three of these books are specifically described by Martial as being in the form of a codex; the poet praises the compendiousness of the form (as opposed to the scroll), as well the convenience with which such a book can be read on a journey. In another poem by Martial, the poet advertises a new edition of his works, specifically noting that it is printed as a codex, taking less space than a scroll and more comfortable to hold in one hand. According to [[Theodore Cressy Skeat]], this might be the first recorded known case of an entire edition of a literary work (not just a single copy) being published in codex form, though it was likely an isolated case and was not a common practice until a much later time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skeat|first= T.C.|title=The Collected Biblical Writings of T.C. Skeat.|year=2004|publisher=E.J. Brill |location= Leiden|isbn=90-04-13920-6|pages=45-46|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=td_OLXo4RvkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Collected+Biblical+Writings+of+T.C.+Skeat&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=in%20at%20least%20three%20cases&f=false}}</ref>\n\nIn his discussion of one of the earliest parchment codices to survive from [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt, Eric Turner seems to challenge Skeat’s notion when stating, “…its mere existence is evidence that this book form had a prehistory”, and that “early experiments with this book form may well have taken place outside of Egypt.”<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Eric|title=The Typology of the Early Codex|year=1977|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-7696-1 |page=38}}</ref> Early codices of parchment or papyrus appear to have been widely used as personal notebooks, for instance in recording copies of letters sent (Cicero ''Fam.'' 9.26.1). The [[parchment]] notebook pages were commonly washed or scraped for re-use (called a [[palimpsest]]) and consequently, writings in a codex were often considered informal and impermanent.\n\nAs early as the early 2nd century, there is evidence that a codex—usually of [[papyrus]]—was the preferred format among [[Christianity|Christians]]. In the library of the [[Villa of the Papyri]], [[Herculaneum]] (buried in AD 79), all the texts (of Greek literature) are scrolls (see [[Herculaneum papyri]]). However, in the [[Nag Hammadi library]], hidden about AD 390, all texts (Gnostic Christian) are codices. Despite this comparison, a fragment of a non-Christian parchment codex of [[Demosthenes]]' ''De Falsa Legatione'' from [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt demonstrates that the surviving evidence is insufficient to conclude whether Christians played a major or central role in the development of early codices—or if they simply adopted the format to distinguish themselves from [[Jews]].{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe earliest surviving fragments from codices come from Egypt, and are variously dated (always tentatively) towards the end of the 1st century or in the first half of the 2nd. This group includes the [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], containing part of St John's Gospel, and perhaps dating from between 125 and 160.<ref>Turner ''The Typology of the Early Codex'', U Penn 1977, and Roberts & Skeat ''The Birth of the Codex'' (Oxford University 1983). From Robert A Kraft (see link): \"A fragment of a Latin parchment codex of an otherwise unknown historical text dating to about 100 CE was also found at Oxyrhynchus ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 30|P. Oxy. 30]]; see Roberts & Skeat 28). Papyrus fragments of a \"Treatise of the Empirical School\" dated by its editor to the centuries 1–2 CE is also attested in the Berlin collection (inv. # 9015, Pack\\2 # 2355)—Turner, Typology # 389, and Roberts & Skeat 71, call it a \"medical manual.\"\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Ezra Codex Amiantinus.jpg|thumb|Early medieval bookcase containing about ten codices depicted in the [[Codex Amiatinus]] ({{circa}} 700)]]\n\nIn [[Western culture#Foundations|Western culture]], the codex gradually replaced the scroll. Between the 4th century, when the codex gained wide acceptance, and the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 8th century, many works that were not converted from scroll to codex were lost. The codex improved on the scroll in several ways. It could be opened flat at any page for easier reading, pages could be written on both front and back ([[recto and verso]]), and the protection of durable covers made it more compact and easier to transport.\n\nThe ancients stored codices with spines facing inward, and not always vertically. The spine could be used for the [[incipit]], before the concept of a proper title developed in medieval times. Though most early codices were made of [[papyrus]], papyrus was fragile and supplies from Egypt, the only place where papyrus grew and was made into paper, became scanty. The more durable [[parchment]] and [[vellum]] gained favor, despite the cost.\n[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 37r.jpg|Folio 37 recto|thumb|right|[[Aztec codices|Aztec codex]] of the early 16th c., [[Codex Mendoza]], showing tribute obligations of particular indigenous towns]]\nThe codices of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] (Mexico and Central America) had the same form as the European codex, but were instead made with long folded strips of either fig bark ([[amatl]]) or plant fibers, often with a layer of [[whitewash]] applied before writing. [[New World]] codices were written as late as the 16th century (see [[Maya codices]] and [[Aztec codices]]). Those written before the Spanish conquests seem all to have been single long sheets folded [[concertina]]-style, sometimes written on both sides of the local ''[[amatl]]'' paper. There are significant codices produced in the colonial era, with pictorial and alphabetic texts in Spanish or an indigenous language such as [[Nahuatl]].\n\nIn [[East Asia]], the scroll remained standard for far longer than in the [[Mediterranean]] world. There were intermediate stages, such as scrolls folded [[concertina]]-style and pasted together at the back and books that were printed only on one side of the paper.<ref>[http://idp.bl.uk/education/bookbinding/bookbinding.a4d [[International Dunhuang Project]]—Several intermediate Chinese bookbinding forms from the 10th century].</ref> This replaced traditional Chinese writing mediums such as [[bamboo and wooden slips]], as well as [[History of silk|silk]] and paper scrolls.<ref>{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|page=227|postscript=.}}</ref> The evolution of the codex in [[History of China|China]] began with folded-leaf [[pamphlet]]s in the 9th century AD, during the late [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907 AD), improved by the 'butterfly' bindings of the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279 AD), the wrapped back binding of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271-1368), the stitched binding of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368-1644 AD) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (1644-1912), and finally the adoption of Western-style bookbinding in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=227-229|postscript=.}}</ref> The initial phase of this evolution, the accordion-folded palm-leaf-style book, most likely came from [[India]] and was introduced to China via [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist missionaries and scriptures]].<ref>{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=227-229|postscript=.}}</ref> \n\n[[Judaism]] still retains the [[Torah]] scroll, at least for ceremonial use.\n\n==From scrolls to codex==\n[[File:Codex Aureus Sankt Emmeram.jpg|thumb|The cover of the [[Carolingian]] gospel book ''Codex Aureus of Sankt Emmeram'', produced ca. 870 AD at the [[Palace of Aachen]], during the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles the Bald]]]]\nAmong the experiments of earlier centuries, scrolls were sometimes unrolled horizontally, as a succession of columns. (The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] are a famous example of this format.) This made it possible to fold the scroll as an accordion. The next step was then to cut the [[Folio (printing)|folios]], sew and glue them at their centers, making it easier to use the [[papyrus]] or [[vellum]] [[Recto and verso|recto-verso]] as with a modern book. Traditional bookbinders would call one of these assembled, trimmed and bound folios a ''codex'' to differentiate it from the ''case,'' which we now know as ''hard cover''. Binding the codex was clearly a different procedure from binding the case.\n\n==Preparing a codex==\n{{see|Parchment}}\nThe first stage in creating a codex is to prepare the animal skin. The skin is washed with water and lime, but not together, and it has to soak in the lime for a couple of days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/making/ |title=The Making of a Medieval Book |publisher=The J. Paul Getty Trust |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref> The hair is removed and the skin is dried by attaching it to a frame called a herse.<ref name=\"Intro\">Clemens, Raymond, and Timothy Graham. Introduction to Manuscript Studies. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008.</ref> The parchment maker attaches the skin at points around the circumference. The skin attaches to the herse by cords. To prevent tearing, the maker wraps the area of the skin attached to the cord around a pebble called a pippin.<ref name=\"Intro\" /> After completing that, the maker uses a crescent shaped knife called a ''lunarium'' or ''lunellum'' to remove any remaining hairs. Once the skin completely dries, the maker gives it a deep clean and processes it into sheets. The number of sheets from a piece of skin depends on the size of the skin and the final product dimensions. For example, the average calfskin can provide three and half medium sheets of writing material. This can be doubled when folded into two conjoint leaves, also known as a ''bifolium''. Historians have found evidence of manuscripts where the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers.<ref name=\"daniel\">Thompson, Daniel. \"Medieval Parchment-Making.\" The Library 16, no. 4 (1935).</ref> Defects can often be found in the membrane, whether from the original animal, human error during the preparation period, or from when the animal was killed. Defects can also appear during the writing process. Unless it is kept in perfect condition, defects can appear later in the manuscript’s life as well.\n\n===Preparation of the pages for writing===\n[[File:Codex Manesse 193r - Albrecht von Rapperswil.jpg|thumb|Manuscript, [[Codex Manesse]]. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered.]]\nFirst the membrane must be prepared. The first step is to set up the quires. The quire is a group of several sheets put together. Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham point out, in \"Introduction to Manuscript Studies\", that “the quire was the scribe’s basic writing unit throughout the Middle Ages”.<ref name=\"Intro\"/> They note “Pricking is the process of making holes in a sheet of parchment (or membrane) in preparation of it ruling. The lines were then made by ruling between the prick marks...The process of entering ruled lines on the page to serve as a guide for entering text. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered and with vertical bounding lines that marked the boundaries of the columns.”<ref name=\"Intro\"/>\n\n===Forming the quire===\nFrom the Carolingian period and all the way up to the Middle Ages, different styles of folding the quire came about. For example, in mainland Europe throughout the Middle Ages, the quire was put into a system in which each side folded on to the same style. The hair side met the hair side and the flesh side to the flesh side. This was not the same style used in the British Isles, where the membrane was folded so that it turned out an eight-leaf quire, with single leaves in the third and sixth positions.<ref name=\"Intro\" /> The next stage was tacking the quire. Tacking is when the scribe would hold together the leaves in quire with thread. Once threaded together, the scribe would then sew a line of parchment up the “spine” of the manuscript, as to protect the tacking.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aztec codices]]\n*[[History of books]]\n*[[List of codices]]\n*[[List of florilegia and botanical codices]]\n*[[List of New Testament papyri]]\n*[[List of New Testament uncials]]\n*[[Maya codices]]\n*[[Traditional Chinese bookbinding]]\n*[[Volume (bibliography)]]\n\n==References and sources==\n===References===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n===Sources===\n* [[David Diringer]], ''The Book Before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental'', Courier Dover Publications, New York 1982, {{ISBN|0-486-24243-9}}\n* [[Larry Hurtado|L.
