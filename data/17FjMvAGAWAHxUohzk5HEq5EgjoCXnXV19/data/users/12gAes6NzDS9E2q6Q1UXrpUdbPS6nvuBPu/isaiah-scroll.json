It is particularly large, being about 734&nbsp;cm (24 feet) long and ranges from 25.3 to 27&nbsp;cm high (10 to 10.6 inches) with 54 columns of text.<ref name=\":1\" />\n__TOC__\n\n== History to Discovery ==\n[[File:Qumran Cave 1.jpg|thumb|311x311px|Qumran Cave 1, where 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> was found.

Pieces of the scroll have dated using both [[radiocarbon dating]] and [[palaeographic]]/scribal dating giving calibrated date ranges between 356-103 BCE and 150-100 BCE respectively.<ref>[http://www.allaboutarchaeology.org/dead-sea-scrolls-2.htm Allaboutarchaeology.org/dead-sea-scrolls-2.htm]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jull|first=Timothy A.

XII.</ref> Further supporting this theory are the number of Essene sectarian texts found in the surrounding [[Qumran Caves]], and the lining up of recorded beliefs to artifacts or structures at the Qumran site (like communal meals and the obsession with ritual purity lining up with rooms with hundreds of plates and many ritual baths found at the site).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls|last=Flint|first=Peter W.|publisher=Abingdon Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Nashville|pages=137–151}}</ref> This theory is the most accepted in scholarly discourse. Further evidence that 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> was used by the sectarian community at Qumran is that scholars Abegg, Flint, and Ulrich argue that the same scribe who copied the sectarian scroll [[Community Rule|Rule of the Community]] (1QS) also made a correction to 1QIsa<sup>a</sup>.<ref name=\":3\" /> The reason for the placement of 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> in Qumran Cave 1 is still unknown, though it has been speculated that it was placed, along with the other scrolls, by Jews (Essene or not) fleeing the [[Roman army|Roman forces]] during the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] (c.66-73 CE).<ref>\"Writing the Dead Sea Scrolls\".

During this time, the front cover of 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> broke off.<ref name=\":8\" /> The three scrolls were brought to an antiques dealer in [[Bethlehem]] for appraisal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/learn-about-the-scrolls/discovery-and-publication|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls - Discovery and Publication|website=www.deadseascrolls.org.il|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}</ref>\n\n== Publication ==\n\nThe scroll first came into the possession of Khalil Iskander Shahin, better known as Kando, an antiques dealer who was a member of the Syrian Church.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Frank Moore|title=The Ancient Library of Qumran|date=1995|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0-8006-2807-1|pages=20–24|edition=3rd}}</ref> Kando was unable to make anything of the writing on the scroll, and sold it to [[Mar Samuel|Anastasius Yeshue Samuel]] (better known as [[Mar Samuel]]), the Syrian Archbishop of the Syrian Orthodox Church in East [[Jerusalem]], who was anxious to have it authenticated.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite book|last1=Bruce|first1=F.

Eerdmans Publishing Company|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|pages=13–19}}</ref> The Archbishop consulted many scholars in Jerusalem to determine the nature and significance of the documents, and in July 1947, he finally consulted the [[École Biblique]] and came in contact with the visiting Dutch scholar Professor J. van der Ploeg of [[Nijmegen University]]. Van der Ploeg identified one of the manuscripts at the monastery as a copy of the [[Book of Isaiah]] in Hebrew, but was met with skepticism, as a fellow scholar at the [[École Biblique]] believed that the scrolls must be fakes due to their antiquity.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn January 1948, Professor [[Eleazar Sukenik]] of the Chair of Palestinian Archaeology in the [[Hebrew University]] arranged to meet with a member of the Syrian community in the [[YMCA|Y.M.C.A]] building of [[Jerusalem]] to see the scrolls and borrow them for a few days, after hearing of their existence at the monastery.<ref name=\":5\" /> Upon realizing their authenticity, Sukenik copied several chapters of the Book of Isaiah from the manuscript and distributed copies to the Constituent Assembly of the State of Israel.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOn February 18, 1948, Father Butrus Sowmy of [[Monastery of Saint Mark, Jerusalem|St. Mark's Monastery]] called the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (ASOR) to contact [[William Brownlee]], a Fellow at the ASOR, about publishing the Great Isaiah Scroll, the [[Habakkuk Commentary]], and the [[Community Rule]]. Brownlee was away from the school temporarily, so Sowmy was put in contact with Dr. [[John Trever]], photographer and temporary director of the school.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|last1=LaSor|first1=William Sanford|title=Amazing Dead Sea Scrolls|date=1956|publisher=Moody Press|location=Chicago|pages=13–19}}</ref> Trever [[photograph]]ed the scrolls and sent the photographs to palaeographer and dean of American archaeologists, Professor [[William F.

Recently, the [[Israel Museum]], in a partnership with [[Google]], created the [http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/ Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Project], and has digitized 1QIsa<sup>a</sup>, the Great Isaiah Scroll, providing a high-quality image of the entire scroll.

Most variants are more minor and include differences of a single word, alternative spellings, plural versus single usage, and changes in the order of words.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41076443|title=The Dead Sea scrolls Bible : the oldest known Bible, translated for the first time into English|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Abegg, Martin G., Jr.,, Flint, Peter W.,, Ulrich, Eugene, 1938-|year=1999|isbn=9780060600648|edition=1st|location=San Francisco, California|pages=214, 268–270|oclc=41076443}}</ref>\n\nSome of the major variants are notable as they show the development of the book of Isaiah over time or represent scribal errors unique to 1QIsa<sup>a</sup>. Abegg, [[Peter Flint (religious scholar)|Flint]] and Ulrich argue that the absence of the second half of verse 9 and all of verse 10 in chapter 2 of 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> indicates that these are slightly later additions.<ref name=\":3\" /> These verses are found in other [[Qumran]] [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] scrolls, the [[Masoretic Text]], and the [[Septuagint]].<ref name=\":3\" /> In chapter 40, a shorter version of verse 7 is found, matching the Septuagint. In the same verse there is also an insertion by a later scribe showing a longer version that is consistent with the [[Masoretic Text]].<ref name=\":2\" /> There are also several examples of likely scribal error in the scroll, such as Isaiah 16:8-9. Most of 16:8 is missing and the first part of verse 9 is missing when compared to the [[Masoretic Text]] and [[Septuagint]], suggesting that the scribe's eye may have skipped over part of the text.<ref name=\":3\" /> Abegg, [[Peter Flint (religious scholar)|Flint]], and Ulrich note that there are a number of errors of this nature that may represent a degree of carelessness on the part of the scribe.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn some cases, the variants from 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> have been incorporated in modern bible translations. An example is [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 53:11 where 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> and [[Septuagint]] versions match and clarify the meaning, while the [[Masoretic Text]] is somewhat obscure.<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Peter Flint (religious scholar)|Dr. Peter Flint]] notes that better readings from the [[Qumran]] scrolls such as [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 53:11 have been adopted by the [[New International Version]] translation and [[Revised Standard Version]] translation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2013/04/17/The-Great-Isaiah-Scroll-and-the-Original-Bible-An-Interview-with-Dr-Peter-Flint.aspx|title=The Great Isaiah Scroll and the Original Bible: An Interview with Dr. Peter Flint|last=Barry|first=John D|website=www.biblearchaeology.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]\n* [[Book of Isaiah]]\n* [[Essenes]]\n* [[Masoretic text]]\n* [[American Schools of Oriental Research]]\n* [[Qumran Caves]]\n* [[1QIsab|IQIsa<sup>b</sup>]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Kutscher, E.Y.
