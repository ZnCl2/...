It is located where the [[Valley of Rephaim]] and the [[Valley of Hinnom]] meet, on the old road from Jerusalem to Bethlehem.<ref>[http://www.begincenter.org.il/en/Article.aspx?CID=8155 Menachem Begin Heritage Center], Lookout and Reich Archaeological Garden.</ref>\n\nThe site consists of a series of rock-hewn burial chambers based on natural caverns.<ref>A photographic view of the site, showing the entrance to the tombs, is available at this [https://israeltours.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/1st-temple-tombs-ketef-hinnom.jpg link].</ref> In 1979, two tiny [[silver]] [[scroll]]s, inscribed with portions of the well-known prophylactic [[Priestly Blessing]] from the [[Book of Numbers]] and apparently once used as [[amulet]]s, were found in one of the burial chambers. The delicate process of unrolling the scrolls while developing a method that would prevent them from disintegrating took three years. They contain what may be the oldest surviving texts from the [[Hebrew Bible]], dating from around the late 7th to early 6th century BCE, and are now preserved at the [[Israel Museum]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Gabriel Barkay at Ketef Hinnom.jpg|thumb|250px|Gabriel Barkay at Ketef Hinnom]]\n\nThe scrolls were found in 1979 in Chamber 25 of Cave 24 at Ketef Hinnom, during excavations conducted by a team under the supervision of [[Gabriel Barkay]], who was then professor of archaeology at [[Tel Aviv University]].<ref>Barkay, Gabriel, et al., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3557916 \"The Challenges of Ketef Hinnom: Using Advanced Technologies to Recover the Earliest Biblical Texts and their Context],\" ''Near Eastern Archaeology'', 66/4 (2003): 162–171. The article includes an isometric drawing of the chamber where the find was made.</ref> The site appeared to be archaeologically sterile (the tomb had last been used for storing rifles during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period), but a chance discovery by a 13-year-old \"assistant\" revealed that a partial collapse of the ceiling long ago had preserved the contents of Chamber 25.<ref>[http://www.itsgila.com/highlightspriestly.htm \"Pilgrimage Panorama\" – Barkay's account of the finding of the scrolls.]</ref>\n\nA reconstruction indicates that there were five chambers and a central 'hall' in cave 24. The cave could hold about 22+ bodies on benches, each with a headrest of stone. Under three of the chambers in the cave there were repositories. The repositories were used for [[secondary burial]], which means that the bones and other remains of the long deceased body were removed and put into the repository, thus making space for another body on that particular bench.<ref>See article [[Secondary burial]].</ref> The chambers were neatly cut with smoothed surfaces using the [[royal cubit]] as measure. The repositories, such as that under chamber 25, had rough surfaces and a sack-like form, thus it was not intended to be seen. Ketef Hinnom cave 24 has a similar outline and capacity as the Mamilla cave complex 1 and 2, however, these cave complexes have more rooms than cave 24 at Ketef Hinnom. To accommodate more people Ketef Hinnom cave 24 has used the large chamber to the right to accommodate about 10 people, whereas this room in the Mamilla cave complexes did not have benches, thus probably they were used for chemical treatment of the bodies.\n\nThe repository under chamber 25 contained approximately 60&nbsp;cm of material with over a thousand objects: many small pottery vessels, artifacts of iron and bronze (including arrowheads), needles and pins, bone and ivory objects, glass bottles, and jewelry including earrings of gold and silver. In addition, the excavators found two tiny silver scrolls, referred to below as KH1 and KH2. The tomb had evidently been in use for several generations from about 650 BCE, that is towards the end of the [[First Temple]] period, and it continued to be used after the [[siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|destruction of Jerusalem]] in 587/6 BCE.\n\nKH1 was found in Square D, the middle of the repository, 7&nbsp;cm above the floor, while KH2 was found while sifting dirt from the lower half of the deposits in Square A, the innermost portion of the repository. Both amulets were separated from [[Hellenistic]] artifacts by 3 meters of length and 25&nbsp;cm of depth, and embedded in pottery and other material from the 7th/6th centuries BCE.\n\nBarkay initially dated the inscriptions to the late-7th/early-6th centuries BCE, but later revised this date downward to the early 6th century on paleographic grounds (the forms of the delicately incised [[paleo-Hebrew]] lettering) and on the evidence of the pottery found in the immediate vicinity. This dating was subsequently questioned by Johannes Renz and Wolfgang Rollig,<ref>Renz, Johannes and Wolfgang Röllig, ''Handbuch der althebräischen Epigraphik'' (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1995).</ref> who argued that the script was in too poor a condition to be dated with certainty and that a 3rd/2nd century BCE provenance could not be excluded, especially as the repository, which had been used as a kind of \"rubbish bin\" for the burial chamber over many centuries, also contained material from the fourth century BCE.\n\nA major re-examination of the scrolls was therefore undertaken by the [[University of Southern California]]'s West Semitic Research Project, using advanced photographic and computer enhancement techniques which enabled the script to be read more easily and the paleography to be dated more confidently. The results confirmed a date immediately prior to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 586/7 BCE.<ref>Barkay, G., A.G. Vaughn, M.J. Lundberg and B.

Kyle McCarter, Jr.|Kyle McCarter]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]], a specialist in ancient [[Semitic scripts]], has said the study should \"settle any controversy over [the date of] these inscriptions\".<ref name=Silver>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/28/science/28scro.html?_r=1&8dpc=&pagewanted=all&position=&oref=slogin \"Solving a Riddle Written in Silver\", ''New York Times'', 2004].</ref>\n\n== Significance ==\nThe 2004 team described the scrolls as \"one of most significant discoveries ever made\" for biblical studies.<ref>Barkay, Gabriel, et al., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3557916 \"The Challenges of Ketef Hinnom: Using Advanced Technologies to Recover the Earliest Biblical Texts and their Context\"], ''Near Eastern Archaeology'', 66/4 (Dec. 2003): 162-171.</ref> Apart from their significance for our knowledge of the development of the Hebrew alphabet, the scrolls \"preserve the earliest known citations of texts also found in the Hebrew Bible and ... the earliest examples of confessional statements concerning Yahweh.\" The reference to Yahweh as \"Rebuker of Evil,\" found in later incantations and amulets associated with Israel, is evidence that these artifacts were also amulets.<ref name=Silver />\n\nDr. Wayne Pitard has stated that although evidence for the antiquity of the Priestly Blessing is now compelling, this does not necessarily mean that the [[Book of Numbers]] already existed at that time.<ref name=Silver /> Dr. James R. Davila has similarly pointed out that the idea that while the scrolls show that \"some of the material found in the Five Books of Moses existed in the First Temple period\", the suggestion that they are \"proof that the Five Books of Moses were in existence during the First Temple period\" (as described in an article in the Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'') is \"an overinterpretation of the evidence.\" <ref>Davila, James, [http://paleojudaica.blogspot.com/2004_09_26_archive.html#109644758320238769 \"MORE ON THE KETEF HINNOM AMULETS in Ha'aretz],\" ''Paleojudaica'', Sept. 2004.</ref>\n\nAccording to the team which led the most conclusive reexamination of the scrolls:\n\n{{quote|Based on our new analysis and reading of these texts, we can reaffirm with confidence that the late preexilic period is the proper chronological context for the artifacts. We can further reassert the conclusion reached by most scholars: that the inscriptions found on these plaques preserve the earliest known citations of texts also found in the Hebrew Bible and that they provide us with the earliest examples of confessional statements concerning Yahweh.<ref>Barkay, G., A.G.

You O YHWH, will guard them; you will protect him from this generation forever. On every side the wicked prowl, a vileness is exalted among humankind.\"<ref>Smoak, ''ibid''., 427–428.</ref>\n\n== Indirect literary dependency ==\nThe possibility of an extended parallel between Deut. 7:9 and Amulet 1 suggests literary dependence between these two texts.{{cn|date=May 2017}}  Deut. 7:9 is commonly regarded as Decalogue interpretation (Exod. 20:6, Deut. 5:10). Granted a literary link between the amulet and Deut. 7:9, the direction of influence might be suggested as follows: 1) Exod. 20:6, 2) Deut. 5:10, 3) Deut. 7:9, 4) Ketef Hinnom amulet 1.<ref>Waaler, Erik, \"A reconstruction of Ketef Hinnom I,\" ''MAARAV'' 16/2 (2009[2011]): 261.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Biblical archaeology]]\n*[[Archaeology in Israel]]\n*[[List of artifacts significant to the Bible]]\n*[[Epigraphy]]\n*[[Paleography]]\n*[[Priestly Blessing]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal |last=Barkay |first=Gabriel |year=1983 |title=News From the Field: The Divine Name Found in Jerusalem |journal=Biblical Archaeology Review |volume=9:2 |issue=March/April |pages=14–9 |url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&Volume=9&Issue=2&ArticleID=8}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Barkay |first=Gabriel |year=2009 |title=The Riches of Ketef Hinnom: Jerusalem tomb yields Biblical text four centuries older than Dead Sea Scrolls |journal=Biblical Archaeology Review | volume=35:4 |issue=Jul/Aug Sep/Oct |pages= |url=http://www.bib-arch.org/bar/article.asp?PubID=BSBA&Volume=35&Issue=04&ArticleID=04&Page=0&UserID=0&/}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Barkay |first1=Gabriel |last2=Lundberg |first2=Marilyn J. |last3=Vaughn |first3=Andrew G. |last4=Zuckerman |first4=Bruce |last5=Zuckerman |first5=Kenneth |year=2003 |title=The Challenges of Ketef Hinnom: Using Advanced Technologies to Reclaim the Earliest Biblical Texts and Their Contexts |journal=Near Eastern Archaeology |volume=66:4 |issue=December |pages=162–71}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Barkay |first1=Gabriel |last2=Lundberg |first2=Marilyn J. |last3=Vaughn |first3=Andrew G. |last4=Zuckerman |first4=Bruce |year=2004 |title=The Amulets from Ketef Hinnom: A New Edition and Evaluation |journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research |volume=334 |issue=May |pages=41–70}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Berlejung |first=Angelika |date=January 2008 |title=Ein Programm fürs Leben.
