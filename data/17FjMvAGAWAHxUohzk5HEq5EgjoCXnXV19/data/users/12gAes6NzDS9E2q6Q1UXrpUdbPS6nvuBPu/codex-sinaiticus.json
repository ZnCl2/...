For example, in John 1:4 Sinaiticus and Codex Bezae are the only Greek manuscripts with textual variant ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἐστίν (''in him is life'') instead of ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ᾓν (''in him was life''). This variant is supported by Vetus Latina and some [[Coptic versions of the Bible#Sahidic|Sahidic]] manuscripts. This portion has a large number of corrections.<ref>[[Gordon Fee|Fee, G.

It could not have been written before 325 because it contains the [[Eusebian Canons]], which is a ''[[terminus post quem]]''. \"The ''terminus ante quem'' is less certain, but, according to Milne and Skeat, is not likely to be much later than about 360.\" <ref name = Bruce>[[Bruce Metzger|Metzger, Bruce M.]], (1991).

Kenyon, \"Handbook to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament\", London<sup>2</sup>, 1912, p. 83.</ref>\n\n==== Scribes and correctors ====\nTischendorf believed that four separate scribes (whom he named A, B, C and D) copied the work and that five correctors (whom he designated a, b, c, d and e) amended portions. He posited that one of the correctors was contemporaneous with the original scribes, and that the others worked in the 6th and 7th centuries. It is now agreed, after Milne and Skeat's reinvestigation, that Tischendorf was wrong, in that scribe C never existed.<ref>Milne, H. J. M. and Skeat, T. C., (1938). ''Scribes and Correctors of the Codex Sinaiticus'', London: British Museum, pp. 22–50.</ref> According to Tischendorf, scribe C wrote the poetic books of the Old Testament. These are written in a different format from the rest of the manuscript – they appear in two columns (the rest of books is in four columns), written stichometrically. Tischendorf probably interpreted the different formatting as indicating the existence of another scribe.<ref name = Jongkind>Jongkind, Dirk (2007), pp. 22–50.

His diary was published in 1879, in which was written:\n<blockquote>In questo monastero ritrovai una quantità grandissima di codici membranacei... ve ne sono alcuni che mi sembravano anteriori al settimo secolo, ed in ispecie una Bibbia in membrane bellissime, assai grandi, sottili, e quadre, scritta in carattere rotondo e belissimo; conservano poi in chiesa un Evangelistario greco in caractere d'oro rotondo, che dovrebbe pur essere assai antico.<ref>Lumbroso, G.

Later, in 1860, in his writings about the Sinaiticus discovery, Tischendorf wrote a narrative about the monastery and the manuscript that spanned from 1844 to 1859. He wrote that in 1844, during his first visit to the Saint Catherine's Monastery, he saw some leaves of parchment in a waste-basket. They were \"rubbish which was to be destroyed by burning it in the ovens of the monastery\",<ref>Skeat, T. C. (2000). \"The Last Chapter in the History of the Codex Sinaiticus\". ''Novum Testamentum''. Vol. '''42''', Fasc. 3, Jul., 2000. p. 313.</ref> although this is firmly denied by the Monastery. After examination he realized that they were part of the Septuagint, written in an early Greek uncial script. He retrieved from the basket 129 leaves in Greek which he identified as coming from a manuscript of the [[Septuagint]]. He asked if he might keep them, but at this point the attitude of the monks changed. They realized how valuable these old leaves were, and Tischendorf was permitted to take only one-third of the whole, i.e. 43 leaves. These leaves contained portions of 1 Chronicles, Jeremiah, Nehemiah, and Esther. After his return they were deposited in the [[Leipzig University Library]], where they remain. In 1846 Tischendorf published their contents, naming them the 'Codex Friderico-Augustanus' (in honor of [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony|Frederick Augustus]] and keeping secret the source of the leaves).<ref>[[Constantin von Tischendorf]], [https://archive.org/stream/Tischendorf.iv.monumentaSacraInedita.newcollection.subscript.6vols.1857-1870/02.MonumentaSacraInedita.NCVP.FragSacra.v2.Tischendorf.Subscript.1860.#page/n269/mode/2up ''Monumenta sacra inedita''] (Leipzig 1855), vol.

Tischendorf reached the monastery on 31 January; but his inquiries appeared to be fruitless. On 4 February, he had resolved to return home without having gained his object:\n[[File:Sinai litografia.jpg|thumb|right|Lithography of Saint Catherine's Monastery based on sketches made by Uspensky in 1857.]]\n<blockquote>\nOn the afternoon of this day I was taking a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as we returned, towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment with him in his cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: \"And I, too, have read a Septuagint\" – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from the corner of the room a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.<ref>See [http://rosetta.reltech.org/TC/extras/tischendorf-sinaiticus.html Constantin von Tischendorf, The Discovery of the Sinaitic Manuscript], Extract from Constantin von Tischendorf, (1866) ''When Were Our Gospels Written?

James Bentley gives an account of how this came about, prefacing it with the comment, \"Tischendorf therefore now embarked on the remarkable piece of duplicity which was to occupy him for the next decade, which involved the careful suppression of facts and the systematic denigration of the monks of Mount Sinai.\"<ref>Bentley, James (1986).

The codex is currently regarded by the monastery as having been stolen. This view is hotly contested by several scholars in Europe. [[Kirsopp Lake]] wrote:\n<blockquote>\nThose who have had much to do with Oriental monks will understand how improbable it is that the terms of the arrangement, whatever it was, were ever known to any except of the leaders.<ref>[[Kirsopp Lake|Lake, Kirsopp]], (1911). ''Codex Sinaiticus Petropolitanus: The New Testament, the Epistle of Barnabas and the Shepherd of Hermas'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. VI.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn a more neutral spirit, New Testament scholar [[Bruce Metzger]] writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nCertain aspects of the negotiations leading to the transfer of the codex to the Tsar's possession are open to an interpretation that reflects adversely on Tischendorf's candour and good faith with the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery. For a recent account intended to exculpate him of blame, see Erhard Lauch's article 'Nichts gegen Tischendorf' in ''Bekenntnis zur Kirche: Festgabe für Ernst Sommerlath zum 70. Geburtstag'' (Berlin, c. 1961); for an account that includes a hitherto unknown receipt given by Tischendorf to the authorities at the monastery promising to return the manuscript from Saint Petersburg 'to the Holy Confraternity of Sinai at its earliest request'.<ref>See Ihor Ševčenko, \"New Documents on Tischendorf and the Codex Sinaiticus\", published in the journal ''Scriptorium'', xviii (1964), pp. 55–80.</ref><ref>Metzger, Bruce A.

K. Elliott (1982) in ''Codex Sinaiticus and the Simonides Affair'', Thessaloniki: Patriarchal Institute for Patristic Studies, p. 16.</ref><ref>[http://www.sravnika.narod.ru/sin/sin3.htm Странное объявление Симонидеса о Синайском кодексе и ответ Тишендорфа].</ref> [[Constantin von Tischendorf]], who worked with numerous Bible manuscripts, was known as somewhat flamboyant, and had ambitiously sought money from several royal families for his ventures, who had indeed funded his trips. Simonides, whose name may be a synonym mocking Tischendorf, had a somewhat obscure history, as he claimed he was at Mt. Athos in the years preceding Tischendorf's contact, making the claim at least plausible. Simonides also claimed his father had died and the invitation to Mt. Athos came from his uncle, a monk there, but subsequent letters to his father were found among his possessions at his death. While the word 'forgery' has been bandied about among scholars regarding the claims on the Sinaiticus by Tischendorf, perhaps a more accurate rendering would be recollation and 'adjusted' restoration as Simonides, an expert on hieroglyphics which are represented throughout the Sinaiticus. Simonides claimed the false nature of the document in ''The Guardian'' in an exchange of letters among scholars and others, at the time. Henry Bradshaw, a British librarian known to both men, defended the Tischendorf find of the Sinaiticus, casting aside the accusations of Simonides. Since Bradshaw was a social 'hub' among many diverse scholars of the day, his aiding of Tischendorf was given much weight. Simonides died shortly after, and the issue lay dormant for many years.<ref>Letters of Constantine Simonides, Grolier Library, NY</ref>\n\nTischendorf answered in ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' (December), that only in the New Testament there are many differences between it and all other manuscripts. [[Henry Bradshaw (scholar)|Henry Bradshaw]], a scholar, contributed to exposing the frauds of Constantine Simonides, and exposed the absurdity of his claims in a letter to ''The Guardian'' (26 January 1863). Bradshaw showed that the Codex Sinaiticus brought by Tischendorf from the Greek monastery of Mount Sinai was not a modern forgery or written by Simonides. Simonides' \"claim was flawed from the beginning\".<ref>McKitterick, David (1998) ''A history of Cambridge University Press'', Volume 2: ''Scholarship and Commerce (1698–1872)'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-30802-X}}, page 369.</ref> The controversy seems to regard the misplaced use of the word 'fraud' or 'forgery' since it may have been a repaired text, a copy of the Septuagint based upon Origen's Hexapla, a text which has been rejected for centuries because of its lineage from Eusebius who introduced Arian doctrine into the courts of Constantine I and II.\n\nNot every scholar and Church minister was delighted about the codex. [[John William Burgon|Burgon]], a supporter of the [[Textus Receptus]], suggested that Codex Sinaiticus, as well as codices Vaticanus and Codex Bezae, were the most corrupt documents extant.

Unfortunately this development is not widely known in the English-speaking world, as only German- and Russian-language media reported on it in 2009. Doubts as to the legality of the gift arose because when Tischendorf originally removed the manuscript from Saint Catherine's Monastery in September 1859, the monastery was without an archbishop, so that even though the intention to present the manuscript to the Tsar had been expressed, no legal gift could be made at the time. Resolution of the matter was delayed through the turbulent reign of Archbishop Cyril (consecrated 7 December 1859, deposed 24 August 1866), and the situation only formalised after the restoration of peace.<ref name = Zacharova/>\n\nSkeat in his article \"The Last Chapter in the History of the Codex Sinaiticus\" concluded in this way:\n<blockquote>\nThis is not the place to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, as it seems to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the importance of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.<ref>Skeat, T. C.

It is the only [[uncial script|uncial]] manuscript with the complete text of the New Testament, and the only ancient manuscript of the New Testament written in four columns per page which has survived to the present day.<ref name = Aland/> With only 300 years separating the Codex Sinaiticus and the proposed lifetime of Jesus, it is considered by some to be more accurate than most New Testament copies in preserving readings where almost all manuscripts are assumed by them to be in error.<ref name = Kenyon/>\n\nFor the [[Gospel]]s, Sinaiticus is considered among some people as the second most reliable witness of the text (after Vaticanus); in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], its text is equal to that of Vaticanus; in the [[Epistles]], Sinaiticus is assumed to be the most reliable witness of the text. In the [[Book of Revelation]], however, its text is corrupted and is considered of poor quality, and inferior to the texts of [[Codex Alexandrinus]], [[Papyrus 47]], and even some minuscule manuscripts in this place (for example, [[Minuscule 2053]], [[Minuscule 2062|2062]]).<ref name = Bruce/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Bible}}\n* [[Biblical manuscript]]\n* [[List of New Testament uncials]]\n* [[Differences between codices Sinaiticus and Vaticanus]]\n* [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine]]\n* [[Syriac Sinaiticus]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=\"n\"|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== Text of the codex ===\n* [[Constantin von Tischendorf]], ''Fragmentum Codicis Friderico-Augustani'', in: [https://archive.org/stream/Tischendorf.iv.monumentaSacraInedita.newcollection.subscript.6vols.1857-1870/02.MonumentaSacraInedita.NCVP.FragSacra.v2.Tischendorf.Subscript.1860.#page/n269/mode/2up ''Monumenta sacra inedita''] (Leipzig 1855), vol.
