The Veronica database could be searched from most major Gopher menus. Although the original Veronica database is no longer accessible,{{when|date=May 2018}} various local Veronica installations and at least one complete rewrite (\"Veronica-2\") still exist.{{elucidate|date=January 2017}}{{clarify|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Naming==\nThe search engine was named after the character [[Veronica Lodge]] from [[Archie Comics]], an intentional analogy with the naming of the [[Archie search engine]], a search engine for [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP servers]].
