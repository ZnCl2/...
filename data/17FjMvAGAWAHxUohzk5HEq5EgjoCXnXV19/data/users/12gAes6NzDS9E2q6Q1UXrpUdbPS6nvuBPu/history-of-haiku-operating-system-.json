OpenBeOS differed from several other contemporary projects aiming to continue BeOS.\n\nFor example, Cosmoe and BlueEyedOS (both of which remain incomplete, and now appear to be inactive) took an existing [[Linux]] or [[BSD]] [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] and re-implemented Be's [[API]]s on top of it; this broke [[binary code compatibility]] with BeOS R5 and significantly deviated from the original design. By contrast, OpenBeOS planned an almost complete rewrite of the system, maintaining binary and [[source code compatibility]]. This should allow any existing BeOS R5 programs to run on the new system without being [[compiler|recompiled]].\n\nA first release of OpenBeOS was made in 2002.<ref name=\"OBOS-BeOS-Patch\">BeGroovy: [http://www.begroovy.com/wordpress/?p=260 OpenBeOS First Release]</ref> That release was no stand-alone operating system, instead it was a community-created update for BeOS 5.0.3 that contained open source replacements for a few BeOS components.\n\nIn 2004 a new project name was chosen in order to avoid infringing on Palm's trademarks.<ref name=\"OBOS-to-HAIKU\">OSNews: [http://www.osnews.com/story/7423/OpenBeOS-Becomes-Haiku/ OpenBeOS Becomes Haiku]</ref> The name was influenced by an official community vote, decided by project leaders and revealed at that year's WalterCon. The name \"Haiku\" was chosen to reflect the elegance and simplicity that attracted many to the BeOS platform, and is also a direct reference to the distinctive [[haiku]] error messages found in [[NetPositive]], the default BeOS web browser, and many other Be applications.\n\n[http://www.haiku-os.org/about/haiku_inc Haiku, Inc.], a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Rochester, New York]], was founded in 2003 by former project leader Michael Phipps to support the project and the development of the Haiku operating system.\n\n== Progress ==\n[[Image:OpenBeOS app-server Proto5.png|right|180px|thumb|OpenBeOS ''app_server'' Proto5]]\nOn April 29, 2002 OpenBeOS ''app_server'' prototype&nbsp;5 was released.<ref name=\"app_server-Proto5\">OSNews: [http://www.osnews.com/story.php/1003/OpenBeOS-Proto5-app_server-Replacement-Released OpenBeOS Proto5 app_server Replacement Released]</ref> It was the first release that was able to render windows.<ref name=\"DarkWyrmHaiku\">DarkWyrm: [http://darkwyrm.beemulated.net/haiku.htm Haiku blog]</ref>\n\nA number of major milestones were achieved in a six-week period during March to April 2005, such as the first graphical applications to run on Haiku itself<ref name=\"FirstGUI\">{{cite web|url=http://haiku.mlotz.ch/#log_20050321|title=Haiku weblog of Michael Lotz|publisher=}}</ref> (running with full 2D acceleration), and the first use of a web browser ([[Links (web browser)|Links]]) on Haiku.<ref name=\"FirstBrowse\">{{cite web|url=http://haiku.mlotz.ch/#log_20050410|title=Haiku weblog of Michael Lotz|publisher=}}</ref> Haiku does not use any code or binaries belonging to Be, Inc., including the drivers used for the graphics and network card in the original examples. Another major milestone was reached in July 2005, when the system was able to run the BeOS desktop [[operating system shell|shell]], [[OpenTracker|Tracker]].\n\nIn October 2005, Axel Dörfler, one of the most prolific Haiku developers, became the first full-time paid Haiku developer, working via funds donated by the community. He worked on CD booting, SMP and other kernel and app_server work. His employment continued until December 2005, when the funds allocated ran out.\n\nWork on the operating system continued; Haiku could now be booted and was semi-usable, however much work remained before a release could be made. Network and [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB) functionality were under heavy development, but the media_server lagged behind the other components.  Haiku was still quite unstable, as should be expected in its pre-release state, as crashes had been prevalent and no release date had been set. In January 2006, project developer Stephan Aßmus suggested that at the current level of development, R1 was at least a year away, maybe two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freelists.org/archives/openbeos/01-2006/msg00051.html|title=Re: OS Zoo|author=Stephan Assmus|date=2006-01-31|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2006, Haiku celebrated its fifth anniversary. Development on the aforementioned network and USB stacks continues rapidly, and it is expected that once these two last major remaining pieces of the operating system are  complete, Haiku will be suitable for day-to-day use by developers and testers.\n\nAfter a new website was launched, a contest was held to create Haiku's default icon set. The winner was Stephan Aßmus's set, \"stippi\". Aßmus was also the developer responsible for Haiku's icon creation tool, Icon-O-Matic, and integrating Haiku's own format of scalable vector graphics, [[Haiku Vector Icon Format]] (HVIF) into the Deskbar and Tracker. A partial implementation of the set can be found in the latest builds.\n\nIn January 2008, an official [http://www.haiku-os.org/about/teams/java Java for Haiku] team was created and was unanimously accepted by the [http://openjdk.java.net/groups/porters/ OpenJDK Porters Group] to port [[OpenJDK]] to Haiku.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haiku-os.org/news/2008-01-21/openjdk_porters_group_votes_to_sponsor_java_port_to_haiku|title=OpenJDK Porters Group Votes to Sponsor Java Port to Haiku|author=Jorge G.
