Despite the ''-im'' ending common to many plural nouns in Hebrew, the word ''Elohim'' when referring to God is grammatically singular, and takes a singular verb in the Hebrew Bible. The word is identical to the usual plural of ''el'' meaning gods or magistrates, and is cognate to the ''{{'}}lhm'' found in [[Ugarit]]ic, where it is used for the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of [[Canaanite mythology|Canaanite gods]], the children of El and conventionally vocalized as \"Elohim\" although the original Ugaritic vowels are unknown.  When the Hebrew Bible uses ''elohim'' not in reference to God, it is plural (for example, [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20:2). There are a few other such uses in Hebrew, for example ''[[Behemoth]]''. In [[Modern Hebrew]], the singular word ''ba'alim'' (\"owner\") looks plural, but likewise takes a singular verb.\n\nA number of scholars have traced the etymology to the Semitic root ''*yl'', \"to be first, powerful\", despite some difficulties with this view.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CmCVZ5mHsboC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mark+S.+Smith,+God+in+translation#v=onepage&q=elohim%20etymology&f=false |author=Mark S.

[[Hebrew grammar]] allows for this form to mean \"He is the Power (singular) over powers (plural)\", just as the word ''Ba'alim'' means \"owner\" (see above). \"He is lord (singular) even over any of those things that he owns that are lordly (plural).\"\n\nTheologians who dispute this claim cite the hypothesis that plurals of majesty came about in more modern times. Richard Toporoski, a classics scholar, asserts that plurals of majesty first appeared in the reign of [[Diocletian]] ({{sc|ce}}&nbsp;284–305).<ref>R. Toporoski, \"What was the origin of the royal \"we\" and why is it no longer used?\", (''[[The Times]]'', May 29, 2002. Ed. F1, p. 32)</ref> Indeed, [[Gesenius]] states in his book ''Hebrew Grammar''  the following:<ref>''Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar'' (A. E. Cowley, ed., Oxford, 1976, p.398)</ref>\n<blockquote>The Jewish grammarians call such plurals … ''plur. virium'' or ''virtutum''; later grammarians call them ''plur. excellentiae'', ''magnitudinis'', or ''plur. maiestaticus''.\n\nThis last name may have been suggested by the ''we'' used by kings when speaking of themselves (compare [[1 Maccabees]] 10:19 and 11:31); and the plural used by God in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:26 and 11:7; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 6:8 has been incorrectly explained in this way). It is, however, either ''communicative'' (including the attendant [[angels]]: so at all events in Isaiah 6:8 and Genesis 3:22), or according to others, an indication of ''the fullness of power and might'' implied. It is best explained as a plural of ''self-deliberation''. The use of the plural as a form of respectful address is quite foreign to Hebrew.</blockquote>\n\n[[Mark S. Smith]] has cited the use of plural as possible evidence to suggest an evolution in the formation of early Jewish conceptions of [[monotheism]], wherein references to \"the gods\" (plural) in earlier accounts of verbal tradition became either interpreted as multiple aspects of a single monotheistic God at the time of writing, or subsumed under a form of [[monolatry]], wherein the god(s) of a certain city would be accepted after the fact as a reference to the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]] and the plural deliberately dropped.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CmCVZ5mHsboC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mark+S.+Smith,+God+in+translation&source=bl&ots=FzHThONctW&sig=DJrqxkl7xwwXlGbVcY0V0hldC6Y&hl=en&ei=cv8CTLDPGcyeccuv3NUB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false Mark S.

(2002), \"The Early History of God: Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israel\" (Biblical Resource Series)</ref>\n\nThe plural form ending in ''-im'' can also be understood as denoting abstraction, as in the Hebrew words ''chayyim'' (\"life\") or ''betulim'' (\"virginity\"). If understood this way, ''Elohim'' means \"divinity\" or \"deity\". The word ''chayyim'' is similarly syntactically singular when used as a name but syntactically plural otherwise.\n\nIn many of the passages in which ''elohim'' occurs in the Bible it refers to non-Israelite deities, or in some instances to powerful men or judges, and even angels (Exodus 21:6, Psalms 8:5) as a simple plural in those instances.\n\n{{anchor|Elohei}}\n\n===Elohai===\nElohai or Elohei (\"My God\") is a form of Elohim along with the [[first person singular|first-person singular]] pronoun [[enclitic]]. It appears in the names \"God of [[Abraham]]\" (''Elohai Avraham''); \"God of Abraham, [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]\" (''Elohai Avraham, Elohai Yitzchak ve Elohai Yaʿaqov''); and \"God of [[Sarah]], [[Rebecca]], [[Leah]], and [[Rachel]]\" (''Elohai Sara, Elohai Rivka, Elohai Leah ve Elohai Rakhel'').\n\n===El Shaddai===\n{{Main|El Shaddai}}\nEl Shaddai ({{lang-he|{{audio|He-Shadai.ogg|{{Hebrew|אל שדי}}}}}}, {{IPA-he|ʃaˈda.i|pron}}) is one of the names of God in Judaism, with its [[etymology]] coming from the influence of the [[Ugaritic religion]] on modern Judaism. El Shaddai is [[English Bible translations|conventionally translated]] as \"God Almighty\". While the translation of ''El'' as \"[[god (word)|god]]\" in [[Ugarit]]/[[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] language is straightforward, the literal meaning of ''Shaddai'' is the subject of debate.\n\n===Tzevaot===\nTzevaot, Tsebaoth or Sabaoth ({{hebrew|{{linktext|צבאות}}}}, {{IPA-he|tsvaot||He-YhwhTzevaot.ogg}}, {{abbr|lit.|literally}}&nbsp;\"Armies\") appears in reference to armies or armed hosts of men in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]<ref>{{bibleref|Exod.|6:26}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exod.|7:4|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exod.|12:41|HE}}.</ref> but is not used as a divine epithet in the [[Torah]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], or [[Book of Judges|Judges]]. In the [[First Book of Samuel]], [[David]] uses the name [[#YHWH|YHWH]] Tzavaot and immediately glosses it as \"the God of the armies of Israel\".<ref>{{bibleref|1 Sam.|17:45|HE}}.</ref> The same name appears in the prophets along with YHWH [[#Eloah|Elohe]] Tzevaot, [[#Eloah|Elohey]] Tzevaot, and [[#Adonai|Adonai]] YHWH Tzevaot. These are usually translated in the [[King James Version]] as the \"Lord of Hosts\" or \"Lord God of Hosts\". In its later uses, however, it often denotes God in His role as leader of the [[Malakhim|heavenly host]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe jewish word ''Sabaoth'' was also absorbed in [[Ancient Greek|Ancient]] [[Greek alphabet#History|Greek]] (σαβαωθ, sabaoth) and [[Latin]] (''Sabaoth'', with no declination). \n[[Tertullian]] and other [[patristics]] used it with the meaning of ''Army of angels of God''.<ref>[[Karl Ernst Georges|Georges]], O.

In the [[Hebrew Bible]], it is nearly always used to refer to God (approximately 450 occurrences). As pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton came to be avoided in the [[Hellenistic period]], Jews may have begun to drop the Tetragrammaton when presented alongside Adonai and subsequently expand it to cover for the Tetragrammaton in the forms of spoken prayer and written scripture. Owing to the expansion of ''[[chumra]]'' (the idea of \"building a fence around the [[Torah]]\"), Adonai itself has come to be too holy to say for Orthodox Jews, leading to its replacement by [[#HaShem|HaShem]] (\"The Name\").\n\nThe singular forms adon and adoni (\"my lord\") are used in the Hebrew Bible as royal titles,<ref>{{citation |title=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |contribution=Lord |p=157 }}.</ref><ref>{{citation |title=Focus on the Kingdom |url=http://focusonthekingdom.org |contribution=Adonai and Adoni (Psalm 110:1) |contribution-url=http://focusonthekingdom.org/articles/adonai.htm |accessdate=5 June 2015 |publisher=[[Restoration Fellowship]] }}.</ref> as in the [[First Book of Samuel]],<ref>{{bibleref|1 Sam.|29:8|HE}}.</ref> and for distinguished persons. The [[Phoenician religion|Phoenicians]] used it as a title of [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], the origin of the [[ancient Greek religion|Greek]] [[Adonis]]. It is also used very occasionally in Hebrew texts to refer to God (e.g. Ps 136:3.)<ref>https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb/psa/136/3/t_conc_614003</ref>\n\n[[Deuteronomy]] 10:17 has the proper name ''Yahweh'' alongside the superlative constructions \"God of gods\" ''elōhê ha-elōhîm'' and \"Lord of lords\" ''adōnê ha-adōnîm '' ({{Hebrew|כִּי יְ  ה  וָ  ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶם הוּא אֱלֹהֵי הָֽאֱלֹהִים וַאֲדֹנֵי הָאֲדֹנִים }}; KJV: \"For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords\").\n\nThe final syllable of Adonai uses the vowel [[kamatz]], rather than [[patach]] which would be expected from the Hebrew for \"my lord(s)\". Prof. [[Yoel Elitzur]] explains this as a normal transformation when a Hebrew word becomes a name, giving as other examples [[Nathan (given name)|Nathan]], [[Yitzchak]], and [[Yigal]].<ref>Yoel Elitzur, ''Shemot HaEl VeTaarichei Ketivat Sifrei HaMiqra'', published in ''Be'einei Elohim VaAdam'', Beit Morasha Jerusalem: 2017, p 407 footnote 24; see also [https://www.academia.edu/27330839/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%99_%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90 link].</ref>\n\n===Adoshem===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\nUp until the mid-twentieth century, the use of the word ''Adoshem'', combining the first two syllables of \"Adonai\" with the last syllable of \"Hashem\"', was quite common. This was discouraged by Rabbi [[David HaLevi Segal]] in his commentary to the [[Shulchan Aruch]]. His rationale was that it is disrespectful to combine a Name of [[God]] with another word. It took a few centuries for the word to fall into almost complete disuse. Despite being obsolete in most circles, it is used occasionally in conversation in place of ''Adonai'' by Jews who do not wish to say ''Adonai'' but need to specify the substitution of that particular word. It is also used when quoting from the liturgy in a non-liturgical context, especially as a substitute in musical pieces where a replacement for \"Adonai\" must have the same number of syllables. For example, [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]] performed his prayer \"[[Shema Yisrael]]\" with the words ''Shema Yisrael Adoshem Elokeinu Adoshem Eḥad'' instead of ''Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Eḥad''.\n\n{{anchor|Baali}}\n===Baal===\n{{main|Baal}}\n[[Baal]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|əl}}),<ref name=oed>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1885), \"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/14174 Baal, ''n.'']\"</ref>{{refn|group=n|The [[American English|American pronunciation]] is usually the same<ref>''Oxford Dictionaries'' (2015), \"[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Baal Baal]\"</ref><ref name=mwo/> but some speakers prefer variants closer to the original sound, such as {{IPAc-en|b|ɑː|ˈ|ɑː|l|,_|b|ɑː|l}}.<ref name=mwo>''Merriam-Webster Online'' (2015), \"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/baal baal]\".</ref><ref>''Webb's Easy Bible Names Pronunciation Guide'' (2012), \"[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=IrrtAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT36 Baal]\".</ref>}} properly Baʿal,{{refn|group=n|The [[ʿ|half ring]] {{nowrap|{{angle brackets| ʿ }}}} or [[apostrophe]] {{nowrap|{{angle brackets| ' }}}} in the name Baʿal marks the original words' [[glottal stop]], a vocalization which appears in the middle of the [[English language|English]] word \"uh-oh\".{{sfnp|Cleghorn & al.|2011|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=RJKZAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA87 87]}}}} meant \"[[property|owner]]\" and, by extension, \"lord\",{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999|p=132}} \"[[slavery|master]]\", and \"[[husband]]\" in Hebrew and the other [[Northwest Semitic languages]].{{sfnp|Pope|2006}}{{sfnp|''DULAT''|2015|loc=\"[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bh6oBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA203 bʕl (II)]\"}} In some early contexts and [[theophoric name]]s, it and Baali ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|ə|l|aɪ}}; \"My Lord\") were treated as synonyms of [[Adon]] and Adonai.{{sfnp|''BEWR''|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dbibAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA102 \"Baal\"]}} After the time of [[Solomon]]<ref name=EJ675/> and particularly after [[Jezebel]]'s attempt to promote the worship of the Lord of [[Ancient Tyre|Tyre]] [[Melqart]],{{sfnp|''BEWR''|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dbibAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA102 \"Baal\"]}} however, the name became particularly associated with the [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] [[storm god]] [[Baʿal Haddu]] and was gradually avoided as a title for Yahweh.<ref name=EJ675>{{citation |title=Encyclopaedia Judaica, ''2nd&nbsp;ed.'' |volume=Vol.&nbsp;VII |p=675 }}.</ref> Several names that included it were rewritten as ''bosheth'' (\"shame\").{{sfnp|''ZPBD''|1963}} The [[prophet (Judaism)|prophet]] [[Hosea]] in particular reproached the [[Israelites]] for continuing to use the term:<ref>{{bibleref|Hos.|2:16|HE}}.</ref>\n{{quote|\"It will come about in that day,\" declares the [[Yahweh|{{smallcaps|Lord}}]], \"That you will call Me Ishi{{refn|group=n|Literally, \"my husband\".<ref>{{citation |first=Arie |last=Uittenbogaard |url=http://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Ishi.html#.UWSk3ddv2aU |title=Ishi &#124; The amazing name Ishi : meaning and etymology |publisher=Abarim Publications |date= |accessdate=21 May 2014 }}.</ref>}} And will no longer call Me Baali.\"<ref>{{bibleref|Hos.|2:16|NASB}} ([[New American Standard Bible|NASB]]).</ref>}}\n\n{{anchor|Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh|I am that I am}}\n===Ehyeh asher ehyeh===\n{{main|I Am that I Am}}\n{{listen|filename=He-EhyehAsherEhyeh.ogg|title=Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n''Ehyeh asher ehyeh'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה) is the first of three responses given to [[Moses]] when he asks for God's name in the [[Book of Exodus]].<ref name=ex314/> The [[King James Version]] of the Bible translates the Hebrew as \"[[I Am that I Am]]\" and uses it as a proper name for God.

The origin of the word is uncertain and it may be related to a root word, meaning \"reverence\". Elah is found in the [[Tanakh]] in the books of [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] (Jer 10:11, the only verse in the entire book written in Aramaic),<ref>Torrey 1945, 64; Metzger 1957, 96; Moore 1992, 704,</ref> and [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]. Elah is used to describe both pagan gods and the Jews' God. The word 'Elah - {{lang|ar|إله}}' is also an Arabic word which means god. The name is etymologically related to [[Allah]] {{lang|ar|الله}} used by [[Muslims]].\n* Elah Yisrael, God of Israel (Ezra 5:1)\n* Elah Yerushelem, God of Jerusalem (Ezra 7:19)\n* Elah Shemaya, God of Heaven (Ezra 7:23)\n* Elah-avahati, God of my fathers, (Daniel 2:23)\n* Elah Elahin, God of gods (Daniel 2:47)\n\n===El Roi===\n{{Main|El Roi}}\nIn the [[Book of Genesis]], [[Hagar]] is said to call the name of Yahweh who spoke to her through his [[angel]].

It appears chiefly in poetic and later Biblical passages. The modern Hebrew adjective \"`Elyon\" means \"supreme\" (as in \"Supreme Court\") or \"Most High\". ''El Elyon'' has been traditionally translated into English as 'God Most High'. The [[Phoenicians]] used what appears to be a similar name for God, one that the Greeks wrote as Έλιον.

In casual conversation some Jews, even when not speaking Hebrew, will call God ''HaShem'' ({{Hebrew|השם}}), which is Hebrew for \"the Name\" (cf. [[Leviticus]] 24:11 and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 28:58). Likewise, when quoting from the [[Tanakh]] or prayers, some pious Jews will replace ''Adonai'' with ''HaShem''. For example, when making [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio recordings]] of prayer services, ''HaShem''<ref>[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Theology/God/About_God/Hashem.shtml A name for God that simply means \"the Name.\"]</ref> will generally be substituted for ''Adonai''.\n\nA popular expression containing this phrase is ''Baruch HaShem'', meaning \"Thank [[God in Judaism|God]]\" (literally, \"Blessed be the Name\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/651431/jewish/Thank-G-d.htm |title=Thank G-d! |date= |accessdate=15 February 2015 |website=Chabad.org |publisher= |last=Greenbaum |first=Elisha |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Shalom===\n{{Main|Shalom}}\n[[Talmud]]ic authors,<ref>Rabbi Adah ben Ahabah and Rabbi Haninuna (possibly citing \"'Ulla\")</ref> ruling on the basis of [[Gideon]]'s name for an altar (\"YHVH-Shalom\", according to [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 6:24), write that \"the name of God is 'Peace'\" (''Pereq ha-Shalom'', Shab. 10b); consequently, a [[Talmud]]ic opinion (''Shabbat'', 10b) asserts that one would greet another with the word ''{{audio|He-Shalom.ogg|shalom}}'' in order for the word not to be forgotten in the [[Jewish diaspora|exile]]. But one is not permitted to greet another with the word ''{{audio|He-Shalom.ogg|shalom}}'' in unholy places such as a bathroom, because of holiness of the name.\n\n===Shekhinah===\n{{Main|Shekhinah}}\n''[[Shekhinah]]'' ({{Hebrew|{{audio|He-Shekhina.ogg|שכינה}}}}) is the presence or manifestation of God which has descended to \"dwell\" among humanity. The term never appears in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]]; later rabbis used the word when speaking of God dwelling either in the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]] or amongst the people of Israel. The root of the word means \"dwelling\". Of the principal names of God, it is the only one that is of the feminine gender in Hebrew grammar. Some believe that this was the name of a female counterpart of God, but this is unlikely as the name is always mentioned in conjunction with an article (e.g.: \"the Shekhina descended and dwelt among them\" or \"He removed Himself and His Shekhina from their midst\"). This kind of usage does not occur in Semitic languages in conjunction with proper names.\n\nThe [[Arabic language|Arabic]] form of the word \"''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Sakina|Sakīnah]]}}'' {{lang|ar|سكينة}}\" is also mentioned in the Quran. This mention is in the middle of the narrative of the choice of [[Saul]] to be king and is mentioned as descending with the [[Ark of the Covenant]], here the word is used to mean \"security\" and is derived from the root sa-ka-na which means dwell:\n:And (further) their Prophet said to them: \"A Sign of his authority is that there shall come to you the Ark of the Covenant, with (an assurance) therein of security from your Lord, and the relics left by the family of Moses and the family of Aaron, carried by angels.

Before transcribing any of the divine titles or name he prepares mentally to sanctify them. Once he begins a name he does not stop until it is finished, and he must not be interrupted while writing it, even to greet a king. If an error is made in writing it may not be erased, but a line must be drawn round it to show that it is canceled, and the whole page must be put in a ''[[genizah]]'' (burial place for scripture) and a new page begun.\n\n==Kabbalistic use==\nOne of the most important names is that of the [[Ein Sof]] ({{lang|he|אין סוף}} \"Endless\"), which first came into use after {{sc|ce}}&nbsp;1300.<ref>{{citation |title=Encyclopaedia Judaica, ''2nd&nbsp;ed.'' |publisher=Keter Publishing House |volume=Vol.&nbsp;VI |p=232 }}.</ref> The forty-two-lettered name contains the combined names  {{lang|he|אהיה יהוה אדוני הויה}}, that when spelled out contains 42 letters. The equivalent in value of YHWH (spelled {{lang|he| יוד הא ואו הא}} = 45) is the forty-five-lettered name.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}\n\nThe seventy-two-lettered name is derived from three verses in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] (14:19–21) beginning with \"Vayyissa\", \"Vayyabo\" and \"Vayyet\" respectively. Each of the verses contains 72 letters, and when combined they form 72 names, known collectively as the [[Shemhamphorasch]]. The [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] book ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'' explains that the creation of the world was achieved by the manipulation of these sacred letters that form the names of God.\n\n==English names==\nThe words \"God\" and \"Lord\" are written by [[Chumra|some]] Jews as \"G-d\" and \"L-rd\" as a way of avoiding writing any name of God in full out of respect. [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+12%3A3-4 12:3–4] reads, \"And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place. Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God.\" From this it is understood that one should not erase or blot out the name of God. The general [[halacha|halachic]] opinion is that this only applies to the sacred Hebrew names of God, but not to other euphemistic references; there is a dispute whether the word \"God\" in English or other languages may be erased or whether Jewish law and/or Jewish custom forbids doing, directly or as a precautionary \"fence\" about the law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shaimos.org/guidelines.htm |title=Shaimos guidelines |publisher=Shaimos.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227045319/http://www.shaimos.org/guidelines.htm |archivedate=2011-12-27 |df= }}</ref>. The hyphenated version of the English name (\"G-d\") can without a doubt be erased, blotted out, shredded, or burned, so by assiduously following the policy and practice of writing the name \"G-d\" without a hyphen in place of the \"o\", religious Jews prevent documents in their possession with the unhyphenated, more sacred word from later being shredded, burned, erased, blotted out, or otherwise destroyed. The same thing can be generally be done by substituting a euphemistic English reference like \"Hashem\" (literally, \"the Name\") or one further step removed, an unobtrusive abbreviation of \"Hashem\" as euphemism written most commonly in small print in the document margin, such as B''H (B'ezrat Hashem, literally, \"By the blessing of the Name\".)\n\nThis particular issue is most controversial in the context of the United States Motto, \"In G-d We Trust\", which has historically been minted or printed since its first appearance in 1864 without hyphenation, in compliance with Christian custom but in violation of the protective Shaimos practices of many American Jews, as exhibited in their customary preservative, conservational bias toward G-d with hyphenation. While many Jews will write the name \"God\" in English on a strip of paper or in digital media, others will not, except in rare and exceptional circumstances. By comparison, Israel struck down efforts to enshrine an allusive reference to G-d (ב''ה, literally \"B '' H\", an abbreviation of the allusion \"Blessed by the Name\") on modern Israeli currency in 2002, 2003, and 2009. The velocity of currency destruction (by shredding, melting, or mutilation) is too high for Israelis to tolerate the name of G-d being printed or minted on Israeli banknotes or coins, and according to Talmudic Tractate Rosh Hashana (18B4), Jews in the times of the Hasmonean Kingdom were \"weaned off\" the practice of writing the name of Heaven by the Sages, arguing that such documents could be disposed of thoughtlessly in a dungheap. The day the Sages succeeded in weaning the people off the practice–the practice of writing the Name of Heaven superfluously on secular documents–was celebrated as a holiday in ancient Israel on the Third of Tishrei, a date now dedicated to the [[Fast of Gedaliah]], which is conceptually related, as it establishes that \"the death of the righteous is likened to the burning of the House of our G-d\". It is logically consistent with the practice of hyphenating G-d's Name to wish to modify or abolish the United States National Motto, \"In G-d We Trust\", from its present form, as an reckless and disrespectful way of treating the chief, primary and exemplary name of G-d in the world's most important current [[lingua franca]] and security language.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Judaism}}\n* [[Baal Shem]]\n* [[Besiyata Dishmaya]]\n* [[Names of God]]\n* [[Names of God in Christianity]]\n* [[Names of God in Islam]]\n* [[Naming taboo]] (a similar prohibition in [[China]])\n* [[Sacred Name Bibles]]\n* [[Ten Commandments]]\n* [[Vishnu Sahasranama]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{citation |title=Britannica Encyclopedia of World Religions |editor-last=Frassetto |editor-first=Michael |display-editors=0 |date=2006 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbibAAAAQBAJ |ref={{harvid|''BEWR''|2006}} |isbn=978-1-59339-491-2 }}.\n* {{citation |editor-last=Olmo Lete |editor-first=Gregorio del |editor2-last=Sanmartin |editor2-first=Joaquin |editor3-last=Watson |editor3-first=Wilfred G.E. |display-editors=0 |title=Diccionario de la Lengua Ugarítica, ''3rd&nbsp;ed.'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bh6oBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |date=2015 |location=Leiden |publisher=translated from the Spanish for E.J.
