In the Linux kernel, it is referred to as \"BeFS\" to avoid confusion with [[Boot File System]].\n\nBFS was developed by [[Dominic Giampaolo]] and [[Cyril Meurillon]] over a ten-month period, starting in September 1996,<ref name=\"practical-book\">{{cite book | last=Giampaolo | first=Dominic | year=1999 | url=http://www.nobius.org/~dbg/practical-file-system-design.pdf | title=Practical File System Design with the Be File System | publisher=Morgan Kaufmann | isbn=1-55860-497-9 | format=PDF}}</ref> to provide [[BeOS]] with a modern [[64-bit]] capable [[journaling file system]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/03/29/windows_on_a_database_sliced/ | title=Windows on a database – sliced and diced by BeOS vets | author=Andrew Orlowski | date=2002-03-29 | publisher=The Register | accessdate=2006-12-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061230040241/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/03/29/windows_on_a_database_sliced/| archivedate= 30 December 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It is [[case-sensitive]] and capable of being used on [[floppy]], [[hard disk]]s and read-only media such as [[CD-ROM]]s. However, its use on small removable media is not advised, as the file-system headers consume from 600 KB to 2 MB, rendering floppy disks virtually useless.\n\nLike its predecessor, OFS (Old Be File System, written by [[Benoit Schillings]] - formerly BFS),<ref name=\"bortmaninterview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.birdhouse.org/beos/bible/bos/int_schillings.html | title=Benoît Schillings, Software Engineer | author=Henry Bortman | work=The BeOS Bible | accessdate=2006-09-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060927061917/http://www.birdhouse.org/beos/bible/bos/int_schillings.html| archivedate= 27 September 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> it includes support for extended file attributes ([[Metadata (computing)|metadata]]), with indexing and querying characteristics to provide functionality similar to that of a [[relational database]].\n\nWhilst intended as a 64-bit-capable file system, the size of some on-disk structures mean that the practical size limit is approximately 2 [[exabytes]]. Similarly the extent-based file allocation reduces the maximum practical file size to approximately 260 gigabytes at best and as little as a few blocks in a pathological worst case, depending on the degree of [[file system fragmentation|fragmentation]].\n\nIts design process, [[application programming interface]], and internal workings are, for the most part, documented in the book ''Practical File System Design with the Be File System''.<ref name=\"practical-book\" />\n\n==Implementations==\nIn addition to the original 1996 BFS used in [[BeOS]], there are several implementations for [[Linux]]. In early 1999, Makoto Kato developed a Be File System driver for Linux; however, the driver never reached a complete stable state, so in 2001 Will Dyson developed his own version of the Linux BFS driver.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://befs-driver.sourceforge.net/about.php | title=BeFS driver for Linux: About BeFS | author=Will Dyson | year=2002 | publisher=SourceForge | accessdate=2006-12-09 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002 Axel Dörfler and a few other developers created and released a reimplemented BFS called OpenBFS for [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]] (OpenBeOS back then).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haikunews.org/482 |title=OBFS Reaches Beta |author=Daniel Teixeira |date=2002-09-04 |work=Haiku News |accessdate=2006-12-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004111533/http://haikunews.org/482 |archivedate=2006-10-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> In January 2004, Robert Szeleney announced that he had developed a fork of this OpenBFS file system for use in his [[SkyOS]] operating system.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.skyos.org/?q=node/210 | title=Update | author=Robert Szeleney | date=2004-01-23 | work=skyos.org | accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref> The regular OpenBFS implementation was also ported to [[Syllable Desktop|Syllable]] and has been included since version 0.6.5.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of file systems]]\n* [[AtheOS File System]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/06/the-beos-filesystem.ars The BeOS file system: an OS geek retrospective], by Andrew Hudson, 2010-06-03, Ars Technica\n\n{{BeOS}}\n{{Filesystem}}\n{{Haiku Software}}\n\n[[Category:Disk file systems]]\n[[Category:BeOS]]\n[[Category:Haiku (operating system)]]",
