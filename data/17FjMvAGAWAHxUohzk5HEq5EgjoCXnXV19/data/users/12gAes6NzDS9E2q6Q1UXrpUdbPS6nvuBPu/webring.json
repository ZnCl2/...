            "text": "A '''webring''' (or '''web ring''') is a collection of [[website]]s [[Hyperlink|linked]] together in a circular structure, and usually organized around a specific theme, often educational or social.<ref>ICT Roger Crawford - Heinemann IGCSE - glossary</ref> They were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly among amateur websites.\n\nTo be a part of the webring, each site has a common [[navigation bar]]; it contains links to the previous and next site. By selecting next (or previous) repeatedly, the user will eventually reach the site they started at; this is the origin of the term webring. However, the select-through route around the ring is usually supplemented by a central site with links to all member sites; this prevents the ring from breaking completely if a member site goes offline.\nA webring is managed from one website which is able to omit the websites that have dropped out or are no longer reachable. The advantage of a webring is that if the user is interested in the topic on one website, they can quickly connect to another website on the same topic.<ref>ICT Roger Crawford - Heinemann IGCSE - Chapter 7 page 192</ref> \nWebrings usually have a moderator who decides which pages to include in the webring. After approval, webmasters add their pages to the ring by 'linking in' to the ring; this requires adding the necessary [[HTML]] or [[JavaScript]] to their site.\n\nSites usually join a webring in order to receive traffic from related sites. When used to improve search engine rankings, webrings can be considered a [[search engine optimization]] technique.\n\nWebrings are mainly viewed as a relic of the early web of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Hover2015\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hover.com/blog/what-ever-happened-to-webrings/|title=What Ever Happened To Webrings?}}</ref>  When the primary site that managed web rings, webring.org was acquired by Yahoo, \"ring masters\" lost access to their webrings<ref name=\"Hover2015\" /> and the web ring hubs were replaced by a Yahoo page.<ref name=\"Hover2015\" />  By the time Yahoo stopped controlling webring.org in 2001, search engines had become good enough that web rings were no longer as useful.<ref name=\"Hover2015\" />  The webring.org site was still active in the mid-2010s.<ref name=\"Hover2015\"/>\n\n==WebRing.com==\n\n[[Denis Howe (editor)|Denis Howe]] started EUROPa (Expanding Unidirectional Ring Of Pages) at [[Imperial College]] in 1994.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/europa.html |title=Expanding Unidirectional Ring Of Pages |access-date=2005-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405175856/http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/europa.html |archive-date=2005-04-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> The idea developed further when [[Giraldo Hierro]] conceptualized a central [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] (Common Gateway Interface) script to enhance functionality. [[Sage Weil]] developed such a script in May 1994. Weil's script gained popularity, pushing Weil in June 1995 to form a company called WebRing. In 1997, Weil sold WebRing to [[Starseed, Inc.]]<ref>{{Cite news| last = Newton| first = Matthew| title = The 1st annual Web Innovator Awards - Sage Weil, Webring| work = Builder.com| accessdate = 2016-07-17| date = 1998-04-15| url = http://builder.cnet.com/Business/Innovators97/ss18.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20000815053629/http://builder.cnet.com/Business/Innovators97/ss18.html| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2000-08-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998 Starseed was acquired by [[GeoCities]], who made no major changes to the system. Just a few months later, in early 1999, [[Yahoo!]] bought GeoCities, and eighteen months after the acquisition, on September 5, 2000, Yahoo! unveiled a fully overhauled WebRing, known as Yahoo! WebRing. Although Yahoo!'s implementation was meant to streamline the way the rings were managed and provide a more consistent interface for all rings, many of these changes were unpopular with ringmasters accustomed to the older system which gave them more flexibility.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mieszkowski|first=Katharine|date=2001-12-05|url=https://www.salon.com/2001/12/05/webring/|title=The strange saga of Yahoo and WebRing|publisher=Salon.com}}</ref>\n\nOn April 15, 2001, Yahoo! pulled their support of WebRing, leaving it in the hands of one technician from the original WebRing, Timothy Killeen. He unveiled a WebRing free of Yahoo! influence on October 12, 2001. In the years since this change, many of the features which had been stripped by Yahoo!, particularly customization options, were reimplemented into the WebRing system.\n\nOn September 26, 2006, Webring Inc. announced a new WebRing Premium Membership Program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dir.webring.com/h/transition|title=Member Program Transition|publisher=WebRing|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref> They have separated memberships into two types, WebRing 1.0 and WebRing 2.0. Sites that are part of WebRing 1.0 will be limited to 50 webrings per URL. Existing 1.0 members can maintain more than 50, but can not add more. In conjunction with the premium membership program, WebRing introduced an [[affiliate program]], in which webmasters earn money when others join webrings from their site; they earn an additional payment if the new member purchases a premium membership.\n\nIn early October 2007, Webring was granted a trademark on \"Webring\" from the USA Trademark office. Also in that month, Yahoo's long partnership ended as Webring ownership repurchased Webring stock held by Yahoo, marking the first time since the late 1990s that Webring was again privately held.\n\n==Alt-webring==\n\nA similar website was Alt-webring.com,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alt-webring.com/ |title=the alternative webring system |publisher=alt-webring.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref> using the Ringlink (Free CGI Perl program for running webrings.).<ref>{{cite web|author=Ringlink |url=http://www.ringlink.org/index.php |title=Ringlink Homepage |publisher=Ringlink.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref> \nThe first \"Alt-webring\" first appeared in the Internet Archive on September 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alt-webring.com |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-26}}{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://alt-webring.com |date=* }}</ref> Alt-webring.com has since closed.\n\n==Webringo==\n\nA reborn website is Webringo.com,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webringo.com/ |title=Free Web Rings |publisher=WebRingo |date= |accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref> run as a hobby by the RingMaster.
