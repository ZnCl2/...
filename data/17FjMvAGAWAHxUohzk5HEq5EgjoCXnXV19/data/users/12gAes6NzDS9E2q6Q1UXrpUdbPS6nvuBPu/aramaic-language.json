More specifically, it is part of the [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic group]], which also includes the [[Canaanite languages]] such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. The [[Aramaic alphabet]] was widely adopted for other languages and is ancestral to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]] and [[Arabic alphabet]]s. During its approximately 3,100 years of written history,<ref>Beyer (1986: 11) suggests that written Aramaic probably dates from the 11th century BC, as it is established by the 10th century, to which he dates the oldest inscriptions of northern Syria. Heinrichs (1990: x) uses the less controversial date of the 9th century, for which there is clear and widespread attestation.</ref> Aramaic has served variously as a language of administration of empires and as a language of divine worship, religious study and as the spoken tongue of a number of [[Semitic people]]s from the [[Near East]].\n\nHistorically, Aramaic was the language of [[Aramean]] tribes, a Semitic people of the region around between the northern [[Levant]] and the northern Euphrates valley. By around 1000 BC, the Arameans had a string of kingdoms in what is now part of western [[Syria]]. Aramaic rose to prominence under the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC), under whose influence Aramaic became a prestige language, and its use spread throughout most of [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Levant]]. At its height, variants of Aramaic were spoken all over in what is today [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Palestinian territories]], [[Kuwait]], [[Eastern Arabia]], Northern Arabia, and to a lesser extent parts of southeast and south central [[Turkey]], and parts of northwest [[Iran]].<ref name=\"om\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tsZdAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT253&dq|first=Hilary|last=Kilpatrick|chapter=Modernity in a Classical Arabic ''Adab'' Work, the ''Kitāb al-Aghānī''|page=253|title=Tradition and Modernity in Arabic Language And Literature|editor-first=J.

Therefore, there is not one singular, static Aramaic language; each time and place rather has had its own variation. The more widely spoken [[Eastern Aramaic]] and [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] forms are today largely restricted to northern Iraq, northeastern Syria, northwestern Iran and southeastern Turkey, whilst the severely endangered [[Western Neo-Aramaic]] is spoken by small communities in northwestern Syria.\n\nCertain dialects of Aramaic are also retained as a [[Sacred language|liturgical language]] by certain religious communities.

However, Aramaic remains a spoken, literary, and liturgical language for local Christians and also some [[Jews]]. Aramaic also continues to be spoken by the Assyrians of Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and northwest Iran, with diaspora communities in [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and southern [[Russia]]. The [[Mandaeans]] also continue to use [[Mandaic language|Mandaic Aramaic]] as a liturgical language, although most now speak Arabic as their [[first language]]. There are still also a small number of first-language speakers of [[Western Aramaic languages|Western Aramaic varieties]] in isolated villages in western Syria.\n\nThe turbulence of the last two centuries (particularly the [[Assyrian genocide]]) has seen speakers of first-language and literary Aramaic dispersed throughout the world. However, there are a number of sizable Assyrian towns in northern Iraq such as [[Alqosh]], [[Bakhdida]], [[Bartella]], [[Tesqopa]], and [[Tel Keppe]], and numerous small villages, where Aramaic is still the main spoken language, and many large cities in this region also have Assyrian Aramaic-speaking communities, particularly [[Mosul]], [[Erbil]], [[Kirkuk]], [[Dohuk]], and [[al-Hasakah]]. Aramaic is also experiencing a revival among [[Maronites in Israel]] in [[Jish]].<ref>{{cite news |date=9 November 2014 |title=Aramaic Israelis seek to revive endangered language of Jesus |url=http://www.jpost.com/Christian-News/Aramaic-Israelis-seek-to-revive-endangered-language-of-Jesus-381229 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |access-date=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Aramaic languages and dialects===\n[[File:YeshuaDSS.gif|thumb|\"[[Jesus]]\" in Jewish Aramaic]]\nAramaic is often spoken of as a single language, but is in reality a group of related languages.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Some Aramaic languages differ more from each other than the Romance languages do among themselves. Its long history, extensive literature, and use by different religious communities are all factors in the diversification of the language. Some Aramaic dialects are mutually intelligible, whereas others are not, not unlike the situation with modern [[varieties of Arabic]]. Some Aramaic languages are known under different names; for example, [[Syriac language|Syriac]] is particularly used to describe the [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic variety]] used in Christian ethnic communities in Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northeastern Syria, and northwestern Iran, and [[Saint Thomas Christians]] in India. Most dialects can be described as either \"Eastern\" or \"Western\", the dividing line being roughly the [[Euphrates]], or slightly west of it. It is also helpful to draw a distinction between those Aramaic languages that are modern living languages (often called \"Neo-Aramaic\"), those that are still in use as literary languages, and those that are extinct and are only of interest to scholars. Although there are some exceptions to this rule, this classification gives \"Modern\", \"Middle\", and \"Old\" periods, alongside \"Eastern\" and \"Western\" areas, to distinguish between the various languages and dialects that are Aramaic.\n\n==Writing system==\n{{Main|Aramaic alphabet}}\n[[File:Amen in East Syriac Aramaic language.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Amen in [[Syriac language|East Syriac Aramaic]]]]\n[[File:Syriac Sertâ book script.jpg|left|thumb|11th century book in [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac Serto]]]]\nThe earliest Aramaic alphabet was based on the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. In time, Aramaic developed its distinctive \"square\" style. The ancient Israelites and other peoples of [[Canaan]] adopted this alphabet for writing their own languages. Thus, it is better known as the [[Hebrew alphabet]] today. This is the writing system used in [[Biblical Aramaic]] and other Jewish writing in Aramaic. The other main writing system used for Aramaic was developed by Christian communities: a cursive form known as the [[Syriac alphabet]]. A highly modified form of the Aramaic alphabet, the [[Mandaic alphabet]], is used by the [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]].\n\nIn addition to these writing systems, certain derivatives of the Aramaic alphabet were used in ancient times by particular groups: the [[Nabataean alphabet]] in [[Petra]] and the [[Palmyrene alphabet]] in [[Palmyra]]. In modern times, [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] (see [[#Modern Eastern Aramaic|below]]) has sometimes been written in a [[Latin script]].\n\n==History==\n{| border=\"0\"  cellpadding=\"5\"  style=\"float:right; background:#ffffd9; margin-left:10px;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffffd9;\"|<timeline>\nImageSize = width:320 height:700\nPlotArea = right:40 top:10 left:40 bottom:10\nDateFormat = yyyy\nTimeAxis = orientation:vertical order:reverse\nPeriod = from:-1200 till:2005\nAlignBars = early\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:200 start:-1200\nColors =\n id:canvas value:rgb(1,1,0.85)\nBackgroundColors = canvas:canvas\nPlotData =\n width:15 color:red\n bar:test from:-1200 till:200 # Old Aramaic\nPlotData =\n width:15 color:orange\n bar:test from:200 till:1200 # Middle Aramaic\nPlotData =\n width:15 color:yellow\n bar:test from:1200 till:2005 # Modern Aramaic\nPlotData =\n bar:test at:-1200 mark:(line,white)\n at:-1200 shift:(10,0) text:12th c.

As such, the term covers over thirteen centuries of the development of Aramaic. This vast time span includes all Aramaic that is now effectively extinct.\n\nThe central phase in the development of Old Aramaic was its official use by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (500–330 BC). The period before this, dubbed \"Ancient Aramaic\", saw the development of the language from being spoken in Aramaean city-states to become a major means of communication in diplomacy and trade throughout [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, local vernaculars became increasingly prominent, fanning the divergence of an Aramaic [[dialect continuum]] and the development of differing written standards.\n\n===Ancient Aramaic===\n\"Ancient Aramaic\" refers to the earliest known period of the language, from its origin until it becomes the lingua franca of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. It was the language of the Aramean city-states of [[Damascus]], [[Hama]]th and [[Arpad, Syria|Arpad]].\n\n[[File:Bar-rakib.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ingot|Silver ingot]] of Bar-Rakib, son of Panammuwa II,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jtsa.edu/Documents/pagedocs/JANES/1986%2018/Younger18.pdf |title=Panammuwa II and Bar-Rakib: Two Structural Analyses, K.

These inscriptions are mostly diplomatic documents between Aramaean city-states. The alphabet of Aramaic at this early period seems to be based on the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and there is a unity in the written language. It seems that, in time, a more refined alphabet, suited to the needs of the language, began to develop from this in the eastern regions of Aram. Due to increasing Aramean migration eastward, the Western periphery of Assyria became bilingual in Akkadian and Aramean at least as early as the mid-9th century BC. As the Neo-Assyrian Empire conquered Aramean lands west of the Euphrates, [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] made Aramaic the Empire's second official language, and it eventually supplanted Akkadian completely.\n\nFrom 700 BC, the language began to spread in all directions, but lost much of its unity. Different dialects emerged in Assyria, Babylonia, the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. Around 600 BC, Adon, a [[Canaan]]ite king, used Aramaic to write to an Egyptian [[Pharaoh]].<ref name=\"Klaus Beyer 1986\">Klaus Beyer, ''The Aramaic Language, Its Distribution and Subdivisions'', (Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht Gottingen, 1986), 14.</ref>\n\n\"Chaldee\" or \"Chaldean Aramaic\" used to be common terms for the Aramaic of the Chaldean dynasty of [[Babylonia]]. It was used to describe [[Biblical Aramaic]], which was, however, written in a later style.

For centuries after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire (in 331 BC), Imperial Aramaic – or near enough for it to be recognisable – would remain an influence on the various native [[Iranian languages]]. Aramaic script and – as ideograms – Aramaic vocabulary would survive as the essential characteristics of the [[Pahlavi scripts]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author1-link=Wilhelm Geiger|first1=Wilhelm|last1=Geiger|first2=Ernst|last2=Kuhn|year=2002|title=Grundriss der iranischen Philologie: Band I.

Of them, the best known is the ''[[Story of Ahikar]]'', a book of instructive aphorisms quite similar in style to the biblical [[Book of Proverbs]]. Achaemenid Aramaic is sufficiently uniform that it is often difficult to know where any particular example of the language was written. Only careful examination reveals the occasional loan word from a local language.\n\nA group of thirty Aramaic documents from [[Bactria]] have been discovered, and an analysis was published in November 2006.

Aramaic that bears a relatively close resemblance to that of the 5th century BC can be found right up to the early 2nd century BC. The [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] imposed [[Greek language|Greek]] in the administration of [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]] from the start of their rule. In the 3rd century BC, Greek overtook Aramaic as the common{{clarify|date=August 2016}}<!--Common in what sense? Administrative? But that began in the 5th century. Vernacular / generally used? But Coptic was the vernacular of the non-Greek majority in Egypt, and Aramaic was the vernacular of the non-Greek majority in Syria.--> language in Egypt and Syria. However, a post-Achaemenid Aramaic continued to flourish from [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]], Assyria, Mesopotamia, through the Syrian Desert and into northern [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]].\n\n[[Biblical Aramaic]] is the Aramaic found in four discrete sections of the [[Hebrew Bible]]:\n* [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 4:8–6:18 and 7:12–26 – documents from the Achaemenid period (5th century BC) concerning the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem.\n* [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 2:4b–7:28 – five subversive tales and an apocalyptic vision.\n* [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 10:11 – a single sentence in the middle of a Hebrew text denouncing idolatry.\n* [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 31:47 – translation of a Hebrew place-name.\nBiblical Aramaic is a somewhat hybrid dialect. It is theorized that some Biblical Aramaic material originated in both Babylonia and Judaea before the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty. According to [[historical criticism]], defiant Jewish propaganda shaped Aramaic [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] during [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rule. These stories might have existed as oral traditions at their earliest stage. This might be one factor that led to differing collections of Daniel in the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Septuagint]] and the [[Masoretic Text]], which presents a lightly [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-influenced Aramaic.\n\nUnder the category of post-Achaemenid is Hasmonaean Aramaic, the official language of [[Hasmonean|Hasmonaean]] Judaea (142–37 BC). It influenced the Biblical Aramaic of the [[Qumran]] texts, and was the main language of non-biblical theological texts of that community. The major [[Targum]]s, translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, were originally composed in Hasmonaean. Hasmonaean also appears in quotations in the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]], although smoothed into its later context. It is written quite differently from Achaemenid Aramaic; there is an emphasis on writing as words are pronounced rather than using etymological forms.\n\nBabylonian [[Targum]]ic is the later post-Achaemenid dialect found in the [[Targum Onkelos|Targum Onqelos]] and [[Targum Jonathan]], the \"official\" targums. The original, Hasmonaean targums had reached Babylon sometime in the 2nd or 3rd century AD. They were then reworked according to the contemporary dialect of Babylon to create the language of the standard targums. This combination formed the basis of Babylonian Jewish literature for centuries to follow.\n\nGalilean Targumic is similar to Babylonian Targumic. It is the mixing of literary Hasmonaean with the dialect of [[Galilee]]. The Hasmonaean targums reached Galilee in the 2nd century AD, and were reworked into this Galilean dialect for local use. The Galilean Targum was not considered an authoritative work by other communities, and documentary evidence shows that its text was amended. From the 11th century AD onwards, once the Babylonian Targum had become normative, the Galilean version became heavily influenced by it.\n\nBabylonian Documentary Aramaic is a dialect in use from the 3rd century AD onwards. It is the dialect of Babylonian private documents, and, from the 12th century, all Jewish private documents are in Aramaic. It is based on Hasmonaean with very few changes. This was perhaps because many of the documents in BDA are legal documents, the language in them had to be sensible throughout the Jewish community from the start, and Hasmonaean was the old standard.\n\n[[Nabataean Aramaic]] is the language of the Arameo-Arab kingdom of [[Petra]]. The kingdom (''c.'' 200 BC–106 AD) covered the east bank of the [[Jordan River]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northern Arabia. Perhaps because of the importance of the caravan trade, the Nabataeans began to use Aramaic in preference to [[Ancient North Arabian|Old North Arabic]]. The dialect is based on Achaemenid with a little influence from Arabic: \"l\" is often turned into \"n\", and there are a few Arabic loanwords. Some Nabataean Aramaic inscriptions exist from the early days of the kingdom, but most are from the first four centuries AD The language is written in a [[cursive]] script that is the precursor to the modern [[Arabic alphabet]]. The number of Arabic loanwords increases through the centuries, until, in the 4th century, Nabataean merges seamlessly with [[Arabic]].\n\nPalmyrene Aramaic is the dialect that was in use in the [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]] city state of [[Palmyra]] in the Syrian Desert from 44 BC to 274 AD. It was written in a rounded script, which later gave way to cursive [[Syriac alphabet|Estrangela]]. Like Nabataean, Palmyrene was influenced by Arabic, but to a much lesser degree.\n\nThe use of ''written'' Aramaic in the Achaemenid bureaucracy also precipitated the adoption of Aramaic(-derived) scripts to render a number of [[Middle Iranian]] languages. Moreover, many common words, including even pronouns, particles, numerals, and auxiliaries, continued to written as Aramaic \"words\" even when writing Middle Iranian languages. In time, in Iranian usage, these Aramaic \"words\" became disassociated from the Aramaic language and came to be understood as ''signs'' (i.e. [[logograms]]), much like the symbol '&' is read as \"and\" in English and the original Latin ''et'' is now no longer obvious. Under the early 3rd-century BCE [[Arsacid Empire|Parthians Arsacids]], whose government used Greek but whose native language was [[Parthian language|Parthian]], the Parthian language and its Aramaic-derived writing system both gained prestige. This in turn also led to the adoption of the name '[[Pahlavi scripts|pahlavi]]' (< ''parthawi'', \"of the Parthians\") for that writing system. The [[Sassanid empire|Persian Sassanids]], who succeeded the Parthian Arsacids in the mid-3rd century CE, subsequently inherited/adopted the Parthian-mediated Aramaic-derived writing system for their own Middle Iranian ethnolect as well.<ref>Beyer. p. 28 n. 27; {{Cite book |title= Ancient Persia |pages=118–20 |last1= Wiesehöfer |first1= Josef |last2=Azodi |first2= Azizeh |isbn= |publisher= |year=}}</ref> That particular Middle Iranian dialect, [[Middle Persian]], i.e. the language of Persia proper, subsequently also became a prestige language. Following the conquest of the Sassanids by the Arabs in the 7th-century, the Aramaic-derived writing system was replaced by Arabic script in all but [[Middle Persian literature|Zoroastrian usage]], which continued to use the name 'pahlavi' for the Aramaic-derived writing system and went on to create the bulk of all Middle Iranian literature in that writing system.\n\n===Late Old Eastern Aramaic===\n{{Main|Eastern Aramaic languages}}\n[[File:Mandaic.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] [[Incantation bowl|magical \"demon trap\"]]]]\nThe dialects mentioned in the last section were all descended from Achaemenid Imperial Aramaic. However, the diverse regional dialects of Late Ancient Aramaic continued alongside these, often as simple, spoken languages. Early evidence for these spoken dialects is known only through their influence on words and names in a more standard dialect. However, these regional dialects became written languages in the 2nd century BC. These dialects reflect a stream of Aramaic that is not dependent on Imperial Aramaic, and shows a clear division between the regions of Mesopotamia, Babylon and the east, and Judah, Syria, and the west.\n\nIn the East, the dialects of Palmyrene and Arsacid Aramaic merged with the regional languages to create languages with a foot in Imperial and a foot in regional Aramaic. The written form of [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]], the language of the [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]] religion, was descended from the Arsacid chancery script.<ref>\"Iranian Scripts for Aramaic Languages,\" in the Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 341 (2006), pp. 53–62.</ref>\n\nIn the kingdom of [[Osroene]], centred on [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] and founded in 132 BC, the regional dialect became the official language: Old [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. On the upper reaches of the [[Tigris]], East Mesopotamian Aramaic flourished, with evidence from [[Hatra]], [[Assur]] and the [[Tur Abdin]]. [[Tatian]], the author of the gospel harmony the [[Diatessaron]] came from Assyria, and perhaps wrote his work (172 AD) in East Mesopotamian rather than Syriac or Greek. In Babylonia, the regional dialect was used by the Jewish community, Jewish Old Babylonian (from ''c.'' 70 AD). This everyday language increasingly came under the influence of Biblical Aramaic and Babylonian Targumic.\n\n===Late Old Western Aramaic===\n{{Main|Western Aramaic languages}}\nThe western regional dialects of Aramaic followed a similar course to those of the east. They are quite distinct from the eastern dialects and Imperial Aramaic. Aramaic came to coexist with Canaanite dialects, eventually completely displacing [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] in the first century BC and [[Hebrew language#Aramaic displaces Hebrew as a spoken language|Hebrew]] around the turn of the fourth century AD.\n\nThe form of Late Old Western Aramaic used by the Jewish community is best attested, and is usually referred to as Jewish Old Palestinian. Its oldest form is Old East Jordanian, which probably comes from the region of [[Caesarea Philippi]]. This is the dialect of the oldest manuscript of the [[Book of Enoch]] (''c.'' 170 BC). The next distinct phase of the language is called Old Judaean into the second century AD. Old Judean literature can be found in various inscriptions and personal letters, preserved quotations in the [[Talmud]] and receipts from [[Qumran]]. [[Josephus]]' first, non-extant edition of his ''[[The Jewish War]]'' was written in Old Judean.\n\nThe Old East Jordanian dialect continued to be used into the first century AD by pagan communities living to the east of the Jordan. Their dialect is often then called Pagan Old Palestinian, and it was written in a cursive script somewhat similar to that used for Old Syriac. A Christian Old Palestinian dialect may have arisen from the pagan one, and this dialect may be behind some of the Western Aramaic tendencies found in the otherwise eastern Old Syriac gospels (see [[Peshitta]]).\n\n====Languages during Jesus' lifetime====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n{{Further|Language of Jesus}}\nIt is generally believed by Christian scholars that in the first century, Jews in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] primarily spoke Aramaic with a decreasing number using [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as their first language, though many learned Hebrew as a liturgical language. Additionally, [[Koine Greek]] was the lingua franca of the Middle East in trade, among the Hellenized classes (much like French in the 18th,19th and 20th centuries in Europe), and in the Roman administration. [[Latin]], the language of the Roman army and higher levels of administration, had almost no impact on the linguistic landscape.\n\nIn addition to the formal, literary dialects of Aramaic based on [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean]] and Babylonian, there were a number of colloquial Aramaic dialects. Seven [[Western Aramaic languages|Western Aramaic varieties]] were spoken in the vicinity of Judea in [[Jesus]]' time. They were probably distinctive yet mutually intelligible. Old Judean was the prominent dialect of [[Jerusalem]] and Judaea. The region of [[Ein Gedi]] spoke the Southeast Judaean dialect. [[Samaria]] had its distinctive [[Samaritan Aramaic language|Samaritan Aramaic]], where the consonants \"[[he (letter)|he]]\", \"{{Transl|sem|[[heth]]}}\" and \"‘[[ayin]]\" all became pronounced as \"[[aleph]]\". Galilean Aramaic, the dialect of Jesus' home region, is only known from a few place names, the influences on Galilean Targumic, some rabbinic literature and a few private letters. It seems to have a number of distinctive features: [[diphthong]]s are never simplified into monophthongs. East of the Jordan, the various dialects of East Jordanian were spoken. In the region of [[Damascus]] and the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]], Damascene Aramaic was spoken (deduced mostly from Modern Western Aramaic). Finally, as far north as [[Aleppo]], the western dialect of Orontes Aramaic was spoken.\n\nThe three languages influenced one another, especially Hebrew and Aramaic. Hebrew words entered Jewish Aramaic (mostly technical religious words but also everyday words like עץ ''{{Transl|sem|ʿēṣ}}'' \"wood\"). Conversely, Aramaic words entered Hebrew (not only Aramaic words like ''māmmôn'' \"wealth\" but Aramaic ways of using words like making Hebrew ראוי ''rā’ûi'', \"seen\" mean \"worthy\" in the sense of \"seemly\", which is a calque of Aramaic ''{{Transl|sem|ḥzî}}'' meaning \"seen\" and \"worthy\").\n\nThe Greek of the [[New Testament]] often preserves non-Greek semiticisms, including transliterations of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] words:\n* Some are Aramaic, like ''talitha'' (ταλιθα), which represents the noun טליתא ''{{Transl|sem|ṭalyĕṯā}}'' (Mark 5:41).\n* Others can be either Hebrew or Aramaic like רבוני ''Rabbounei'' (Ραββουνει), which stands for \"my master/great one/teacher\" in both languages (John 20:16).\n\nThe 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' used Aramaic for much of its dialogue, specially reconstructed by a scholar, [[William Fulco]], S.J. Where the appropriate words (in first century Aramaic) were no longer known, he used the Aramaic of Daniel and fourth-century Syriac and Hebrew as the basis for his work.<ref>{{Cite news|title=What's up with Aramaic? - Thanks to 'The Passion of the Christ,' a near-dead, 2,500-year-old - language will reach the ears of millions|last=Darling|first=Cary|date=February 25, 2004|work=Fort Worth Star-Telegram}}</ref>\n\n==Middle Aramaic==\nThe 3rd century AD is taken as the threshold between Old and Middle Aramaic. During that century, the nature of the various Aramaic languages and dialects began to change. The descendants of Imperial Aramaic ceased to be living languages, and the eastern and western regional languages began to develop vital new literatures. Unlike many of the dialects of Old Aramaic, much is known about the vocabulary and grammar of Middle Aramaic.\n\n===Eastern Middle Aramaic===\nOnly two of the Old Eastern Aramaic languages continued into this period. In the north of the region, Old Syriac transitioned into Middle Syriac. In the south, Jewish Old Babylonian became Jewish Middle Babylonian. The post-Achaemenid, Arsacid dialect became the background of the new [[Mandaic language]].\n\n====Syriac====\n{{Main|Syriac language}}\n[[File:Estrangela.jpg|thumb|9th century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Syriac alphabet|Estrangela]] manuscript of [[John Chrysostom]]'s ''Homily on the [[Gospel of John]]'']]\n{{listen|filename=aboun.ogg|title=Abun dbashmayo|description=The [[Lord's Prayer]], ''Abun dbashmayo'', sung in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]}}\n\nSyriac (also \"Middle Syriac\") is the classical, literary, liturgical and often spoken language of [[Syriac Christianity]] to this day, particularly the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and [[Saint Thomas Christians]]. It originated in fifth century BC [[Achaemenid Assyria]], but its golden age was the fourth to sixth centuries. This period began with the translation of the Bible into the language: the [[Peshitta]] and the masterful prose and poetry of [[Ephrem the Syrian]]. Middle Syriac became the language of those opposed to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] leadership of the [[Church of the East]]. Missionary activity by Assyrian and [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christians]] led to the spread of Syriac from Mesopotamia and [[Iran|Persia]], into [[Central Asia]], [[Indian subcontinent|India]] and [[China]].\n\n==== Jewish Middle Babylonian Aramaic ====\n<!-- This section is linked, this language was taken from the Aramaic language of the Byzantines from [[Halakha]] -->\n{{Main|Jewish Babylonian Aramaic}}\nJewish Middle Babylonian is the language employed by Jewish writers in Babylonia between the fourth and the eleventh century. It is most commonly identified with the language of the Babylonian [[Talmud]] (which was completed in the seventh century) and of post-Talmudic [[Geonim|Geonic]] literature, which are the most important cultural products of Babylonian Judaism. The most important epigraphic sources for the dialect are the hundreds of [[incantation bowl]]s written in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic.\n\n====Mandaic====\n{{Main|Mandaic language}}\nThe [[Mandaic language]], spoken by the [[Mandaeans]] of [[Iraq]], is a sister dialect to Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, though it is both linguistically and culturally distinct. Classical Mandaic is the language in which the Mandaeans' [[gnosticism|gnostic]] religious literature was composed. It is characterized by a highly phonetic orthography.\n\n===Western Middle Aramaic===\nThe dialects of Old Western Aramaic continued with Jewish Middle Palestinian (in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew \"square script\"]]), [[Samaritan Aramaic]] (in the [[Phoenician alphabet|old Hebrew script]]) and Christian Palestinian (in cursive [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac script]]). Of these three, only Jewish Middle Palestinian continued as a written language.{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}<!--So how do we know the other two if they weren't written? Also, at least Samaritan Aramaic certainly was written and lots of texts survive.-->\n\n====Jewish Middle Palestinian Aramaic====\n[[File:Kennicott Bible fol 42v.jpg|thumb|right|Hebrew (left) and Aramaic (right) in parallel in a 1299 Hebrew Bible held by the [[Bodleian Library]]]]\n\n{{Main|Jewish Palestinian Aramaic}}\nIn 135, after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], many [[Jew]]ish leaders, expelled from [[Jerusalem]], moved to [[Galilee]]. The Galilean dialect thus rose from obscurity to become the standard among Jews in the west. This dialect was spoken not only in Galilee, but also in the surrounding parts. It is the linguistic setting for the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (completed in the 5th century), Palestinian [[targum]]im (Jewish Aramaic versions of scripture), and [[midrash]]im (biblical commentaries and teaching). The standard [[niqqud|vowel pointing]] for the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Tiberian system (7th century), was developed by speakers of the Galilean dialect of Jewish Middle Palestinian. Classical Hebrew vocalisation, therefore, in representing the Hebrew of this period, probably reflects the contemporary pronunciation of this Aramaic dialect.\n\n[[Middle Judaean Aramaic|Middle Judaean]], the descendant of [[Old Judaean Aramaic|Old Judaean]], was no longer the dominant dialect, and was used only in southern Judaea (the variant Engedi dialect continued throughout this period). Likewise, [[Middle East Jordanian Aramaic|Middle East Jordanian]] continued as a minor dialect from [[Old East Jordanian Aramaic|Old East Jordanian]]. The inscriptions in the synagogue at [[Dura-Europos]] are either in Middle East Jordanian or Middle Judaean.\n\n====Samaritan Aramaic====\n{{Main|Samaritan Aramaic language}}\nThe [[Samaritan Aramaic language|Samaritan Aramaic]] is earliest attested by the documentary tradition of the [[Samaritans]] that can be dated back to the fourth century. Its modern pronunciation is based on the form used in the tenth century.\n\n====Christian Palestinian Aramaic====\nSometimes referred to as \"Melkite Aramaic\", it is the language of Western-Aramaic-speaking Christians. It is evidenced from the 5th–6th century, but probably existed two centuries earlier. The language itself comes from Old Christian Palestinian Aramaic, but its writing conventions were based on early [[Middle Syriac]], and it was heavily influenced by [[Greek language|Greek]]. For example, the name Jesus, although ישוע ''Yešua’'' in Jewish Aramaic, and ''Išo'' in Syriac, is written ''Yesûs'' (a transliteration of the Greek form) in Christian Palestinian.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Modern Aramaic==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\n{{Main|Neo-Aramaic languages}}\nAs the [[Western Aramaic]] languages of the Levant and Lebanon have become nearly extinct in non-liturgical usage, the most prolific speakers of Aramaic dialects today are predominantly ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Eastern Neo-Aramaic speakers, the most numerous being the [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]] speakers of Mesopotamia. This includes speakers of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] (235,000 speakers), [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] (216,000 speakers), and [[Turoyo language|Turoyo (Surayt)]] (112,000 to 450,000 speakers).  Having largely lived in remote areas as insulated communities for over a millennium, the remaining modern Aramaic dialects, such as the Assyrians, and the [[Arameans]], escaped the linguistic pressures experienced by others during the large-scale [[language shift]]s that saw the proliferation of other tongues among those who previously did not speak them, most recently the [[Arabization]] of the Middle East and North Africa by [[Arabs]] beginning with the [[early Muslim conquests]] of the seventh century.<ref>Turoyo at Ethnologue (17th ed., 2013)</ref><ref>Khan 2008, pp. 6</ref>\n\nAnother Eastern Aramaic language, Neo-Mandaean, is spoken by the Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran. They number some 50,000–75,000 people, but it is believed the Mandaic language may now be spoken fluently by as few as 6000 people, with other Mandaeans having varying degrees of knowledge.<ref>Modern Mandaic at Ethnologue (17th ed., 2013)</ref>\n\n===Modern Eastern Aramaic===\n{{main|Northeastern Neo-Aramaic|Neo-Mandaic}}\nModern Eastern Aramaic exists in a wide variety of dialects and languages. There is significant difference between the Aramaic spoken by Jews, Christians, and Mandaeans.\n\nThe Christian varieties are often called Modern Syriac (or Neo-Syriac, particularly when referring to their literature), being deeply influenced by the literary and liturgical language of Middle Syriac. However, they also have roots in numerous, previously unwritten, local Aramaic varieties, and are not purely the direct descendants of the language of [[Ephrem the Syrian]]. The varieties are not all mutually intelligible. The principal Christian varieties are [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]], both used by the ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of Iraq, southeast Turkey, Iran, and northeast Syria.\n\nThe [[Judeo-Aramaic languages]] are now mostly spoken in [[Israel]], and most are facing extinction. The Jewish varieties that have come from communities that once lived between [[Lake Urmia]] and [[Mosul]] are not all mutually intelligible. In some places, for example [[Urmia]], Assyrian Christians and Jews speak mutually unintelligible varieties of Modern Eastern Aramaic in the same place. In others, the [[Nineveh plains]] around Mosul for example, the varieties of these two ethnic communities are similar enough to allow conversation.\n\nModern [[Central Neo-Aramaic]], being in between Western Neo-Aramaic and Eastern Neo-Aramaic) is generally represented by Turoyo, the language of the Assyrians of [[Tur Abdin]]. A related language, [[Mlahsô language|Mlahsô]], has recently become extinct.\n\nMandaeans living in the [[Khuzestan Province]] of Iran and scattered throughout Iraq, speak Modern Mandaic. It is quite distinct from any other Aramaic variety.\n\n===Modern Central Aramaic===\n{{main|Central Neo-Aramaic}}\nCentral Neo-Aramaic consists of [[Turoyo]] and the recently extinct [[Mlahsô]].\n\n===Modern Western Aramaic===\n{{Main|Western Neo-Aramaic}}\nVery little remains of Western Aramaic. It is still spoken in the villages of [[Maaloula]], [[al-Sarkha (Bakhah)]], and [[Jubb'adin]] on [[Syria]]'s side of the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]], as well as by some people who migrated from these villages, to [[Damascus]] and other larger towns of Syria. All these speakers of Modern Western Aramaic are fluent in Arabic as well. [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]] and [[Samaritan Aramaic]] are preserved in liturgical and literary usage.\n\n==Phonology==\nEach dialect of Aramaic has its own distinctive pronunciation, and it would not be feasible here to go into all these properties. Aramaic has a phonological palette of 25 to 40 distinct phonemes. Some modern Aramaic pronunciations lack the series of \"emphatic\" consonants, and some have borrowed from the inventories of surrounding languages, particularly [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!\n! Front\n! Back\n|-\n! Close\n| {{IPA link|i}}\n| {{IPA link|u}}\n|-\n! Close-mid\n| {{IPA link|e}}\n| {{IPA link|o}}\n|-\n! Open-mid\n| {{IPA link|ɛ}}\n| ({{IPA link|ɔ}})\n|-\n! Open\n| {{IPA link|a}}\n| ({{IPA link|ɑ}})\n|}\n\nAs with most Semitic languages, Aramaic can be thought of as having three basic sets of vowels:\n* Open ''a''-vowels\n* Close front ''i''-vowels\n* Close back ''u''-vowels\nThese vowel groups are relatively stable, but the exact articulation of any individual is most dependent on its consonantal setting.\n\nThe open vowel is an open near-front unrounded vowel (\"short\" ''a'', somewhat like the first vowel in the English \"batter\", {{IPAblink|a}}). It usually has a back counterpart (\"long\" ''a'', like the ''a'' in \"father\", {{IPAblink|ɑ}}, or even tending to the vowel in \"caught\", {{IPAblink|ɔ}}), and a front counterpart (\"short\" ''e'', like the vowel in \"head\", {{IPAblink|ɛ}}). There is much correspondence between these vowels between dialects. There is some evidence that Middle Babylonian dialects did not distinguish between the short ''a'' and short ''e''. In West Syriac dialects, and possibly Middle Galilean, the long ''a'' became the ''o'' sound. The open ''e'' and back ''a'' are often indicated in writing by the use of the letters א \"alaph\" (a [[glottal stop]]) or ה \"he\" (like the English ''h'').\n\nThe close front vowel is the \"long\" ''i'' (like the vowel in \"need\", {{IPA|[i]}}). It has a slightly more open counterpart, the \"long\" ''e'', as in the final vowel of \"café\" ({{IPA|[e]}}). Both of these have shorter counterparts, which tend to be pronounced slightly more open. Thus, the short close ''e'' corresponds with the open ''e'' in some dialects. The close front vowels usually use the consonant י ''y'' as a [[mater lectionis]].\n\nThe close back vowel is the \"long\" ''u'' (like the vowel in \"school\", {{IPA|[u]}}). It has a more open counterpart, the \"long\" ''o'', like the vowel in \"low\" ({{IPA|[o]}}). There are shorter, and thus more open, counterparts to each of these, with the short close ''o'' sometimes corresponding with the long open ''a''. The close back vowels often use the consonant ו ''w'' to indicate their quality.\n\nTwo basic [[diphthong]]s exist: an open vowel followed by י ''y'' (''ay''), and an open vowel followed by ו ''w'' (''aw''). These were originally full diphthongs, but many dialects have converted them to ''e'' and ''o'' respectively.\n\nThe so-called \"emphatic\" consonants (see the next section) cause all vowels to become mid-centralised.\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Interdental consonant|Interdental]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Pharyngeal consonant|Pharyngeal]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! <small>plain</small>\n! <small>[[Emphatic consonant|emp.]]</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| {{IPA link|m}} || || {{IPA link|n}} || || || || || ||\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n! <small>[[Voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| {{IPA link|p}} || || {{IPA link|t}} || {{IPA link|tˤ}} || || {{IPA link|k}} || {{IPA link|q}} || || {{IPA link|ʔ}}\n|-\n! <small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| {{IPA link|b}} || || {{IPA link|d}} || || || {{IPA link|ɡ}} || || ||\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n! <small>[[Voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| {{IPA link|f}} || {{IPA link|θ}} || {{IPA link|s}} || {{IPA link|sˤ}} || {{IPA link|ʃ}} || {{IPA link|x}} || || {{IPA link|ħ}} || {{IPA link|h}}\n|-\n! <small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| {{IPA link|v}} || {{IPA link|ð}} || {{IPA link|z}} || || || {{IPA link|ɣ}} || || {{IPA link|ʕ}} ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| || || {{IPA link|l}} || || {{IPA link|j}} || {{IPA link|w}} || || ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n| || || {{IPA link|r}} || || || || || ||\n|}\n\nThe various alphabets used for writing Aramaic languages have twenty-two letters (all of which are consonants). Some of these letters, though, can stand for two or three different sounds (usually a [[stop consonant|stop]] and a [[fricative consonant|fricative]] at the same point of articulation). Aramaic classically uses a series of lightly contrasted plosives and fricatives:\n* Labial set: '''פּ'''\\'''פ''' ''p''/''f'' and '''בּ'''\\'''ב''' ''b''/''v'',\n* Dental set: '''תּ'''\\'''ת''' ''t''/''θ'' and '''דּ'''\\'''ד''' ''d''/''ð'',\n* Velar set: '''כּ'''\\'''כ''' ''k''/''x'' and '''גּ'''\\'''ג''' ''g''/''ɣ''.\nEach member of a certain pair is written with the same letter of the alphabet in most writing systems (that is, ''p'' and ''f'' are written with the same letter), and are near [[allophone]]s.\n\nA distinguishing feature of Aramaic phonology (and that of Semitic languages in general) is the presence of \"emphatic\" consonants. These are consonants that are pronounced with the root of the tongue retracted, with varying degrees of [[pharyngealization]] and [[Velar consonant|velarization]]. Using their alphabetic names, these emphatics are:\n* ח Ḥêṯ, a [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]], {{IPA|/ħ/}},\n* ט Ṭêṯ, a pharyngealized ''t'', {{IPA|/tˤ/}},\n* ע ʽAyin (or ʽE in some dialects), a pharyngealized [[glottal stop]] (sometimes considered to be a [[Voiced pharyngeal fricative|voiced pharyngeal approximant]]), {{IPA|[ʕ]}} or {{IPA|[ʔˤ]}},\n* צ Ṣāḏê, a pharyngealized ''s'', {{IPA|/sˤ/}},\n* ק Qôp, a [[voiceless uvular stop]], {{IPA|/q/}}.\n{{listen|filename=Aramaic_emphatics.ogg|title=The emphatic consonants of Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nAncient Aramaic may have had a larger series of emphatics, and some Neo-Aramaic languages definitely do. Not all dialects of Aramaic give these consonants their historic values.\n\nOverlapping with the set of emphatics are the \"guttural\" consonants. They include ח Ḥêṯ and ע ʽAyn from the emphatic set, and add א ʼĀlap̄ (a [[glottal stop]]) and ה Hê (as the English \"h\").\n\nAramaic classically has a set of four [[sibilant]]s (ancient Aramaic may have had six):\n* ס, שׂ {{IPA|/s/}} (as in English \"sea\"),\n* ז {{IPA|/z/}} (as in English \"zero\"),\n* שׁ {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (as in English \"ship\"),\n* צ {{IPA|/sˤ/}} (the emphatic Ṣāḏê listed above).\n\nIn addition to these sets, Aramaic has the [[nasal consonant]]s מ ''m'' and נ ''n'', and the [[approximant consonant|approximants]] ר ''r'' (usually an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills|alveolar trill]]), ל ''l'', י ''y'' and ו ''w''.\n\n===Historical sound changes===\nSix broad features of sound change can be seen as dialect differentials:\n* '''Vowel change''' occurs almost too frequently to document fully, but is a major distinctive feature of different dialects.\n* '''Plosive/fricative pair reduction'''.  Originally, Aramaic, like [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian Hebrew]], had fricatives as conditioned [[allophone]]s for each plosive. In the wake of vowel changes, the distinction eventually became phonemic; still later, it was often lost in certain dialects. For example, [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] has mostly lost {{IPA|/p/}}, using {{IPA|/f/}} instead, like Arabic; other dialects (for instance, standard [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]) have lost {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} and replaced them with {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}, as with Modern Hebrew. In most dialects of Modern Syriac, {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} are realized as {{IPA|[w]}} after a vowel.\n* '''Loss of emphatics'''. Some dialects have replaced emphatic consonants with non-emphatic counterparts, while those spoken in the [[Caucasus]] often have [[Ejective consonant|glottalized]] rather than [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] emphatics.\n* '''Guttural assimilation''' is the main distinctive feature of Samaritan pronunciation, also found in [[Samaritan Hebrew]]: all the gutturals are reduced to a simple glottal stop. Some Modern Aramaic dialects do not pronounce ''h'' in all words (the third person masculine pronoun ''hu'' becomes ''ow'').\n* Proto-Semitic */θ/ */ð/ are reflected in Aramaic as */t/, */d/, whereas they became sibilants in Hebrew (the number three is שלוש ''šālôš'' in Hebrew but תלת ''tlāṯ'' in Aramaic). Dental/sibilant shifts are still happening in the modern dialects.\n* '''New phonetic inventory'''. Modern dialects have borrowed sounds from the dominant surrounding languages. The most frequent borrowings are {{IPA|[ʒ]}} (as the first consonant in \"azure\"), {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} (as in \"jam\") and {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} (as in \"church\"). The [[Syriac alphabet]] has been adapted for writing these new sounds.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{listen|filename=kthovo.ogg|title=Aramaic words based on the triliteral<br /> root ''k-t-b'' |description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nAs with other Semitic languages, Aramaic [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the way words are formed) is based on the consonantal [[Semitic root|root]]. The root generally consists of two or three consonants and has a basic meaning, for example, כת״ב ''k-t-b'' has the meaning of 'writing'. This is then modified by the addition of vowels and other consonants to create different nuances of the basic meaning:\n* כתבה ''kṯāḇâ'', handwriting, inscription, script, book.\n* כתבי ''kṯāḇê'', books, the Scriptures.\n* כתובה ''kāṯûḇâ'', secretary, scribe.\n* כתבת ''kiṯḇeṯ'', I wrote.\n* אכתב '''eḵtûḇ'', I shall write.\n\n===Nouns and adjectives===\nAramaic nouns and adjectives are inflected to show ''gender'', ''number'' and ''state''.\n\nAramaic has two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. The feminine absolute singular is often marked by the ending ה- ''-â''.\n\nNouns can be either singular or plural, but an additional \"dual\" number exists for nouns that usually come in pairs. The dual number gradually disappeared from Aramaic over time and has little influence in Middle and Modern Aramaic.\n\nAramaic nouns and adjectives can exist in one of three states. To a certain extent, these states correspond to the role of articles and cases in the [[Indo-European languages]]:\n# The ''absolute'' state is the basic form of a noun. In early forms of Aramaic, the absolute state expresses indefiniteness, comparable to the English indefinite article a(n) (for example, כתבה ''kṯāḇâ'', \"'''a''' handwriting\"), and can be used in most syntactic roles. However, by the Middle Aramaic period, its use for nouns (but not adjectives) had been widely replaced by the emphatic state.\n# The ''[[Status constructus|construct]]'' state is a form of the noun used to make possessive constructions (for example, '''כתבת''' מלכתא '''''kṯāḇat''' malkṯâ'', \"the handwriting of the queen\"). In the masculine singular the form of the construct is often the same as the absolute, but it may undergo vowel reduction in longer words. The feminine construct and masculine construct plural are marked by suffixes. Unlike a [[genitive case]], which marks the possessor, the construct state is marked on the possessed. This is mainly due to Aramaic word order: '''possessed[const.] possessor[abs./emph.]''' are treated as a speech unit, with the first unit (possessed) employing the construct state to link it to the following word. In Middle Aramaic, the use of the construct state for all but stock phrases (like בר נשא ''bar nāšâ'', \"son of man\") begins to disappear.\n# The ''emphatic'' or ''determined'' state is an extended form of the noun that functions similarly to the [[Article (grammar)|definite article]]. It is marked with a suffix (for example, כתבת'''א'''  ''kṯāḇtâ'', \"'''the''' handwriting\"). Although its original grammatical function seems to have been to mark definiteness, it is used already in Imperial Aramaic to mark all important nouns, even if they should be considered technically indefinite. This practice developed to the extent that the absolute state became extraordinarily rare in later varieties of Aramaic.\n\nWhereas other [[Northwest Semitic languages]], like Hebrew, have the absolute and construct states, the emphatic/determined state is a unique feature to Aramaic. [[Inflection|Case endings]], as in [[Ugaritic grammar#Case|Ugaritic]], probably existed in a very early stage of the language, and glimpses of them can be seen in a few compound proper names. However, as most of those cases were expressed by short final vowels, they were never written, and the few characteristic long vowels of the masculine plural accusative and genitive are not clearly evidenced in inscriptions. Often, the [[Object (grammar)|direct object]] is marked by a prefixed -ל ''l-'' (the [[preposition and postposition|preposition]] \"to\") if it is definite.\n\nAdjectives agree with their nouns in number and gender but agree in state only if used attributively. Predicative adjectives are in the absolute state regardless of the state of their noun (a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] may or may not be written). Thus, an attributive adjective to an emphatic noun, as in the phrase \"the good king\", is written also in the emphatic state מלכא טבא ''malkâ ṭāḇâ''—king[emph.] good[emph.]. In comparison, the predicative adjective, as in the phrase \"the king is good\", is written in the absolute state מלכא טב ''malkâ ṭāḇ''—king[emph.] good[abs.].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \"good\"\n! masc. sg.\n! fem. sg.\n! masc. pl.\n! fem. pl.\n|-\n! abs.\n| rowspan=\"2\" | טב ṭāḇ\n| טבה ṭāḇâ\n| טבין ṭāḇîn\n| טבן ṭāḇān\n|-\n! const.\n| טבת ṭāḇaṯ\n| טבי ṭāḇê\n| טבת ṭāḇāṯ\n|-\n! det./emph.\n| טבא ṭāḇâ\n| טבתא ṭāḇtâ\n| טביא ṭāḇayyâ\n| טבתא ṭāḇāṯâ\n|}\n\nThe final א- ''-â'' in a number of these suffixes is written with the letter [[aleph]]. However, some Jewish Aramaic texts employ the letter [[he (letter)|he]] for the feminine absolute singular. Likewise, some Jewish Aramaic texts employ the Hebrew masculine absolute singular suffix ים- ''-îm'' instead of ין- ''-în''. The masculine determined plural suffix, יא- ''-ayyâ'', has an alternative version, ''-ê''. The alternative is sometimes called the \"gentilic plural\" for its prominent use in ethnonyms (יהודיא ''yəhûḏāyê'', 'the Jews', for example). This alternative plural is written with the letter [[aleph]], and came to be the only plural for nouns and adjectives of this type in Syriac and some other varieties of Aramaic. The masculine construct plural, ''-ê'', is written with [[yodh]]. In Syriac and some other variants this ending is [[diphthong]]ized to ''-ai''.\n\nPossessive phrases in Aramaic can either be made with the construct state or by linking two nouns with the relative particle -[ד[י ''d[î]-''. As the use of the construct state almost disappears from the Middle Aramaic period on, the latter method became the main way of making possessive phrases.\n\n{{listen|filename=kthovath malktho.ogg|title=Different variations of the possessive construction in Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nFor example, the various forms of possessive phrases (for \"the handwriting of the queen\") are:\n# '''כתבת מלכתא''' '''kṯāḇaṯ malkṯâ''' – the oldest construction, also known as סמיכות səmîḵûṯ : the possessed object (כתבה kṯābâ, \"handwriting\") is in the construct state (כתבת kṯāḇaṯ); the possessor (מלכה malkâ, \"queen\") is in the emphatic state (מלכתא malkṯâ)\n# '''כתבתא דמלכתא''' '''kṯāḇtâ d(î)-malkṯâ''' – both words are in the emphatic state and the relative particle -[ד[י ''d[î]-'' is used to mark the relationship\n# '''כתבתה דמלכתא''' '''kṯāḇtāh d(î)-malkṯâ''' – both words are in the emphatic state, and the relative particle is used, but the possessed is given an anticipatory, pronominal ending (כתבתה kṯāḇtā-h, \"handwriting-her\"; literally, \"her writing, that (of) the queen\").\nIn Modern Aramaic, the last form is by far the most common. In Biblical Aramaic, the last form is virtually absent.\n\n===Verbs===\nThe Aramaic verb has gradually evolved in time and place, varying between varieties of the language. Verb forms are marked for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second or third), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural), [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (perfect or imperfect), [[grammatical mood|mood]] (indicative, imperative, jussive or infinitive) and [[voice (grammar)|voice]] (active, reflexive or passive). Aramaic also employs a system of [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]s, or verbal stems, to mark intensive and extensive developments in the lexical meaning of verbs.\n\n====Aspectual tense====\nAramaic has two proper [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: [[perfective aspect|perfect]] and [[imperfective aspect|imperfect]]. These were originally [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]], but developed into something more like a [[preterite]] and [[future tense|future]]. The perfect is [[Markedness|unmarked]], while the imperfect uses various [[prefix|preformative]]s that vary according to person, number and gender. In both tenses the third-person singular masculine is the unmarked form from which others are derived by addition of [[Suffix|afformative]]s (and preformatives in the imperfect). In the chart below (on the root כת״ב K-T-B, meaning \"to write\"), the first form given is the usual form in Imperial Aramaic, while the second is [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Person & gender\n! colspan=\"2\" | Perfect\n! colspan=\"2\" | Imperfect\n|-\n!

The basic form of the verb is called the ''ground stem'', or ''G-stem''. Following the tradition of mediaeval Arabic grammarians, it is more often called the Pə‘al פעל (also written Pe‘al), using the form of the [[Semitic root]] פע״ל P-‘-L, meaning \"to do\". This stem carries the basic lexical meaning of the verb.\n\nBy doubling of the second radical, or root letter, the D-stem or פעל Pa‘‘el is formed. This is often an intensive development of the basic lexical meaning. For example, ''qəṭal'' means \"he killed\", whereas ''qaṭṭel'' means \"he slew\". The precise relationship in meaning between the two stems differs for every verb.\n\nA [[preformative]], which can be -ה ''ha-'', -א ''a-'' or -ש ''ša-'', creates the C-stem or variously the Hap̄‘el, Ap̄‘el or Šap̄‘el (also spelt הפעל Haph‘el, אפעל Aph‘el and שפעל Shaph‘el). This is often an extensive or causative development of the basic lexical meaning. For example, טעה ''ṭə‘â'' means \"he went astray\", whereas אטעי ''aṭ‘î'' means \"he deceived\". The Šap̄‘el שפעל is the least common variant of the C-stem. Because this variant is standard in Akkadian, it is possible that its use in Aramaic represents loanwords from that language. The difference between the variants הפעל Hap̄‘el and אפעל Ap̄‘el appears to be the gradual dropping of the initial ה ''h'' sound in later Old Aramaic. This is noted by the respelling of the older [[he (letter)|he]] preformative with א [[aleph]].\n\nThese three conjugations are supplemented with three further derived stems, produced by the preformative -הת ''hiṯ-'' or -את ''eṯ-''. The loss of the initial ה ''h'' sound occurs similarly to that in the form above. These three derived stems are the Gt-stem, התפעל Hiṯpə‘el or אתפעל Eṯpə‘el (also written Hithpe‘el or Ethpe‘el), the Dt-stem, התפעּל Hiṯpa‘‘al or אתפעּל Eṯpa‘‘al (also written Hithpa‘‘al or Ethpa‘‘al), and the Ct-stem, התהפעל Hiṯhap̄‘al, אתּפעל Ettap̄‘al, השתפעל Hištap̄‘al or אשתפעל Eštap̄‘al (also written Hithhaph‘al, Ettaph‘al, Hishtaph‘al or Eshtaph‘al). Their meaning is usually [[reflexive verb|reflexive]], but later became [[passive voice|passive]]. However, as with other stems, actual meaning differs from verb to verb.\n\nNot all verbs use all of these conjugations, and, in some, the G-stem is not used. In the chart below (on the root כת״ב K-T-B, meaning \"to write\"), the first form given is the usual form in Imperial Aramaic, while the second is [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Perhaps under influence from other languages, Middle Aramaic developed a system of composite tenses (combinations of forms of the verb with pronouns or an [[auxiliary verb]]), allowing for narrative that is more vivid. The syntax of Aramaic (the way sentences are put together) usually follows the order verb–subject–object (VSO).  Imperial (Persian) Aramaic, however, tended to follow a S-O-V pattern (similar to Akkadian), which was the result of Persian syntactic influence.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Languages|Syriac Christianity|Assyrians}}\n* [[Arabic alphabet]]\n* [[Aramaic of Hatra]]\n* [[Ephrem the Syrian]]\n* [[Hebrew alphabet]]\n* [[Gospel of Matthew]]\n* [[Peshitta]]\n* [[List of loanwords in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|List of loanwords in modern Aramaic]]\n* [[Syriac Latin alphabet]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book |last=Beyer |first=Klaus |year=1986 |title=The Aramaic language: its distribution and subdivisions |publisher=Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht |isbn=3-525-53573-2}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Casey |first=Maurice |year=1998 |title=Aramaic sources of Mark's Gospel |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-63314-1}}\n* {{Cite encyclopedia|title=Aramaic| encyclopedia = The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary|publisher=William B Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA |year=1975|isbn=0-8028-2402-1}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Frank |first=Yitzchak |year=2003 |title=Grammar for Gemara & Targum Onkelos |edition=(expanded edition) |publisher=Feldheim Publishers / Ariel Institute |isbn=1-58330-606-4}}\n* {{Cite book |editor=Heinrichs, Wolfhart |editor-link=Wolfhart Heinrichs |year=1990 |title=Studies in Neo-Aramaic |location=Atlanta, Georgia |publisher=Scholars Press |isbn=1-55540-430-8}}\n* {{Cite book |authorlink=Theodor Nöldeke |last=Nöldeke |first=Theodor |year=2001 |title=Compendious Syriac Grammar |location=Winona Lake |publisher=Eisenbrauns |isbn=1-57506-050-7}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Near Eastern Archaeology: A Reader|first1=Suzanne|last1=Richard|edition=Illustrated|publisher=EISENBRAUNS|year=2003|isbn=978-1-57506-083-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=khR0apPid8gC&pg=PA69&dq=aramaic+spread+North+Africa}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Rosenthal |first=Franz |authorlink=Franz Rosenthal |year=1995 |title=A Grammar of Biblical Aramaic |edition=6th, revised |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden |isbn=3-447-03590-0}}\n* {{cite book |title = A Jewish Neo-Aramaic Dictionary |last = Sabar |first = Yona |authorlink=Yona Sabar |year = 2002 |publisher = Harrassowitz |isbn = 978-3-447-04557-5}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Sokoloff |first=Michael |year=2002 |title=A Dictionary of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic |isbn=965-226-260-9 |publisher=Bar-Ilan UP; Johns Hopkins UP |location=Ramat Gan}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Sokoloff |first=Michael |year=2002 |title=A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic |edition=2nd |publisher=Bar-Ilan UP; Johns Hopkins UP |isbn=965-226-101-7}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Stevenson |first=William B. |year=1962 |title=Grammar of Palestinian Jewish Aramaic |edition=2nd |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=0-19-815419-4}}\n*Waltisberg, Michael (2016).
