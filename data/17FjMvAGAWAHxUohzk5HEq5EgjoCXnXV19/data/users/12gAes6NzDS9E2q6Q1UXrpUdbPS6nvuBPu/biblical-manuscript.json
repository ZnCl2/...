            "text": "{{Bible-related |TM}}\nA '''biblical manuscript''' is any handwritten copy of a portion of the text of the [[Bible]]. The word ''Bible'' comes from the Greek ''biblia'' (books); ''[[manuscript]]'' comes from Latin ''manu'' (hand) and ''scriptum'' (written). Biblical manuscripts vary in size from tiny scrolls containing individual verses of the Jewish scriptures (see [[Tefillin]]) to huge [[Polyglot (book)|polyglot]] [[codices]] (multi-lingual books) containing both the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanakh]]) and the [[New Testament]], as well as [[Biblical canon|extracanonical]] works.\n\nThe study of biblical manuscripts is important because handwritten copies of books can contain errors. The science of [[textual criticism]] attempts to reconstruct the original text of books, especially those published prior to the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]].\n\n==Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh) manuscripts==\n[[File:Aleppo Codex (Deut).jpg|thumb|left|A page from the [[Aleppo Codex]], Deuteronomy]]\n\n{{main article|List of Hebrew Bible manuscripts}}\n\nThe [[Aleppo Codex]] (c. 920 CE) and [[Leningrad Codex]] (c. 1008 CE) were the oldest Hebrew language manuscripts of the [[Tanakh]]. In 1947 CE the finding of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] at [[Qumran]] pushed the manuscript history of the Tanakh back a millennium from the two earliest complete codices. Before this discovery, the earliest extant manuscripts of the [[Old Testament]] were in Greek in manuscripts such as [[Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. Out of the roughly 800 manuscripts found at Qumran, 220 are from the Tanakh. Every book of the Tanakh is represented except for the [[Book of Esther]]; however, most are fragmentary. Notably, there are two [[scroll]]s of the [[Book of Isaiah]], one complete ([[1QIs-a|1QIs<sup>a</sup>]]), and one around 75% complete ([[1QIs-b|1QIs<sup>b</sup>]]). These manuscripts generally date between 150 BCE to 70 CE.<ref>Bruce 1964</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Extant Tanakh manuscripts===\n\n{| border=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"\"\n||\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFE4C4\" align=\"center\"\n! width=\"\"|Version !!|Examples !! width=\"\"|Language !! |Date of Composition !! | Oldest Copy\n|-\n| [[Ketef Hinnom|Silver Scrolls]]|| || [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo-Hebrew]]|| || 587-586 BCE<ref>Barkay, Vaughn, Lundberg and Zuckerman 2004 pp. 41-71</ref> ([[Amulet]]s with the [[Priestly Blessing]] recorded in the [[Book of Numbers]])\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#FFE4C4;\"|\n|-\n| [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]|| || Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek|| c. 150 BCE – 70 CE || c. 150 BCE – 70 CE (fragments)\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#FFE4C4;\"|\n|-\n|[[Septuagint]]||[[Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and other earlier papyri\n||Greek||300–100 BCE || 2nd century BCE (fragments)<br/>4th century CE (complete)\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#FFE4C4;\"|\n|-\n| [[Peshitta]]||||[[Syriac language|Syriac]]|| ||early 5th century CE\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#FFE4C4;\"|\n|-\n| [[Vulgate]]||[[Codex Amiatinus]]|| Latin|| ||early 5th century CE<br/>early 8th century CE (complete)\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#FFE4C4;\"|\n|-\n| [[Masoretic]]||[[Aleppo Codex]], [[Leningrad Codex]] and other, incomplete MSS|| Hebrew|| c. 100 CE ||10th century CE (complete)\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#FFE4C4;\"|\n|-\n|[[Samaritan Pentateuch]]|||| [[Samaritan Hebrew]]||200–100 BCE||Oldest extant MSS, c. 11th century CE; oldest MSS available to scholars, 16th century CE\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#FFE4C4;\"|\n|-\n| [[Targum]] || ||[[Aramaic]]||500–1000 CE||5th century CE\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#FFE4C4;\"|\n|\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#FFE4C4;\"|\n|-\n| [[Coptic versions of the Bible|Coptic]] || [[List of the Coptic New Testament manuscripts|Crosby-Schøyen Codex]], [[British Library MS.

The dates of these manuscripts range from c. 125 (the {{Papyrus link|52}} papyrus, oldest copy of John fragments) to the introduction of printing in Germany in the 15th century.\n\nOften, especially in monasteries, a manuscript cache was little more than a former manuscript recycling centre, where imperfect and incomplete copies of manuscripts were stored while the monastery or scriptorium decided what to do with them.<ref name=\"Ehrman 2005\">Ehrman 2005</ref> There were several options. The first was to simply \"wash\" the manuscript and reuse it. Such reused manuscripts were called [[palimpsest]]s and were very common in the ancient world until the [[Middle Ages]]. One notable palimpsest is the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]. If not done within a short period of time after the papyri was made, washing it was less likely since the papyri might deteriorate and thus be unusable. When washing was no longer an option, the second choice was burning. Since the manuscripts contained the words of Christ, they were thought to have had a level of sanctity;<ref name=\"Ehrman 2005\"/> burning them was considered more reverent than simply throwing them into a garbage pit, which occasionally happened (as in the case of [[Oxyrhynchus 840]]). The third option was to leave them in what has become known as a manuscript gravesite. When scholars come across manuscript caches, such as at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai]] (the source of the [[Codex Sinaiticus]]), or Saint Sabbas Monastery outside [[Bethlehem]], they are finding not libraries but storehouses of rejected texts<ref name=\"Ehrman 2005\"/> sometimes kept in boxes or back shelves in libraries due to space constraints. The texts were unacceptable because of their scribal errors and contain corrections inside the lines,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231104440/http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/ |archivedate=2008-12-31 |df= }}</ref> possibly evidence that monastery scribes compared them to a master text. In addition, texts thought to be complete and correct but had deteriorated for heavy usage or had missing [[wikt:folio|folios]] would also be placed in the [[Treasure trove|caches]]. Once in a cache, insects and humidity would often contribute to the continued deterioration of the documents.<ref name=\"Ehrman 2005\" />\n\nComplete and correctly-copied texts would usually be immediately placed in use and so wore out fairly quickly, which required frequent recopying. Manuscript copying was very costly when it required a scribe's attention for extended periods so a [[manuscript]] might be made only when it was commissioned. The size of the [[parchment]], [[writing system|script]] used, any illustrations (thus raising the effective cost) and whether it was one book or a collection of several would be determined by the one commissioning the work. Stocking extra copies would likely have been considered wasteful and unnecessary since the form and the presentation of a manuscript were typically customized to the aesthetic tastes of the buyer.\n\nDue to the prevalence of manuscript caches, scholars today are more likely to find incomplete and sometimes conflicting segments of manuscripts rather than complete and largely consistent works.<ref name=\"Ehrman 2005\" />\n\n'''Distribution of Greek manuscripts by century'''<ref>Aland, p 81</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| |\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''New Testament manuscripts'''\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | '''Lectionaries'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"\" | '''Century'''\n| | [[New Testament papyrus|Papyri]]\n| | [[Uncial script|Uncials]]\n| | [[List of New Testament minuscules|Minuscules]]\n| | Uncials\n| | Minuscules\n|-\n| | 2nd\n|| 2\n|| -\n|| -\n|  | -\n|  | -\n|-\n| | 2nd/3rd\n|| 5\n|| 1\n|| -\n|  | -\n|  | -\n|-\n| | 3rd\n| | 28\n| | 2\n| | -\n| | -\n| | -\n|-\n| | 3rd/4th\n| | 8\n| | 2\n| | -\n| | -\n| | -\n|-\n| | 4th\n|| 14\n|| 14\n|| -\n|  | 1\n|  | -\n|-\n|  | 4th/5th\n|| 8\n|| 8\n|| -\n|  | -\n|  | -\n|-\n|  | 5th\n|| 2\n|| 36\n|| -\n|  | 1\n|  | -\n|-\n|  | 5th/6th\n|| 4\n|| 10\n|| -\n|  | -\n|  | -\n|-\n|  | 6th\n|| 7\n|| 51\n|| -\n|  | 3\n|  | -\n|-\n|  | 6th/7th\n|| 5\n|| 5\n|| -\n|  | 1\n|  | -\n|-\n|  | 7th\n|| 8\n|| 28\n|| -\n|  | 4\n|  | -\n|-\n|  | 7th/8th\n|| 3\n|| 4\n|| -\n|  | -\n|  | -\n|-\n|  | 8th\n|| 2\n|| 29\n|| -\n|  | 22\n|  | -\n|-\n|  | 8th/9th\n|| -\n|| 4\n|| -\n|  | 5\n|  | -\n|-\n|  | 9th\n|| -\n|| 53\n|| 13\n|  | 113\n|  | 5\n|-\n|  | 9th/10th\n|| -\n|| 1\n|| 4\n|  | -\n|  | 1\n|-\n|  | 10th\n|| -\n|| 17\n|| 124\n|  | 108\n|  | 38\n|-\n|  | 10th/11th\n|| -\n|| 3\n|| 8\n|  | 3\n|  | 4\n|-\n|  | 11th\n|| -\n|| 1\n|| 429\n|  | 15\n|  | 227\n|-\n|  | 11th/12th\n|| -\n|| -\n|| 33\n|  | -\n|  | 13\n|-\n|  | 12th\n|| -\n|| -\n|| 555\n|  | 6\n|  | 486\n|-\n|  | 12th/13th\n|| -\n|| -\n|| 26\n|  | -\n|  | 17\n|-\n|  | 13th\n|| -\n|| -\n|| 547\n|  | 4\n|  | 394\n|-\n|  | 13th/14th\n|| -\n|| -\n|| 28\n|  | -\n|  | 17\n|-\n|  | 14th\n|| -\n|| -\n|| 511\n|  | -\n|  | 308\n|-\n|  | 14th/15th\n|| -\n|| -\n|| 8\n|  | -\n|  | 2\n|-\n|  | 15th\n|| -\n|| -\n|| 241\n|  | -\n|  | 171\n|-\n|  | 15th/16th\n|| -\n|| -\n|| 4\n|  | -\n|  | 2\n|-\n|  | 16th\n|| -\n|| -\n|| 136\n|  | -\n|  | 194\n|}\n\n===Transmission===\nThe task of copying manuscripts was generally done by [[scribe]]s who were trained professionals in the arts of writing and bookmaking. Some manuscripts were also proofread, and scholars closely examining a text can sometimes find the original and corrections found in certain manuscripts. In the 6th century, a special room devoted to the practice of manuscript writing and [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]] called the [[scriptorium]] came into use, typically inside medieval European monasteries. Sometimes a group of scribes would make copies at the same time as one individual read from the text.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/mss_trans.html|title=Seid|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Manuscript construction===\n\nAn important issue with manuscripts is preservation. The earliest New Testament manuscripts were written on [[papyrus]], made from a reed that grew abundantly in the [[Nile Delta]]. This tradition continued as late as the 8th century.<ref>Metzger 2005, pp.3f</ref> Papyrus eventually becomes brittle and deteriorates with age. The dry climate of Egypt allowed some papyrus manuscripts to be partially preserved, but, with the exception of {{Papyrus link|77}}, no New Testament papyrus manuscript is complete; many consist only of a single fragmented page.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/intro.html#MSTypes|title=Waltz|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> Beginning in the fourth century, [[parchment]] (also called [[vellum]]) began to be a common medium for New Testament manuscripts.<ref>Metzger 2005, pp.3-10</ref> It wasn't until the twelfth century that [[paper]] (made from cotton or plant fibers), which was invented in first-century [[China]], began to gain popularity in biblical manuscripts.<ref>Aland 1995, p. 77</ref>\n\nOf the 476 non-Christian manuscripts dated to the second century, 97% of the manuscripts are in the form of [[scroll]]s; however, eight Christian manuscripts are [[codex|codices]]. In fact, most New Testament manuscripts are codices. The adaptation of the codex form in non-Christian text did not become dominant until the fourth and fifth centuries, showing a preference for that form amongst early Christians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/codex.html|title=Seid|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> The considerable length of some New Testament books (such as the [[Pauline epistles]]), and the New Testament itself, was not suited to the limited space available on a single scroll; in contrast a codex could be expanded to hundreds of pages.  On its own, however, length alone is an insufficient reason - after all, the Jewish scriptures would continue to be transmitted on scrolls for centuries to come.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kruger |first1=Michael J. |title=Canon revisited : establishing the origins and authority of the New Testament books |date=2012 |publisher=Crossway |location=Wheaton, Ill. |isbn=9781433505003 |page=249 |edition=1st}}</ref>  Scholars have argued that the codex was adopted as a product of the formation of the New Testament canon, allowing for a specific collections of documents like the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kruger |first1=Michael J. |title=Canon revisited : establishing the origins and authority of the New Testament books |date=2012 |publisher=Crossway |location=Wheaton, Ill. |isbn=9781433505003 |page=250}}</ref>  \"Canon and codex go hand in hand in the sense that the adoption of a fixed canon could be more easily controlled and promulgated when the codex was the means of gathering together originally separate compositions.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=J.K. |title=Manuscripts, the Codex, and the Canon |journal=Journal for the Study of the New Testament |date=1996 |issue=63 |page=111}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:BookOfDurrowBeginMarkGospel.jpg|thumb|left|The beginning of the [[Gospel of Mark]] from the [[Book of Durrow]].]]\n\n===Script and other features===\n\nThe handwriting found in New Testament manuscripts varies. One way of classifying handwriting is by formality: book-hand vs. cursive. More formal, literary Greek works were often written in a distinctive style of even, capital letters called book-hand. Less formal writing consisted of cursive letters which could be written quickly. Another way of dividing handwriting is between [[uncial script]] (or majuscule) and [[Roman cursive#New Roman cursive|minuscule]]. The uncial letters were a consistent height between the [[baseline (typography)|baseline]] and the cap height, while the minuscule letters had [[Ascender (typography)|ascenders]] and [[descender]]s that moved past the baseline and cap height. Generally speaking, the majuscules are earlier than the minuscules, with a dividing line roughly in the 11th century.<ref>Metzger 2005, pp. 17-18, 20</ref>\n\nThe earliest manuscripts had negligible punctuation and breathing marks. The manuscripts also lacked word spacing, so words, sentences, and paragraphs would be a continuous string of letters ([[scriptio continua]]), often with line breaks in the middle of words. Bookmaking was an expensive endeavor, and one way to reduce the number of pages used was to save space. Another method employed was to abbreviate frequent words, such as the ''[[nomina sacra]]''. Yet another method involved the [[palimpsest]], a manuscript which recycled an older manuscript. Scholars using careful examination can sometimes determine what was originally written on the material of a document before it was erased to make way for a new text (for example ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'' and the ''[[Syriac Sinaiticus]]'').\n\nThe original New Testament books did not have titles, section headings, or [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verse and chapter divisions]]. These were developed over the years as \"helps for readers\". The [[Eusebian Canons]] were an early system of division written in the margin of many manuscripts. The Eusebian Canons are a series of tables that grouped parallel stories among the gospels. Starting in the fifth century, subject headings ([[:wikt:κεφαλαία|κεφαλαία]]) were used.\n\nManuscripts became more ornate over the centuries, which developed into a rich [[illuminated manuscript]] tradition, including the famous Irish [[Gospel Book]]s, the ''[[Book of Kells]]'' and the ''[[Book of Durrow]]''.\n\n===Cataloging===\n[[File:SinopeGospelsFolio29rChristHealingBlind.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A page from the [[Sinope Gospels]]. The miniature at the bottom shows [[Jesus]] healing the blind.]]\n[[Desiderius Erasmus]] compiled the first printed edition of the Greek New Testament in 1516, basing his work on several manuscripts because he did not have a single complete work and because each manuscript had small errors. In the 18th century, [[Johann Jakob Wettstein]] was one of the first biblical scholars to start cataloging biblical manuscripts. He divided the manuscripts based on the writing used ([[uncial]], minuscule) or format ([[Lectionary|lectionaries]]) and based on content ([[Gospel]]s, [[Pauline epistles|Pauline letters]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] + [[General epistles]], and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]). He assigned the uncials letters and minuscules and lectionaries numbers for each grouping of content, which resulted in manuscripts being assigned the same letter or number.<ref>Aland 1995, p. 72</ref>\n\nFor manuscripts that contained the whole New Testament, such as [[Codex Alexandrinus]] (A) and [[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]] (C), the letters corresponded across content groupings. For significant early manuscripts such as [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]] (B), which did not contain Revelation, the letter B was also assigned to a later 10th-century manuscript of Revelation, thus creating confusion. [[Constantin von Tischendorf]] found one of the earliest, nearly complete copies of the Bible, [[Codex Sinaiticus]], over a century after Wettstein's cataloging system was introduced. Because he felt the manuscript was so important, Von Tischendorf assigned it the Hebrew letter [[aleph]] (א). Eventually enough uncials were found that all the letters in the [[Latin alphabet]] had been used, and scholars moved on to first the [[Greek alphabet]], and eventually started reusing characters by adding a [[superscript]]. Confusion also existed in the minuscules, where up to seven different manuscripts could have the same number or a single manuscript of the complete New Testament could have 4 different numbers to describe the different content groupings.<ref>Aland 1995, pp. 72-73</ref>\n\n===={{anchor | Von Soden}}Von Soden====\n\n[[Hermann, Freiherr von Soden]] published a complex cataloging system for manuscripts in 1902-10.<ref>Hermann von Soden, ''Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte'' 4 vols., Berlin: Glaue, 1902-1910.</ref> He grouped the manuscripts based on content, assigning them a Greek prefix: δ for the complete New Testament, ε for the Gospels, and α for the remaining parts. This grouping was flawed because some manuscripts grouped in δ did not contain Revelation, and many manuscripts grouped in α contained either the general epistles or the Pauline epistles, but not both. After the Greek prefix, Von Soden assigned a numeral that roughly corresponded to a date (for example δ1-δ49 were from before the 10th century, δ150-δ249 for the 11th century). This system proved to be problematic when manuscripts were re-dated, or when more manuscripts were discovered than the number of spaces allocated to a certain century.<ref>Aland 1995, pp. 40-41</ref>\n\n===={{anchor | Gregory-Aland}}Gregory–Aland====\n\n[[Caspar René Gregory]] published another cataloging system in 1908 in ''Die griechischen Handschriften des Neuen Testaments'', which is the system still in use today. Gregory divided the manuscripts into four groupings: papyri, uncials, minuscules, and [[Lectionary|lectionaries]]. This division is partially arbitrary. The first grouping is based on the physical material ([[papyrus]]) used in the manuscripts. The second two divisions are based on script: uncial and minuscule. The last grouping is based on content: lectionary. Most of the papyrus manuscripts and the lectionaries before the year 1000 are written in uncial script. There is some consistency in that the majority of the papyri are very early because parchment began to replace papyrus in the 4th century (although the latest papyri dates to the 8th century). Similarly, the majority of the uncials date to before the 11th century, and the majority of the minuscules to after.<ref>Aland 1995, pp. 73-77</ref>\n\nGregory assigned the papyri a prefix of '''P''', often written in [[blackletter]] script ({{Papyrus|n}}), with a superscript numeral. The uncials were given a prefix of the number 0, and the established letters for the major manuscripts were retained for redundancy (''e.g.'' [[Codex Claromontanus]] is assigned both '''06''' and '''D'''). The minuscules were given plain numbers, and the lectionaries were prefixed with '''''l''''' often written in script ('''ℓ'''). [[Kurt Aland]] continued Gregory's cataloging work through the 1950s and beyond. Because of this, the numbering system is often referred to as \"Gregory-Aland numbers\". The most recent manuscripts added to each grouping are {{Papyrus link|131}}, [[Uncial 323|0323]], [[Minuscule 2928|2928]], and ''ℓ'' 2463.<ref>[http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/liste New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room] at the [[University of Münster]] website</ref> Due to the cataloging heritage and because some manuscripts which were initially numbered separately were discovered to be from the same codex, there is some redundancy in the list (''i.e.'' the [[Magdalen papyrus]] has both the numbers of {{Papyrus|64}} and {{Papyrus|67}}).<ref>Aland 1995, pp. 73f</ref>\n\nThe majority of New Testament textual criticism deals with Greek manuscripts because scholars believe the original books of the New Testament were written in Greek. The text of the New Testament is also found both translated in manuscripts of many different languages (called ''versions'') and quoted in manuscripts of the writings of the [[Church Fathers]]. In the [[critical apparatus]] of the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], a series of abbreviations and prefixes designate different language versions (it for Old Latin, lowercase letters for individual Old Latin manuscripts, vg for [[Vulgate]], lat for Latin, sy<sup>s</sup> for [[Sinaitic Palimpsest]], sy<sup>c</sup> for [[Curetonian Gospels]], sy<sup>p</sup> for the [[Peshitta]], co for Coptic, ac for Akhmimic, bo for Bohairic, sa for Sahidic, arm for Armenian, geo for Georgian, got for Gothic, aeth for Ethiopic, and slav for Old Church Slavonic).<ref>NA<sup>27</sup> 1996, pp. 64*-76*</ref>\n\n===Dating the New Testament manuscripts===\n[[Image:Escribano.jpg|thumb|210px|right|An illustration of a European [[scribe]] at work]]\nThe New Testament books appear to have been completed within the 1st century. The original manuscripts of the New Testament books have not survived. The [[autograph]]s were lost or destroyed a long time ago. What survives are copies of the original. Generally speaking, these copies were made centuries after the originals from other copies rather than from the autograph. [[Paleography]], a science of dating manuscripts by typological analysis of their scripts, is the most precise and objective means known for determining the age of a manuscript. Script groups belong typologically to their generation; and changes can be noted with great accuracy over relatively short periods of time. Dating of manuscript material by a [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dating test]] requires that a small part of the material be destroyed in the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-73398/biblical-literature#597996.hook|title=Britannica Online: Types of manuscript errors|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> Both radiocarbon and paleographical dating only give a range of possible dates, and it is still debated just how narrow this range might be. Dates established by radiocarbon dating can present a range of 10 to over 100 years. Similarly, dates established by paleography can present a range of 25 to over 125 years.<ref>F. V. Greifenhagen, ''Egypt on the Pentateuch's Ideological Map''.</ref>\n\n====Earliest extant manuscripts====\nThe earliest manuscript of a New Testament text is a business-card-sized fragment from the [[Gospel of John]], [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], which may be as early as the first half of the 2nd century.

The textual critic seeks to ascertain from the divergent copies which form of the text should be regarded as most conforming to the original.<ref>Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration''.</ref> The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in three major manuscript traditions: the 4th-century-CE [[Alexandrian text-type]], the [[Western text-type]], and the [[Byzantine text-type]], which includes over 80% of all manuscripts, the majority comparatively very late in the tradition.\n\nSince the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no ''a priori'' bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament. This is reflected in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], which since 2014 corresponds to both the United Bible Society, 5th edition and Nestle-Aland, 28th edition. In [[textual criticism]], eclecticism is the practice of examining a wide number of text witnesses and selecting the variant that seems best. The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence. Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the [[Alexandrian text-type]], are the most favored, and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition.<ref name=\"ISBN 9039001057\">Aland, B. 1994: 138</ref> Modern translations of the New Testament are based on these copies.\n\nTextual scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]] writes: \"It is true, of course, that the New Testament is abundantly attested in the manuscripts produced through the ages, but most of these manuscripts are many centuries removed from the originals, and none of them perfectly accurate. They all contain mistakes - altogether many thousands of mistakes. It is not an easy task to reconstruct the original words of the New Testament....\"<ref>''The New Testament: An Historical Introduction To The Early Christian Writings'', Bart Ehrman p. 449</ref> In reference to the textual evidence for the New Testament, [[Bruce M. Metzger]] wrote,\n\n{{quote|In evaluating the significance of these statistics...one should consider, by way of contrast, the number of manuscripts which preserve the text of the ancient classics. Homer's ''[[Iliad]]''...is preserved by 457 papyri, 2 uncial manuscripts, and 188 minuscule manuscripts. Among the tragedians the witnesses to [[Euripides]] are the most abundant; his extant works are preserved in 54 papyri and 276 parchment manuscripts, almost all of the later dating from the Byzantine period...the time between the composition of the books of the New Testament and the earliest extant copies is relatively brief. Instead of the lapse of a millennium or more, as is the case of not a few classical authors, several papyrus manuscripts of portions of the New Testament are extant which were copies within a century or so after the composition of the original documents.<ref>''The Text Of The New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption & Restoration'', 1992, Third Enlarged Edition, [[Bruce Metzger]], p. 33-35</ref><ref>As a footnote to his comments, [[Bruce Metzger|Metzger]] also said, \"Lest, however, the wrong impression be conveyed from the statistics given above regarding the total number of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, it should be pointed out that most of the [[New Testament papyrus|papyri]] are relatively fragmentary and that only about fifty manuscripts (of which the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] is the only [[Uncial script|Uncial manuscript]]) contain the entire New Testament.\" ''The Text Of The New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption & Restoration'', 1992, Third Enlarged Edition, Bruce Metzger, p. 34</ref>}}\n\nBiblical scholar [[Gary Habermas]] adds, \n\n{{quote|What is usually meant is that the New Testament has far more manuscript evidence from a far earlier period than other classical works. There are just under 6000 NT manuscripts, with copies of most of the NT dating from just 100 years or so after its writing. Classical sources almost always have fewer than 20 copies each and usually date from 700-1400 years after the composition of the work. In this regard, the classics are not as well attested. While this doesn't guarantee truthfulness, it means that it is much easier to reconstruct the New Testament text. Regarding genre, the Gospels are usually taken today to be examples of Roman biographies.<ref>[Quoted from http://www.garyhabermas.com/qa/qa_index.htm]</ref>}}\n\nEvery year, several New Testament manuscripts handwritten in the original Greek format are discovered. The latest substantial find was in 2008, when 47 new manuscripts were discovered in [[Albania]]; at least 17 of them unknown to Western scholars.<ref>Michelle A Vu, [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/nt.scholar.on.discovery.of.giant.trove.of.bible.manuscripts/18204.htm \"NT scholar on discovery of giant trove of Bible manuscripts,\"] ''[[Christianity Today]]'', April 21, 2008</ref>  There has been an estimate of 400,000 variations among all these manuscripts (from the 2nd to 15th century).<ref>Daniel Wallace, https://bible.org/article/number-textual-variants-evangelical-miscalculation</ref>   If you spread those 400,000 variations over 5,600 manuscripts, that comes out to only about 71 variations per manuscript.  (400,000 divided by 5,600).  And some of these manuscripts are the equivalent of several hundred pages of text, hand-written (see [[Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Alexandrinus]], et al.).  The number of variants is additionally less significant than may appear since it is a comparison across linguistic boundaries.  More important estimates focus on comparing texts within languages. Those variations are considerably fewer. The vast majority of these are accidental errors made by [[scribe]]s, and are easily identified as such: [[Haplography|an omitted word]], [[Homoioteleuton|a duplicate line]], a misspelling, a rearrangement of words. Some variations involve apparently intentional changes, which often make more difficult a determination of whether they were corrections from better exemplars, [[harmonization]]s between readings, or ideologically motivated.<ref>Ehrman 2004, pp.480f</ref> Variants are listed in critical editions of the text, the most important of which is the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], which is the basis for most modern translations. For over 250 years, Christian scholars have argued that no textual variant affects key Christian doctrine.<ref>Wallace, Daniel. \"[https://bible.org/article/majority-text-and-original-text-are-they-identical The Majority Text and the Original Text: Are They Identical]?\".
