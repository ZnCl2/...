The term \"Obamacare\" was first used by opponents, then [[reappropriated]] by supporters, and eventually used by President Obama himself.<ref name=\"CNN20120625Obamacare\"/> Together with the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]] amendment, it represents the [[U.S. healthcare system]]'s most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] in 1965.<ref name=\"Oberlander2010\"/><ref name=\"Blumenthal2015\"/><ref name=\"CohenEtAl\"/><ref name=\"ReutersSCOTUS\"/>\n\nThe ACA's major provisions came into force in 2014. By 2016, the uninsured share of the population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20 to 24 million additional people covered during 2016.<ref name=CBO_Subsidy2016/><ref name=HHS_ASPE16/> The increased coverage was due, roughly equally, to an expansion of Medicaid eligibility and to major changes to [[Individually purchased health insurance|individual insurance]] markets. Both involved new spending, funded through a combination of new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates and [[Medicare Advantage]]. Several [[Congressional Budget Office]] reports said that overall these provisions reduced the [[Government budget balance|budget deficit]], that repealing the ACA would increase the deficit,<ref name=\"CBO50252\"/><ref name=\"CBO22077\"/> and that the law reduced income inequality by taxing primarily the top 1% to fund roughly $600 in benefits on average to families in the bottom 40% of the income distribution.<ref name=\"CBO_Dist14\"/> The law also enacted a host of [[Healthcare industry#Delivery of services|delivery system]] reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. After the law went into effect, increases in overall healthcare spending slowed, including premiums for employer-based insurance plans.<ref name=Kaiser15/>\n\nThe act largely retains the existing structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the [[Health insurance in the United States#Employer sponsored|employer market]], but individual markets were radically overhauled around a three-legged scheme.<ref name=\"Oberlander2010\"/><ref name=\"Gruber2011\">{{cite journal |last1=Gruber |first1=Jonathan |title=The Impacts of the Affordable Care Act: How Reasonable Are the Projections? |journal=National Tax Journal |date=2011 |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=893–908 |url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/11416 |accessdate=23 July 2017 |doi=10.17310/ntj.2011.3.06}}</ref> Insurers in these markets are made to [[Guaranteed issue|accept all applicants]] and [[Community rating|charge the same rates]] regardless of [[pre-existing condition]]s or sex. To combat resultant [[adverse selection]], the act [[Individual shared responsibility provision|mandates]] that individuals buy insurance and insurers cover a list of \"[[essential health benefits]]\". However, a repeal of the tax mandate, passed as part of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], will become effective in 2019. To help households between 100–400% of the [[Poverty in the United States#Recent poverty rate and guidelines|Federal Poverty Line]] afford these compulsory policies, the law provides [[premium tax credit|insurance premium subsidies]]. Other individual market changes include [[health insurance marketplace|health marketplaces]] and [[Risk equalization|risk adjustment]] programs.\n\nThe act has also faced challenges and opposition. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled 5 to 4 [[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius|in 2012]] that states could choose not to participate in the ACA's Medicaid expansion, although it upheld the law as a whole.<ref name=NatLawReview2012/> The federal [[health exchange]], [[HealthCare.gov]], faced major technical problems at the beginning of its rollout in 2013. In 2017, a unified [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] government failed to pass [[American Health Care Act of 2017|several different]] partial repeals of the ACA. The law spent several years opposed by a slim [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of Americans polled, although its provisions were generally more popular than the law as a whole,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kirzinger |first1=Ashley |last2=Sugarman |first2=Elise |last3=Brodie |first3=Mollyann |title=Kaiser Health Tracking Poll: November 2016 |url=http://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-november-2016/ |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |accessdate=23 July 2017 |date=1 December 2016}}</ref> and the law gained majority support by 2017.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gallup: ObamaCare has majority support for first time |url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/327267-poll-obamacare-has-majority-support-for-first-time |accessdate=18 November 2017 |work=The Hill |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Provisions==\n{{Main|Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act}}\n[[File:Barack Obama reacts to the passing of Healthcare bill.jpg|thumb|The President and White House Staff react to the House of Representatives passing the bill on March 21, 2010.]]\n[[File:View From the Speaker's Office Tonight (4452690853).jpg|thumb|right|[[Jim Clyburn]] and Nancy Pelosi celebrating after the House passes the amended bill on March 21]]\nThe ACA includes provisions to take effect from 2010 to 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014.

This controversial decision significantly raised premiums on the ACA exchanges along with the premium tax credit subsidies that rise with them, with the CBO estimating a $200 billion increase in the budget deficit over a decade. The reasons for this are complex and require discussion of how the two major subsidies work.<ref name=\"Vox1SK\">Kliff, Sarah (October 18, 2017).

The second and larger type of subsidy, the premium tax credits designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium tax credits.<ref name=\"CBOSubsidy17\">[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53091 \"Federal Subsidies for Health Insurance Coverage for People Under Age 65: 2017 to 2027\"]. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. September 14, 2017.</ref> A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide to appropriate funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.<ref name=\"Vox1SK\"/>\n\nHowever, the premium tax credits are mandatory spending, meaning all those eligible under the ACA receive them without Congressional appropriation. These adjust with premium increases to limit after-subsidy premium payments by ACA enrollees to a fixed percentage of income. Based on President Trump's threats to end the CSR payments during early 2017, several insurers and actuarial groups estimated this resulted in a 20 percentage point or more increase in premiums for the 2018 plan year. In other words, premium increases expected to be 10% or less in 2018 became 28–40% instead.<ref name=\"VoxDS1\"/><ref name=\"Vox1SK\"/>\n\nThe CBO reported in August 2017 (prior to President Trump's decision) that ending the CSR payments might increase ACA premiums by 20 percentage points or more, with a resulting increase of nearly $200 billion in the budget deficit over a decade, as the premium tax credit subsidies would rise along with premium prices. CBO also estimated that initially up to one million fewer would have health insurance coverage, although more might have it in the long-run as the subsidies expand. CBO expected the exchanges to remain stable (i.e., no \"death spiral\" before or after Trump's action) as the premiums would increase and prices would stabilize at the higher (non-CSR) level.<ref name=\"CBO-CSR1\">[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53009 \"The Effects of Terminating Payments for Cost-Sharing Reductions\"]. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. August 15, 2017.</ref>\n\nCBO estimated that of the 12 million with private insurance via the ACA exchanges in 2017, about 10 million receive premium tax credit subsidies and will be shielded from premium increases, as their after-subsidy premiums are limited as a percentage of income under the ACA. However, those 2 million who do not receive subsidies face the brunt of the 20%+ premium increases, without subsidy assistance. This may adversely impact enrollment in 2018 and beyond. Another 13 million who are covered under the ACA's Medicaid expansion (in the 31 states that chose to expand coverage) should not be directly affected by Trump's action.<ref name=\"CBO-CSR1\"/><ref name=\"CBOSubsidy17\"/>\n\nPresident Trump's argument that the CSR payments were a \"bailout\" for insurance companies and therefore should be stopped, actually results in the government paying more
