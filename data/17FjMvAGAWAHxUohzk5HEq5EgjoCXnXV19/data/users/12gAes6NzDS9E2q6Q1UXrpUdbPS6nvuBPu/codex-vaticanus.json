Hort's argument for Rome rests mainly on certain spellings of proper names, such as Ισακ and Ιστραηλ, which show a Western or Latin influence. A second argument is that the chapter division of Acts, similar to that of Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, is not found in any other Greek manuscript, but is present in several manuscripts of the Latin [[Vulgate]].<ref>Brook F. Westcott and Fenton J. A. Hort, ''Introduction to the New Testament in the Original Greek'' (New York: Harper & Bros., 1882; reprint, Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 1988), pp. 264–267.</ref> [[Armitage Robinson|Robinson]] counters the argument by suggesting that this system of chapter divisions was introduced into the Vulgate by [[Jerome]] himself, as a result of his studies at Caesarea.<ref>Robinson, ''Euthaliana'', pp. 42, 101.</ref> According to Hort, it was copied from a manuscript whose line length was 12–14 letters per line, because where the Codex Vaticanus's scribe made large omissions, they were typically 12–14 letters long.<ref>Brook F.

Hort, ''Introduction to the New Testament in the Original Greek'' (New York: Harper & Bros., 1882; reprint, Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 1988), pp. 233–234.</ref>\n\nKenyon suggested that the manuscript originated in Alexandria: \"It is noteworthy that the section numeration of the Pauline Epistles in B shows that it was copied from a manuscript in which the Epistle to the Hebrews was placed between Galatians and Ephesians — an arrangement which elsewhere occurs only in the Sahidic version.\"<ref name = G.Kenyon84/> A connection with Egypt is also indicated, according to Kenyon, by the order of the Pauline epistles and by the fact that, as in the Codex Alexandrinus, the titles of some of the books contain letters of a distinctively Coptic character, particularly the Coptic [[Mu (letter)|mu]], used not only in titles but frequently at the ends of lines where space has to be economized.<ref name = G.Kenyon84>Frederic G. Kenyon, ''Handbook to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament'', London<sup>2</sup>, 1912, p. 84.</ref> According to Metzger, \"the similarity of its text in significant portions of both Testaments with the Coptic versions and with Greek papyri, and the style of writing (notably the Coptic forms used in some of the titles) point rather to Egypt and Alexandria\".<ref name = Metzger/>\n\nIt has been postulated that at one time the manuscript was in the possession of Cardinal [[Johannes Bessarion|Bessarion]], because the minuscule supplement has a text similar to one of Bessarion's manuscripts. [[T. C. Skeat]] believes that Bessarion's mentor, the patriarchal notary in Constantinople [[John Chortasmenos]], had the book brought to Rome from [[Constantinople]] around the time of the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref>see [[Theodore Cressy Skeat]], « The Codex Vaticanus in the fifteenth century », in ''The Collected Biblical Writings of T. C. Skeat'', J. K. Elliott (ed.), Brill, Leiden, 2004.</ref> According to [[Paul Canart]], the decorative initials added to the manuscript in the Middle Ages are reminiscent of Constantinopolitan decoration of the 10th century, but the poor execution gives the impression they were added in the 11th or 12th century, and likely not before the 12th century in light of the way they appear in connection with notes in a minuscule hand at the beginning of the book of Daniel.<ref>Paul Canart, \"Notice paléographique et codicologique\", in P. Andrist (ed.) ''Le manuscrit B de la Bible (Vaticanus graecus 1209)'', (Lausanne: Éditions du Zèbre, 2009), pp.26 & 32-38.</ref> [[Theodore Cressy Skeat|T. C. Skeat]], a [[paleography|paleographer]] at the [[British Museum]], first argued that Codex Vaticanus was among the [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine|50 Bibles]] that the Emperor [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine I]] ordered [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] to produce.<ref>T. C. Skeat, \"The Codex Sinaiticus, the Codex Vaticanus and Constantine\", JTS 50 (1999), pp. 583–625.</ref> The similarity of the text with the papyri and Coptic version (including some letter formation), parallels with Athanasius' canon of 367 suggest an Egyptian or Alexandrian origin.\n\nThe manuscript is dated to the first half of the 4th century and is likely slightly older than [[Codex Sinaiticus]], which was also transcribed in the 4th century. One argument to support this, is that Sinaiticus already has the, at that time, very new Eusebian Canon tables, but Vaticanus does not. Another is the slightly more archaic style of Vaticanus, and the complete absence of ornamentation.<ref name=autogenerated1>F. G.

In 1521, Bombasius was consulted by Erasmus as to whether the Codex Vaticanus contained the [[Comma Johanneum]], and Bombasius supplied a transcript of 1 John 4:1–3 and 1 John 5:7–11 to show that it did not. Sepúlveda in 1533 cross-checked all places where Erasmus's New Testament (the [[Textus Receptus]]) differed from the Vulgate, and supplied Erasmus with 365 readings where the Codex Vaticanus supported the latter, although the list of these 365 readings has been lost.<ref group=\"n\">We know nothing about these 365 readings except one. Erasmus in his ''Adnotationes'' on Acts 27:16 wrote that according to the Codex from the Library Pontifici, the name of the island is καυδα (Cauda), not κλαυδα (Clauda) as in his ''[[Novum Instrumentum omne|Novum Testamentum]]'' (''Tamet si quidam admonent in codice Graeco pontificiae bibliothecae scriptum haberi, καυδα, id est, cauda''). See: Erasmus Desiderius, ''Erasmus’ Annotations on the New Testament: Acts – Romans – I and II Corinthians'', ed. A. Reeve and M. A. Sceech, (Brill: Leiden 1990), p. 931. [[Andrew Birch]] was the first, who identified this note with 365 readings of Sepulveda.</ref> Consequently, the Codex Vaticanus acquired the reputation of being an old Greek manuscript that agreed with the Vulgate rather than with the Textus Receptus. Not until much later would scholars realise it conformed to a text that differed from both the Vulgate and the Textus Receptus – a text that could also be found in other known early Greek manuscripts, such as the [[Codex Regius (New Testament)|Codex Regius]] (L), housed in the French Royal Library (now [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]).<ref name = Tregelles108>[[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles|S. P. Tregelles]], ''An Introduction to the Critical study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures'', London 1856, p. 108.</ref>\n\nIn 1669 a collation was made by [[Giulio Bartolocci]], librarian of the Vatican, which was not published, and never used until [[Johann Martin Augustin Scholz|Scholz]] in 1819 found a copy of it in the Royal Library at Paris. This collation was imperfect and revised in 1862.<ref name = G.Kenyon78>[[Frederic G. Kenyon]], \"Handbook to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament\", London<sup>2</sup>, 1912, p. 78.</ref> Another collation was made in 1720 for [[Richard Bentley|Bentley]] by Mico, revised by Rulotta, although not published until 1799.<ref name = G.Kenyon78/> Bentley was stirred by [[John Mill (theologian)|Mill's]] claim of 30,000 variants in the New Testament and he wanted to reconstruct the text of the New Testament in its early form. He felt that among the manuscripts of the New Testament, Codex Alexandrinus was \"the oldest and best in the world\".<ref>R.C. Jebb, ''Richard Bentley'' (New York 1966), p. 487.</ref> Bentley understood the necessity to use manuscripts if he were to reconstruct an older form than that apparent in Codex Alexandrinus. He assumed, that by supplementing this manuscript with readings from other Greek manuscripts, and from the Latin Vulgate, he could triangulate back to the single recension which he presumed existed at the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. Therefore, he required a collation from Vaticanus. Unfortunately, the text of the collation was irreconcilable with Codex Alexandrinus and he abandoned the project.<ref>William L. Petersen, ''What Text can New Yestament Textual Criticism Ultimately Reach'', in: B. Aland & J. Delobel (eds.) ''New Testament Textual Criticism, Exegesis and Church History'' (Pharos: Kampen, 1994), p. 137.</ref>\n\nA further collation was made by [[Andrew Birch]], who in 1798 in Copenhagen edited some textual variants of the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles,<ref>Andreas Birch, ''Variae Lectiones ad Textum Actorum Apostolorum, Epistolarum Catholicarum et Pauli'' (Copenhagen 1798).</ref> in 1800 for the Book of Revelation,<ref>Andreas Birch, ''Variae lectiones ad Apocalypsin'' (Copenhagen 1800).</ref> in 1801 for the Gospels.<ref>Andreas Birch, ''Variae Lectiones ad Textum IV Evangeliorum'' (Copenhagen 1801).</ref> They were incomplete and included together with the textual variants from the other manuscripts.<ref name = G.Kenyon/> Many of them were false.
