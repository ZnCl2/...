SCRIPT was developed for [[CP/CMS|CP-67/CMS]] by [[Stuart Madnick]]<ref name=\"smadnick\" /><ref name=\"TheRootsOfSgml\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sgmlsource.com/history/roots.htm|year=1996|title=The Roots of SGML - A Personal Recollection|author=Charles F. Goldfarb|accessdate=2012-02-26}}</ref> at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], succeeding [[TYPSET and RUNOFF|CTSS RUNOFF]].\n\nSCRIPT is a ''procedural markup'' language.  Inline commands called ''control words'', indicated by a [[Period (punctuation)|period]] in the first column of a logical line, describe the desired appearance of the formatted text. SCRIPT originally provided a '''2PASS''' option to allow text to refer to variables defined later in the text, but subsequent versions allowed more than two passes.\n\n==Native SCRIPT control words==\nSCRIPT allows space units in control words to be specified in a number of units including inches, centimeters, millimeters, [[Pica (typography)|picas]], [[Cicero (typography)|ciceros]], m-spaces, or ''device units'' ([[Pixel|pels]] at the current device resolution).  Vertical space units are assumed to be ''lines'' unless otherwise specified.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! control word !! function !! example !! \n|-\n| <code>.sp</code> || Inserts blank vertical space || .sp 1 || Inserts one blank line\n|-\n| <code>.ce</code> || Centers following lines || .ce 2 || Centers the following two lines on the current page or column\n|-\n| <code>.ez</code> || Controls EasyScript || .ez P foo bar || Starts paragraph with text '''foo bar'''; equivalent to '''&amp;P.foo bar''' after .ez on\n|-\n| <code>.im</code> || Imbeds a file at the current location || .im BLRPLT || Inserts the file 'BLRPLT SCRIPT' \n|-\n| <code>.ju</code> || Turn on/off justify mode || .ju on || Requests that subsequent lines be justified<br>until .ju off is encountered\n|-\n| <code>.rh</code> || Specify [[Page header|''running head'']] information || .rh || Identify following lines as running head<br>until .rh off is encountered\n|-\n| <code>.df</code> || Define a named [[font]] || .df examp type('Century Schoolbook' 10 light) || Specifies attributes for font named 'examp'.\n|-\n| <code>.bf</code> || Specify font for following text || .bf title || 'title' is the name of a font identified by a .df control word.\n|-\n| <code>.se</code> || Assigns a value to a variable symbol || .se month = January || Assigns a value to the variable &month that will replace every subsequent occurrence of &month in the input text until &amp;month is redefined.\n|}\n\n==SCRIPT macros==\nScript includes a facility for user-defined macros and for automatically reading a profile containing macro definitions and other commands. Several packages for semantic tagging, including [[#Generalized Markup Language|GML]] and [[#EasyScript|EasyScript]] are built on top of this facility.\n\n==Generalized Markup Language==\n{{Main|Generalized Markup Language}}\nIBM's [[IBM Generalized Markup Language|Generalized Markup Language]] (GML) is a ''descriptive markup'' layer describing the logical structure of a document. Both SCRIPT/VS and the GML Starter Set are part of IBM's Document Composition Facility (DCF), used in the [[System/370]] platform and successors. The Starter Set<ref>\"IBM Document Composition Facility: Generalized Markup Language  Starter Set User's Guide\", SH20-9186</ref><ref>\"IBM Document Composition Facility: Generalized Markup Language  Starter Set Reference\", SH20-9187</ref><ref>\"DCF V1R4.0: GML Implement. Gde \", SH35-0050-05</ref> is a macro language encapsulating a set of SCRIPT commands. The tag sets of the [[IBM BookMaster|BookMaster]]<ref>[http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=dd&subtype=sm&htmlfid=897/ENUS5688-015 5688-015 IBM Host Publishing Systems BookMaster R4]</ref><ref>[http://publibfp.dhe.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr/Shelves/edf01a02 BookMaster V1R4.0 Bookshelf product on Printing and Publishing CD]</ref> and [[BookManager BUILD/MVS]]<ref>[http://publibfp.dhe.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr/Shelves/eoxeoy07 BookManager READ/MVS and BUILD/MVS V1R3.0 Bookshelf]</ref> products are built on a foundation of the GML Starter Set syntax and implementation.\n\nThe [[Standard Generalized Markup Language]] (SGML) is a descendant of GML. While DCF does not directly handle SGML, there is an SGML translator available as a separate product.\n\n===EasyScript===\n'''EasyScript''' is a set of macro definitions and profiles included with Script/370<ref>{{cite manual\n |     author = IBM\n |      title = SCRIPT/370 Text Processing Facility Under Virtual Machine Facility/370 (VM/370) Program Description/Operations Manual Program Number 5796-PAF\n |    chapter =\n |    section =\n | sectionurl =\n |    version = First Edition\n |  publisher = IBM\n |       date = November 1972\n |        url = http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/370/CMS/SH20-1114-0_SCRIPT_370_Text_Processing_Facility_Nov72.pdf\n |     format = PDF\n |         id = SH20-1114-0\n | accessdate =\n |      quote =\n |       page =\n |      pages =\n |        ref =}}</ref> Version 3<ref>{{cite manual\n |     author = IBM\n |      title = SCRIPT/370 Version 3 User's Guide Program Number: 5796ÃºPHL\n |    chapter =\n |    section =\n | sectionurl =\n |    version = First Edition\n |  publisher = IBM\n |       date = September 1976\n |        url = http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/370/CMS/SH20-1857-0_SCRIPT_370_Version_3_Users_Guide_Sep76.pdf\n |     format = PDF\n |         id = SH20-1857-0\n | accessdate =\n |      quote =\n |       page =\n |      pages =\n |        ref =}}</ref><ref>{{cite manual\n |     author = IBM\n |      title = SCRIPT/370 Text Processing Facility Under Virtual Machine Facility/370 (VM/370) Systems Guide Program Number 5796-PAF\n |    chapter =\n |    section =\n | sectionurl =\n |    version =\n |  publisher = IBM\n |       date =\n |        url = http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/370/CMS/LY20-0762-0_SCRIPT_370_Text_Processing_Facility_Systems_Guide_Nov72.pdf\n |     format = PDF\n |         id = LY20-0762-0\n | accessdate =\n |      quote =\n |       page =\n |      pages =\n |        ref =}}</ref> that implements a primitive version of GML.
