The content of an MHTML file is encoded using the same techniques that were first developed for [[HTML email]] messages, using the MIME content type <code>multipart/related</code>.<ref>{{cite web|first=Amanda |last=Holden|title=Difference of HTML & MHTML|url=https://www.techwalla.com/articles/difference-of-html-mhtml|accessdate=17 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117122700/https://www.techwalla.com/articles/difference-of-html-mhtml|archivedate=17 November 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}</ref> MHTML files use a '''.mhtml''' or '''.mht''' [[filename extension]].\n\nThe first part of the file is an [[e-mail header]]. The second part is normally HTML code. Subsequent parts are additional resources identified by their original [[URL|uniform resource locator]]s (URLs) and encoded in [[base64]] [[binary-to-text encoding]]. MHTML was  proposed as an open standard, then circulated in a revised edition in 1999 as RFC 2557.\n\nThe .mhtml (Web archive) and [[Email#Filename extensions|.eml]] (email) filename extensions are interchangeable: either filename extension can be changed from one to the other. An .eml message can be sent by e-mail, and it can be displayed by an [[email client]]. An email message can be saved using a .mhtml or .mht filename extension and then opened for display in a web browser or for editing other programs, including [[word processor]]s and [[text editor]]s.\n\n==Browser support==\n{{Primary sources|section|date=August 2011}}\n\nSome browsers support the MHTML format, either directly or through third-party extensions, but the process for saving a web page along with its resources as an MHTML file is not standardized. Due to this, a web page saved as an MHTML file using one browser may render differently on another.\n\n===Internet Explorer===\nAs of version 5.0, [[Internet Explorer|IE]] was the first browser to support reading and saving web pages and external resources to a single MHTML file.\n\n===Opera===\nSupport for saving web pages as MHTML files was made available in the [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] 9.0 web browser.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/show.dml/172375 |title=â€¦and one more weekly! |last=Santambrogio |first=Claudio |date=10 March 2006 |publisher=[[Opera Software]] |accessdate=2009-05-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115001636/http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/show.dml/172375 |archivedate=15 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> From Opera 9.50 through the rest of the Presto-based Opera product line (currently at Opera 12.16 as of 19 July 2013), the default format for saving pages is MHTML. The initial release of the new Webkit/Blink-based Opera (Opera 15) did not support MHTML, but subsequent releases (Opera 16 onwards) do.\n\nMHTML can be enabled by typing \"opera://flags#save-page-as-mhtml\" at the address bar.\n\n=== Google Chrome ===\nCreating MHTML files in Google Chrome ([[Google Chrome version history|v25]]+) is supported by toggling the experimental \"Save Page as MHTML\" option by visiting the link \"chrome://flags/#save-page-as-mhtml\" in the Chrome browser. There are several third-party extensions that use the code supporting this functionality to provide a user interface for page saving.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://github.com/rahiel/archiveror |title=GitHub - rahiel/archiveror: Archiveror will help you preserve the webpages you love. ðŸ’¾ |website=GitHub |accessdate=2018-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://github.com/vsDizzy/SaveAsMHT |title=GitHub - vsDizzy/SaveAsMHT: Chrome extension saving page as .mht |website=GitHub |accessdate=2018-10-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Firefox ===\n[[Mozilla Firefox]] does not support MHTML.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bug 40873 - Save as rfc 2557 MHTML; complete webpage in one file|url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40873}}</ref> Until the advent of [[History of Firefox#Firefox 57|version 57 (\"Firefox Quantum\")]], MHT files could be read and written by installing a [[browser extension]], such as [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mozilla-archive-format/ Mozilla Archive Format] or [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/unmht/ UnMHT].\n\n=== Safari ===\nAs of version 3.1.1 onwards, [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser still does not natively support the MHTML format.  Instead, Safari supports the [[webarchive]] format, and the [[macOS]] version includes a print-to-[[PDF]] feature.\n\nAs with most other modern web browsers, support for MHTML files can be added to Safari via various third-party extensions.\n\n=== Konqueror ===\nAs of version 3.5.7, [[KDE]]'s [[Konqueror]] web browser does not support MHTML files. An extension project, [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mhtconv mhtconv], can be used to allow saving and viewing of MHTML files.\n\n===ACCESS NetFront===\n[[NetFront]] 3.4 (on devices such as the Sony Ericsson [[K850]]) can view and save MHTML files.\n\n===Pale Moon===\n[[Pale Moon (web browser)|Pale Moon]] requires an extension to be installed to read and write MHT files.  One extension is freely available, [https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/mozarchiver/ MozArchiver], a fork of Mozilla Archive Format extension.\n\n=== GNOME Web ===\n\nIn recent versions of [[Web (web browser)|GNOME Web]] it is possible to save web pages as MHTML.\n\n=== Vivaldi ===\n[[Vivaldi (web browser)|Vivaldi]] supports both reading and writing MHTML files by toggling the \"vivaldi://flags/#save-page-as-mhtml\" option.\n\n=== MHT viewers ===\nThere are commercial software products for viewing MHTML files and converting them to other formats, such as PDF and [[ePub]]. Some [[HTML editor]] programs can view and edit MHTML files<!--E.g. free WizHtmlEditor, among others, can edit MHTML-->.\n\n==MIME type==\nMIME type for MHTML is not well agreed upon. Used MIME types include:\n* multipart/related\n* application/x-mimearchive\n* message/rfc822\n\n==Other apps==\n\n=== Problem Steps Recorder ===\nProblem Steps Recorder for Windows can save its output to MHT format.\n\n=== Save to Google Drive extension ===\nThe \"Save to Google Drive\" extension for [[Google Chrome]] can save as MHTML as one of its outputs.\n\n===Microsoft OneNote===\n[[Microsoft OneNote]], starting with OneNote 2010, emails individual pages as .mht files.\n\n===Evernote===\n[[Evernote]] for Windows can export notes as MHT format, as an alternative to HTML or its own native .enex format.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Data URI scheme]]\n* [[Mozilla Archive Format]]\n* [[Mpack (Unix)]]\n* [[Webarchive]]\n* [[Web ARChive]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/ietf/mhtml.html MHTML standard explained]\n* RFC 2557 (1999)â€”MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML (MHTML)\n* RFC 2110 (1997, Obsolete)â€”MIME E-mail Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML (MHTML)\n* [http://www.bitrecover.com/mht/viewer/ Free MHT Viewer]â€”A Free application to view MHTML files in batch on Windows\n* [https://github.com/lsowen/mht-rip MHT-ripâ€”A program to view MHTML files on Linux]\n\n{{web browsers}}\n{{Internet Explorer}}\n{{Microsoft Office}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mhtml}}\n[[Category:Archive formats]]\n[[Category:Internet Explorer]]\n[[Category:HTML]]\n[[Category:MIME]]\n[[Category:Web Archives]]",
