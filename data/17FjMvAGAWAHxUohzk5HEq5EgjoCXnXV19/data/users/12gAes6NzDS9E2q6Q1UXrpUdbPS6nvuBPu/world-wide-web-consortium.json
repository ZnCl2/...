It was founded at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] [[Laboratory for Computer Science]] (MIT/LCS) with support from the [[European Commission]] and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]]), which had pioneered the [[ARPANET]], one of the predecessors to the [[Internet]].<ref name=\"consortium\"/>\n\nThe organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of new standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors, causing inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors to implement a set of core principles and components which are chosen by the consortium.\n\nIt was originally intended that CERN host the European branch of W3C; however, CERN wished to focus on particle physics, not information technology. In April 1995, the [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] (INRIA) became the European host of W3C, with [[Keio University]] Research Institute at [[Keio University Shonan Fujisawa Campus|SFC]] (KRIS) becoming the Asian host in September 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/Press/Keio-PR.html|title=Press Release: Keio University joins MIT and INRIA in hosting W3C|website=www.w3.org|access-date=2017-07-13}}</ref> Starting in 1997, W3C created regional offices around the world. As of September 2009, it had eighteen World Offices covering Australia, the Benelux countries (Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium), Brazil, China, Finland, Germany, Austria, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, South Korea, Morocco, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and, as of 2016, the United Kingdom and Ireland.<ref name=\"Offices\">{{cite web|url = http://www.w3.org/Consortium/org#offices|title = W3C Offices|accessdate =14 September 2009|last = Jacobs|first = Ian|date=June 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, W3C convened a community of major web players and publishers to establish a [[MediaWiki]] wiki that seeks to document open web standards called the [[WebPlatform]] and WebPlatform Docs.\n\nIn January 2013, [[Beihang University]] became the Chinese host.\n\n==Specification maturation==\nSometimes, when a specification becomes too large, it is split into independent modules which can mature at their own pace. Subsequent editions of a module or specification are known as levels and are denoted by the first integer in the title (e.g. CSS3 = Level 3). Subsequent revisions on each level are denoted by an integer following a decimal point (e.g. CSS2.1 = Revision 1).\n\nThe W3C standard formation process is defined within the W3C process document, outlining four maturity levels through which each new standard or recommendation must progress.<ref name=\"W3CDevProc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#rec-advance |title=World Wide Web Consortium &#124; Development Process |publisher=W3.org |date=2005-04-12 |accessdate=2012-04-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Working draft (WD) ===\nAfter enough content has been gathered from 'editor drafts' and discussion, it may be published as a working draft (WD) for review by the community. A WD document is the first form of a standard that is publicly available. Commentary by virtually anyone is accepted, though no promises are made with regard to action on any particular element commented upon.<ref name=\"W3CDevProc\" />\n\nAt this stage, the standard document may have significant differences from its final form. As such, anyone who implements WD standards should be ready to significantly modify their implementations as the standard matures.<ref name=\"W3CDevProc\" />\n\n=== Candidate recommendation (CR) ===\nA candidate recommendation is a version of a standard that is more mature than the WD. At this point, the group responsible for the standard is satisfied that the standard meets its goal. The purpose of the CR is to elicit aid from the development community as to how implementable the standard is.<ref name=\"W3CDevProc\" />\n\nThe standard document may change further, but at this point, significant features are mostly decided. The design of those features can still change due to feedback from implementors.<ref name=\"W3CDevProc\" />\n\n=== Proposed recommendation (PR) ===\nA proposed recommendation is the version of a standard that has passed the prior two levels. The users of the standard provide input. At this stage, the document is submitted to the W3C Advisory Council for final approval.<ref name=\"W3CDevProc\" />\n\nWhile this step is important, it rarely causes any significant changes to a standard as it passes to the next phase.<ref name=\"W3CDevProc\" />\n\nBoth candidates and proposals may enter \"last call\" to signal that any further feedback must be provided.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n=== W3C recommendation (REC) ===\nThis is the most mature stage of development. At this point, the standard has undergone extensive review and testing, under both theoretical and practical conditions. The standard is now endorsed by the W3C, indicating its readiness for deployment to the public, and encouraging more widespread support among implementors and authors.<ref name=\"W3CDevProc\" />\n\nRecommendations can sometimes be implemented incorrectly, partially, or not at all, but many standards define two or more levels of conformance that developers must follow if they wish to label their product as W3C-compliant.<ref name=\"W3CDevProc\" />\n\n=== Later revisions ===\nA recommendation may be updated or extended by separately-published, non-technical errata or editor drafts until sufficient substantial edits accumulate for producing a new edition or level of the recommendation. Additionally, the W3C publishes various kinds of informative notes which are to be used as references.<ref name=\"W3CDevProc\" />\n\n=== Certification ===\nUnlike the [[Internet Society|ISOC]] and other international standards bodies, the W3C does not have a certification program. The W3C has decided, for now, that it is not suitable to start such a program, owing to the risk of creating more drawbacks for the community than benefits.<ref name=\"W3CDevProc\" />\n\n==Administration==\nThe Consortium is jointly administered by the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] (CSAIL, located in [[Stata Center]]) in the USA, the [[European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics]] (ERCIM) (in [[Sophia Antipolis]], France), [[Keio University]] (in Japan) and [[Beihang University]] (in China).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Consortium/contact-mit |title=W3C Contact |publisher=W3.org |date=2006-10-31 |accessdate=2012-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Facts About W3C|url=http://www.w3.org/Consortium/facts#org|publisher=W3C|accessdate=7 November 2015}}</ref> The W3C also has World Offices in sixteen regions around the world.
