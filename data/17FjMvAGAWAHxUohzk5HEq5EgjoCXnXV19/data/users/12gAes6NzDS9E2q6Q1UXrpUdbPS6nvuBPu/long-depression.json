Consequently, some limit the term Long Depression to the worldwide price recession beginning in 1873 and running through the spring of 1879. Six years is not exactly a \"long\" depression, that in our analysis is 26 years – the typical maximum period which Japan entered following 1989.95.

In [[Europe]], the end of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] yielded a new political order in [[German Empire|Germany]], and the £200 million reparations imposed on [[French Third Republic|France]] led to an inflationary investment boom in Germany and [[Central Europe]].<ref name=\"cycles-4\"/> New technologies in industry such as the [[Bessemer converter]] were being rapidly applied; railroads were booming.<ref name=\"cycles-4\"/> In the United States, the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and a brief post-war recession (1865–1867) gave way to an investment boom, focused especially on railroads on public lands in the [[Western United States]] - an expansion funded greatly by foreign investors.<ref name=\"cycles-4\"/>\n\n==Causes of the crisis==\n{{main article|Panic of 1873}}\n\n[[File:Panic of 1873 bank run.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Bank run|Run]] on the Fourth National Bank, No. 20 Nassau Street, New York City, 1873. From ''Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper'', October&nbsp;4, 1873.]]\n\nIn 1873, during a decline in the value of silver—exacerbated by the end of the German Empire's production of the [[thaler]] coins from which the dollar got its name—the US government passed the [[Coinage Act of 1873]] in April of that year. This essentially ended the [[bimetallic standard]] of the United States, forcing it for the first time onto a pure [[gold standard]]. This measure, referred to by its opponents as \"the Crime of 1873\" and the topic of [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s [[Cross of Gold speech]] in 1896, forced a contraction of the [[money supply]] in the United States. It also drove down silver prices further, even as new silver mines were being established in [[Nevada]], which stimulated mining investment but increased supply as demand was falling.<ref>*{{cite book |last=Loomis |first=Noel M.\n |year=1968 |title=Wells Fargo }}\n pp. 219–220, 224–225.</ref> Silver miners arrived at US mints, unaware of the ban on production of silver coins, only to find their product no longer welcome. By September, the US economy was in a crisis, deflation causing banking panics and destabilizing business investment, climaxing in the [[Panic of 1873]].\n\nThe Panic of 1873 has been described as \"the first truly international crisis\".<ref name=\"cycles-4\"/> The optimism that had been driving booming stock prices in [[central Europe]] had reached a fever pitch, and fears of a bubble culminated in a panic in [[Vienna]] beginning in April 1873. The collapse of the [[Wiener Börse|Vienna Stock Exchange]] began on May 8, 1873, and continued until May 10, when the exchange was closed; when it was reopened three days later, the panic seemed to have faded, and appeared confined to [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref name=\"cycles-4\"/> Financial panic arrived in the [[Americas]] only months later on [[Black Thursday]], September 18, 1873 after the failure of the banking house of [[Jay Cooke]] and Company over the [[Northern Pacific Railway]].<ref name=\"titan-1\"/> The Northern Pacific railway had been given {{convert|40|e6acre|km2}} of public land in the [[Western United States]] and Cooke sought $100,000,000 in capital for the company; the bank failed when the bond issue proved unsalable, and was shortly followed by several other major banks. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] closed for ten days on September 20.<ref name=\"cycles-4\"/>\n\nThe [[financial contagion]] then returned to Europe, provoking a second panic in Vienna and further failures in [[continental Europe]] before receding. [[France]], which had been experiencing deflation in the years preceding the crash, was spared financial calamity for the moment, as was [[United Kingdom|Britain]].<ref name=\"cycles-4\"/>\n\nSome have argued the depression was rooted in the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]] that hurt the French economy and, under the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]], forced that country to make large [[war reparations]] payments to Germany.  The primary cause of the price depression in the [[United States]] was the tight monetary policy that the United States followed to get back to the [[gold standard]] after the [[US Civil War|Civil War]]. The U.S. government was taking money out of circulation to achieve this goal, therefore there was less available money to facilitate trade.  Because of this monetary policy the [[price of silver]] started to fall causing considerable losses of asset values; by most accounts, after 1879 production was growing, thus further putting downward pressure on prices due to increased industrial productivity, trade and competition.\n\nIn the US the speculative nature of financing due to both the [[Demand Note|greenback]], which was paper currency issued to pay for the Civil War and rampant fraud in the building of the [[Union Pacific Railway]] up to 1869 culminated in the [[Crédit Mobilier of America scandal|Credit Mobilier panic]]. Railway overbuilding and weak markets collapsed the bubble in 1873. Both the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific lines were central to the collapse; another railway bubble was the [[railway mania]] in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].\n\nBecause of the Panic of 1873, governments [[fixed exchange rate|depegged]] their currencies, to save money. The demonetization of silver by European and North American governments in the early 1870s was certainly a contributing factor.  The US [[Coinage Act of 1873]] was met with great opposition by farmers and miners, as silver was seen as more of a monetary benefit to rural areas than to banks in big cities.  In addition, there were US citizens who advocated the continuance of government-issued [[fiat money]] ([[United States Note]]s) to avoid deflation and promote exports. The western US states were outraged—[[Nevada]], [[Colorado]], and [[Idaho]] were huge silver producers with productive mines, and for a few years mining abated.  Resumption of silver dollar coinage was authorized by the [[Bland-Allison Act]] of 1878.  The resumption of the US government buying silver was enacted in 1890 with the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]].\n\n[[Monetarist]]s believe that the 1873 depression was caused by shortages of gold that undermined the gold standard, and that the 1848 [[California Gold Rush]], 1886 [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] in South Africa and the 1896–99 [[Klondike Gold Rush]] helped alleviate such crises.  Other analyses have pointed to developmental surges (see [[Kondratiev wave]]), theorizing that the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] was causing large shifts in the economies of many states, imposing transition costs, which may also have played a role in causing the depression.\n\n==Course of the depression==\n\nLike the later [[Great Depression]], the Long Depression affected different countries at different times, at different rates, and some countries accomplished rapid growth over certain periods. Globally, however, the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s were a period of falling price levels and rates of economic growth significantly below the periods preceding and following.\n\nBetween 1870 and 1890, iron production in the five largest producing countries more than doubled, from 11 million tons to 23 million tons, steel production increased twentyfold (half a million tons to 11 million tons), and [[railroad]] development boomed.<ref name=\"hobsbawm-1\">{{cite book|title=The Age of Empire (1875–1914)|author=[[Eric Hobsbawm]]|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|year=1989|isbn=0-679-72175-4|page=35}}</ref> But at the same time, prices in several markets collapsed - the price of [[grain]] in 1894 was only a third what it had been in 1867,<ref name=\"hobsbawm-2\">{{cite book|title=The Age of Empire (1875-1914)|author=Eric Hobsbawm|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|year=1989|isbn=0-679-72175-4|page=36}}</ref> and the price of [[cotton]] fell by nearly 50 percent in just the five years from 1872 to 1877,<ref name=\"reconstruction-3\">{{cite book|title=Reconstruction: America's unfinished revolution, 1863–1877|author=Eric Foner|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2002|isbn=0-06-093716-5|pages=535}}</ref> imposing great hardship on farmers and planters.

About the whole 1870–90 period Wells said:\n\n<blockquote>Some of these changes have been destructive, and all of them have inevitably occasioned, and for a long time yet will continue to occasion, great disturbances in old methods, and entail losses of capital and changes in occupation on the part of individuals.  And yet the world wonders, and commissions of great states inquire, without coming to definite conclusions, why trade and industry in recent years has been universally and abnormally disturbed and depressed.</blockquote>\n\nWells notes that many of the government inquires on the \"depression of prices\" (deflation) found various reasons such as the scarcity of gold and silver. Wells showed that the US money supply actually grew over the period of the deflation. Wells noted that deflation lowered the cost of only goods that benefited from improved methods of manufacturing and transportation. Goods produced by craftsmen and many services did not decrease in value, and the cost of labor actually increased.  Also, deflation did not occur in countries that did not have modern manufacturing, transportation, and communications.\n\nNobel laureate economist [[Milton Friedman]], author of ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', on the other hand, blamed this prolonged economic crisis on the imposition of a new gold standard, part of which he referred to by its traditional name, [[Coinage Act of 1873|The Crime of 1873]].<ref>The Crime of 1873, bit Milton Friedman http://www.unc.edu/~salemi/Econ006/Friedman_Crime_1873.pdf</ref> This forced shift into a currency whose supply was limited by nature, unable to expand with demand, caused a series of economic and monetary contractions that plagued the entire period of the Long Depression. [[Murray Rothbard]], in his book ''History of Money and Banking of the United States'', argues that the long depression was only a misunderstood recession since real wages and production were actually increasing throughout the period. Like Friedman, he attributes falling prices to the resumption of a deflationary gold standard in the U.S. after the Civil War.\n\n==Interpretations==\n\nMost economic historians see this period as negative for the most industrial nations.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Many argue that most of the stagnation was caused by a monetary contraction caused by abandonment of the [[bimetallic standard]], for a new fiat [[gold standard]], starting with the [[Coinage Act of 1873]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nOther economic historians have complained about the characterization of this period as a \"depression\" because of conflicting economic statistics that cast doubt on the interpretation of this period as a depression. They note that this period saw a relatively large expansion of industry, of railroads, of physical output, of net national product and real per-capita income.\n\nAs economists [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna J. Schwartz]] have noted, the decade from 1869 to 1879 saw a growth of 3 percent per year in money national product, an outstanding real national product growth of 6.8 percent per year in this period and a rise of 4.5 percent per year in real product per capita. Even the alleged \"monetary contraction\" never took place, the money supply increasing by 2.7 percent per year in this period. From 1873 through 1878, before another spurt of monetary expansion, the total supply of bank money rose from $1.964 billion to $2.221 billion, a rise of 13.1 percent or 2.6 percent per year. In short, a modest but definite rise, and scarcely a contraction.<ref name=\"Friedman_Schwartz\">Friedman, Schwartz. A Monetary History of the United States: 1867–1960.</ref> Although per-capita nominal income declined very gradually from 1873 to 1879, that decline was more than offset by a gradual increase over the course of the next 17 years.\n\nFurthermore, real per-capita income either stayed approximately constant (1873–1880; 1883–1885) or rose (1881–1882; 1886–1896) so the average consumer appears to have been considerably better off at the end of the \"depression\" than before. Studies of other countries where prices also tumbled, including the US, Germany, France, and Italy, reported more markedly positive trends in both nominal and real per-capita income figures. Profits generally were also not adversely affected by deflation although they declined (particularly in Britain) in industries that were struggling against superior, foreign competition.  Furthermore, some economists argue that a falling general price level is not inherently harmful to an economy and cite the economic growth of the period as evidence.<ref name=\"Rothbard_1873\">Murray N. Rothbard. [https://mises.org/books/historyofmoney.pdf \"A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II\"] (pdf), The War of 1812 and its Aftermath, p.145, 153-156.</ref> As economist [[Murray Rothbard]] has stated:\n\n<blockquote>Unfortunately, most historians and economists are conditioned to believe that steadily and sharply falling prices must result in depression: hence their amazement at the obvious prosperity and economic growth during this era. For they have overlooked the fact that in the natural course of events, when government and the banking system do not increase the money supply very rapidly, freemarket capitalism will result in an increase of production and economic growth so great as to swamp the increase of money supply. Prices will fall, and the consequences will be not depression or stagnation, but prosperity (since costs are falling, too), economic growth, and the spread of the increased living standard to all the consumers.<ref name=\"Rothbard_1873\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccompanying the overall growth in real prosperity was a marked shift in consumption from necessities to luxuries: by 1885, \"more houses were being built, twice as much tea was being consumed, and even the working classes were eating imported meat, oranges, and dairy produce in quantities unprecedented\". The change in working class incomes and tastes was symbolized by \"the spectacular development of the department store and the chain store\".\n\n<blockquote>Prices certainly fell, but almost every other index of economic activity - output of coal and pig iron, tonnage of ships built, consumption of raw wool and cotton, import and export figures, shipping entries and clearances, railway freight clearances, joint-stock company formations, trading profits, consumption per head of wheat, meat, tea, beer, and tobacco - all of these showed an upward trend.<ref name=\"Musson\">A.E.

Real unit production costs for most final goods dropped steadily throughout the 19th century and especially from 1873 to 1896. At no previous time had there been an equivalent \"harvest of technological advances... so general in their application and so radical in their implications\". That is why, notwithstanding the dire predictions of many eminent economists, Britain did not end up paralyzed by strikes and lockouts. Falling prices did not mean falling money wages. Instead of inspiring large numbers of workers to go on strike, falling prices were inspiring them to go shopping.<ref name=\"Selgin_Zero\">George Selgin.
