The kernel and several user-space libraries are common open-source projects: Linux, [[libusb]], [[BlueZ]], etc. Some other parts of the HAL are shared with the Android project: GPS, camera, among others. Gonk is basically an extremely simple Linux distribution and is therefore from Gecko's perspective, simply a porting target of Gecko; there is a port of Gecko to Gonk, just like there is a port of Gecko to OS X, and a port of Gecko to Android. However, since the development team have full control over Gonk, the developers can fully expose all the features and interfaces required for comprehensive mobile platforms such as Gecko, but which aren't currently possible to access on other mobile OSes. For example, using Gonk, Gecko can obtain direct access to the full [[baseband processor|telephony stack]] and display [[framebuffer]], but doesn't have this access on any other OS.<ref name=\"MW B2G arch\"/>\n\n===Gecko===\n{{Main article|Gecko (software)| l1=Gecko}}\n[[Gecko (software)|Gecko]] is the [[web browser engine]] of Firefox OS. Gecko implements [[open standard]]s for [[HTML]], [[CSS]], and [[JavaScript]]. Gecko includes a networking stack, graphics stack, layout engine, virtual machine (for JavaScript), and porting layers.<ref name=\"MW B2G arch\"/>\n\n===Gaia===\nGaia is the user interface of Firefox OS and controls everything drawn to screen. Gaia includes by default implementations of a lock screen, home screen, telephone dialer and contacts application, text-messaging application, camera application and a gallery support, plus the classic phone apps: mail, calendar, calculator and marketplace. Gaia is written entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It interfaces with the operating system through Open Web APIs, which are implemented by Gecko. Because it uses only standard web APIs, it can work on other OSes and other web-browsers.<ref name=\"MW B2G arch\"/>\n\n==Release history==\n{{Update section|date=May 2017}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Firefox OS used the Gecko engine on top of Linux kernel to render the screen output. Apps were written using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript -- all three being cooperative languages used in making internet webpages. In essence Apps on Firefox OS were webapps and the OS could be thought of as a Web browser that stored content off-line. On the other hand, Android, in a design manner similar to [[Microsoft Windows]], has a dedicated path for every operation and functionality -- and so, for example, its apps are coded in Java, using Android Studio. So Android provides a broader set of controls and development options, as compared to what can be achieved using HTML5, CSS and JS.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Android also enjoys greater maturity and support. Firefox OS, however, featured all the essentials required to use a smartphone.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fox Chase ¬ª Linux Magazine|url = http://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2014/159/Firefox-OS-vs.-Android|website = Linux Magazine|accessdate = 2016-01-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Firefox OS Shows Continued Global Growth|url = https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/10/09/firefox-os-shows-continued-global-growth/|website = The Mozilla Blog|accessdate = 2016-01-10}}</ref> Firefox launched its first official device in Germany in 2014, which was an Alcatel One Touch Fire.
