The translation was largely the work of [[Jerome]], who in 382 had been commissioned by [[Pope Damasus I]] to revise the {{lang|la|[[Vetus Latina]]}} (\"Old Latin\") [[Gospels]] then in use by the Roman Church. Jerome, on his own initiative, extended this work of revision and translation to include most of the [[books of the Bible]], and once published, the new version was widely adopted and eventually eclipsed the {{lang|la|Vetus Latina}}; so that by the 13th century, it had taken over from the former version the appellation of {{lang|la|versio vulgata}}&thinsp;<ref name=\"LewisShort\">[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=vulgo2 On the etymology of the noun (originally an adjective) ''vulgata'']</ref> (the \"version commonly used\") or {{lang|la|vulgata}} for short, and in [[Greek language|Greek]] as {{lang|grc|βουλγάτα}} (\"Voulgata\").\n\nThe Catholic Church affirmed the Vulgate as its official Latin Bible at the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63), though there was no authoritative edition at that time.<ref name = Metzger348>Bruce M.

Several unrevised books of the Vetus Latina Old Testament also commonly became included in the Vulgate; these are 1 and 2 Maccabees, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah; while 3 Esdras in Vulgate manuscripts witnesses a wholly different (and possibly earlier) translation of the Greek than that found in Vetus Latina manuscripts.  Medieval Vulgate bibles might further include the Prayer of Manasses, 4 Esdras, the Epistle to the Laodiceans and Psalm 151. Jerome himself translated all books of the Jewish Bible from the Hebrew (having separately translated the book of Psalms from the Greek Hexapla Septuagint); and further translated the books of Tobias and Judith from Aramaic, the additions to the book of Esther from the Common Septuagint and the additions to the book of Daniel from the Greek of Theodotion.\n\nThe Vulgate's components include:\n* ''Independent translation from the [[Tanakh|Hebrew]]'' by Jerome: the books of the Hebrew Bible, including a [[Latin Psalters#Versio juxta Hebraicum|translation of the Psalms from the Hebrew]] which is found in early medieval Vulgate manuscripts but is commonly supplanted by Jerome's [[Latin Psalters#Versio Gallicana|Gallican version]] in later bibles.

The Song of the Three Children was retained within the narrative of Daniel, Susanna was moved by Jerome from before the beginning of Daniel to the end of the book along with Bel and the Dragon. These additions he marked with an [[obelus]] to distinguish them from the canonical text.\n* ''Translation from the [[Septuagint|Common Septuagint]]'' by Jerome: the [[Book of Esther#Additions to Esther|Rest of Esther]].

He had been commissioned by [[Damasus I]] in 382 to revise the Old Latin text of the [[four Gospels]] from the best Greek texts. By the time of Damasus' death in 384, Jerome had completed this task, together with a more cursory revision from the Greek Common Septuagint of the Old Latin text of the Psalms in the Roman [[Psalter]], a version which he later disowned and is now believed to be lost.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Goins|first=Scott|contribution=Jerome's Psalters|editor-last = Brown|editor-first = William P.|title=Oxford Handbook to the Psalms|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|page=188}}</ref> How much of the rest of the [[New Testament]] he then revised is difficult to judge today,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Scherbenske|first=Eric W.|title=Canonizing Paul: Ancient Editorial Practice and the Corpus Paulinum|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|page=182}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Houghton|first=H.

The revised text of the New Testament outside the Gospels is the work of one or more other scholars; [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus of Aquileia]] has been suggested, as have Rufinus the Syrian (an associate of [[Pelagius]]) and Pelagius himself, though without specific evidence for any of them.<ref name=\"Scherbenske 2013 183\">{{Cite book|last=Scherbenske|first=Eric W.|title=Canonizing Paul: Ancient Editorial Practice and the Corpus Paulinum|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|page=183}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Houghton|first=H.

There he was able to use a surviving manuscript of the [[Hexapla]], likely from the nearby [[Theological Library of Caesarea Maritima]], a columnar comparison of the variant versions of the Old Testament undertaken 150 years before by [[Origen]]. Jerome then embarked on a second revision of the Psalms, translated from the revised Septuagint Greek column of the Hexapla, which later came to be called the Gallican version. There are no indications that either these revisions from the Hexapla or Jerome's later revised versions of the Old Testament from the Hebrew were ever officially commissioned.\n\nHe also appears to have undertaken further new translations into Latin from the Hexaplar Septuagint column for other books, of which only that for Job survives. From 390 to 405, Jerome translated anew from the Hebrew all the books in the Hebrew Bible, including a further version of the Psalms. This new translation of the Psalms was labelled by him as \"{{lang|la|iuxta Hebraeos}}\" (i.e. \"close to the Hebrews\", \"immediately following the Hebrews\") and was the version most commonly found in Vulgate bibles until it was supplanted by his Gallican psalms beginning in the 9th century. Jerome lived 15 years after the completion of his Old Testament text, during which he undertook extensive commentaries on the Prophetic Books. In these commentaries he generally took his own translation from the Hebrew as his subject text, sometimes proposing further improvements, suggestions which would often later be incorporated as interpolations to the Vulgate text of these books.\n\nIn Jerome's Vulgate, the Hebrew Book of [[Ezra-Nehemiah]] is translated as the single book of 'Ezra'.  Jerome defends this in his Prologue to Ezra, although he had formerly noted in his Prologue to the Book of Kings that some Greeks and Latins had proposed that this book should be split in two.  Jerome argues that the two books of Ezra found in the Septuagint and Vetus Latina, [[1 Esdras|Esdras A]] and [[Ezra-Nehemiah|Esdras B]], represented 'variant examples' of a single Hebrew original.  Hence he does not separately translate [[1 Esdras|Esdras A]]; even though it had been up til then universally found in Greek and Old Latin Old Testaments, preceding Esdras B, the combined text of Ezra-Nehemiah.<ref>{{Cite journal|volume=1o5|pages=5-26|last=Bogaert|first=Pierre-Maurice|title=Les livres d’Esdras et leur numérotation dans l’histoire du canon de la Bible latin|journal=Revue Benedictine|date=2000}}</ref>  Following the same principle, Jerome's Vulgate translation presents [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]], [[Books of Kings|Kings]] and [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] each as a single book; where the in the [[Septuagint]] Greek and [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] texts, all these had been split as 'double' books.\n\nThe Vulgate is usually credited as being the first translation of the Old Testament into Latin directly from the Hebrew [[Tanakh]] rather than from the Greek [[Septuagint]]. Jerome's extensive use of exegetical material written in Greek, as well as his use of the [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquiline]] and [[Theodotion]]tic columns of the Hexapla, along with the somewhat [[paraphrase|paraphrastic style]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Worth Jr|first1=Roland H.|title=Bible Translations: A History Through Source Documents|pages=29–30}}</ref> in which he translated, makes it difficult to determine exactly how direct the conversion of Hebrew to Latin was.<ref>Some, following P. Nautin (1986) and perhaps E. Burstein (1971), suggest that Jerome may have been almost wholly dependent on Greek material for his interpretation of the Hebrew. A. Kamesar (1993), on the other hand, sees evidence that in some cases Jerome's knowledge of Hebrew exceeds that of his exegetes, implying a direct understanding of the Hebrew text.</ref><ref>Pierre Nautin, article \"Hieronymus\", in: ''Theologische Realenzyklopädie'', Vol. 15, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin – New York 1986, p. 304-315, here p. 309-310.</ref><ref>Adam Kamesar.

Burstein, ''La compétence en hébreu de saint Jérôme'' (Diss.), Poitiers 1971.</ref> [[Saint Augustine]], a contemporary of Saint Jerome, states in Book XVII ch. 43 of his ''City of God'' that \"in our own day the priest Jerome, a great scholar and master of all three tongues, has made a translation into Latin, not from Greek but directly from the original Hebrew.\"<ref>''City of God'' edited and abridged by Vernon J. Bourke 1958</ref> Nevertheless, Augustine still maintained that the Septuagint alongside the Hebrew witnessed the inspired text of Scripture and consequently pressed Jerome for complete copies of his Hexaplar Latin translation of the Old Testament, a request that Jerome ducked with the excuse that the originals had been lost \"through someone's dishonesty\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102172.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: Letter 172 (Augustine) or 134 (Jerome)|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs Jerome completed his translations of each book of the Bible, he recorded his observations and comments in an extensive correspondence with other scholars. These letters were collected and appended as prologues to the Vulgate text for those books where they survived. In these letters, Jerome described those books or portions of books in the Septuagint that were not found in the Hebrew as being non-[[Biblical canon|canonical]]; he called them [[Biblical apocrypha|''apocrypha'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/prologi.shtml|title=The Bible|website=www.thelatinlibrary.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref> Jerome's views did not prevail and all complete manuscripts and editions of the Vulgate include some or all of these books.\n\nOf the Old Testament texts not found in the Hebrew, Jerome translated [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] and [[Book of Judith|Judith]] anew from the Aramaic, and from the Greek the additions to [[Book of Esther|Esther]] from the Septuagint and the additions to [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] from [[Theodotion]], distinguishing the additional material with an [[obelus]]. He refused to translate the additions to [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] and these texts, [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]] and the [[Letter of Jeremiah]], remained excluded from the Vulgate for 400 years.  Other books ([[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom]], [[Book of Sirach|Ecclesiasticus]], [[Books of the Maccabees|1 and 2 Maccabees]] and the [[Prayer of Manasses]]<ref name=\"Stuttgart\"/>) are variously found in Vulgate manuscripts with texts derived from the Old Latin sometimes together with Latin versions of other texts found neither in the Hebrew Bible nor in the Septuagint ([[2 Esdras|4 Esdras]] and [[Laodiceans]].) Their style is still markedly distinguishable from Jerome's.\n\nIn the 9th century the Old Latin texts of Baruch and the [[Letter of Jeremiah]] were introduced<ref name=\"Stuttgart4B\">{{Cite book|edition=4|publisher=Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft|isbn=978-3-438-05303-9|others=Robert Weber, Roger Gryson (eds.)|title=Biblia Sacra iuxta vulgatam versionem|location=Stuttgart|pages=XXXIV|year=1994}}</ref> into the Vulgate in versions revised by [[Theodulf of Orleans]] and are found in a minority of early medieval Vulgate pandect bibles from that date onwards.<ref>{{Cite journal|volume=115|pages=286–342|last=Bogaert|first=Pierre-Maurice|title=Le livre de Baruch dans les manuscrits de la Bible latine. Disparition et réintégration|journal=Revue Benedictine|date=2005}}</ref> After 1300, when the booksellers of Paris began to produce commercial single volume Vulgate bibles in large numbers, these commonly included both Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah as the ''Book of Baruch''.  Also beginning in the 9th century, Vulgate manuscripts are found that split [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] and the [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] into separate books called 1 Ezra and 2 Ezra.  Bogaert argues that this practice arose from an intention to conform the Vulgate text to the authoritative canon lists of the 5th/6th century, where 'two books of Ezra' were commonly cited. <ref>{{Cite journal|volume=110|pages=5-26|last=Bogaert|first=Pierre-Maurice|title=Les livres d’Esdras et leur numérotation dans l’histoire du canon de la Bible latin|journal=Revue Benedictine|date=2000}}</ref>  Again this split becomes standard in the Paris Bibles; and as these bibles commonly also included one or both of the two books of [[Esdras]]: Greek Esdras and Latin Esdras; these became retitled as 3 Ezra and 4 Ezra respectively.\n\n=== Critical value ===\nIn translating the 38 books of the Hebrew Bible (Ezra-Nehemiah being counted as one book), Jerome was relatively free in rendering their text into Latin, but it is possible to determine that the oldest surviving complete manuscripts of the [[Masoretic Text]], which date from nearly 600 years after Jerome, nevertheless transmit a consonantal Hebrew text very close to that used by Jerome.<ref name = Kenyon81>{{cite book|title=Our Bible and the Ancient Manuscripts|first=Frederic G.|last=Kenyon|authorlink=Frederic George Kenyon|place=London|publisher=|year=1939|edition=4th|isbn=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MN41613ucmf_0#page/n117/mode/2up|accessdate=2011-01-06|page=81}}</ref> Jerome translated the books of Judith and Tobit, engaging a Jewish intermediary to render the Aramaic into oral Hebrew for him then to paraphrase into Latin. The Vulgate Old Testament texts that were translated from the Greek, whether by Jerome or preserving revised or unrevised Old Latin versions, are early and important secondary witnesses to the Septuagint.\n\nGiven Jerome's conservative methods and that manuscript evidence from outside Egypt at this early date is very rare, these Vulgate readings have considerable critical interest. Also valuable from a text-critical perspective is the revised Vulgate text of the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse]], a book where there is no clear [[majority text]] in the surviving Greek witnesses, as both the Old Latin base text and its revisions show signs of using early Greek texts.\n\n=== Prologues ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Deuterocanonical books]] -->\nIn addition to the [[Bible|biblical text]] Vulgate editions almost invariably print 17 prologues, 16 of which were written by [[Jerome]]. Jerome's prologues were written not so much as prologues than as cover letters to specific individuals to accompany copies of his translations. Because they were not intended for a general audience, some of his comments in them are quite cryptic. These prologues are to the Pentateuch,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=214|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Genesis – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref> to Joshua,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=217|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Joshua – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref> and to Kings, which is also called the ''Prologus Galeatus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=218|title=Jerome’s \"Helmeted Introduction\" to Kings – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing these are prologues to Chronicles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=220|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Chronicles – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref> Ezra,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=222|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Ezra – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref> Tobias,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=223|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Tobias – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref> Judith,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=224|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Judith – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\nEsther,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=225|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Esther – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\nJob,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=228|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Job – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\nthe Gallican Psalms,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=229|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Psalms (LXX) – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\nSong of Songs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=231|title=Jerome’s Prologue to the Books of Solomon – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\nIsaiah,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=232|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Isaiah – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\nJeremiah,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=233|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Jeremiah – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\nEzekiel,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=234|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Ezekiel – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\nDaniel,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=235|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Daniel – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\nthe minor prophets,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=236|title=Jerome’s Prologue to the Twelve Prophets – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\nthe gospels,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=237|title=Jerome’s Prologue to the Gospels – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref> and the final prologue which is to the Pauline epistles and is better known as {{lang|la|Primum quaeritur}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=238|title=Vulgate Prologue to Paul’s Letters – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref> Related to these are Jerome's ''Notes on the Rest of Esther''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=226|title=Jerome’s Notes to the Additions to Esther – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref> and his ''Prologue to the Hebrew Psalms''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=230|title=Jerome’s Prologue to Psalms (Hebrew) – biblicalia|website=www.bombaxo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>  In addition to Jerome's prologue to the Gallican version of the Psalms, which is commonly found in Vulgate manuscripts, his prologues also survive for the translations from the Hexaplar Septuagint of the books of Job, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs and Chronicles.\n\nA recurring theme of the [[Old Testament]] prologues is Jerome's preference for the {{lang|la|[[Tanakh|Hebraica veritas]]}} (i.e., Hebrew truth) over the [[Septuagint|'version of the Seventy Interpreters']], a preference which he defended from his detractors. He stated that the Hebrew text more clearly prefigures [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] than the Greek. Among the most remarkable of these prologues is the {{lang|la|Prologus Galeatus}}, in which Jerome described an [[Old Testament]] canon of 22 books, which he found represented in the 22-letter [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]] alphabet. Alternatively, he numbered the books as 24, which he described as the 24 elders in the [[Book of Revelation]] casting their crowns before the [[Lamb of God|Lamb]]. These are the two Jewish numberings of the Jewish canon. The 12 minor prophets are counted as one book, 1 and 2 Samuel as one book, 1 and 2 Kings as one book, Ezra and Nehemiah as one book, and 1 and 2 Chronicles as one book, making a total of 24 books. Alternatively, Ruth is counted as part of Judges, and Lamentations as part of Jeremiah, for a total of 22 books.\n\nIn addition, many medieval Vulgate manuscripts included [[Jerome's epistle to Paulinus|Jerome's epistle number 53, to Paulinus bishop of Nola]], as a general prologue to the whole Bible. Notably, this letter was printed at the head of the [[Gutenberg Bible]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LIII.html|title=NPNF2-06. Jerome: The Principal Works of St. Jerome - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>  Jerome's letter promotes study of each of the books of the Old and New Testaments listed by name ( and excluding any mention of the deuterocanonical books); and its dissemination had the effect of propagating the belief that the whole Vulgate text was Jerome's work.  \n\nThe regular prologue to the Pauline Epistles in the Vulgate {{lang|la|Primum quaeritur}} defends the Pauline authorship of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], directly contrary to Jerome's own views – a key argument in demonstrating that Jerome did not write it.  The author of the {{lang|la|Primum quaeritur}} is unknown; but it is first quoted by [[Pelagius]] in his commentary on the Pauline letters written before 410; and as this work also quotes from the Vulgate revision of these letters, it has been proposed that Pelagius or one of his associates may have been responsible for the revision of the Vulgate New Testament outside the Gospels. At any rate, it is reasonable to identify the  author of the preface with the unknown reviser of the New Testament outside the gospels.<ref name=\"Scherbenske 2013 183\"/>\n\nIn addition to {{lang|la|Primum quaeritur}}, many manuscripts contain brief notes to each of the epistles indicating where they were written, with notes about where the recipients dwelt. [[Adolf von Harnack]],<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/origin_nt.v.i.html ''Origin of the New Testament''], Adolf von Harnack, 1914</ref> citing De Bruyne, argued that these notes were written by [[Marcion of Sinope]] or one of his followers.<ref>Harnack noted: \"We have indeed long known that [[Marcionite]] readings found their way into the ecclesiastical text of the Pauline epistles, but now for seven years we have known that Churches actually accepted the Marcionite prefaces to the Pauline epistles! De Bruyne has made one of the finest discoveries of later days in proving that those prefaces, which we read first in [[Codex Fuldensis]] and then in numbers of later manuscripts, are Marcionite, and that the Churches had not noticed the cloven hoof.\" [http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/Harnack%20Origen%20of%20the%20New%20Testament.pdf ''Origin of the New Testament''], pp76sqq</ref>  Where Vulgate books lacked a genuine prologue from Jerome, the apparent lack was commonly supplied over time by pseudonymous compositions, many of which are frequently found in medieval Vulgate manuscripts.  Where Vulgate bibles included the Psalter in the Roman version  (rather than Jerome's Hebraic version) this inclusion was occasionally supported by pseudonymous letters between Jerome and Damasus; which subsequently were occasionally attached to Jerome's Gallican Psalter when that supplanted the Hebraic Psalter in the Vulgate in the 9th century. Many medieval manuscripts also include a pseudonymous prologue from Jerome for the [[Catholic Epistles]], composed to support the interpolated [[Comma Johanneum#Vulgate Prologue to the Canonical Epistles|Comma Johanneum]] at 1 John 5:7.\n\n== Relation with the Old Latin Bible ==\n{{Main article|Vetus Latina}}\n\nThe Latin biblical texts in use before Jerome's Vulgate are usually referred to collectively as the {{lang|la|[[Vetus Latina]]}}, or \"Old Latin Bible\"; where \"Old Latin\" means that they are older than the Vulgate and written in [[Latin Language|Latin]], not that they are written in [[Old Latin]]. Jerome himself uses the term \"Latin Vulgate\" for the ''[[Vetus Latina]]'' text, so intending to denote this version as the common Latin rendering of the [[Greek Vulgate]] or [[Septuagint|Common Septuagint]] (which Jerome otherwise terms the 'version of the Seventy'); and this remained the usual use of the term 'Latin Vulgate\" in the West for centuries. Jerome reserves the term 'Septuagint'(''Septuaginta'') to refer to the [[Hexapla|Hexaplar Septuagint]]. The earliest known use of the term ''Vulgata'' to describe the 'new' Latin translation was made by [[Roger Bacon]] in the 13th century.<ref name=\"ISBE\">[http://www.bible-researcher.com/vulgate1.html Article, ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia''], 1915</ref> The translations in the Vetus Latina had accumulated piecemeal over a century or more; they were not translated by a single person or institution, nor uniformly edited. The individual books varied in quality of translation and style, and different manuscripts and quotations witness wide variations in readings. Some books appear to have been translated several times; the book of [[Latin Psalters|Psalms]] in particular having circulated for over a century in an earlier Latin version (the Cyprianic Version), before this was superseded by the Old Latin version in the 4th century. Jerome, in his preface to the Vulgate gospels, commented that there were \"as many [translations] as there are manuscripts\". The base text for Jerome's revision of the gospels was an Old Latin text similar to the [[Codex Veronensis]]; with the text of the Gospel of John conforming more to that in the [[Codex Corbiensis]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Buron|first=Philip|title=The text of the New Testament in Contemporary Research; 2nd edn|publisher=Brill|year=2014|page=182}}</ref>\n\nDamasus had instructed Jerome to be conservative in his revision of the Old Latin Gospels, and it is possible to see Jerome's obedience to this injunction in the preservation in the Vulgate of variant Latin vocabulary for the same Greek terms. Hence, \"high priest\" is rendered {{lang|la|princeps sacerdotum}} in Vulgate Matthew; as {{lang|la|summus sacerdos}} in Vulgate Mark; and as {{lang|la|pontifex}} in Vulgate John. The [[Vetus Latina]] gospels had been translated from Greek originals of the [[Western text-type]]. Comparison of Jerome's Gospel texts with those in Old Latin witnesses, suggests that his revision was substantially concerned with redacting their expanded 'Western' phraseology in accordance with the Greek texts of better early [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine]] and [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]] witnesses.  One major change introduced by Jerome was to re-order the Latin Gospels. Old Latin gospel books generally followed the \"Western Order\" – Matthew, John, Luke, Mark; where Jerome adopted the \"Greek Order\" – Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.  It appears that he followed this order in his programme of work; as his revisions become progressively less frequent and less consistent in the gospels presumably done later.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Houghton|first=H. A. G.|title=The Latin New Testament; a Guide to its Early History, Texts and Manuscripts|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|page=34}}</ref>  In places Jerome adopted readings that did not correspond to a straightforward rendering either of the Old Latin or the Greek text, so reflecting a particular doctrinal interpretation; as in his rewording ''panem nostrum '''[[epiousios|supersubstantialem]]''''' at [[Matthew 6:11]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Houghton|first=H. A. G.|title=The Latin New Testament; a Guide to its Early History, Texts and Manuscripts|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|page=33}}</ref>\n\nThe unknown reviser of the rest of the New Testament shows marked differences from Jerome, both in editorial practice and in his sources.  Where Jerome sought to correct the Old Latin text with reference to the best recent Greek manuscripts, with a preference for those conforming to the [[Byzantine text-type]], the Greek text underlying the revision of the rest of the New Testament demonstrates the [[Alexandrian text-type]] found in the great [[Uncial script|majuscule]] [[Great uncial codices|pandects]] of the mid 4th century, most similar to the [[Codex Sinaiticus]].  The reviser's changes generally conform very closely to this Greek text, even in matters of word order; to the extent that the resulting text may be only barely intelligible as Latin.<ref name=\"Houghton 2016 41\"/>\n\nAfter the Gospels, the most widely used and copied part of the Christian Bible is the Book of [[Latin Psalters|Psalms]]; and consequently Damasus also commissioned Jerome to revise the psalter in use in Rome, to agree better with the Greek of the Common Septuagint. This, Jerome said, he had done cursorily when in Rome; but later disowned this version, maintaining that copyists had reintroduced erroneous readings.  Until the 20th century, it was commonly assumed that the surviving Roman Psalter represented Jerome's first attempted revision; but more recent scholarship - following de Bruyne - rejects this identification.  The Roman Psalter is indeed one of at least five revised versions of the mid-4th-century Old Latin Psalter; but, compared to the four others the revisions in the Roman Psalter are in clumsy Latin, and signally fail to follow Jerome's known translational principles, especially in respect of correcting harmonised readings.  Nevertheless it is clear from Jerome's correspondence (especially in his defence of the Gallican Pslater in the long and detailed Epistle 106)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Goins|first=Scott|contribution=Jerome's Psalters|editor-last = Brown|editor-first = William. P.|title=Oxford Handbook of the Psalms|publisher=OUP|year=2014|page=190}}</ref> that he was familiar with the Roman Psalter text; and consequently it is assumed that this revision represents the Roman text as Jerome had found it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norris|first=Oliver|contribution=Tracing Fortunatianus's Psalter|editor-last = Dorfbauer|editor-first = Lukas J.|title=Fortunatianus ridivivus|publisher=CSEL|year=2017|page=285}}</ref>   \n\nJerome's earliest efforts in translation, his revision of the four Gospels, was dedicated to Damasus; but following Damasus's death Jerome's versions had little or no official recognition. Jerome's translated texts had to make their way on their own merits. The Old Latin versions continued to be copied and used alongside the Vulgate versions. Commentators such as [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] (Pope from 590 to 604) recognised the superiority of the new version, and promoted it in their works; but the old tended to continue in liturgical use, especially in the [[Psalter]] and the biblical [[Canticle]]s. In the prologue to ''[[Moralia in Job]],'' Gregory the Great writes: \"I comment on the new translation. But when argumentation is necessary, I use the evidence sometimes of the new translation, sometimes of the old one, since the Apostolic See, over which by God's grace I preside, uses both\". This distinction of \"new translation\" and \"old translation\" is regularly found in commentators until the 8th century; but it remained uncertain for those books that had not been revised by Jerome (the New Testament outside the Gospels, and certain of the deuterocanonical books), which versions of the text belonged to the \"new\" translation and which to the \"old\". The earliest Bible manuscript where all books are included in the versions that would later be recognised as \"Vulgate\" is the 8th-century [[Codex Amiatinus]]; but as late as the 12th century, the Vulgate [[Codex Gigas]] retained an Old Latin text for the Apocalypse and the Acts of the Apostles.\n\nChanges to familiar phrases and expressions aroused hostility in congregations, especially in North Africa and Spain; while scholars often sought to conform Vulgate texts to [[Patristics|Patristic]] citations from the Old Latin; and consequently many Vulgate texts became contaminated with Old Latin readings, re-introduced by copyists.  Spanish biblical traditions, with many Old Latin borrowings, were influential in Ireland, while both Irish and Spanish influences are found in Vulgate texts in northern France.  By contrast, in Italy and southern France a much purer Vulgate text predominated; and this is the version of the Bible that became established in England following the mission of [[Augustine of Canterbury]].\n\n== Influence on Western culture ==\n[[File:CodxAmiatinusTextPage.jpg|thumb|A page from the ''[[Codex Amiatinus]]''.]]\nFor over a thousand years (c. AD 400–1530), the Vulgate was the definitive edition of the most influential text in Western European society. Indeed, for most Western Christians, it was the only version of the Bible ever encountered. The Vulgate's influence throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] into the [[Early Modern Period]] is even greater than that of the [[King James Version]] in English; for Christians during these times the phraseology and wording of the Vulgate permeated all areas of the culture.\n\nAside from its use in prayer, liturgy, and private study, the Vulgate served as inspiration for [[Poor Man's Bible|ecclesiastical art and architecture]], [[hymn]]s, countless paintings, and popular [[mystery plays]].\n\n=== The Reformation ===\nWhile the Genevan Reformed tradition sought to introduce vernacular versions translated from the original languages, it nevertheless retained and extended the use of the Vulgate in theological debate. In both the published Latin sermons of [[John Calvin]], and the Greek New Testament editions of [[Theodore Beza]], the accompanying Latin reference text is the Vulgate; and where Protestant churches took their lead from the Genevan example – as in England and Scotland – the result was a broadening appreciation of Jerome's translation in its dignified style and flowing prose. The closest equivalent in English, the [[King James Version]] or Authorized Version, shows a marked influence from the Vulgate, especially by comparison with the earlier vernacular version of [[Tyndale]], in respect of Jerome's demonstration of how a technically exact Latinate religious vocabulary may be combined with dignified prose and vigorous poetic rhythms.\n\nThe Vulgate continued to be regarded as the standard scholarly Bible throughout most of the 17th century. [[Brian Walton, Bishop of Chester|Walton's London Polyglot]] of 1657 disregards the English Language entirely.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Daniell|first1=David|title=The Bible in English: its history and influence|date=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-09930-4|page=510}}</ref> Walton's reference text throughout is the Vulgate. The Vulgate Latin is also found as the standard text of scripture in [[Thomas Hobbes]] ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' of 1651,<ref>{{Harv|Daniell|2003| p. 478}}</ref> indeed Hobbes gives Vulgate chapter and verse numbers (e.g., Job 41:24, not Job 41:33) for his head text.\n\nIn Chapter 35, \"The Signification in Scripture of Kingdom of God\", Hobbes discusses Exodus 19:5, first in his own translation of the \"Vulgar Latin\", and then subsequently as found in the versions he terms \"the English translation made in the beginning of the reign of King James\", and \"The Geneva French\" (i.e. [[Pierre Robert Olivétan|Olivetan]]). Hobbes advances detailed critical arguments why the Vulgate rendering is to be preferred. It remained the assumption of Protestant scholars that, while it had been of vital importance to provide the scriptures in the vernacular for ordinary people, nevertheless for those with sufficient education to do so, biblical study was best undertaken within the international common medium of the Latin Vulgate.\n\n=== The Council of Trent ===\nThe Vulgate was given an official capacity by the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) as the touchstone of the [[biblical canon]] concerning which parts of books are canonical.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1093/jts/os-XLIX.193-194.35|issn=0022-5185|volume=49|issue=193-194|pages=35–42|last=Sutcliffe|first=Edmund F.|title=The Council of Trent on the ''authentia'' of the Vulgate|journal=The Journal of Theological Studies|series=o.s.|year=1948|url=http://jts.oxfordjournals.org/content/os-XLIX/193-194/35.full.pdf+html}}</ref> When the council listed the books included in the canon, it qualified the books as being \"entire with all their parts, as they have been used to be read in the [[Catholic Church]], and as they are contained in the old Latin vulgate edition\". The fourth session of the Council specified 72 canonical books in the Bible: 45 in the [[Old Testament]], 27 in the [[New Testament]]; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] not being counted as separate from Jeremiah.<ref>[http://www.bible-researcher.com/trent1.html Fourth Session, April 8 1546].</ref>  On June 2, 1927, [[Pope Pius XI]] clarified this decree, allowing that the [[Comma Johanneum]] was open to dispute, and further clarification came with [[Pope Pius XII]]'s {{lang|la|[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www7.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1&lang=en&s=Pope%20Pius%20XII|title=Deuterocanonical Books|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=May 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe council cited [[Sacred Tradition]] in support of the Vulgate's [[Magisterium|magisterial authority]]:\n<blockquote>Moreover, this sacred and holy Synod,—considering that no small utility may accrue to the Church of God, if it be made known which out of all the Latin editions, now in circulation, of the sacred books, is to be held as authentic,—ordains and declares, that the said old and vulgate edition, which, by the lengthened usage of so many years, has been approved of in the Church, be, in public lectures, disputations, sermons and expositions, held as authentic; and that no one is to dare, or presume to reject it under any pretext whatever.<ref>[http://www.bible-researcher.com/trent1.html Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent, The Fourth Session], 1546</ref></blockquote>The qualifier \"Latin editions, now in circulation\" and the use of authentic (not inerrant) show the limits of this statement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/jimmy-akin/is-the-vulgate-the-catholic-churchs-official-bible|title=Is the Vulgate the Catholic Church’s Official Bible?|work=National Catholic Register|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Translations ===\nBefore the publication of [[Pius XII]]'s {{lang|la|[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]}}, the Vulgate was the source text used for many translations of the Bible into vernacular languages. In English, the interlinear translation of the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] as well as other [[Old English Bible translations]], the [[Wycliffe's Bible|translation]] of [[John Wycliffe]], the [[Douay–Rheims Bible]], the [[Confraternity Bible]], and [[Ronald Knox]]'s [[Knox's Translation of the Vulgate|translation]] were all made from the Vulgate.\n\n=== Influence upon the English language ===\nThe Vulgate had a large influence on the development of the English language, especially in matters of religion. Many Latin words were taken from the Vulgate into English nearly unchanged in meaning or spelling: ''[[wikt:creation|creatio]]'' (e.g. [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:1, Heb 9:11), ''[[wikt:salvation|salvatio]]'' (e.g. Is 37:32, Eph 2:5), ''[[wikt:justification|justificatio]]'' (e.g. Rom 4:25, Heb 9:1), ''[[wikt:testament|testamentum]]'' (e.g. Mt 26:28), ''[[wikt:sanctification|sanctificatio]]'' (1 Ptr 1:2, 1 Cor 1:30), ''[[wikt:regeneration|regeneratio]]'' (Mt 19:28), and ''[[wikt:rapture|raptura]]'' (from a noun form of the verb ''rapiemur'' in 1 Thes 4:17). The word \"[[publican]]\" comes from the Latin ''publicanus'' (e.g., Mt 10:3), and the phrase \"far be it\" is a translation of the Latin expression ''absit'' (e.g., Mt 16:22 in the [[King James Bible]]). Other examples include ''[[wikt:apostle|apostolus]]'', ''[[wikt:ecclesial|ecclesia]]'', ''[[wikt:evangelical|evangelium]]'', ''[[wikt:paschal|Pascha]]'', and ''[[wikt:angel|angelus]]''.\n\n== Texts ==\nThe Vulgate exists in many forms. The [[Codex Amiatinus]] is the oldest surviving complete manuscript from the 8th century. The [[Gutenberg Bible]] is a notable printed edition of the Vulgate by Johann Gutenberg in 1455. The 1598 edition of the [[Clementine Vulgate]] is an official standardized edition of the medieval Vulgate. The Stuttgart Vulgate is a 1969 critical edition of Jerome's original Vulgate. The Nova Vulgata is a new official translation, completed in 1979, from modern critical editions of original language texts of the Bible into Classical Latin.\n\n=== Manuscripts and early editions ===\n{{Vulgate manuscripts}}\n\nA number of early manuscripts containing or reflecting the Vulgate survive today. Dating from the 8th century, the [[Codex Amiatinus]] is the earliest surviving [[manuscript]] of the complete Vulgate Bible. The [[Codex Fuldensis]], dating from around 545, contains most of the New Testament in the Vulgate version, but the four [[gospel]]s are harmonized into a continuous narrative derived from the [[Diatessaron]].\n\nOver the course of the Middle Ages, the Vulgate had succumbed to the inevitable changes wrought by human error in the countless copies made of the text in monasteries across Europe. From its earliest days, readings from the Old Latin were introduced. Marginal notes were erroneously interpolated into the text.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n[[Alcuin]] of York oversaw efforts to make an improved Vulgate, which he presented to [[Charlemagne]] in 801. He concentrated mainly on correcting inconsistencies of grammar and orthography, many of which were in the original text. More scholarly attempts were made by [[Theodulphus]], [[Bishop of Orléans]] (787?–821); [[Lanfranc]], Archbishop of Canterbury (1070–1089); [[Stephen Harding]], Abbot of Cîteaux (1109–1134); and Deacon Nicolaus Maniacoria (mid-12th century). The [[University of Paris]], the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], and the [[Franciscans]] following [[Roger Bacon]] assembled lists of ''[[Correctories|correctoria]]''; approved readings where variants had been noted.<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=Society for the Study of Medieval Languages and Literature|isbn=9780907570226|last=Linde|first=Cornelia|title=How to correct the Sacra scriptura? Textual criticism of the Latin Bible between the twelfth and fifteenth century|location=Oxford|series=Medium Ævum Monographs 29|year=2011}}</ref> Many of the readings that were recommended were later found to be interpolations, or survivals of the Old Latin text, since medieval correctors commonly sought to adjust the Vulgate text into consistency with Bible quotations found in Early Church Fathers.\n\nThough the advent of printing greatly reduced the potential of human error and increased the consistency and uniformity of the text, the earliest editions of the Vulgate merely reproduced the manuscripts that were readily available to the publishers. Of the hundreds of early editions, the most notable today is [[Gutenberg Bible|Mazarin edition]] published by [[Johann Gutenberg]] and [[Johann Fust]] in 1455, famous for its beauty and antiquity. In 1504 the first Vulgate with variant readings was published in Paris. One of the texts of the [[Complutensian Polyglot]] was an edition of the Vulgate made from ancient manuscripts and corrected to agree with the Greek.\n\n[[Erasmus]] published an edition corrected to agree better with the Greek and Hebrew in 1516. Other corrected editions were published by [[Santes Pagnino|Xanthus Pagninus]] in 1518, [[Thomas Cardinal Cajetan|Cardinal Cajetan]], [[Agostino Steuco|Augustinus Steuchius]] in 1529, Abbot [[Isidoro Chiari|Isidorus Clarius]] ([[Venice]], 1542), and others. In 1528, [[Robert Estienne|Robertus Stephanus]] published the first of a series of critical editions, which formed the basis of the later Sistine and Clementine editions. The critical edition of [[John Hentenius]] of Louvain followed in 1547.<ref name=\"ISBE\"/>\n\nIn 1550, Stephanus fled to [[Geneva]] where in 1555 he issued his final critical edition of the Vulgate, which was the first complete Bible with full [[Bible verses|chapter and verse divisions]], and which became the standard biblical reference text for late-16th-century Reformed theology.\n\n=== Clementine Vulgate ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Deuterocanonical books]] 1. REDIRECT Vulgate#Clementine Vulgate\n-->\n\n[[File:Vulgata.jpg|thumb|The Vulgata Sixtina.]]\n[[File:Prologus Ioanni Vulgata Clementina.jpg|thumb|300px|The prologue of the [[gospel of John]], Clementine Vulgate, 1922 edition.]]\n\nThe [[Clementine Vulgate]] ({{lang|la|Biblia Sacra Vulgatæ Editionis Sixti Quinti Pontificis Maximi iussu recognita atque edita}}) is the edition most familiar to Catholics who have lived prior to the liturgical reforms following [[Vatican II]].\n\nAfter the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], when the Catholic Church [[Counter reformation|strove to counter the attacks]] and refute the doctrines of [[Protestantism]], the Vulgate was reaffirmed in the [[Council of Trent]] as the sole, authorized Latin text of the Bible.<ref>Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent, [http://www.bible-researcher.com/trent1.html Fourth Session, April 8 1546].</ref> Furthermore, the council expressed the wish that this should be 'printed in the most correct manner possible'; although this fell short of a full commission to create a standard text of the Vulgate out of the countless editions produced during the [[Renaissance]].  Nevertheless, pressure built up for the preparations of an authorized Vulgate text.\n\nA committee was formed by [[Pope Pius IV]] in 1561 to undertake the task, but it worked slowly and ineffectively. A second committee was appointed by [[Pope Pius V]] in 1569. [[Pope Sixtus V]] appointed a third committee, who took as their base text the Louvain Vulgate edition of 1583 (based on the edition of [[Hentenius]]), recording variant readings from authoritative manuscripts in the margin. A recommended text was presented in 1589. Sixtus was dissatisfied with the result, judging that it was too far from the familiar printed editions. He had substantial changes made to the text, using the Vulgate edition of [[Robertus Stephanus]] corrected to agree with the Greek; and introducing personal changes, including an entirely new system of verse divisions. This revised version was hurried into print; and suffered from misprints in the Old Testament. In addition, three whole verses were found to have been dropped from the [[Book of Numbers]]; Numbers 30:11-13, though it is unclear whether this was an error in printing or a 'wild' editorial choice.  The Bible appeared in 1590 and is known as [[Vulgata Sixtina|Sistine Vulgate]]. Sixtus immediately issued ''corrigenda'' as pasted slips to be inserted into copies. After the Pope's sudden death, [[Robert Bellarmine]] warned that the work was an embarrassment, and a great danger to the church.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bellarmino|first=Roberto Francesco Romolo|title=Spiritual Writings|year=1989|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=0-8091-0389-3-|pages=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GI9Uw6Fe_S4C&pg=PA15&dq=sixtus+v+vulgate&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iGpRUoG9C7fG4AO4zID4BA&ved=0CNYBEOgBMB0#v=onepage&q=sixtus%20v&f=false}}</ref> The [[College of Cardinals]] stopped all further sales, and bought and destroyed as many copies as possible.<ref name=\"Metzger348\"/>\n\nThe Sistine edition was replaced by [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]] (1592–1605) who had ordered [[Franciscus Toletus]], [[Augustinus Valerius]], [[Federico Borromeo|Fredericus Borromaeus]], [[Robert Bellarmine|Robertus Bellarmino]], [[Antonius Agellius]], and [[Petrus Morinus]] to make corrections and a revision.<ref name=\"Townley\">''Illustrations of Biblical Literature'', vol. II, Rev. [[James Townley (Methodist)|James Townley]], 1856</ref>  It is called today the [[Sixto-Clementine Vulgate]], or simply the Clementine, although it is Sixtus' name which appears on the title page. The replacement version reversed many of Sixtus's changes, adopting the verse divisions of the Stephanus editions but otherwise tending to prefer the Louvain text; but this too was rushed in preparation, omitting all Jerome's Prologues. The many misprints of the 1592 first edition were remedied in the second (1593) and a third (1598) editions; which also restored the Prologues.<ref name = Metzger349>Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Early Versions of the New Testament'', Clarendon Press, Oxford 1977, p. 349.</ref>\n\nThe Clementine differed from the manuscripts on which it was ultimately based in that it grouped the various prefaces of St. Jerome together at the beginning, and it removed [[1 Esdras|3]] and [[2 Esdras|4 Esdras]] and the [[Prayer of Manasses]] from the [[Old Testament]] and placed them as Apocrypha into an appendix following the New Testament. As this was intended as a standard text, rather than as a critical text for scholarship, it differed from previous Vulgate editions in not printing  marginal variant readings.The Psalter of the Clementine Vulgate, like that of almost all earlier printed editions, is the [[Latin Psalters#Versio Gallicana|Gallicanum]], omitting [[Psalm 151]]. It follows the Greek numbering of the Psalms, which differs from that in versions translated directly from the Hebrew.\n\nThe Clementine Vulgate of 1598 became the standard Bible text of the [[Roman Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] until 1979, when the Nova Vulgata was promulgated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20010507_liturgiam-authenticam_en.html|title=Liturgiam authenticam|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nRoger Gryson, in the preface to 4th edition of the Stuttgart Vulgate (1994), asserts that the Clementine edition \"frequently deviates from the manuscript tradition for literary or doctrinal reasons, and offers only a faint reflection of the original Vulgate, as read in the ''pandecta'' of the first millennium.\"<ref name=\"Stuttgart4\">{{Cite book|edition=4|publisher=Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft|isbn=978-3-438-05303-9|others=Robert Weber, Roger Gryson (eds.)|title=Biblia Sacra iuxta vulgatam versionem|location=Stuttgart|pages=XXXVII|year=1994}}</ref> By the same token however, the great extent to which the Clementine edition preserves contaminated readings from the medieval period can itself be considered to have critical value; Frans Van Liere states: \"for the medieval student interested in the text as it was read, for instance, in thirteenth century Paris, the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate might actually be a better representative of the scholastic biblical text that the modern critical editions of the text in its pre-Carolingian form.\"<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last=Van Liere|first=Frans|title=\"The Lain Bible, c 900 to the Council of Trent 1546\" in \"The New Cambridge History of the Bible, Vol II|location=Cambridge|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Later printings ====\nAfter Clement's 1598 printing of the Vulgate, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] issued no other official printings, leaving the task to other printers. Although the other printers of the Clementine Vulgate faithfully reproduced the words of the official edition, they were often quite free in matters of spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and paragraph boundaries. In 1906, [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin friar]] Fr. Michael Hetzenauer produced an edition restoring the original Clementine text while taking into account variations in Clement's three printings as well as correctoria officially issued by the Vatican. The current standard reference edition is that of [[Alberto Colunga]] & Laurentio Turrado, published in Madrid in 1946.\n\nIn 1959, Biblioteca de Autores Cristianos issued a printing of the Colunga-Turrado Clementine Vulgate omitting the Apocrypha, but containing excerpts from various [[Magisterium|magisterial]] documents and the ''[[Latin Psalters#Versio Piana|Piana]]'' version of the psalms in addition to the [[Latin Psalters#Versio Gallicana|vulgate version]].<ref>{{Cite book|edition=13|publisher=Biblioteca de autores cristianos|isbn=978-84-7914-021-2|last=Colunga, Alberto and Lorenzo Turrado (eds.)|title=Biblia Sacra iuxta Vulgatam Clementinam|location=Madrid|series=Biblioteca de autores cristianos 14|year=2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern critical editions ===\nThe official status of the Clementine Vulgate and the mass of manuscript material discouraged the creation of a [[Textual criticism|critical edition]] of the Vulgate. In 1734 Vallarsi published a corrected edition of the Vulgate. Most other later editions were limited to the [[New Testament]] and did not present a full critical apparatus, most notably [[Karl Lachmann]]'s editions of 1842 and 1850 based primarily on the [[Codex Amiatinus]] and [[Codex Fuldensis]],<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=Reimer|last=Lachmann|first=Karl|title=Novum Testamentum graece et latine|location=Berlin|date=1842–50}} (Google Books: [https://books.google.com/books?id=sxc-AAAAcAAJ Volume 1], [https://books.google.com/books?id=BVgPAAAAQAAJ Volume 2])</ref> Fleck's edition<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC14064762&id=7R7rgfv_Fp0C&pg=PP7&lpg=PP7&dq=%22vulgatae+editionis%22&as_brr=1#PPR1,M1|title=Novum Testamentum Vulgatae editionis juxta textum Clementis VIII.: Romanum ex Typogr.

He took these three manuscript witnesses as primary sources, and claimed to have decided the text by the ''règle de fer'' of always adopting the reading supported two-to-one in his three primary sources.  The resulting text was highly regarded, but neither Quentin's  method nor his underlying theory, carried scholarly conviction; all of his three primary sources being more generally considered to witness an early Italian text.\n\nAfter Henri Quentin's death in 1935, the Roman Vulgate's editors, for the Old Testament books from I Samuel onwards, modified their underlying textual theory and methods towards those of the Oxford editors; explicitly looking to establish for each book the best two or three primary sources from the Italian Vulgate tradition, and then deciding readings between them using secondary sources.  For much of rest of the Old Testament the chosen primary sources were the [[Codex Amiatinus]] and [[La Cava Bible|Codex Cavensis]]; although for the Book of Baruch, their only source was from the bibles of [[Codex Theodulphianus|Theodulf of Orleans]].  As neither Amiatinus nor Cavensis presented the Gallican psalter, the selected primary sources for the [[Book of Psalms]] were three of a series of 8th-10th-century psalters which presented both Jerome's Gallican and Hebraic translations in parallel columns.\n\nFollowing the Codex Amiatinus and the Vulgate texts of Alcuin and Theodulf the Roman Vulgate reunited the [[Book of Ezra]] and the [[Book of Nehemiah]] into a single book; reversing the decisions of the [[Sixto-Clementine Vulgate]].  \n\nIn 1933, [[Pope Pius XI]] established the [[Pontifical Abbey of St Jerome-in-the-City]] to complete the work.

[[Roger Gryson]] has been responsible for the most recent editions.

The first editions were published as two volumes, but the fourth (1994) and fifth (2007) editions were published as a single volume with smaller pages. The text reproduces and updates those of the Rome edition and the Oxford Edition for the Old Testament, Gospels, Acts and the earlier Pauline epistles; with changes mainly limited to standardisation of orthography. In the later New Testament books (those where the Oxford editors had retained the text of the 1911 ''editio minor'' unchanged), the Stuttgart editors felt justified in making a greater number of critical changes, especially as H.F.D. Sparks himself was included among their number. The text has not been modified substantially since the third edition of 1983, but the [[Apparatus criticus|''apparatus'']] has been rewritten for many books in more recent editions, based for example on new findings concerning the Vetus Latina from the work of the [[Vetus Latina Institute, Beuron]]. Like the editions of Oxford and Rome, it attempts, through critical comparison of the most significant historical manuscripts of the Vulgate, to recreate an early text, cleansed of the scribal errors and scholarly contaminations of a millennium. Thus it does not always represent what might have been read in the later [[Middle Ages]].\n\nAn important feature of the Weber-Gryson edition for those studying the Vulgate is its inclusion of Jerome's prologues, typically included in medieval copies of the Vulgate. It also includes the [[Eusebian Canons]]. It does not, however, provide any of the other prefatory material often found in medieval Bible manuscripts, such as chapter headings, some of which are included in the large editions of Oxford and Rome.\n\nIn its spelling, it retains medieval Latin orthography, sometimes using ''oe'' rather than ''ae'', and having more proper nouns beginning with ''H'' (e.g., ''Helimelech'' instead of ''Elimelech''). Unlike the edition of Rome, it standardizes the spelling of proper names rather than attempting to reproduce the idiosyncrasies of each passage. It also follows the medieval manuscripts in using line breaks, rather than the modern system of punctuation marks, to indicate the structure of each verse, following the practice of the Oxford and Rome editions, though it initially presents an unfamiliar appearance to readers accustomed to the Clementine text.\n\nIt contains two Psalters, both the traditional ''[[Latin Psalters#Versio Gallicana|Gallicanum]]'' and the ''[[Latin Psalters#Versio juxta Hebraicum|juxta Hebraicum]]'', which are printed on facing pages to allow easy comparison and contrast between the two versions. It has an expanded [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], containing [[Psalm 151]] and the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]] in addition to [[1 Esdras|3]] and [[2 Esdras|4 Esdras]] and the [[Prayer of Manasses]]. In addition, its modern prefaces (in Latin, German, French, and English) are a source of valuable information about the history of the Vulgate.\n\nThis edition's early popularity can in part be attributed to a concordance based on the second edition of the book by [[Bonifatius Fischer]], which was a key reference tool before the availability of personal computers.<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=Frommann-Holzboog|isbn=3772806384|last=Fischer|first=Bonifatius|title=Novae concordantiae bibliorum sacrorum iuxta Vulgatam versionem critice editam|location=Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt|year=1977}} {{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/2847758|issn=0038-7134|volume=56|issue=3|pages=611–613|last=Meyvaert|first=Paul|author2=Serge Lusignan|title=Review of Novae concordantiae Biblorum Sacrorum iuxta vulgatam versionem by Bonifatius Fischer|journal=Speculum|date=1981|jstor=2847758}} {{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0009840X00234082|volume=30|issue=1|pages=36–37|last=Kilpatrick|first=G.D.|title=A New Concordance to the Vulgate|journal=The Classical Review|series=n.s.|year=1980|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0009840X00234082}}</ref> More recently, it has become the text of the Vulgate most commonly disseminated on the Internet.

In 1965 [[Pope Paul VI]] appointed a commission to revise the rest of the Vulgate following the same principles. The Commission published its work in eight annotated sections, inviting criticism from Catholic scholars as the sections were published.

The ''Nova Vulgata'' is the translation used in the latest editions of the [[Lectionary|Roman Lectionary]], [[Liturgy of the Hours]], and [[Roman Ritual]].\n\nA second edition was published in 1986; this second edition added a Preface to the reader,<ref name=praefatio/> an Introduction<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/bible/nova_vulgata/documents/nova-vulgata_praenotanda_lt.html|title=Nova Vulgata : Praenotanda|language=la|access-date=2015-06-04}}</ref> to the principles used in producing the Nova Vulgata as well as an appendix<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/bible/nova_vulgata/documents/nova-vulgata_appendix_lt.html|language=la|title=Appendix|website=vatican.va|access-date=2015-06-04}}</ref> containing 3 historical documents from the Council of Trent and the Clementine Vulgate. In addition, the second edition included the footnotes to the Latin text found in the 8 annotated sections published before 1979; it also replaced the few occurrences of the form [[Yahweh|''Iahveh'']], when translating the [[Tetragrammaton]], with [[Adonai|''Dominus'']], in keeping with an ancient tradition.\n\nThe ''Nova Vulgata'' has been criticized by those who see it as being in some verses of the Old Testament a new translation rather than a revision of Jerome's work. Also, some of its readings sound unfamiliar to those who are accustomed to the Clementine. Traditional Catholics object against the ''Nova Vulgata'' because in their view it lacks Latin manuscript support and breaks with the historic worship tradition of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cathinfo.com/catholic.php?a=topic&t=43757|title=So now the Modernists in Rome are rewriting Scripture - Crisis in the Church - Catholic Info|website=www.cathinfo.com|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] released the instruction ''Liturgiam Authenticam'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20010507_liturgiam-authenticam_en.html|title=Liturgiam authenticam|website=vatican.va| access-date=2015-06-04}}</ref> establishing the Nova Vulgata as a point of reference for all translations of the [[liturgy]] of the [[Roman rite]] into the vernacular from the original languages, \"in order to maintain the tradition of interpretation that is proper to the Latin Liturgy\".\n\n==== Novum Testamentum Latine ====\nIn 1984 and 1992 [[Kurt Aland|Kurt]] and Barbara Aland updated and entirely revised Nestle's Latin New Testament of 1906 and republished it under the same name, ''Novum Testamentum Latine''.<ref>{{Cite book|edition=2|publisher=Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft|isbn=9783438053008|others=Kurt Aland, Barbara Aland (eds.)|title=Novum testamentum Latine: Novam vulgatam Bibliorum sacrorum ed. secuti apparatibus titulisque additis|location=Stuttgart|year=1992}}</ref> The text is a reprint of the [[New Testament]] of the ''Nova Vulgata'' to which has been added a [[critical apparatus]] giving the variant readings of earlier printed editions: the Stuttgart edition, the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1452), the Latin text of the [[Complutensian Polyglot]] (1514), the edition from [[Wittenberg]] favoured by [[Martin Luther|Luther]] (1529), and those of [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (1527), [[Robert Estienne|Robertus Stephanus]] (1540), [[Hentenius|Hentenius of Louvain]] (1547), [[Christoffel Plantijn|Christophorus Plantinus]] (1583), Pope Sixtus V (1590), Pope Clement VIII (1592), and Wordsworth and White (1911, 1954).

Over 100 late antique and medieval Vulgate texts also include the concocted ''[[Epistle to the Laodiceans]]'' (accepted as a genuine letter of Paul by many Latin commentators), although often with a note to the effect that it was not counted as canonical.\n\nThe Vulgate Old Testament from the first comprised the 38 books of the Hebrew Bible (as counted in Christian tradition before Nehemiah became split from Ezra in the medieval period), but always also including books from the [[Septuagint]] tradition, which by this date had ceased to be used by Jews, but which was copied in Greek Bibles as their [[Old Testament]]. Modern critical editions of the Septuagint take their texts from the Old Testament found in the great 4th/5th-century [[pandect]] bibles: [[Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]], and [[Codex Alexandrinus]]; but no two of these present exactly the same canon of Old Testament books. Similarly, Vulgate Old Testaments continued to vary in their content throughout the Middle Ages, and this was not considered problematic until Protestant [[Reformation|Reformers]] questioned the canonical status of books outside the Hebrew canon.\n\nAlthough Jerome preferred the books of the Hebrew Bible, he deferred to church authority in accepting as scripture not only the Greek additions to Esther and Daniel (albeit distinguished as apocryphal with the obelus), but also an extra six 'apocryphal' books in Judith, Tobit, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus and the two books of Maccabees, which in his listing of the Old Testament in the ''prologus galeatus'' he placed after the Hebrew canon. But, as Jerome explained in the prologue to Jeremiah, he continued to exclude altogether the Book of Baruch (and with it the letter of Jeremiah); and indeed these two books are not found in the Vulgate before the 9th century, and only in a minority of manuscripts before the 13th century. The 71 biblical books as listed by Jerome, although not in his order, formed the standard text of the Vulgate as it became established in Italy in the 5th and 6th centuries. No early Italian manuscript of the whole Vulgate Bible survives, and such [[pandect]] Bibles were always rare in this period; but the [[Codex Amiatinus]] written in Northumbria from Italian exemplars around 700 and intended to be presented to the Pope, represents the complete Bible according to the Italian Vulgate tradition. It contains the standard 71 books, with the Psalms according to Jerome's translation from the Hebrew, except for the addition of Psalm 151 in a version corresponding closely to that later attached to the Gallican psalter.\n\nThe early Vulgate text in Spain tended to vary much further from Jerome's original, specifically in the retention of many Old Latin readings, in the expansion of the text of the Book of Proverbs, and in the incorporation into the first epistle of John of the ''[[Comma Johanneum]]''. Spanish Bibles, on occasion, also included additional apocryphal texts, including the Book of Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah, 3 Esdras and 4 Esdras. Spanish, Italian and Irish Vulgate traditions were all reflected in Bibles created in northern France, which by the end of the 8th century featured a wide variety of highly variable texts. Under prompting from the emperor [[Charlemagne]], several scholars attempted in the 9th century to reform the French Vulgate. The English scholar [[Alcuin]] produced a text substantially based on Italian exemplars (although also including the ''Comma Johanneum''), but with the major change of substituting Jerome's Gallican version of the psalms (with Psalm 151 added from the Old Latin) for Jerome's third version from the Hebrew that had previously predominated in Bible texts. In the 50 years after Alcuin's death, the abbey of Tours reproduced his text in standardised pandect Bibles, of which over 40 survive. Alcuin's contemporary [[Theodulf of Orleans]] produced a second independent reformed recension of the Vulgate, also based largely on Italian exemplars, but with variant readings, from Spanish texts and patristic citations, indicated in the margin. Theodulf kept Jerome's Hebraic version of the Psalms, and also incorporated the Book of Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah within the book of Jeremiah. However, otherwise Theodulf adopted Jerome's proposed order of the Old Testament, with the six books from the Septuagint at the end. Theodulf's text was widely influential. A Vulgate revision was also undertaken in the early 9th century by scholars in the Abbey of [[Corbie]], and Bibles from this abbey are the first in France to include the books of 3 Esdras and 4 Esdras, though this practice remained rare.\n\nAlthough a large number of Bible manuscripts resulted from all this work, no standard Vulgate text was established for another three centuries. Marsden points out, in discussing how the Gallican version of the Psalter came to become established as the text of the psalms in the Vulgate Bible: \"Its dominant position was in fact not assured before the early 13th century, and even then was not universal\".  However, the explosive growth of medieval universities, especially the [[University of Paris]] during the 12th century, created a demand for a new sort of Vulgate. University scholars needed the entire Bible in a single, portable and comprehensive volume; which they could rely on to include all biblical texts which they might encounter in patristic references.  The result was the Paris Bible, which reached its final form around 1230. Its text owed most to Alcuin's revision, and always presented the psalms in the Gallican version; but readings throughout were in many places adjusted to be more consistent with patristic citations (which would very frequently have been based on Old Latin or Greek texts). The book of Baruch and Letter of Jeremiah were now always included, as too were 3 Esdras, and usually (appended to the book of Chronicles) the Prayer of Manasses. Less commonly included was 4 Esdras.\n\nThe early printings of the Latin Bible took examples of the Paris Bible as their base text, culminating in the successive critical Vulgate editions of [[Robert Estienne]] (Stephanus). Estienne's Geneva Vulgate of 1555, the first Bible to be subdivided throughout into chapters and verses, remained the standard Latin Bible for Reformed Protestantism; and established the content of the Vulgate as 76 books: 27 New Testament, 39 Hebrew Bible (with Ezra and Nehemiah now separated), plus Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch (including the Letter of Jeremiah), 1 and 2 Maccabees, 3 Esdras, 4 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasses. At the [[Council of Trent]] it was agreed that seven of these books (all except 3 Esdras, 4 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasses) should be considered inspired scripture; and the term \"deuterocanonical\", first applied by [[Sixtus of Siena]], was adopted to categorise them. The Council also requested that the Pope should undertake the production of definitive editions of the Latin, Greek and Hebrew scriptures conforming to their definition of the [[biblical canon]]; and this resulted, after several false starts, in the publication of the Clementine Vulgate of 1592. This incorporates the books of Trent's Deuterocanon in the main Bible text; but also introduces, following the New Testament, a section of Apocrypha, containing the Prayer of Manasses, 3 Esdras and 4 Esdras, of which only the first two are found in the Septuagint.\n\n== See also ==\n; Related articles\n* [[Bible translations into Latin]]\n* [[Biblia Pauperum]]\n* [[Books of the Latin Vulgate]]\n* [[Gutenberg Bible]]\n* [[Jerome]]\n* [[Poor Man's Bible]]\n* [[Ferdinand Cavallera]]\n* [[The Philobiblon]]\n\n; Some manuscripts\n* [[List of New Testament Latin manuscripts]]\n* [[Codex Sangallensis 1395]]\n* [[Codex Amiatinus]]\n* [[Codex Complutensis I]]\n* [[Codex Fuldensis]]\n* [[Codex Gigas]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://archive.org/stream/vulgatenewtesta00jerogoog#page/n5/mode/2up ''The Vulgate New Testament, with the Douay Version of 1582.
