The consonantal text was transmitted in manuscript form, and underwent redaction in the Second Temple period, but its earliest portions (parts of  [[Book of Amos|Amos]], [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] and [[Book of Micah|Micah]]) [[Dating the Bible|can be dated]] to the late 8th to early 7th centuries BCE. \n\nBiblical Hebrew has been written with a number of different writing systems. The Hebrews adopted the [[Phoenician alphabet]] around the 12th century&nbsp;BCE, which developed into the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]. This was retained by the [[Samaritans]], who use the descendent [[Samaritan alphabet]] to this day. However, the [[Aramaic alphabet]] gradually displaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet for the Jews, and it became the source for the modern [[Hebrew alphabet]]. All of these scripts were lacking letters to represent all of the sounds of Biblical Hebrew, though these sounds are reflected in Greek and Latin transcriptions/translations of the time. These scripts originally only indicated consonants, but certain letters, known by the [[Latin]] term [[Mater lectionis|''matres lectionis'']], became increasingly used to mark vowels. In the Middle Ages, various systems of [[diacritic]]s were developed to mark the vowels in Hebrew manuscripts; of these, only the [[Tiberian vocalization]] is still in wide use.\n\nBiblical Hebrew possessed a series of \"emphatic\" consonants whose precise articulation is disputed, likely [[Ejective consonant|ejective]] or [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]]. Earlier Biblical Hebrew possessed three consonants which did not have their own letters in the writing system, but over time they merged with other consonants. The [[stop consonant]]s developed [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] allophones under the influence of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and these sounds eventually became marginally [[phoneme|phonemic]]. The [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] and [[glottal consonant]]s underwent weakening in some regional dialects, as reflected in the modern Samaritan Hebrew reading tradition. The vowel system of Biblical Hebrew changed over time and is reflected differently in the ancient Greek and Latin transcriptions, medieval vocalization systems, and modern reading traditions.\n\nBiblical Hebrew had a typical Semitic morphology with [[nonconcatenative morphology]], arranging [[Semitic root]]s into patterns to form words. Biblical Hebrew distinguished two [[grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine), three [[grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, plural, and uncommonly, dual). Verbs were marked for [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] and [[Grammatical mood|mood]], and had two conjugations which may have indicated [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and/or [[grammatical tense|tense]] (a matter of debate). The tense or aspect of verbs was also influenced by the conjugation {{lang|hbo|ו|rtl=yes}}, in the so-called [[waw-consecutive]] construction. Default word order was [[verb–subject–object]], and verbs inflected for the number, gender, and [[grammatical person|person]] of their subject. Pronominal suffixes could be appended to verbs (to indicate [[Object (grammar)|object]]) or nouns (to indicate [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]]), and nouns had special [[construct state]]s for use in possessive constructions.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n{{Hiero | ˁ[[Apiru]] (ʕprw)<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Budge|1920|p=119}}</ref> | <hiero>a:p:r-G43-A1</hiero> | align=right | era=default }}\n\nThe earliest written sources refer to Biblical Hebrew by the name of the land in which it was spoken: {{lang|hbo|שפת כנען|rtl=yes}} 'the language of Canaan' (see Isaiah 19:18).<ref name=\"s1\" /> The Hebrew Bible also shows that the language was called {{lang|hbo|יהודית|rtl=yes}} 'Judaean, Judahite' (see, for example, 2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;18:26,28).<ref name=\"s1\" /> In the Hellenistic period Greek writings use the names ''Hebraios'', ''Hebraïsti'' (Josephus, ''Antiquities'' I, 1:2, etc.), and in Mishnaic Hebrew we find {{lang|hbo|עברית|rtl=yes}} 'Hebrew' and {{lang|hbo|לשון עברית|rtl=yes}} 'Hebrew language' ([[Nashim|Mishnah Gittin]] 9:8, etc.).<ref name=\"s1\" /> The origin of this term is obscure; suggested origins include the biblical [[Eber]], the [[ethnonym]]s [[Habiru|Ḫabiru]], Ḫapiru, and ˁApiru found in sources from Egypt and the near east, and a derivation from the root {{lang|hbo|עבר|rtl=yes}} \"to pass\" alluding to crossing over the Jordan River.<ref name=\"s1\" />{{sfn|Rainey|2008}} Jews also began referring to Hebrew as {{lang|hbo|לשון הקדש|rtl=yes}} \"the Holy Tongue\" in Mishnaic Hebrew.<ref name=\"s1\" />\n\nThe term ''Classical Hebrew'' may include all pre-medieval dialects of Hebrew, including Mishnaic Hebrew, or it may be limited to Hebrew contemporaneous with the Hebrew Bible. The term ''Biblical Hebrew'' refers to pre-Mishnaic dialects (sometimes excluding Dead Sea Scroll Hebrew). The term 'Biblical Hebrew' may or may not include extra-biblical texts, such as inscriptions (e.g. the [[Siloam inscription]]), and generally also includes later vocalization traditions for the Hebrew Bible's consonantal text, most commonly the early medieval Tiberian vocalization.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Ancient Hebrew writings}}\n[[File:Barkokhba-silver-tetradrachm.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Bar-Kokhba revolt coin using Paleo-Hebrew script, showing on one side a facade of the Temple, the Ark of the Covenant within, star above; and on the other a lulav with etrog.|Coin issued during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]].

The phonemic system was inherited essentially unchanged, but the [[emphatic consonant]]s may have changed their realization in Central Semitic from [[ejective]]s to [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized consonant]]s.\n\nThe morphology of Proto-Central-Semitic shows significant changes compared with Proto-Semitic, especially in its verbs, and is much like in [[Classical Arabic]]. Nouns in the singular were usually declined in three cases: /-u/ (nominative), /-a/ (accusative) or /-i/ (genitive). In some circumstances (but never in the [[construct state]]), nouns also took a final nasal after the case ending: ''nunation'' (final /-n/) occurred in some languages, ''mimation'' (final /-m/) in others. The original meaning of this marker is uncertain. In Classical Arabic, final /-n/ on nouns indicates indefiniteness and disappears when the noun is preceded by a [[definite article]] or otherwise becomes definite in meaning. In other languages, final /-n/ may be present whenever a noun is not in the [[construct state]]. [[Canaanite languages|Old Canaanite]] had mimation, of uncertain meaning, in an occurrence of the word ''urušalemim'' ([[Jerusalem]]) as given in an Egyptian transcription.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=267}}</ref>\n\n[[Broken plural]] forms in Arabic are declined like singulars, and often take singular agreement as well. Dual and \"strong plural\" forms use endings with a long vowel or diphthong, declined in only two cases: nominative and objective (combination accusative/genitive), with the objective form often becoming the default one after the loss of case endings. Both Hebrew and Arabic had a special form of nunation/mimation that co-occurred with the dual and masculine sound plural endings whenever the noun was not in the construct state. The endings were evidently felt as an inherent part of the ending and, as a result, are still used. Examples are Arabic strong masculine plural ''-ūna'' (nominative), ''-īna'' (objective), and dual endings ''-āni'' (nominative), ''-ayni'' (objective); corresponding construct-state endings are ''-ū, -ī'' (strong masculine plural), ''-ā, -ay'' (dual). (The strong feminine endings in Classical Arabic are ''-ātu'' nominative, ''-āti'' objective, marked with a singular-style ''-n'' nunation in the indefinite state only.)\n\nHebrew has almost lost the [[broken plural]] (if it ever had it), and any vestigial forms that may remain have been extended with the strong plural endings. The dual and strong plural endings were likely much like the Arabic forms given above at one point, with only the objective-case forms ultimately surviving. For example, dual ''-ayim'' is probably from ''*-aymi'' with an extended mimation ending (cf. Arabic ''-ayni'' above), while dual construct ''-ē'' is from ''*-ay'' without mimation. Similarly, ''-īm'' < ''*-īma'', ''-ōt'' < ''*-āti''. (Note that expected plural construct state ''*-ī'' was replaced by dual ''-ē''.)\n\nFeminine nouns at this point ended in a suffix /-at-/ or /-t-/ and took normal case endings. When the ending /-at-/ became final because of loss or non-presence of the case ending, both Hebrew and Arabic show a later shift to /-ah/ and then {{IPA|/-aː/}}. The final /t/ consonant therefore is silent in the absolute state, but becomes /t/ again in the construct state and when these words take suffixes, e.g. תֹורָה /toːraː/ \"law\" becomes תֹורַת /toːrat/ \"law of\", and תֹורָתְךָ /toːraːtəxaː/ \"your law\", etc. (This is equivalent to the Arabic letter Tāʼ Marbūṭah ة, a modified final form of the letter He ه which indicates this same phoneme shifting, and only its pronunciation varies between construct and absolute state.)\n\n===== Canaanite shift =====\nHebrew shows the [[Canaanite shift]] whereby {{IPA|*/aː/}} often shifted to {{IPA|/oː/}}; the conditions of this shift are disputed.<ref name=\"Blau 2010 136-137\"/><ref group=\"nb\">In fact, its scope of application is different in Samaritan and Tiberian Hebrew (e.g. {{lang|hbo|פה|rtl=yes}} 'here' Tiberian {{IPA|/po/}} vs. Samaritan {{IPA|/fa/}}), see {{Harvcoltxt|Ben-Ḥayyim|2000|pp=83–86}}. Even in Tiberian Hebrew doublets are found, e.g. {{IPA|/kʼanːo(ʔ?)/}} = {{IPA|/kʼanːɔ(ʔ?)/}} ('zealous'). See {{Harvcoltxt|Steiner|1997|p=147}}</ref> This shift had occurred by the 14th century&nbsp;BCE, as demonstrated by its presence in the [[Amarna letters]] (c. 1365&nbsp;BCE).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Steiner|1997|p=147}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|LaSor|1978|loc=Part 2, §14.11}}</ref>\n\n===== Proto-Hebrew =====\nAs a result of the Canaanite shift, the Proto-Hebrew vowel system is reconstructed as {{IPA|*/a aː oː i iː u uː/}} (and possibly rare {{IPA|*/eː/}}).<ref name=\"david\" /> Furthermore, stress at this point appears to have shifted so that it was consistently on the penultimate (next to last) syllable, and was still non-phonemic. The predominant final stress of Biblical Hebrew was a result of loss of final unstressed vowels and a shift away from remaining open syllables (see below).\n\n===== Loss of final unstressed vowels =====\nFinal unstressed short vowels dropped out in most words, making it possible for long vowels to occur in closed syllables.\nThis appears to have proceeded in two steps:\n#Final short mood, etc. markers dropped in verbal forms.\n#Final short case markers dropped in nominal forms.\nVowel lengthening in stressed, open syllables occurred ''between'' the two steps, with the result that short vowels at the beginning of a -VCV ending lengthened in nouns but not verbs. This is most noticeable with short {{IPA|/a/}}: e.g. ''*kataba'' ('he wrote') > {{IPA|/kɔˈθav/}} but ''*dabara'' ('word' acc.') > {{IPA|/dɔˈvɔr/}}.\n\nThe dropping of final short vowels in verb forms tended to erase mood distinctions, but also some gender distinctions; however, unexpected vowel lengthening occurred in many situations to preserve the distinctions. For example, in the suffix conjugation, first-singular *''-tu'' appears to have been remade into *''-tī'' already by Proto-Hebrew on the basis of possessive ''-ī'' (likewise first singular personal pronoun ''*ʔana'' became ''*ʔanī'').\n\nSimilarly, in the second-singular, inherited ''*-ta -ti'' competed with lengthened ''*-tā -tī'' for masculine and feminine forms. The expected result would be ''-t'' or ''-tā'' for masculine, ''-t'' or ''-tī'' for feminine, and in fact both variants of both forms are found in the Bible (with ''-h'' marking the long ''-ā'' and ''-y'' marking the long ''-ī''). The situation appears to have been quite fluid for several centuries, with ''-t'' and ''-tā/tī'' forms found in competition both in writing and in speech (cf. the [[Secunda (Hexapla)]] of [[Origen]], which records both pronunciations, although quite often in disagreement with the written form as passed down to us). Ultimately, writing stabilized on the shorter ''-t'' for both genders, while speech chose feminine ''-t'' but masculine ''-tā''. This is the reason for the unexpected [[qamatz]] vowel written under the final letter of such words.\n\nThe exact same process affected possessive ''*-ka'' ('your' masc. sing.) and ''*-ki'' ('your' fem. sing.), and personal pronouns ''*ʔanta, *ʔanti'', with the same split into shorter and longer forms and the same ultimate resolution.\n\n===== Short vowel lengthening (esp. pretonic), lowering =====\nThe short vowels {{IPA|*/a i u/}} tended to lengthen in various positions.\n*First, short vowels lengthened in an open syllable in pretonic position (i.e. directly before the stressed syllable).\n*Later, short vowels lengthened in stressed open syllables.<ref name=\"Janssens 1982 56-57\">{{Harvcoltxt|Janssens|1982|pp=56–57}}</ref> <ref group=\"nb\">Parallels to Aramaic syllable structure suggest pretonic lengthening may have occurred in the Second Temple period. See {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=128–129}}</ref>\nIn the process of lengthening, the high vowels were lowered. In the Secunda, the lengthened reflexes of {{IPA|/a i u/}} are {{IPA|/aː eː oː/}}; when kept short they generally have reflexes {{IPA|/a e o/}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Janssens|1982|pp=54, 118–120, 132}}</ref><ref group=\"nb\">Long {{IPA|/aː eː oː/}} were written as {{angle bracket|α η ω}}, while short {{IPA|/a e o/}} were written {{angle bracket|α/ε ε ο}}.

See {{Harvcoltxt|Janssens|1982|pp=54, 58–59}}</ref>\n\n===== Reduction of short open stressed syllables =====\nStressed [[open syllable]]s with a short vowel (i.e. syllables consisting of a short vowel followed by a consonant and another vowel) had the vowel reduced to {{IPA|/ə/}} and the stressed moved one syllable later in the word (usually to the last syllable of the word).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Janssens|1982|pp=56–57}}.</ref> Stress was originally penultimate and loss of final short vowels made many words have final stress. However, words whose final syllable had a long vowel or ended with a consonant were unaffected and still had penultimate stress at this point. This change did not happen in [[pausa]]l position, where the penultimate stress is preserved, and vowel lengthening rather than reduction occurs.\n\nThe previous three changes occurred in a complex, interlocking fashion:\n\n# Shift of stress to be universally penultimate.\n# Loss of final short vowels in verbs, pre-stress lengthening in open syllables. Pre-stress lengthening/lowering becomes a [[surface filter]] that remains as a rule in the language, automatically affected any new short vowels in open syllables as they appear (but ultra-short vowels are unaffected).\n# Stress movement from light syllable to following heavy syllable when not in [[pausa]], with newly unstressed light syllable reducing the schwa.\n# Tonic lengthening/lowering in open syllables.\n# Loss of final short vowels in nouns.\n\nExamples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable nowrap\"\n|+ Possible derivation of some nominal/verbal forms\n!\n!

The above changes can be seen to divide words into a number of main classes based on stress and syllable properties:\n\n# Proto-Hebrew words with an open penult and short-vowel ending: Become final-stressed (e.g. {{IPA|/qɔˈṭal/}} ('he killed') <  PHeb. {{IPA|/qaˈṭala/}}).\n# Proto-Hebrew words with a closed penult and short-vowel ending: Become penultimate due to segholate rule (e.g. {{IPA|/ˈmɛlɛx/}} ('king') < {{IPA|*/malku/}}).\n# Proto-Hebrew words with an open short penult and longer ending: Become final-stressed due to sress shift (e.g. {{IPA|/qɔṭəˈlu/}} ('they killed') <  PHeb. {{IPA|/qaˈṭaluː/}}).\n# Proto-Hebrew words with a closed penult and longer ending: Remain penultimate (e.g. {{IPA|/qɔˈṭalti/}} ('I killed') <  PHeb. {{IPA|/qaˈṭaltiː/}}).\n# Proto-Hebrew words with an open long penult and longer ending: ???\n\n===== Pre-stress reduction of short vowel =====\n{{IPA|*/a i u/}} were reduced to {{IPA|/ə/}} in the second syllable before the stress,<ref name=\"j54\" /> and occasionally reduced rather than lengthened in pretonic position, especially when initial (e.g. σεμω = {{lang|hbo|שמו|rtl=yes}} {{IPA|/ʃəˈmo/}} 'his name').<ref name=\"j120\">{{Harvcoltxt|Janssens|1982|p=120}}</ref><ref group=\"nb\">The Secunda also has a few cases of pretonic gemination.

They also overlap semantically, for example a jussive form like 'May my soul ...' is semantically equivalent to a cohortative like 'May I ...'. However, the three moods stem from different classes in proto-West-Semitic. As preserved in Classical Arabic, there were originally three prefix tenses, indicative ''yaqtulu'', jussive ''yaqtul'', and subjunctive ''yaqtula'', which existed for every person. In Biblical Hebrew, ''yaqtulu'' developed into the prefixing class, while ''yaqtul'' remained the jussive and ''yaqtula'' the cohortative. For most roots in Biblical Hebrew, the jussive form is identical to the indicative form. (Differentiation is typical of forms with \"long\" and \"short\" forms, e.g. indicative {{lang|hbo|יכרִית|rtl=yes}}, jussive {{lang|hbo|יכרֵת|rtl=yes}}; indicative {{lang|hbo|יראה|rtl=yes}}, jussive {{lang|hbo|יֵרֶא|rtl=yes}}) See {{Harvcoltxt|Waltke|O'Connor|1990|pp=564–565, 566}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=206}}.</ref> The meaning of the prefixing and suffixing conjugations are also affected by the conjugation {{lang|hbo|ו|rtl=yes}}, and their meaning with respect to [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] is a matter of debate.<ref name=\"sconj\" />\n\n=== Word order ===\nThe default word order in Biblical Hebrew is commonly thought to be [[verb–subject–object|VSO]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Doron|2005|p=3}}</ref> though one scholar has argued that this is due to the prevalence of clauses with a [[Waw-consecutive|''wayyiqtol'' verb form]] compared to other less [[markedness|marked]] forms that use SVO either more often or at least to a comparable degree.<ref>Robert Holmstedt.

The Perfect verb form expressed the idea of the verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.com|title=Bible Search and Study Tools - Blue Letter Bible|website=www.blueletterbible.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-17}}</ref>\n\nThe Imperfect portrays the verb as an incomplete action along with the process by which it came about, either as an event that has not begun, an event that has begun but is still in the process, or a habitual or cyclic action that is on an ongoing repetition. The Imperfect can also express modal or conditional verbs, as well as commands in the Jussive and Cohortative moods. While often future tense, it also has uses in the past and present under certain contexts. Biblical Hebrew tense is not necessarily reflected in the verb forms per se, but rather is determined primarily by context. The Participles also reflect ongoing or continuous actions, but are also subject to the context determining their tense.\n\nThe verbal forms can be Past Tense in these circumstances:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511610899|title=A Guide to Biblical Hebrew Syntax by Bill T.
