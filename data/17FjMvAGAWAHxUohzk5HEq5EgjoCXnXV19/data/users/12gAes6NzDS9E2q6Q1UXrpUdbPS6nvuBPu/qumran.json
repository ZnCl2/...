The [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]] settlement was constructed during the reign of [[John Hyrcanus]] ({{BCE|link|134–104}}) or somewhat later, and was occupied most of the time until it was destroyed by the Romans in {{CE|link|68}} or shortly after. It is best known as the settlement nearest to the [[Qumran Caves]] where the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] were hidden, caves in the sheer [[desert]] cliffs and beneath, in the [[marl]] terrace. The principal excavations at Qumran were conducted by [[Roland de Vaux]] in the 1950s, though several later unearthings at the site have since been carried out.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dead Sea Scrolls Map.jpg|thumb|250px|Location of Qumran]]\nSince the discovery of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in 1947–1956, extensive excavations have taken place in Qumran. Nearly 900 [[scroll]]s were discovered. Most were written on [[parchment]] and some on [[papyrus]]. [[Cisterns]], [[Mikveh|Jewish ritual baths]], and [[cemetery|cemeteries]] have been found, along with a dining or assembly room and debris from an upper story alleged by some to have been a [[scriptorium]] as well as pottery kilns and a tower.\n\nMany scholars believe the location was home to a Jewish [[sect]], probably the [[Essenes]]. But, according to [[Lawrence Schiffman]], the rules of the community, its heavy stress on priesthood and the [[Zadokites|Zadokite]] legacy, and other details indicate a [[Sadducean]]-oriented sect either distinct from or one of the various Essene groupings.<ref>Schiffman, 1983, 1989, and, summarizing his current views, [http://lawrenceschiffman.com/research/dead-sea-scrolls/ \"What Are the Dead Sea Scrolls: An Introduction\"], accessed 24 February 2014</ref> Others propose non-sectarian interpretations, some of these starting with the notion that it was a Hasmonean [[fort]] that was later transformed into a [[villa]] for a wealthy family, or a production center, perhaps a pottery factory or something similar.\n\nA large cemetery was discovered to the east of the site. While most of the graves contain the remains of males, some females were also discovered, though some burials may be from medieval times. Only a small portion of the graves were excavated, as [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavating]] cemeteries is forbidden under Jewish law. Over a thousand bodies are buried at Qumran cemetery.<ref>de Vaux 1973, p. 45f, states that there were 1100 tombs in the main cemetery. However, Kapera 2000, p. 46, argues for only 669 tombs. But an on-site survey came closer to de Vaux's number, Eshel, Hanan, Magen Broshi, Richard Freund, and Brian Schultz. \"New Data on the Cemetery East of Khirbet Qumran\". DSD 9/2 (2002) 135–165.</ref> One theory is that bodies were those of generations of sectarians, while another is that they were brought to Qumran because burial was easier there than in rockier surrounding areas.<ref>Stacey, [http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/Stacey_Qumran_Light_of_Recent_Publications.shtml#Note_11 Some Notes on the Archaeological Context of Qumran in the Light of Recent Publications].</ref>\n\nThe scrolls were found in a series of eleven caves around the settlement, some accessible only through the settlement. Some scholars have claimed that the caves were the permanent [[library|libraries]] of the sect, due to the presence of the remains of a shelving system. Other scholars believe that some caves also served as domestic shelters for those living in the area. Many of the texts found in the caves appear to represent widely accepted Jewish beliefs and practices, while other texts appear to speak of divergent, unique, or minority interpretations and practices. Some scholars believe that some of these texts describe the beliefs of the inhabitants of Qumran, who may have been [[Essenes]], or the [[political asylum|asylum]] for supporters of the traditional [[priest]]ly family of the Zadokites against the [[Hasmonean]] priest/kings. A literary epistle published in the 1990s expresses reasons for creating a community, some of which resemble Sadducean arguments in the [[Talmud]].<ref>[[Joseph M. Baumgarten]], \"The 'Halakha' in Miqsat Ma`ase ha-Torah (MMT).\" ''JAOS'' 116/3 (1996) 512–516 cautioned against premature suggestions of few Sadducee agreements as if pointing to identity. Schofield, Alison, and James C. VanderKam. \"Were the Hasmoneans Zadokites?\" JBL 124/1 (2005) 73–87 show that matters of \"Zadokite\" identity are not simple. Also, \"Sadducees\" in Second Temple Period are not fully identical with Talmudic use of the term. In some scrolls \"sons of Zadok\" are members of the sect, but not a name for the whole sect.</ref> Most of the scrolls seem to have been hidden in the caves during the turmoil of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] (66–73 CE), although some of them may have been deposited earlier.\n\n==Discovery and excavation==\n[[File:Qumran cave.jpg|thumb|Caves of Qumran]]\n\n===Early site analysis===\nThe site of Khirbet Qumran had been known to European explorers since the 19th century.<ref>J. E. Taylor, \"Khirbet Qumran in the Nineteenth Century and the Name of the Site.\" pp. 144–164. Cansdale 2000, especially p. 633 regarding F. de Saulcy.</ref> The initial attention of the early explorers was focused on the cemetery, beginning with de Saulcy in 1851. In fact, the first excavations at Qumran (prior to the development of modern methodology) were of burials in the cemetery, conducted by Henry Poole in 1855 followed by [[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau|Charles Clermont-Ganneau]] in 1873.<ref>B. Schultz, \"The Qumran Cemetery: 150 Years of Research.\" pp. 194–196.</ref>\n\nRev. [[Albert Augustus Isaacs|Albert Isaacs]], British counsel James Finn, and photographer James Graham visited Qumran in December 1856.<ref>Isaacs, Rev. Albert Augustus, M.A. The Dead Sea: or, Notes and Observations Made During a Journey to Palestine in 1856-7, London: Hatchard and Son,\tPiccadilly,1857.</ref> Isaacs stated regarding Qumran's tower, \"It can hardly be doubted that this formed a tower or stronghold of some kind. The situation is commanding, and well adapted for defensive operations.\"<ref>See p. 66 in Isaacs, A., ''The Dead Sea: or, Notes and Observations Made During a Journey to Palestine in 1856–7'', (London: Hatchard and Son, 1857).</ref> Finn later suggested Qumran was \"some ancient fort with a cistern\".<ref>See p. 416 in Finn, J., ''Byeways in Palestine'' (London: James Nisbet, 1868).</ref>\n\nThe British scholar Ernest William Gurney Masterman visited Qumran on several occasions between 1900 and 1901. After observing the positioning of Qumran atop a plateau overlooking the ‘Ein Feshkha Springs, he concluded the ruins \"may have very well been once a small fortress\".<ref>See p. 161 in Masterman, E. W. G. \"‘Ain el-Feshkhah, el-Hajar, el-Asbah, and Khurbet Kumrân\", ''PEFQS'' 27 (1902): 160–167, 297–299.</ref> Masterman also questioned why a small fort would require a graveyard of over one thousand tombs.<ref>See p. 162 in Masterman, E. W. G. \"‘Ain el-Feshkhah, el-Hajar, el-Asbah, and Khurbet Kumrân\", ''PEFQS'' 27 (1902): 160–167; 297–299.</ref>\n\nGustaf Dalman visited Qumran in 1914, and explicitly identified Qumran as a ''burg'', or fort.<ref>Dalman, G. ''Palästinajahrbuch des Deutschen evangelischen Instituts für Altertumswissenschaft des heiligen Landes zu Jerusalem''. (Berlin: Ernst Siegfried Mittler, 1914), 9–11.</ref> Archaeologist Michael Avi-Yonah agreed with Dalman’s identification of Qumran as a fort and published a map that identified the remains at Qumran as part of a string of fortresses along the southeastern Judean border.<ref>See p. 164 in Avi-Yonah, M. \"Map of Roman Palestine\", ''Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine'' 5 (1936): 139–196.</ref>\n\n===Major excavations===\nFull-scale work at the site began after [[Roland de Vaux]] and [[Gerald Lankester Harding]] in 1949 excavated what became known as Cave 1, the first scroll-bearing cave. A cursory surface survey that year produced nothing of interest,<ref>Trever 1965, p. 147.</ref> but continued interest in the scrolls led to a more substantial analysis of the ruins at Qumran in 1951. This analysis yielded traces of pottery closely related to that found in Cave 1.<ref>Trever. ibid.</ref> This discovery led to intensive excavations at the site over a period of six seasons (1951–1956) under the direction of de Vaux.\n\n[[File:Qumran chronology chart 3.jpg|thumb|220px|Chart of various proposed chronologies of Qumran.<ref>From Cargill, Robert R., ''Qumran through (Real) Time: A Virtual Reconstruction of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls'', Bible in Technology 1, (Piscataway, New Jersey: [[Gorgias Press]], 2009), Plate 10.1.\n*Used with permission – author upload.</ref>]]\nThe Iron Age remains at the site, which were modest but included a [[lmlk]]-seal, led de Vaux to identify Qumran as the [[City of Salt]] listed in Josh 15:62. The site, however, may be identified with [[Secacah]], which is referenced in the same area as the City of Salt in Josh 15:61. Secacah is mentioned in the [[Copper Scroll]], and the water works of Secacah that are described in this source are consistent with those of Qumran.<ref>H. Eshel, \"A Note on Joshua 15:61–62 and the Identification of the City of Salt.\" pp. 37–40.</ref> The excavations revealed that after the Iron Age, Qumran was principally in use from the Hasmonean times until some time after the destruction of the temple by Titus in 70 CE. De Vaux divided this use into three periods:\n\n* Period I, the Hasmonean era, which he further divided in two:\n** Period Ia, the time of John Hyrcanus\n** Period Ib, the latter Hasmoneans, ending with an earthquake and fire in 31&nbsp;BCE (this was followed by a hiatus in de Vaux's interpretation of the site)\n* Period II, the Herodian era, starting in 4&nbsp;BCE on up to the destruction of the site apparently at the hands of the Romans during the Jewish War\n* Period III, a reoccupation in the ruins\n\nDe Vaux's periodization has been challenged by both Jodi Magness<ref>Magness 2000, p. 713f. Magness rejected Period Ia and the hiatus between Periods Ib and II.</ref> and Yizhar Hirschfeld.<ref>Hirschfeld, \"Context\", p. 52f. Hirschfeld proposed a new periodization based on the analysis of Humbert ''Revue Biblique'' 1994. 209f.</ref>\n\nThe site that de Vaux uncovered divides into two main sections: a ''main building'', a squarish structure of two stories featuring a central courtyard and a defensive tower on its north-western corner; and a ''secondary building'' to the west. The excavation revealed a complex water system that had supplied water to several stepped cisterns, some quite large, located in various parts of the site. Two of these cisterns were within the walls of the main building.\n\nBoth the buildings and the water system evince signs of consistent evolution throughout the life of the settlement. with frequent additions, extensions and improvements. The water channel was raised to carry water to newer cisterns farther away and a dam was placed in the upper section of Wadi Qumran to secure more water, which was brought to the site by an aqueduct. Rooms were added, floors were raised, pottery ovens relocated and locations were repurposed.\n\nDe Vaux found three inkwells at Qumran (Loci 30 (2) and 31) and over the following years more inkwells have come to light with a Qumran origin. Jan Gunneweg identified a fourth (locus 129). S. Steckoll found a fifth (reportedly near the scriptorium). Magen and Peleg found a sixth inkwell. Without counting the [[Ein Feshkha]] inkwell<ref>Alison Schofield ,[https://books.google.com/books?id=7qVTOrldR-IC&pg=PA255  ''From Qumran to the Yaḥad: A New Paradigm of Textual Development for The Community Rule''], BRILL, 2009 pp.255–6,</ref> or others with debated provenance, that number is more inkwells than found at any other site of the Second Temple Period, a significant indication of writing at Qumran.\n\n===De Vaux's interpretations===\nDe Vaux interpreted his findings at Qumran based (at least in part) upon information in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]—which continued to be discovered in the nearby caves throughout his [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]]. De Vaux concluded that the remains at Qumran were left by a sectarian religious community. Using his excavations as well as textual sources, including the Dead Sea Scrolls and the historical accounts recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Philo]], and [[Flavius Josephus]], De Vaux's conclusion was that the inhabitants of the site were a sect of highly ritualistic Jews called the [[Essenes]], a conclusion that has come to be known as the \"Qumran–Essene hypothesis\".<ref>De Vaux was actually a relative late-comer to the Essene identification, years after [[Eliezer Sukenik]] proposed the notion in 1948. It seems that it was also derived independently by Butrus Sowmy of St Mark's Monastery at the same time, according to Trever 1965, p. 25.</ref> This hypothesis suggests that the original residents of the settlement were the Essenes, and that they established the site in the desert for religious purposes.\n\nHe interpreted the room above locus 30 as a \"scriptorium\" because he discovered inkwells there. A plastered bench was also discovered in the remains of an upper story. De Vaux concluded that this was the area where the Essenes could have written some of the Dead Sea Scrolls. De Vaux also interpreted locus 77 as a \"refectory\", or a community dining hall, based on the discovery of numerous sets of bowls in the nearby \"pantry\" of locus 89. Additionally, de Vaux interpreted many of the numerous stepped cisterns as \"miqva’ot\", or Jewish ritual baths, due to their similarity to several stepped and partitioned ritual baths near the [[Jerusalem]] [[Temple Mount]].\n\nRegarding the scrolls De Vaux cautiously stated that \"manuscripts were copied in the ''scriptorium'' of Qumran... We may also suppose... that certain works were composed at Khirbet Qumran. But beyond this we cannot go.\"<ref>de Vaux 1973, p. 104.</ref> He believed that the Essenes later hid the scrolls in the nearby caves when they felt their safety was in danger.\n\nRoland de Vaux died in 1971 without having provided a full report on the excavations at Qumran.<ref>[https://books.google.ru/books?id=tJTSvfsgSK4C&pg=PA91&dq=de+Vaux+died+in+1971+without+having+published+all+of+the+material+from+his+excavations&hl=ru&sa=X&ei=M70sVLe1B42vPKuSgegP&ved=0CCEQuwUwAA#v=onepage&q=de%20Vaux%20died%20in%201971%20without%20having%20published%20all%20of%20the%20material%20from%20his%20excavations&f=false Maxine L.

Preliminary findings were presented at a conference in New York in 1992,<ref>Wise et al., 1994, p. 1.</ref> but a final report never eventuated. According to Pauline Donceel-Voûte the final report was impossible to write, because many artifacts had been lost or corrupted (in particular, according to the Donceels, some of the coins excavated by Roland de Vaux from Qumran had been lost.<ref>[https://books.google.ru/books?id=NnpvX1Ke-LkC&pg=PA4&dq=for+example+the+Donceels+reported+that+some+of+the+coins+from+de+Vaux+excavations+have+been+lost.&hl=ru&sa=X&ei=NvMtVNjnJKmGywP72IHIDw&ved=0CCIQuwUwAA#v=onepage&q=for%20example%20the%20Donceels%20reported%20that%20some%20of%20the%20coins%20from%20de%20Vaux%20excavations%20have%20been%20lost.&f=false Jodi Magness.

As de Vaux left little of the settlement unexcavated, later archaeologists have often turned elsewhere to continue research, including dump sites from de Vaux's excavations. During the 1960s, according to Catherine Murphy, there were some unpublished excavations at Qumran by [[John Allegro]] and by [[Solomon H. Steckoll|Solomon Steckoll]].<ref>Murphy 2002, pp. 293–294.

In the late 1980s, archaeologist Robert Donceel worked on the de Vaux materials in a new effort towards publishing excavation reports. He found artifacts he believed did not fit the religious settlement model, including \"sophisticated glass and stoneware\".<ref>I. Magen, ''The stone vessel industry in the Second Temple period'', 2002. Donceel & Donceel-Voute, 1994, p. 12.</ref> In 1992 Pauline Donceel-Voute put forward the Roman villa model in an attempt to explain these artifacts.<ref>Donceel & Donceel-Voute, 1994.</ref> In 2002 archaeologists Minna and Kenneth Lönnqvist<ref>M. Lönnqvist & K. Lönnqvist, 2000.</ref> published their archaeological and spatial studies at Qumran bringing another view to the settlement interpretations including the astronomical orientations of some structures at Qumran. A recent final publication of the French excavations by Jean-Baptist Humbert<ref>See Humbert \"Reconsideration\", 2003.</ref> outlining evidence of a decorated frieze, [[opus sectile]], fine columns etc., indicates a phase of a wealthier occupation, \"une grande maison\", at Qumran.\n\n===Pottery===\nThe range of pottery, glass and high quantity of coins found at Qumran do not sit well in the context of a sectarian settlement according to the Donceels.<ref>Donceel & Donceel-Voute 1994, coins: p. 6; glass and stoneware, p. 12.</ref><ref>But relatively few \"luxury\" items, such as glass and stone ware have so far been published (and some of them may be from Period III).</ref> These materials point to trade connections in the area, and provide evidence that Qumran may not have been in a vacuum in the Graeco-Roman period. Rachel Bar-Nathan has argued from similarities between pottery finds at Qumran and at the Hasmonean and Herodian palaces of [[Jericho]] that Qumran should be seen as part of the Jordan valley context, rather than as an isolated site.<ref>Bar-Nathan 2006.</ref> While the cylindrical \"scroll jars\" from Qumran were once thought unique, she cites a proposed similar find at Jericho, shows a related form existed at [[Masada]],<ref name=\"Bar-Nathan 2006, p.275\">Bar-Nathan 2006, p. 275.</ref> and reports that such jars have been found at Qalandiya.<ref>Personal communication from Y. Magen, Bar-Nathan 2006, p. 275.</ref> Bar-Nathan states from the Jericho palace data that, \"It is possible to trace the typological development of this group of jars\", i.e., the cylindrical jars.<ref name=\"Bar-Nathan 2006, p.275\"/> Jodi Magness, citing Bar-Nathan's M.A. thesis on the Jericho pottery data, refers to cylindrical jars at Jericho, saying \"[a]t Jericho, most of these jars .. come from an industrial area dating to the time of Herod\".<ref>Magness 2002, p. 81.</ref> Jan Gunneweg observed that the supposed single partial parallel at Jericho – \"a partly preserved rim and neck with a vertical loop handle\" – is in fact not a \"scroll\" jar.<ref>p105-6, with photo, \"Figure 5. The wrongly dubbed Jericho 'Scroll' jar with handle.\" in Jan Gunneweg and Marta Balla, \"The Provenance of Qumran Pottery by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis, 99–108 in ''Bio- and Material Culture at Qumran'', ed. J. Gunneweg et al. (Stuttgart: Fraunhofer IRB Verlag, 2006).</ref> Another one was reported found in Jordan in a later burial near Abila but no photos or drawings were published and the jar has not been relocated, showing de Vaux sought parallels. Taking into account subtypes of pottery, true cylindrical \"scroll\" jars are not common outside Qumran. They are, however, clearly not unique to Qumran. Bar-Nathan noted the jar's \"rarity in the Second Temple period\".<ref>''Masada VII'' (Israel Exploration Society, 2006), p. 43.</ref> Of some of the proposed parallel Masada jars, Bar-Nathan wrote \"It seems that this group of storage jars was brought (or pillaged?) from the area of Qumran and probably also from the Plain of Jericho.\"<ref>Masada VII, p. 43.</ref>\n\n===Cisterns===\nMany scholars have viewed the several large stepped cisterns at Qumran as ritual baths. This supports the religious settlement model. There are difficulties in understanding all these cisterns as baths, however. Qumran's water arrived perhaps twice a year from rainwater runoff. Water was one of Qumran's most valued commodities, and water management is an integral part of the site, as seen with the numerous cisterns and channels. If the large cisterns were ritual baths, the water would sit getting dirtier through ritual bathing throughout the year and was extremely infrequently replenished by the run off. The current state of analysis of the cisterns is still unresolved, but [[Katharina Galor]] suggests a mixed usage of the stepped cisterns as both ritual baths and water storage.<ref>Galor 2003, esp. 317.</ref> According to the Israeli archaeologists Magen and Peleg, the clay found in the cisterns was used for pottery factory facilities.<ref>Magen 2006.</ref>\n\n===Numismatic studies===\nCoins from Qumran are one of the most important groups of primary evidence from the ancient site. Much of what has been written on the chronology, the occupational periods and the history of Qumran is based on the preliminary report and lecture by the original excavator, Roland de Vaux in 1961, which was translated in 1973.<ref>In French, in R. de Vaux (1961), L’Archéologie et les Manuscrits de la Mer Morte.

This means that the site was highly monetized in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, i.e. that the occupants of Qumran were not a community of poor and isolated people. That the flow of cash at Qumran may have been large in the 1st century CE is hardly surprising given the archaeological evidence of trade at Qumran in luxury goods such as glass, which is specifically dated to this period.\n\nThe coin profile of Qumran shows that there do not appear to have been any major changes in the role of coins and money in the economic system at Qumran during any of the occupational periods from ca. 150&nbsp;BCE. to 73&nbsp;CE. Worth noting here is that the amount of coins found at Qumran suggests according to numismatic principles of loss and survival of ancient coins that millions of bronze coins must have circulated at Qumran.\n\nThe bronze coins identified from Qumran, some dating to the second and third years of the Jewish War, indicate that the site was still in use in 68&nbsp;CE and only destroyed after 70&nbsp;CE, perhaps as late as 73&nbsp;CE.<ref>Lönnqvist and M. Lönnqvist (2006) ‘The Numismatic Chronology of Qumran: Fact and Fiction’, The Numismatic Chronicle 166, London: The Royal Numismatic Society, pp. 21–165.</ref><ref>Leonard, Robert D., \"Numismatic Evidence for the Dating of Qumran\", ''The Qumran Chronicle'' 7:3/4 (1997), p. 231.</ref> The coins from Qumran of this period end with a peculiar series of bronze coins minted in 72/73&nbsp;CE at Ascalon, which sent auxiliary troops to assist the Roman army in the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] (66–73&nbsp;CE).\n\nIn 73&nbsp;CE the Romans stormed the mountain fortress of Masada, which also was located on the western bank of the Dead Sea. It is more than likely that Qumran was destroyed this same time, as the coin finds from Qumran end with the same peculiar bronze coins minted at Ascalon.\n\n====The silver coinage====\nAccording to the publications prior to 2007, the most recent silver coin in the Qumran hoard(s) is a [[tetradrachm]] of Tyre from the year 9/8 BCE.<ref name=\"FarhiPrice2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Farhi|first1=Yoav|last2=Price|first2=Randall|title=The Numismatic Finds from the Qumran Plateau Excavations 2004‐2006, and 2008 Seasons|journal=Dead Sea Discoveries|volume=17|issue=2|year=2010|pages=210–225|url=http://archaeology.huji.ac.il/depart/classical/farhi/Farhi.QUMRAN_COINS.DSD_17,2_210-226.pdf|issn=0929-0761|doi=10.1163/156851710X503567}}</ref>\n\n=====Lönnqvist analysis of 2007=====\nThe publication of the bulk of the silver coins by K. A. K. Lönnqvist, and his regional analysis, resulted, in 2007, in a new interpretations as to the importance, chronology and significance of the coins.<ref>Lönnqvist, K. 2007. ''The Report of the Amman Lots of the Qumran Silver Coin Hoards. New Chronological Aspects of the Silver Coin Hoard Evidence from Khirbet Qumran at the Dead Sea''. Amman: National Press.</ref><ref>K. A. K. Lönnqvist (2009) ''New Perspectives on the Roman Coinage on the Eastern Limes in the Late Republican and Roman Imperial Periods''. [[VDM Verlag Dr. Müller]]. Saarbrücken 2009</ref> According to Lönnqvist, the newly dated coins in the silver coin hoards give an earliest possible burial date for the coin hoards to 52/3-66&nbsp;CE, based on an interpretation of a countermark. However, the archaeological and numismatic nature of the silver coin hoard burials may suggest that the coin hoards may have been buried in the early 3rd century CE. The final coin belongs to Emperor Caracalla and came from the mint of Rome (206–210&nbsp;CE).\n\nThe new suggestion made is that the silver coin hoards from Qumran may be connected to Roman military campaigns in the region, as these are widely attested to in the early 3rd century CE. It is also quite possible that the silver were part of Roman army payments made to troops in a local garrison.\n\nAccording to Lönnqvist, the technical evidence of the recording and documenting of the Qumran silver coin hoards in 2006–2007 showed that the coins came from lots, groups or batches of coins that originated in a few or one single large payment. This payment may have come from a mint, bank or an authority like the treasury of the Roman army. The new evidence refutes the possibility that the silver coins could have been collected from single individuals, for instance, as tax payments, or that Qumran could have been a regional ‘tax house’.<ref>K. A. K. Lönnqvist (2009) New Perspectives on the Roman Coinage on the Eastern Limes in the Late Republican and Roman Imperial Periods. [[VDM Verlag Dr. Müller]]. Saarbrücken 2009, pp. 222–227.</ref>\n\nThe new 2007 analysis of the silver coinage contradicts the findings of de Vaux, Seyrig, and Spijkerman as well as the findings of Robert Donceel.<ref>''Revue Biblique'' 99 (1992) 559-60 n.10.</ref> Donceel was surprised to find in the Amman museum unrecorded coins, notably denarius coins of Trajan, that he claimed were intrusive.   The original Amman Museum records of the Qumran coin hoards and the museum bags where the coins where kept do not support the hypothesis that the 2nd- and 3rd-century Roman coins are intrusive in relation to the Tyrian silver.\n\nFurthermore, the new countermark<ref>K. A. K. Lönnqvist (2009) New Perspectives on the Roman Coinage on the Eastern Limes in the Late Republican and Roman Imperial Periods. [VDM Verlag Dr. Müller]. Saarbrücken 2009, Coin No. 304.</ref> that went unrecorded is apparently from 52/53&nbsp;CE and the Greek letters in it do not support a date of 9/8&nbsp;BCE, as the other countermarks. This means archaeologically and numismatically that at least one, but probably two minimum, of the three hoards post-date de Vaux's suggestion of a burial date after 9/8&nbsp;BCE.\n\nThe unusual and intensive die-linkage of the Qumran silver hoards suggest that the three hoards were buried at the same time, and this would mean at the earliest in 52/53&nbsp;CE.\n\nAccording to Lönnqvist, a highly unusual type of coin hoard found at Ain Hanaziv in the Jordan Valley in the early 1960 and reported in the Israel Numismatic Bulletin<ref>K. A. K. Lönnqvist (2009) New Perspectives on the Roman Coinage on the Eastern Limes in the Late Republican and Roman Imperial Periods. [VDM Verlag Dr. Müller]. Saarbrücken 2009, 155.</ref> supports his theory of a third-century CE date for the three silver coin hoards from Qumran. This Ain Hanaziv coin hoard spanned hundreds of years, starting from the Seleucid era and ended with the same kind of coins from reign of Septimius Severus in 210&nbsp;CE.\n\nTherefore, according to Lönnqvist, claiming an earlier date for the silver hoards is untenable and contradicts the first complete recording of the Qumran silver hoards made by him in 2007, which includes the first photographic evidence of the coin hoards, and the regional coin evidence from other hoards. It has already been shown that de Vaux's dating system of Qumran and the silver coin hoards was based on what is generally known as a circular argument; the end of the first major settlement period was dated after the assumed date of hiding of the coin hoards, which in turn dated the coin hoards themselves.\n\nNevertheless, Lönnqvist's theories have been criticized by Farhi and Price.<ref name=\"FarhiPrice2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Farhi|first1=Yoav|last2=Price|first2=Randall|title=The Numismatic Finds from the Qumran Plateau Excavations 2004‐2006, and 2008 Seasons|journal=Dead Sea Discoveries|volume=17|issue=2|year=2010|pages=210–225|url=http://archaeology.huji.ac.il/depart/classical/farhi/Farhi.QUMRAN_COINS.DSD_17,2_210-226.pdf|issn=0929-0761|doi=10.1163/156851710X503567}}</ref> They point to the fact that the identity of the silver coins from Qumran held at the [[Amman]] Museum in Jordan is not certain.\n\n===Population at Qumran===\n[[File:Qumran Caves.jpg|thumb|[[Qumran Caves]]]]\nOne important issue for the understanding of the site of Qumran is a realistic calculation of its population. Using estimates based on the size of the cemetery and average lifespan de Vaux calculated that the inhabitants \"would not have numbered many more than 200 members\".<ref>de Vaux 1973, p. 86.</ref> He noted that \"[t]here is a manifest disproportion between the number of tombs and the number of inhabitants for whom there was room in the buildings\".<ref>de Vaux 1973, p. 56.</ref> This led him to speculate whether the caves were used as lodgings for his estimated 200 inhabitants. [[Józef Milik|J.T. Milik]] some years earlier provided an estimate of between 150 and 200 as the average population, working on the comparison with the population of the monastery of Mar Saba, which numbered 150 monks in the 9th century and from Josephus' figure of 3,000 Essenes calculating that \"at least five per cent lived the strict monastic life\".<ref>Milik 1959, p. 97.</ref> E.M. Laperrousaz went as high as 1,428 inhabitants.<ref>Laperrousez, Qoumran, ''L'establissement essenien des bord de la Mer Morte: Histoire et archeologie'' (Paris: A.&J. Picard, 1976) 99–107.</ref> Magen Broshi, analyzing the size of L77 (which he calls an assembly hall), estimated that about 120 to 150 people could sit there, to which he added a few dozen candidates to the population, yielding over 170 people.<ref>M. Broshi 1992, p. 104.</ref>\n\nFrom 1983 to 1987 Joseph Patrich carried out archaeological surveys around Qumran and its caves. He concluded that the caves were \"stores and hiding places\". He found no traces of permanent tent dwellings and that any \"dwelling quarters should be sought inside the wall of Khirbet Qumran, mainly on the upper floor\". Patrich estimated that the population was only 50–70 people.<ref>Patrich 1994, pp. 93–94.</ref> Magen Broshi and Hanan Eshel, revisiting the caves and the territory around Qumran in 1995–1996, later pointed out that Patrich's estimate was far too high for what Qumran could offer, reducing the number to 12–20. They turned back to caves (mainly artificial ones cut into the marl terrace most of which have not survived) and tents (pointing to pottery and nails found along one of the paths near Qumran), and staying with 150–200 inhabitants.<ref>Broshi 1999, pp. 330–334.</ref> While waiting for the publication of Broshi and Eshel's results, Patrich, anticipating them, doubted the possibility that there were once \"significantly more habitable caves\" cut into the marl, pointing to the lack of paths and suitable terrain. He went on to discount the significance of the nails for tent dwelling without \"further substantial evidence and returned to a figure of \"a few tens of residents, fifty at most\".<ref>Patrich 2000, p. 726. Patrich's article actually appeared after the publication of Broshi and Eshel's paper, but was already in press when it appeared.</ref> Jodi Magness accepted Broshi's estimate, adding \"This number accords better than lower estimates with the presence of over 1000 dining dishes in the pantry (L86).\"<ref>Magness 2002, p. 70.</ref>\n\nWorking from ratios of populations in other ancient settlements, Yizhar Hirschfeld estimated the population of Qumran thus: \"If we use the lower value of fifteen people per dunam [1,000 m<sup>2</sup>], it emerges that in the Hasmonean period only about 20 people occupied the site of Qumran.<ref>Hirchfeld 2004, p. 65.</ref> Yitzhak Magen and Yuval Peleg entered the discussion commenting on how one could feed such large numbers of community members: \"Were we to accept the claim that the sect lived at Qumran for about 170 years, we would expect to find hundreds of cooking and baking ovens as well as thousands of cooking pots.\"<ref>Magen 2006, p. 99.</ref>\n\nThe population question is a complex issue, as can be seen by the above considerations. Much hinges on interpretation of two locations at Qumran—the ''refectory'' and the ''pantry''. The search for extramural dwelling quarters has failed to provide substantial evidence. Discounting Laperrousaz's apparently excessively high estimate, a number of proposals put the population in and around Qumran at between 20 and 200 people.\n\n==Qumran-Essene hypothesis==\n[[File:1QIsa b.jpg|thumb|220px|Dead Sea Scroll – part of Isaiah Scroll (Isa 57:17 – 59:9), 1QIsa<sup>b</sup>]]\nThere were not many serious challenges to de Vaux's interpretation of the site of Qumran as a settlement of Essenes from the time it was introduced. While the archaeologist [[Ernest-Marie Laperrousaz|E.-M. Laperrousaz]],<ref>Qoumrân l’établissement essénien des bords de la mer Morte : histoire et archéologie du site / E.-M. Laperrousaz. Paris : A.&J. Picard, 1976.</ref> had some quite divergent views, members of de Vaux's team followed approximately the same narrative, with minor deviations, members including [[Józef Milik|J. T. Milik]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and [[Frank Moore Cross|F. M. Cross]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. De Vaux's initial dig co-director, [[Gerald Lankester Harding|G. Lankester Harding]], wrote an article in 1955<ref>\"Where Christ Himself may Have Studied: An Essene Monastery at Khirbet Qumran\", ''Illustrated London News'' 227 September 3, 1955 pp. 379–81. De Vaux never wrote of Qumran as a \"monastery\" even though some claim he did.</ref> where he presented Qumran as, \"...a building in which [[John the Baptist]], and probably [[Christ]], studied: Khirbet Qumran\". Others outside de Vaux's team proposed other interpretations, people such as Henri del Medico,<ref>The riddle of the Scrolls. London, Burke [1958, trans, from French 1957].</ref> [[Solomon Zeitlin]],<ref>For an annotated bibliography of the most of the critiques, see Sidney B.

More recently, [[Lawrence H. Schiffman]] has defended the thesis that the Qumran documents indicate a [[Sadducean]] sectarian orientation, but while scholars commonly grant that the term \"Essenes\" probably included a diversity of groups, the sectarian Sadducean hypothesis remains a minority opinion.<ref>See footnote 1, above, for references.  A key point made by Schiffman is that in addition to the Sadducean orientation of the Qumran halakhot, or rulings, the texts indicate strong identification with the pro-Sadducean persecutions of the Pharisees by the Macccabean King Alexander Jannaeus, and similar pro-Sadducean political views regarding later Maccabean rulers.  Reviewing the evidence, including differences between the anciently reported traits of the Essenes and the beliefs and practices stipulated in the scrolls themselves, Michael Wise, Martin Abegg, Jr., and Edward Cook, in the \"Introduction\" to their translation, ''The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation'' (San Francisco: Hodder & Stoughton, 1996), p. 29, comment: \"The evidence suggests, then, that the scroll group resembled the Sadducees in some ways and the Essenes in others.  Yet there are major obstacles to identifying the group straightforwardly as one or the other.\"</ref> Simon J. Joseph agrees that the Qumran community was a part of the Essene movement, under the influence of the Enoch traditions, adding that they possessed a stronger focus towards eschatology and messianism.<ref name=\"Joseph2012\">{{cite book|author=Simon J.

He accepts that the site might have been originally established as a villa rustica, but that the site was abandoned and that it was reoccupied by Essenes in the late 1st century BCE. Humbert argues that the site may also have been used a place where sectarian pilgrims—barred from entering Jerusalem—may have celebrated the pilgrimage.<ref>Humbert, Jean-Baptiste, \"L’espace sacré à Qumrân.

From this, they argued that the settlement and cemetery are connected to the Dead Sea Scrolls and associated with an Essene-type group, which finds the closest parallels in the contemporary Jewish Therapeutic group known to have lived in Egypt.<ref>Lönnqvist M.& Lönnqvist K.(2002) \"Archaeology of the Hidden Qumran, The New Paradigm\" Helsinki: Helsinki University Press.</ref>\n\n[[Robert Cargill]] argues that the theory suggesting Qumran was established as a [[Hasmonean]] fortress is not incompatible with the theory proposing that a group of Jewish sectarians reoccupied the site. Cargill suggests that Qumran was established as a Hasmonean fort (see below, \"Qumran as fortress\"), abandoned, and later reoccupied by Jewish settlers, who expanded the site in a communal, non-military fashion, and who were responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n<ref>Cargill, Robert R., ''Qumran through (Real) Time: A Virtual Reconstruction of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls'', Bible in Technology 1, Piscataway, New Jersey: [[Gorgias Press]], 2009.</ref><ref>Cargill, Robert R., \"The Qumran Digital Model: An Argument for Archaeological Reconstruction in Virtual Reality and Response to Jodi Magness\", ''Near Eastern Archaeology'' 72/1 (2009): 28–47.</ref>\n\nSome who challenged de Vaux's findings took issue with the practice of using the Dead Sea Scrolls to interpret the archaeological remains at Qumran. They argued that these remains should be interpreted independently, without any influence from the Dead Sea Scrolls. Various reinterpretations have led to various conclusions about the site. These include:\n\n===Qumran as fortress===\nThe overlooked [[Qumran#Early site analysis|early suggestion]] that Qumran was a fortress was given new life by the analysis of Pessach Bar-Adon. Using de Vaux's Period 1a findings, his own excavations at Ain el-Ghuweir 15&nbsp;km south of Qumran, and [[Benjamin Mazar|Mazar]]'s level 2 at '[[En-Gedi]], Bar-Adon argued, \"these fortresses [belonged] to John Hyrcanus, who needed a strong, comprehensive defence system commanding vital water sources, agricultural fields, flocks, Jordan River crossings, the plains of Jericho and the caravan routes in the Judean desert. He turned the Qumran-Ain Feshka oasis, like the one at En-Gedi, into crown property and incorporated his tenants into his strategic plans.\"<ref>Bar-Adon 1981. English summary, p. 86.</ref>\n\n[[Norman Golb]] took up the notion that the Qumran settlement was established as a fortress and argued—against the prevailing views of the time—that not only was Qumran not established as a sectarian residence, but that there were no sectarians at the site at all. Like Rengstorf he proposed that the Scrolls had been produced in Jerusalem, but unlike Rengstorf, Golb argues that the scrolls came from different libraries throughout Jerusalem and were hidden in the caves by Jews fleeing the Romans during a political uprising.<ref>Golb, Norman, ''Who Wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls?: The Search for the Secret of Qumran'', New York: Scribner, 1995.</ref>\n\n===Qumran as villa===\n[[Robert Donceel]] and [[Pauline Donceel-Voûte]] focused their research on the small finds amongst de Vaux's unpublished materials from Qumran, including, but not limited to, glassware (55 newly catalogued items), stoneware (53 new items), metal wares, and coins. Contrary to the belief that the inhabitants of the site were poor monastics, Donceel and Donceel-Voûte suggest that the residents were actually wealthy traders, with connections to the upper class and wealthy in nearby Jerusalem. They ultimately suggest that Qumran was a ''[[villa rustica]]'', or wealthy manor house that may have been a winter or year-round second home to some wealthy family from Jerusalem.<ref>Donceel, Robert and Pauline H.

Magness reported that from what she saw of the pottery in the Rockefeller Museum that \"there was very, very little in the way of fine wares\".

Citing his work at ‘[[Ein Feshkha]] as a comparison, he suggested that the site at Qumran ultimately became an agriculturally-based, fortified trading station during the Herodian era.<ref>Hirschfeld, Yizhar, \"Early Roman Manor Houses in Judea and the Site of Khirbet Qumran\", ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' 57/3 (1998): 161–89.</ref><ref>Hirschfeld, Yizhar, ''Qumran in Context: Reassessing the Archaeological Evidence'', Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson, 2004.</ref>\n\n[[Yizhak Magen]] and [[Yuval Peleg]] have focused their 10-year excavation at Qumran upon the vast water system at Qumran. They accept that the site was originally a \"forward field fort\", but argue that the site was repurposed as a pottery production plant, and that the water system was actually used to bring the clay-laced water into the site for the purpose of pottery production.<ref>Magen, Yizhak and Yuval Peleg, ''The Qumran Excavations 1993–2004: Preliminary Report'', Judea & Samaria Publications 6, Jerusalem: Israel Antiquities Authority, 2007, p. 29.

(Samples of that clay have now been analysed, and they do not match tested Qumran pottery. \"This information goes straight against\" the Magen Peleg proposal, according to scientists J.

Zangenberg, Leiden: Brill, 2006.</ref>\n\n[[David Stacey]] argues that the settlement at Qumran is associated with the estate at Jericho. Due to the scarcity of year-round water at Qumran, he suggests that the site served as a seasonal tannery and pottery production facility.<ref>Stacey, David, \"Some Archaeological Observations on the Aqueducts of Qumran\", ''Dead Sea Discoveries'' 14/2 (2007): 222–43.\n</ref>\n\n===Other issues===\nRecent scientific evidence published by Ira Rabin, Oliver Hahn, Timo Wolff, Admir Masic, and Gisela Weinberg demonstrates that the ink from The Thanksgiving Scroll uses water taken from the Dead Sea and vicinity thereby demonstrating a link between the Dead Sea region and at least some of the scrolls.<ref>Rabin 2009, 97–106.</ref>\n\nPaleographer Ada Yardeni<ref>Yardeni, Ada, \"A Note on a Qumran Scribe.\" In ''New Seals and Inscriptions: Hebrew, Idumean, and Cuneiform'', ed.

Looking east from the Qumran gorge, the small structure on the upper left amid the trees contains the modern Qumran visitor's center. The ruins of Qumran can be seen immediately to the right. The settlement was built close to the seaward side of a plateau. The Dead Sea forms a hazy backdrop. To the extreme right is the Wadi Qumran, a torrent that is dry most of the year. On the few occasions when it rains, though, it becomes a ravaging torrent that has eroded the side of the plateau where Qumran is. From the mid-left the remains of an aqueduct run down to the settlement. This channel helped furnish Qumran with a valuable supply of water. At the end of the outcrop in the center of the picture is Cave 4, which supplied the vast bulk of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n|-\n|[[File:Qumran.jpeg|thumb|240px|Classic view of Cave 4.]]\n| valign=\"top\" | \n2. This is another view of Wadi Qumran taken from the esplanade abutting the southern side of the Qumran settlement. Cave 4 can clearly be seen. It is an artificial cave cut into the cliff face by humans. Several hundred scrolls were found in the cave. It was found and opened up in the 20th century by a local bedouin who had been searching for scrolls. Behind the cave on the cliffs the upper course of Wadi Qumran can be seen as it cuts its way down toward the wadi floor.\n|-\n|[[File:Khirbet Qumrān 2.jpg|thumb|240px|A first view of Qumran.]]\n| valign=\"top\" | \n3. Coming up from the visitor's center one comes to the corner of the tower. What we see to the left is mainly the buttressing for the tower. This marks the north-western corner of the main building. Ahead, is a modern walkway that lets visitors to walk through the site and see some of the complexities of the water system. Behind the walkway on the right is the aqueduct that brought rainwater down into the site. The Qumran gorge is in the central distance.\n|-\n|[[File:Qumran citerne locus 110.jpg|thumb|240px|The area between the two buildings.]]\n| valign=\"top\" | \n4. This photo was taken from the walkway. The southern end of the main building can be seen at the top left. The main channel snakes its way through the settlement—here around the round cistern before bending south eastwards. This round cistern was originally constructed during the Iron Age, making it one of the oldest structures at Qumran. Note also the arch cut into the stone on the central left: this fed water down into a stepped cistern (L117) behind it. The canopy in the distance is where photo #2 was taken.\n|-\n|[[File:Palestine Qumran BW 4.jpg|thumb|240px|Looking west over the water system toward the cliffs.]]\n| valign=\"top\" | \n5. Looking down from the tower westward is a worker's installation that may have been the bottom of a kiln (or some other structure that was heated from beneath). To its left, a flat area marks the entry point for a stepped cistern (L117), which is farther left. (The steps can just be made out as they descend leftwards.) The main water channel is before the walkway. Behind the walkway are ruins of the western building. Farther behind is the aqueduct that brought rainwater down to the settlement.\n|-\n|[[File:Qumran L30 scriptorium.jpg|thumb|240px|The so-called \"scriptorium\". (L30)]]\n| valign=\"top\" | \n6. Looking from the tower southward one sees a long narrow room built against the inner wall of the western wing of the main settlement. Here, de Vaux discovered two inkwells and plastered elements he interpreted as benches or tables for writing. The largest surface, upon being reconstructed, measured 5 meters in length, 40 centimeters in breadth and only 50 centimeters in height.<ref>de Vaux 1973, p. 29.</ref> These benches (or tables) had fallen through the floor above when the ceiling collapsed. De Vaux referred to this room above as the \"scriptorium\" and concluded the Dead Sea Scrolls could have been written here, but not all scholars agree with this interpretation. Nearly all scholars, however, conclude that some form of writing took place here on the upper floor of Locus 30. Several [[ostracon|ostraca]], including a practice alphabet, have been found in and around the site.<ref>Lemaire 2003 catalogues a number of ostraca. Magen 2006 (p. 72) refers to ten more.</ref>\n|-\n|[[File:Palestine Qumran BW 5.jpg|thumb|240px|A stepped cistern. (L56/58)]]\n| valign=\"top\" | \n7. Looking east toward the Dead Sea: this stepped pool is located immediately south of the main building but within the main southern wall. It was originally one long pool before an internal wall separated it into two, making the western half (L56) like most other stepped pools on the site. The eastern side (L58) was excavated and a much deeper storage cistern was created. The original pool took fullest advantage of the sloping location, requiring only minimal excavating for the capacity. This pool came into existence some time after the Qumran water system was raised. This raising let water be carried farther, and opened up the possibility for a much bigger storage capacity on the site. The southern end of the main building can be seen to the left. Between it and the wall of the pool, is a channel that carried water to farther stepped pools, L48/49 and L71.\n|-\n|[[File:Qumran refectoire locus 77.jpg|thumb|240px|Long room to the south of the main building. (L77)]]\n| valign=\"top\" | \n8. Looking south-east one sees a long narrow room built against the main southern wall of the settlement on the left. (This location is south of #7.) The far end once featured pillars, which gave de Vaux the idea there was a second storey—though no traces were found of such a storey. De Vaux considered this room a ''refectory'', because an adjacent room, commonly referred to as a ''pantry'', contained over a thousand pieces of pottery. This pottery was thought by de Vaux to have been used for communal meals, though some have challenged this interpretation. In fact the size and layout strongly suggest this was some kind of drying floor for the production of clay from the adjoining evaporation cisterns. That it lines up with the summer solstice supports this theory.\n|-\n|[[File:Qumran Locus 86.jpg|thumb|240px|The room with the 1000 ceramic items. (L86/89)]]\n| valign=\"top\" | \n9. To the right (south) of #8. This location is commonly known as the \"pantry\". At the southern end of this room 708 bowls, 204 plates, 75 goblets, 37 terrines, 21 jars, 11 jugs, and other ceramic items were found by de Vaux, mostly neatly stacked. De Vaux believed that this crockery was used for meals in L.77, which he referred to as the \"refectory\". The southern end of the room had been walled off. The effects of an earthquake may be indicated by the fact that this wall later collapsed over the pottery, crushing it, and that the southern walls had to be strengthened externally. During the last period at Qumran, a water channel was rerouted to pass immediately south of the northern wall. Then, following the outer wall of L.77, it eventually supplied the large cistern (L.71). Another interesting find from the location was a bowl inscribed with the name \"Eleazar\". Note the remains of two pilasters. Their purpose is unknown, but they do not seem to have been load-bearing.\n|-\n|[[File:Qumran miqveh est locus 48.jpg|thumb|240px|The broken cistern. (L48/49)]]\n| valign=\"top\" | \n10. One of the most interesting discoveries at Qumran was the unearthing on the eastern side of the main building of this stepped cistern featuring a crack down the steps marking where the land dropped, apparently due to an earthquake. A channel farther to the south fed the largest of the Qumran cisterns, which was broken at the same time by the same means. As that cistern was used in a late phase of the site, we can surmise that the cistern we see was also damaged then. Also of interest are the dividers that run down the steps. Some scholars have suggested that these served as partitions separating those entering the pool from those exiting, similar to ''[[Mikvah|miqva'ot]]'' (Jewish ritual baths) found near Jerusalem,<ref>Reich, Ronny, \"Miqwa'ot at Khirbet Qumran and the Jerusalem Connection.\" pp. 728–731 in ''The Dead Sea Scrolls: Fifty Years After Their Discovery''. Edited by Lawrence H. Schiffman, Emanuel Tov, James C. VanderKam, and Galen Marquis. Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 2000.</ref> but not all scholars accept this interpretation. (Katharina Galor, who carried out the most complete analysis thus far of the Qumran water system, commented, \"[f]rom a practical point of view, the interpretation of using the low divisions as a symbolic space divider does not make any sense\".)<ref>Galor 2003, p. 304b.</ref> The partitions may have served to aid in channeling water into the pool.\n|-\n|[[File:Qumran L-71 pool.jpg|thumb|240px|The Locus 71 pool.]]\n| valign=\"top\" | \n11. Looking south one sees a long narrow pool dug into the southeast corner of the settlement. This is the last and largest pool in the water system at Qumran. This enormous structure could hold 300 cubic meters of water, more than all the other stepped pools combined.<ref>See Galor 2003 for capacities.</ref> During Period III, (i.e., after the Jewish War), a water channel was partially rerouted to remedy prior destruction and continue to fill this pool. Scholars debate whether it was a ''miqvah'' (Jewish ritual bath), a cistern, or a clay collection vat.\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ancient Qumran: A Virtual Reality Tour]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* '''Bar-Adon''', Pessah, \"The Hasmonean Fortresses and the Status of Khirbet Qumran\", ''Eretz Israel'' 15 (1981): 349–52.\n* '''Bar-Nathan''', Rachel, \"Qumran and the Hasmonaean and Herodian Winter Palaces of Jericho\", in ''The Site of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Archaeological Interpretations and Debates'', (Studies on the Texts of the Desert of Judah, Vol. 57), ed. by Katharina Galor, Jean-Baptiste Humbert, and Jurgen Zangenberg, (Leiden: Brill, 2006), 263–277.\n* '''Boccaccini''', Gabriele, ''Beyond the Essene Hypothesis: The Parting of Ways between Qumran and Enochic Judaism'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998).\n* '''Broshi''', Magen, \"The Archaeology of Qumran: A Reconsideration\", in ''The Dead Sea Scrolls: Forty Years of Research'', D.
