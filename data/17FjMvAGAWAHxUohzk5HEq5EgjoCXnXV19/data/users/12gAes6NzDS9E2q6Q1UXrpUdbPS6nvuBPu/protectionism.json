Proponents claim that protectionist policies shield the producers, businesses, and workers of the [[Import substitution industrialization|import-competing sector]] in the country from foreign competitors. However, they also reduce [[trade]] and adversely affect consumers in general (by raising the cost of imported goods), and harm the producers and workers in export sectors, both in the country implementing protectionist policies, and in the countries protected against.\n\nThere is a consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fairbrother|first=Malcolm|date=2014-03-01|title=Economists, Capitalists, and the Making of Globalization: North American Free Trade in Comparative-Historical Perspective|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/675410|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=119|issue=5|pages=1324–1379|doi=10.1086/675410|issn=0002-9602}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes.com\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://piie.com/newsroom/short-videos/why-after-200-years-cant-economists-sell-free-trade|title=Economic Consensus On Free Trade|last=|first=|date=2017-05-25|work=PIIE|access-date=2018-02-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2004/09/01/free-trade-why-are-economists-and-noneconomists-so-far-apart/|title=Free Trade: Why Are Economists and Noneconomists So Far Apart?|last=Poole|first=William|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}</ref> while [[free trade]], [[deregulation]], and the reduction of [[trade barrier]]s has a positive effect on [[economic growth]].<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">[[N.

Tariff rates usually vary according to the type of goods imported. Import tariffs will increase the cost to importers, and increase the price of imported goods in the local markets, thus lowering the quantity of goods imported, to favour local producers.  Tariffs may also be imposed on exports, and in an economy with [[floating exchange rate]]s, export tariffs have similar effects as import tariffs. However, since export tariffs are often perceived as \"hurting\" local industries, while import tariffs are perceived as \"helping\" local industries, export tariffs are seldom implemented.\n* [[Import quota]]s: To reduce the quantity and therefore increase the market price of imported goods. The economic effects of an import quota is similar to that of a tariff, except that the tax revenue gain from a tariff will instead be distributed to those who receive import licenses. Economists often suggest that import licenses be auctioned to the highest bidder, or that import quotas be replaced by an equivalent tariff.\n* Administrative barriers: Countries are sometimes accused of using their various administrative rules (e.g. regarding [[food safety]], environmental standards, electrical safety, etc.) as a way to introduce barriers to imports. \n* [[International commercial law#Anti-dumping measures|Anti-dumping legislation]]: \"[[Dumping (pricing policy)|Dumping]]\" is the practice of firms selling to export markets at lower prices than are charged in domestic markets.  Supporters of anti-dumping laws argue that they prevent import of cheaper foreign goods that would cause local firms to close down. However, in practice, anti-dumping laws are usually used to impose trade tariffs on foreign exporters.\n* Direct [[Subsidy|subsidies]]:  Government subsidies (in the form of lump-sum payments or cheap loans) are sometimes given to local firms that cannot compete well against imports. These subsidies are purported to \"protect\" local jobs, and to help local firms adjust to the world markets.\n* Export [[Subsidy|subsidies]]:  Export subsidies are often used by governments to increase exports. Export subsidies have the opposite effect of export tariffs because exporters get payment, which is a percentage or proportion of the value of exported. Export subsidies increase the amount of trade, and in a country with floating exchange rates, have effects similar to import subsidies.\n* [[Exchange rate]] control: A government may [[currency intervention|intervene in the foreign exchange market]] to lower the value of its currency by selling its currency in the foreign exchange market. Doing so will raise the cost of imports and lower the cost of exports, leading to an improvement in its [[trade balance]]. However, such a policy is only effective in the short run, as it will lead to higher [[inflation]] in the country in the long run, which will in turn raise the real cost of exports, and reduce the relative price of imports.\n* International [[patent]] systems: There is an argument for viewing national patent systems as a cloak for protectionist trade policies at a national level. Two strands of this argument exist: one  when patents held by one country form part of a system of exploitable relative advantage in trade negotiations against another, and a second where adhering to a worldwide system of patents confers \"good citizenship\" status despite 'de facto protectionism'. [[Peter Drahos]] explains that \"States realized that patent systems could be used to cloak protectionist strategies. There were also reputational advantages for states to be seen to be sticking to intellectual property systems. One could attend the various revisions of the Paris and [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne conventions]], participate in the cosmopolitan moral dialogue about the need to protect the fruits of authorial labor and inventive genius...knowing all the while that one's domestic intellectual property system was a handy protectionist weapon.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Information Feudalism: Who Owns the Knowledge Economy?|year=2002|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|isbn=9781853839177|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pkl7HNzhXgoC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA36#v=onepage&q=%22States%20realized%20that%22&f=false|author=Peter Drahos|author2=John Braithwaite}}</ref>\n* Political campaigns advocating domestic consumption (e.g. the \"Buy American\" campaign in the United States, which could be seen as an extra-legal promotion of protectionism.)\n* Preferential governmental spending, such as the [[Buy American Act]], federal legislation which called upon the United States government to prefer US-made products in its purchases.\n\nIn the modern trade arena many other initiatives besides tariffs have been called protectionist.  For example, some commentators, such as [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], see developed countries efforts in imposing their own labor or environmental standards as protectionism. Also, the imposition of restrictive certification procedures on imports are seen in this light.\n\nFurther, others point out that free trade agreements often have protectionist provisions such as intellectual property, [[copyright]], and patent restrictions that benefit large corporations.  These provisions restrict trade in music, movies, pharmaceuticals, software, and other manufactured items to high cost producers with quotas from low cost producers set to zero.<ref>[http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/econ/2003/0714rta.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017061845/http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/econ/2003/0714rta.htm|date=October 17, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tariff Rates in Japan (1870-1960).gif|thumb|Tariff Rates in Japan (1870–1960)]]\n[[File:Tariff Rates in Spain and Italy (1860-1910).gif|thumb|Tariff Rates in Spain and Italy (1860–1910)]]\nHistorically, protectionism was associated with economic theories such as [[mercantilism]] (which focused on achieving positive [[trade balance]] and accumulating gold), and [[import substitution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn the 18th century, [[Adam Smith]] famously warned against the \"interested sophistry\" of industry, seeking to gain advantage at the cost of the consumers.<ref name=\"FreeToChoose\">[[Free to Choose]], Milton Friedman</ref> [[Friedrich List]] saw Adam Smith's views on [[free trade]] as disingenuous, believing that Smith advocated for freer trade so that British industry could lock out underdeveloped foreign competition.<ref>''The National System of Political Economy'', by Friedrich List, 1841, translated by Sampson S.

In the decades after World War II, Japan’s rapid rise led to trade friction with other countries. Japan’s recovery was accompanied by a sharp increase in its exports of certain product categories: cotton textiles in the 1950s, steel in the 1960s, automobiles in the 1970s, and electronics in the 1980s. In each case, the rapid expansion in Japan’s exports created difficulties for its trading partners and the use of protectionism as a shock absorber.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAccording to some political theorists, protectionism is advocated mainly by parties that hold [[Far-left politics|far-left]] or [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] economic positions, while economically [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] political parties generally support [[free trade]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=State Aid for Newspapers: Theories, Cases, Actions|last=Murschetz|first=Paul|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=2013|isbn=978-3642356902|location=|pages=64|quote=Parties of the left in government in adopt protectionist policies for ideological reasons and because they wish to save worker jobs.

A boom would generate enough revenue for tariffs to fall, and when the bust came pressure would build to raise them again. By the time that happened, the economy would be recovering, giving the impression that tariff cuts caused the crash and the reverse generated the recovery. 'Mr Irwin' also attempts to debunk the idea that protectionism made America a great industrial power, a notion believed by some to offer lessons for developing countries today. As its share of global manufacturing powered from 23% in 1870 to 36% in 1913, the admittedly high tariffs of the time came with a cost, estimated at around 0.5% of GDP in the mid-1870s. In some industries, they might have sped up development by a few years. But American growth during its protectionist period was more to do with its abundant resources and openness to people and ideas.</blockquote>According to Paul Bairoch, the United States was \"the mother country and bastion of modern protectionism\" since the end of the 18th century and until the post-World War II period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ips-dc.org/kicking_away_the_ladder_the_real_history_of_free_trade/|title=Kicking Away the Ladder: The \"Real\" History of Free Trade|last1=Chang|first1=Ha-Joon|last2=Gershman|first2=John|website=ips-dc.org|publisher=Institute for Policy Studies|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Bush administration implemented [[2002 United States steel tariff|tariffs on Chinese steel in 2002]];
