(corporation)|company]], owned by Finnish company [[Nokia]]. Its headquarters are located in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey|Murray Hill]], [[New Jersey]], in addition to other laboratories around the rest of the United States and in other countries.\n\nThe historic laboratory originated as the Western Electric Engineering department in the late 19th century, located at [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|463 West Street]], NYC. In 1925, after years of conducting research and development under [[Western Electric]], [[AT&T|American Telephone & Telegraph Company]] (AT&T Corporation), Western Electric divided ownership of the newly formed Bell Telephone Laboratories.\n\nResearchers working at Bell Labs are credited with the development of [[radio astronomy]], the [[transistor]], the [[laser]], the [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD), [[information theory]], the [[Unix]] operating system, and the programming languages [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[S (programming language)|S]]. Eight [[Nobel Prize]]s have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories.\n\n==Origin and historical locations==\n\n=== Bell's personal research after the telephone ===\nIn 1880, the [[France|French government]] awarded [[Alexander Graham Bell]] the [[Volta Prize]] of 50,000 [[French franc|francs]], approximately US$10,000 at that time (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1879|r=-4}}}} in current dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}) for the [[invention of the telephone]]. Bell used the award to fund the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] (''Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory'') in  [[Washington, D.C.]], in collaboration with [[Charles Sumner Tainter|Sumner Tainter]] and Bell's cousin [[Chichester Bell]].<ref name=\"Bruce1990\">Bruce, Robert V.

[[Alexander Graham Bell]], Thomas Sanders, and Gardiner Hubbard formed the Bell Patent Association when filing the first patents for the telephone in 1876. A year later, the first telephone company was formed as Bell Telephone Company and later became a part of the American Bell Telephone Company. By 1889, its own subsidiary company, [[American Telephone & Telegraph Company]] (AT&T) took control of American Bell and the Bell System. American Bell held a controlling interest in Western Electric which was the manufacturing arm of the business whereas AT&T was doing research into the service providers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Telephone Enterprise|last=Garnet|first=Robert|publisher=The John's Hopkins University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=1–44}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bell-labs.com/about/history-bell-labs/|title=Nokia Bell Labs History|last=|first=|date=20 July 2018|website=Nokia Bell Labs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1884, the [[American Bell Telephone Company]] created the Mechanical Department from the Electrical and [[Patent]] Department formed a year earlier.\n\n===Formal organization and location changes===\n[[File:Bell Laboratories West Street.jpg|alt=463 West Street New York Bell Labs|thumb|The original home of Bell Laboratories beginning in 1925, 463 West Street, New York.]]\nIn 1896, Western Electric bought property at [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|463 West Street]] to station their manufacturers and engineers who had been supplying AT&T with their product. This included everything from [[telephone]]s, [[telephone exchange]] switches, and transmission equipment. In 1925, Bell Laboratories was developed to better consolidate the research activities of the Bell System. Ownership was evenly split between [[Western Electric]] and [[AT&T]] and throughout the next decade, the [[AT&T]] Research and Development branch moved into West Street. Bell Labs also carried out consulting work for the [[Bell Telephone Company]], U.S. government work, and a few workers were assigned to basic research. The first president of research at Bell Labs was [[Frank B. Jewett]] who stayed there until 1940.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Donofrio|first=Angelo|date=May–June 1966|title=West Street Story|url=|journal=Bell Labs Reporter|volume=15|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Idea Factory|last=Gertner|first=Jon|publisher=The Penguin Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Manufacturing the Future|last=Adams, Butler|first=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1940s, Bell Labs engineers and scientists had begun to move to other locations away from the congestion and environmental distractions of New York City, and in 1967 Bell Laboratories headquarters was officially relocated to [[Murray Hill, New Jersey|Murray Hill,]] New Jersey. Among the later Bell Laboratories locations in New Jersey were [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey|Holmdel]], [[Crawford Hill]], the [[Deal Test Site]], [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold]], [[Lincroft, New Jersey|Lincroft]], [[Long Branch, New Jersey|Long Branch]], [[Middletown Township, New Jersey|Middletown]], [[Neptune Township, New Jersey|Neptune]], [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[Piscataway, New Jersey|Piscataway]], [[Red Bank, New Jersey|Red Bank]], [[Chester Township, New Jersey|Chester]], and [[Whippany, New Jersey|Whippany]].

The mirrored-glass building was designed by [[Eero Saarinen]].  In August 2013, Somerset Development bought the building, intending to redevelop it into a mixed commercial and residential project. The prospects of success are clouded by the difficulty of readapting Saarinen's design and by the current glut of aging and abandoned office parks.<ref>{{cite news|title=Future takes shape for Bell Labs site|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/realestate/commercial/future-takes-shape-for-bell-labs-site.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0&gwh=5E7B08AA3F6C8953AB163DA6FD824D78|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Discoveries and developments==\n[[File:Bell Laboratories logo.svg|thumb|right|Bell Laboratories logo, used from 1969 until 1983]]\n\nAt its peak, Bell Laboratories was the premier facility of its type, developing a wide range of revolutionary technologies, including [[radio astronomy]], the [[transistor]], the [[laser]], [[information theory]], the operating system [[Unix]], the programming languages [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]].

Shewhart]] proposed the [[control chart]] as a method to determine when a process was in a state of statistical control. Shewhart's methods were the basis for [[statistical process control]] (SPC): the use of statistically based tools and techniques to manage and improve processes. This was the origin of the modern quality movement, including [[Six Sigma]].\n\nIn 1927, a Bell team headed by [[Herbert E. Ives]] successfully transmitted long-distance 128-line [[television]] images of [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]] from Washington to New York. In 1928 the [[thermal noise]] in a resistor was first measured by [[John Bertrand Johnson|John B. Johnson]], and [[Harry Nyquist]] provided the theoretical analysis; this is now termed ''Johnson noise''. During the 1920s, the [[one-time pad]] [[cipher]] was invented by [[Gilbert Vernam]] and [[Joseph Mauborgne]] at the laboratories. Bell Labs' [[Claude Shannon]] later proved that it is unbreakable.\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:Green Banks - Jansky Antena.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the directional antenna used in the discovery of radio emission of extraterrestrial origin by [[Karl Guthe Jansky]] at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in 1932]]\n\nIn 1931, a foundation for [[radio astronomy]] was laid by [[Karl Jansky]] during his work investigating the origins of static on long-distance [[Shortwave bands|shortwave communications]]. He discovered that [[radio]] waves were being emitted from the center of the [[galaxy]]. In 1931 and 1932, experimental high fidelity, long playing, and even stereophonic recordings were made by the labs of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]].<ref>[http://www.stokowski.org/Harvey%20Fletcher%20Bell%20Labs%20Recordings.htm Leopold Stokowski, Harvey Fletcher, and the Bell Laboratories Experimental Recordings], Stokowski.org.

Bell researcher [[Clinton Davisson]] shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with [[George Paget Thomson]] for the discovery of [[electron diffraction]], which helped lay the foundation for [[solid-state electronics]].\n\n===1940s===\n[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|left|The first [[transistor]], a [[point-contact transistor|point-contact]] [[germanium]] device, was invented at Bell Laboratories in 1947.

In 1943, Bell developed [[SIGSALY]], the first digital scrambled speech transmission system, used by the Allies in World War II. The British wartime codebreaker [[Alan Turing]] visited the labs at this time, working on speech encryption and meeting [[Claude Shannon]].<ref>{{cite book| authorlink1=Jack Copeland | first1=Jack | last1=Copeland | authorlink2=Jonathan Bowen | first2=Jonathan | last2=Bowen | chapter=Chapter 1: Life and work & Chapter 18: Delilah—encrypting speech | title=The Turing Guide | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2017 | isbn=978-0198747833 | title-link=The Turing Guide }}</ref>\n\nBell Labs Quality Assurance Department gave the world and the United States such statisticians as [[Walter A. Shewhart]], [[W. Edwards Deming]], [[Harold F. Dodge]], [[George D. Edwards]], Harry Romig, R. L. Jones, Paul Olmstead, E.G.D. Paterson, and [[Mary N. Torrey]]. During World War II, Emergency Technical Committee – Quality Control, drawn mainly from Bell Labs' statisticians, was instrumental in advancing Army and Navy ammunition acceptance and material sampling procedures.\n\nIn 1947, the [[transistor]], probably the most important invention developed by Bell Laboratories, was invented by [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]], and [[William Shockley|William Bradford Shockley]] (and who subsequently shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956). In 1947, [[Richard Hamming]] invented [[Hamming code]]s for [[error detection and correction]]. For patent reasons, the result was not published until 1950. In 1948, \"[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]\", one of the founding works in [[information theory]], was published by [[Claude Shannon]] in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''. It built in part on earlier work in the field by Bell researchers [[Harry Nyquist]] and [[Ralph Hartley]], but it greatly extended these. Bell Labs also introduced a series of increasingly complex calculators through the decade. Shannon was also the founder of [[History of cryptography|modern cryptography]] with his 1949 paper ''[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]''.\n\n====Calculators====\n<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-10-01|title=George Stibitz|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stibitz#Other|journal=Wikipedia|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Irvine|first=M.

The central development was binary code systems. Efforts concentrated more precisely on the Laboratories' prime mission of supporting the Bell System with engineering advances including N-carrier, TD [[Microwave radio relay]], [[Direct Distance Dialing]], E-[[repeaters]], [[Wire spring relay]]s, and [[5XB switch|improved switching]] systems. Maurice Karnaugh, in 1953, developed the [[Karnaugh map]] as a tool to facilitate management of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebraic]] expressions. In 1954, the first modern [[solar cell]] was invented at Bell Laboratories. As for the spectacular side of the business, in 1956 [[TAT-1]], the first [[transatlantic telephone cable]] was laid between Scotland and Newfoundland, in a joint effort by AT&T, Bell Laboratories, and British and Canadian telephone companies.<!-- What was Bell Labs' involvement in that?--> A year later, in 1957, [[MUSIC-N|MUSIC]], one of the first computer programs to play [[electronic music]], was created by [[Max Mathews]].

Also in 1960, [[Dawon Kahng]] and [[Martin Atalla]] invented the metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor ([[MOSFET]]); the MOSFET has achieved electronic hegemony and sustains the [[Large-scale integration|large-scale integrated circuits]] (LSIs) underlying today's information society. In 1962, the [[electret microphone]] was invented by [[Gerhard Sessler|Gerhard M. Sessler]] and [[James Edward Maceo West]]. Also in 1962, [[John R. Pierce]]'s vision of [[communications satellite]]s was realized by the launch of [[Telstar]]. In 1964, the [[Carbon dioxide laser]] was invented by [[Kumar Patel]]. In 1965, Penzias and Wilson discovered the [[cosmic microwave background]], for which they were awarded the [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/ Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978]. Frank W. Sinden, Edward E. Zajac, Kenneth C. Knowlton, and A. Michael Noll made computer-animated movies during the early to mid-1960s. Ken C. Knowlton invented the computer animation language [[BEFLIX]]. The first digital computer art was created in 1962 by Noll. In 1966, [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM), a key technology in wireless services, was developed and patented by R. W. Chang. In 1968, [[Molecular beam epitaxy]] was developed by [[J.R. Arthur]] and [[A.Y. Cho]]; molecular beam epitaxy allows semiconductor chips and laser matrices to be manufactured one atomic layer at a time. In 1969, [[Dennis Ritchie]] and [[Ken Thompson]] created the computer operating system [[UNIX]] for the support of telecommunication switching systems as well as general purpose computing. From 1969 to 1971, [[Aaron Marcus]], the first graphic designer involved with computer graphics, researched, designed, and programmed a prototype interactive page-layout system for the Picturephone. In 1969, the [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) was invented by [[Willard Boyle]] and [[George E. Smith]], for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009. In the 1960s, the [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|New York City site]] was sold and became the [[Westbeth Artists Community]] complex.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:The C Programming Language logo.svg|left|thumb|125px|The C programming language was developed in 1972.]]\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw more and more computer-related inventions at the Bell Laboratories as part of the [[personal computing]] revolution. In 1972, [[Dennis Ritchie]] developed the compiled programming language [[C (programming language)|C]] as a replacement for the interpreted language [[B (programming language)|B]] which was then used in a [[worse is better]] rewrite of UNIX.  Also, the language [[AWK]] was designed and implemented by [[Alfred Aho]], [[Peter Weinberger]], and [[Brian Kernighan]] of Bell Laboratories.\n\nIn 1970, [[A. Michael Noll]] invented a tactile, force-feedback system, coupled with interactive stereoscopic computer display. In 1971, an improved task priority system for computerized [[telephone exchange]] switching systems for telephone traffic was invented by [[Erna Schneider Hoover]], who received one of the first [[software patent]]s for it. In 1976, [[Optical fiber]] systems were first tested in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and in 1980, the first single-chip [[32-bit]] [[microprocessor]], the [[Bellmac 32]]A was demonstrated. It went into production in 1982.\n\nThe 1970s also saw a major central office technology evolve from crossbar electromechanical relay-based technology and discrete transistor logic to Bell Labs-developed thick film hybrid and [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL), stored program-controlled switching systems; [[1ESS switch|1A]]/[[4ESS switch|#4 TOLL]] Electronic Switching Systems (ESS) and 2A Local Central Offices produced at the Bell Labs Naperville and Western Electric Lisle, Illinois facilities. This technology evolution dramatically reduced floor space needs. The new ESS also came with its own diagnostic software that needed only a switchman and several frame technicians to maintain. The technology was often touted in the Bell Labs Technical Journals and Western Electric magazine (WE People).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}<!-- Fact tag for the whole paragraph -->\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:Bell Labs logo, 1984-1995.png|frame|Bell Laboratories logo, used from 1984 until 1995]]\n\nIn 1980, the [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] and [[CDMA]] digital cellular telephone technology was patented. In 1982, [[Fractional quantum Hall effect]] was discovered by [[Horst Ludwig Störmer|Horst Störmer]] and former Bell Laboratories researchers [[Robert B. Laughlin]] and [[Daniel C.

This type of antenna became an important component in [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]]. In 1984, [[Karmarkar's algorithm]] for linear programming was developed by mathematician [[Narendra Karmarkar]]. Also in 1984, [[Modification of Final Judgment|a divestiture agreement]] signed in 1982 with the American Federal government forced the break-up of AT&T: [[Bellcore]] (now [[Telcordia Technologies]]) was split off from Bell Laboratories to provide the same R&D functions for the newly created [[local exchange carrier]]s. AT&T also was limited to using the Bell trademark only in association with Bell Laboratories. ''Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc.'' became a wholly owned company of the new [[AT&T Technologies]] unit, the former Western Electric. The [[5ESS Switch]] was developed during this transition. In 1985, [[laser cooling]] was used to slow and manipulate atoms by [[Steven Chu]] and team. In 1985, the modeling language ''A Mathematical Programming Language'' [[AMPL]] was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], David M. Gay and Brian Kernighan at Bell Laboratories.  Also in 1985, Bell Laboratories was awarded the [[National Medal of Technology]] \"For contribution over decades to modern communication systems\". During the 1980s, the operating system ''[[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]]'' was developed extending the UNIX model. Also, the [[Radiodrum]], an electronic music instrument played in three space dimensions was invented. In 1988, [[TAT-8]] became the first transatlantic [[fiber-optic cable]]. Bell Labs in Freehold, NJ developed the 1.3-micron fiber, cable, splicing, laser detector, and 280 Mbit/s repeater for 40,000 telephone-call capacity.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Image:Lucent Technologies logo.svg|thumb|200px|Lucent Logo bearing the \"Bell Labs Innovations\" tagline]]\n\nIn 1991, the 56K [[modem]] technology was patented by Nuri Dağdeviren and his team. In 1994, the [[quantum cascade laser]] was invented by [[Federico Capasso]], [[Alfred Cho]], Jerome Faist and their collaborators. Also in 1994, [[Peter Shor]] devised his quantum factorization algorithm. In 1996, SCALPEL electron [[lithography]], which prints features atoms wide on microchips, was invented by Lloyd Harriott and his team. The operating system [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno]], an update of Plan 9, was created by Dennis Ritchie with others, using the then-new [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]] programming language [[Limbo (programming language)|Limbo]]. A high performance database engine (Dali) was developed which became DataBlitz in its product form.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970116221538/http://www.bell-labs.com/project/dali/]</ref>\n\nIn 1996, AT&T spun off Bell Laboratories, along with most of its equipment manufacturing business, into a new company named [[Alcatel-Lucent|Lucent Technologies]]. AT&T retained a small number of researchers who made up the staff of the newly created [[AT&T Labs]].\n\nIn 1997, the smallest then-practical transistor (60 [[nanometer]]s, 182 atoms wide) was built. In 1998, the first [[Optical IP Switching|optical router]] was invented.\n\n===2000s===\n[[Image:Alcatel Lucent Logo.svg|thumb|200px|Pre-2013 logo of Alcatel-Lucent, parent company of Bell Labs]]\n\n2000 was an active year for the Laboratories, in which [[DNA machine]] prototypes were developed; progressive geometry compression algorithm made widespread 3-D communication practical; the first electrically powered [[Dye laser|organic laser]] invented; a large-scale map of cosmic [[dark matter]] was compiled, and the F-15 (material), an organic material that makes [[Organic electronics|plastic transistors]] possible, was invented.\n\nIn 2002, physicist [[Schön scandal|Jan Hendrik Schön was fired]] after his work was found to contain fraudulent data. It was the first known case of fraud at Bell Labs.\n\nIn 2003, the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] Biomedical Engineering Laboratory was created at [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]].<ref>[http://www.njnano.org/resources/index.shtml New Jersey Nanotechnology Consortium.

Kim]], former President of Lucent's Optical Network Group, returned from academia to become the President of Bell Laboratories.\n\nIn April 2006, Bell Laboratories' parent company, Lucent Technologies, signed a merger agreement with [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]]. On 1 December 2006, the merged company, [[Alcatel-Lucent]], began operations. This deal raised concerns in the United States, where Bell Laboratories works on defense contracts. A separate company, LGS Innovations, with an American board was set up to manage Bell Laboratories' and Lucent's sensitive [[U.S. government]] contracts.\n\nIn December 2007, it was announced that the former Lucent Bell Laboratories and the former Alcatel Research and Innovation would be merged into one organization under the name of Bell Laboratories. This is the first period of growth following many years during which Bell Laboratories progressively lost manpower due to layoffs and spin-offs making the company shut down for a short period of time.\n\nAs of July 2008, however, only four scientists remained in physics research, according to a report by the scientific journal ''Nature''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080820/full/454927a.html |title=Access : Bell Labs bottoms out : Nature News |publisher=Nature.com |author=Geoff Brumfiel |date= |accessdate=2008-09-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907044552/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080820/full/454927a.html| archivedate= 7 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 August 2008, Alcatel-Lucent announced it was pulling out of basic science, material physics, and semiconductor research, and it will instead focus on more immediately marketable areas, including networking, high-speed electronics, wireless networks, nanotechnology and software.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.wired.com/2008/08/bell-labs-kills/|first = Priya|last = Ganapati|title = Bell Labs Kills Fundamental Physics Research|date = 2008-08-27|accessdate = 2008-08-28|website = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080828233520/http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/08/bell-labs-kills.html|archivedate = 28 August 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl = no}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Willard Boyle and George Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention and development of the [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/press.html |title=The 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics - Press Release |website=Nobelprize.org |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\n[[File:Nokia Bell Labs sign.jpg|thumb|250px|Nokia Bell Labs entrance sign at New Jersey headquarters in 2016]]\nIn February 2013, Gee Rittenhouse, former Head of Research returned from his position as Chief Operating Officer of Alcatel-Lucent's Software, Services, and Solutions business to become the 12th President of Bell Labs.<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Gee Rittenhouse to take over as President of world-famous research institution Bell Labs |url=https://www.alcatel-lucent.com/press/2013/002793 |location=Paris |publisher=Alcatel-Lucent |agency= |date=February 18, 2013 |access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 November 2013, Alcatel-Lucent announced the appointment of [[Marcus Weldon]] as President of Bell Labs.
