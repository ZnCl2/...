The policy doesn't prohibit international NGO's from providing advice, a referral, or performing an abortion if the pregnancy causes a severe risk to the life of the mother or was a result of incest or rape. It is also possible for these international NGO's to answer questions about an abortion if the woman makes it clear she has decided to have a safe, legal abortion.

The [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] (IPPF) did not alter its operation and lost more than 20% of its total funding. Other [[family planning]] organizations, such as the Family Guidance Association of [[Ethiopia]] and the Planned Parenthood Association of [[Zambia]], likewise did not make the changes required by the Mexico City policy and had their funding cut. NGOs in [[Romania]] and [[Colombia]] adapted to the new U.S. guidelines and continued to qualify for federal funding.<ref>Motluk, Alison.

However, in 2001, the policy was re-implemented and expanded to cover all voluntary family planning activities, and critics began to refer to it as the \"global [[gag rule]].\"  These critics argue that the policy not only reduces the overall funding provided to particular NGOs, it closes off their access to [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]-supplied [[condom]]s and other forms of [[contraception]].<ref name=\"pai\"/> This, they argue, negatively impacts the ability of these NGOs to distribute birth control, leading to a downturn in contraceptive use and from there to an increase in the rates of unintended [[pregnancy|pregnancies]] and abortion.<ref name=\"pai\" /> A study of nations in sub-Saharan Africa suggests that unintended pregnancies increased and abortions approximately doubled while the policy was in effect.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Bendavid |first1=Eran |last2=Avila |first2=Patrick |last3=Miller |first3=Grant |date=2012-10-27 |title=United States aid policy and induced abortion in sub-Saharan Africa |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/12/11-091660/en/ |magazine=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |publisher= |access-date= |doi=10.2471/BLT.11.091660 }}</ref>  Critics also argue that the ban promotes restrictions on [[free speech]] as well as restrictions on accurate medical information.<ref>Sierra Club.
