The Gopher protocol was strongly oriented towards a menu-document design and presented an alternative to the [[World Wide Web]] in [[History of the World Wide Web|its early stages]], but ultimately [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) became the dominant protocol. The Gopher ecosystem is often regarded as the effective predecessor of the World Wide Web.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carlson|first=Scott|date=September 5, 2016|title=How Gopher Nearly Won the Internet.|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-Gopher-Nearly-Won-the/237682?cid=wc&elqTrackId=efb09ffa986845e1ac578b879a71c12d&elq=79b4d513152c4e8c8f1c4e70634b60c9&elqaid=10545&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=3974|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=September 12, 2016|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe protocol was invented by a team led by [[Mark P. McCahill]]<ref name=\"tri\">{{Triangulation|264|Mark P. McCahill}}</ref> at the [[University of Minnesota]].  It offers some features not natively supported by the Web and imposes a much stronger hierarchy on information stored on it. Its text menu interface is well-suited to computing environments that rely heavily on remote [[Computer terminal#Text terminals|text-oriented computer terminals]], which were still common at the time of its creation in 1991, and the simplicity of its protocol facilitated a wide variety of client implementations. More recent Gopher revisions and graphical clients added support for multimedia.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Gopher was preferred by many network administrators for using fewer network resources than Web services.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Moore's Law saved us from the Gopher web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/03/how-moores-law-saved-the-web.html|date=12 March 2009|access-date=20 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831183201/http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/03/how-moores-law-saved-the-web.html|archivedate=31 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nGopher's hierarchical structure provided a platform for the first large-scale electronic library connections.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1UoH2vGKE8C&pg=PA69|title=Electronic collection management|author=Suzan D.

Its central goals were, as stated in RFC 1436:\n\n* A file-like hierarchical arrangement that would be familiar to users.\n* A simple syntax.\n* A system that can be created quickly and inexpensively.\n* Extending the file system metaphor, such as searches.\n\nGopher combines document hierarchies with collections of services, including [[Wide area information server|WAIS]], the [[Archie search engine|Archie]] and [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]] [[Search engine (computing)|search engines]], and gateways to other information systems such as [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) and [[Usenet]].\n\nThe general interest in [[Campus-Wide Information Systems]] (CWISs)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/bit.listserv.cwis-l/browse_frm/thread/11db689fbe802834/bc8a60ab89926a4b?lnk=st&q=cwis+gopher&rnum=482&hl=en#bc8a60ab89926a4b |title=Google Groups archive of bit.listserv.cwis-l discussion |publisher=Google  |access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref> in higher education at the time, and the ease with which a Gopher server could be set up to create an instant CWIS with links to other sites' online directories and resources were the factors contributing to Gopher's rapid adoption.\n\nThe name was coined by Anklesaria as a play on several meanings of the word \"gopher\".<ref name=\"gophervideo\">{{Cite AV media\n |people      = Mark McCahill, Farhad Anklesaria\n |title       = \"Smart Solutions: Internet Gopher\"\n |url         = http://mediamill.cla.umn.edu/mediamill/display/69597\n |format      = Flash\n |publisher   = University of Minnesota Media Mill\n |location    = Minneapolis\n |time        = 2:40\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720093228/http://mediamill.cla.umn.edu/mediamill/display/69597\n |archivedate = 20 July 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} McCahill credits Anklesaria with naming Gopher</ref> The [[University of Minnesota]] mascot is the gopher,<ref>{{cite web| title = Gophersports.com – Official Web Site of University of Minnesota Athletics| url = http://www.gophersports.com/| access-date = 17 August 2010| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100814175230/http://www.gophersports.com/| archivedate = 14 August 2010| df = dmy-all}}</ref> a [[gofer]] is an assistant who \"goes for\" things, and a [[gopher]] burrows through the ground to reach a desired location.<ref name=\"gopher_protocol_rise_and_fall\">{{cite web | url=https://www.minnpost.com/business/2016/08/rise-and-fall-gopher-protocol | title=The rise and fall of the Gopher protocol | publisher=minnpost.com | access-date=12 August 2016 | author=Gihring, Tim}}</ref>\n\n==Decline==\nThe [[World Wide Web]] was in its infancy in 1991, and Gopher services quickly became established. By the late 1990s, Gopher had ceased expanding. Several factors contributed to Gopher's stagnation:\n\n* In February 1993, the [[University of Minnesota]] announced that it would charge licensing fees for the use of its implementation of the Gopher server.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.funet.fi/pub/vms/networking/gopher/gopher-software-licensing-policy.ancient |title=Subject: University of Minnesota Gopher software licensing policy |publisher=Funet.fi |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref><ref name=\"gopher_protocol_rise_and_fall\" /> Users became concerned that fees might also be charged for independent implementations.<ref>{{cite web|author=JQ Johnson |url=https://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1mj6cb$6gm@pith.uoregon.edu |title=Message from discussion gopher licensing |publisher=Google|date=25 February 1993 |access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Joel Rubin |url=https://groups.google.com/groups?selm=36e4c2f1.10244576@nntp.best.ix.netcom.com |title=CW from the VOA server page – rec.radio.shortwave |publisher=Google|date=3 March 1999 |access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref>  Gopher expansion stagnated, to the advantage of the World Wide Web, to which [[CERN]] disclaimed ownership.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hacking Capitalism: The Free and Open Source Software Movement|author=Johan Söderberg|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|page=25|isbn=0-415-95543-2}}</ref> In September 2000, the University of Minnesota re-licensed its Gopher software under the [[GNU General Public License]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.infosystems.gopher/4A-LS_A6qtA/nT89yWKzzsIJ |title=Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref>\n* Gopher client functionality was quickly duplicated by the early [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser, which subsumed its protocol.\n* Gopher has a more rigid structure than the free-form [[HTML]] of the Web. Every Gopher document has a defined format and type, and the typical user navigates through a single server-defined menu system to get to a particular document. This can be quite different from the way a user finds documents on the Web.\n\nGopher remains in active use by its enthusiasts, and there have been attempts to revive Gopher on modern platforms and mobile devices. One attempt is The Overbite Project, which hosts various browser extensions and modern clients.\n\n===Server census===\n*{{As of|2012}}, there remained about 160 gopher servers indexed by [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica-2]],<ref name=\"Veronica report\">{{cite web|url=http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher/0/v2/vstat |title=Floodgap Gopher-HTTP gateway gopher://gopher/0/v2/vstat |website=Gopher.floodgap.com |date= |access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref> reflecting a slow growth from 2007 when there were fewer than 100.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://db.tidbits.com/article/8909 |title=Down the Gopher Hole |last=Kaiser |first=Cameron |publisher=TidBITS |date=19 March 2007 |access-date=23 March 2007}}</ref> They are typically infrequently updated.

At a minimum, whatever a person can do with data files on a [[CD-ROM]], one can do on Gopher.\n\nA Gopher system consists of a series of hierarchical hyperlinkable menus. The choice of menu items and titles is controlled by the administrator of the server.\n{{Double image|center|Floodgap gopher top menu.PNG|250|Floodgap gopher fun menu.PNG|{{#expr: (183 * 1249 / 755) round 0}}|The top level menu of a Gopher server. Selecting the \"Fun and Games\" menu item...|...takes the user to the \"Fun and Games\" menu.}}\n\nSimilar to a file on a Web server, a file on a Gopher server can be linked to as a menu item from any other Gopher server. Many servers take advantage of this inter-server linking to provide a directory of other servers that the user can access.\n\n===Protocol===\nThe Gopher protocol was first described in RFC 1436. [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] has assigned [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[List of well-known ports (computing)|port]] 70 to the Gopher protocol.\n\nThe protocol is simple to negotiate, making it possible to browse without using a client. A standard gopher session may therefore appear as follows:\n\n<pre>\n/Reference\n1CIA World Factbook     /Archives/mirrors/textfiles.com/politics/CIA    gopher.quux.org 70\n0Jargon 4.2.0   /Reference/Jargon 4.2.0 gopher.quux.org 70      +\n1Online Libraries       /Reference/Online Libraries     gopher.quux.org 70     +\n1RFCs: Internet Standards       /Computers/Standards and Specs/RFC      gopher.quux.org 70\n1U.S. Gazetteer /Reference/U.S. Gazetteer       gopher.quux.org 70      +\niThis file contains information on United States        fake    (NULL)  0\nicities, counties, and geographical areas.  It has      fake    (NULL)  0\nilatitude/longitude, population, land and water area,   fake    (NULL)  0\niand ZIP codes. fake    (NULL)  0\ni       fake    (NULL)  0\niTo search for a city, enter the city's name.  To search        fake    (NULL) 0\nifor a county, use the name plus County -- for instance,        fake    (NULL) 0\niDallas County. fake    (NULL)  0\n</pre>\n\nHere, the client has established a TCP connection with the server on port 70, the standard gopher port. The client then sends a string followed by a carriage return followed by a [[Newline|line feed]] (a \"CR + LF\" sequence). This is the selector, which identifies the document to be retrieved. If the item selector were an empty line, the default directory would be selected. The server then replies with the requested item and closes the connection. According to the protocol, before the connection is closed, the server should send a full-stop (i.e., a period character) on a line by itself. However, as is the case here, not all servers conform to this part of the protocol and the server may close the connection without returning the final full-stop.\n\nIn this example, the item sent back is a gopher menu, a directory consisting of a sequence of lines each of which describes an item that can be retrieved. Most clients will display these as [[hypertext]] links, and so allow the user to navigate through gopherspace by following the links.<ref name=\"wwwunleashed\" />\n\nAll lines in a gopher menu are terminated by \"CR + LF\", and consist of five fields: the ''item type'' as the very first character (see below), the ''display string'' (i.e., the description text to display), a ''selector'' (i.e., a file-system pathname), ''host name'' (i.e., the domain name of the server on which the item resides), and ''port'' (i.e., the port number used by that server). The item type and display string are joined without a space; the other fields are separated by the tab character.\n\nBecause of the simplicity of the Gopher protocol, tools such as [[netcat]] make it possible to download Gopher content easily from the command line:\n echo jacks/jack.exe | nc gopher.example.org 70 > jack.exe\nThe protocol is also supported by [[cURL]] as of 7.21.2-DEV.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curl: Re: Gopher patches for cURL (includes test suite)|url=http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-08/0339.html|access-date=25 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927155457/http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-08/0339.html|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Source code of a menu===\nGopher menu items are defined by lines of [[tab-separated values]] in a [[text file]]. This file is sometimes called a ''gophermap''. As the [[source code]] to a gopher menu, a gophermap is roughly analogous to an [[HTML]] file for a [[web page]]. Each tab-separated line (called a ''selector line'') gives the [[client software]] a description of the menu item: what it is, what it's called, and where it leads. The client displays the menu items in the order that they appear in the gophermap.\n\nThe first character in a selector line indicates the ''item type'', which tells the client what kind of file or protocol the menu item points to. This helps the client decide what to do with it. Gopher's item types are a more basic precursor to the [[media type]] system used by the Web and [[email attachment]]s.\n\nThe item type is followed by the ''user display string'' (a description or label that represents the item in the menu); the selector (a [[Path (computing)|path]] or other string for the resource on the server); the ''hostname'' (the [[domain name]] or [[IP address]] of the server), and the [[network port]].\n\nFor example: The following selector line generates a link to the \"/home\" [[Directory (computing)|directory]] at the [[subdomain]] gopher.floodgap.com, on [[Port (computer networking)|port]] 70. The item type of {{var|1}} indicates that the resource is a Gopher menu. The string \"Floodgap Home\" is what the user  sees in the menu.\n\n 1Floodgap Home\t/home\tgopher.floodgap.com\t70\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Item type !! User display string !! Selector !! Hostname !! [[Port (computer networking)|Port]] \n|-\n| 1 || Floodgap Home || /home || gopher.floodgap.com || 70\n|}\n\nIn addition to selector lines, a gophermap may contain ''comment lines''. Comment lines are not for [[code comments]]; rather, they are lines of text sent to the client to display alongside the menu items, such as for a menu description or welcome message. A comment line contains no [[tab character]]s.\n\n====Item types====\nIn a Gopher menu's source code, a one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. This code may either be a digit or a letter of the alphabet; letters are [[case-sensitive]].\n\nThe [[technical specification]] for Gopher, RFC 1436, defines 14 item types. A one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. Item type {{code|3}} is an [[error code]] for [[exception handling]]. Gopher client authors improvised item types {{code|h}} (HTML), {{code|i}} (informational message), and {{code|s}} ([[sound file]]) after the publication of RFC 1436.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" {{partial|Canonical types}}\n|-\n| {{okay|'''0'''}} || [[Text file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''1'''}} || Gopher submenu\n|-\n| {{okay|'''2'''}} || [[CCSO Nameserver]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''3'''}} || Error code returned by a Gopher server to indicate failure\n|-\n| {{okay|'''4'''}} || [[BinHex]]-encoded file (primarily for [[Macintosh]] computers)\n|-\n| {{okay|'''5'''}} || [[DOS]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''6'''}} || [[uuencoded]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''7'''}} || Gopher [[full-text search]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''8'''}} || [[Telnet]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''9'''}} || [[Binary file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''+'''}} || Mirror or alternate server (for [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] or in case of primary server [[downtime]])\n|-\n| {{okay|'''g'''}} || [[GIF]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''I'''}} || [[Image file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''T'''}} || [[Telnet 3270]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" {{unofficial|Non-canonical types}} \n|-\n| style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''h''' || [[HTML]] file\n|-\n| style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''i''' || Informational message\n|-\n| style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''s''' || [[Sound file]] (especially the [[WAV]] format) \n|}\n\n====URL links====\nHistorically, to create a link to a Web server, \"GET /\" was used as a pseudo-selector to emulate an [[HTTP]] [[GET request]]. [[John Goerzen]] created an addition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gopher.quux.org/Archives/Mailing%20Lists/gopher/gopher.2002-02 |title=Gopher: gopher.2002-02 |publisher=Gopher.quux.org |date= |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref> to the Gopher protocol, commonly referred to as \"[[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] links\", that allows links to any protocol that supports URLs. For example, to create a link to http://gopher.quux.org/, the item type is {{code|h}}, the display string is the title of the link, the item selector is \"<nowiki>URL:http://gopher.quux.org/</nowiki>\", and the domain and port are that of the originating Gopher server (so that clients that do not support URL links will query the server and receive an HTML redirection page).\n\n===Related technology===\nThe master Gopherspace search engine is [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]]. Veronica offers a keyword search of all the public Internet Gopher server menu titles. A Veronica search produces a menu of Gopher items, each of which is a direct pointer to a Gopher data source. Individual Gopher servers may also use localized search engines specific to their content such as [[Jughead (search engine)|Jughead]] and [[Jughead (search engine)|Jugtail]].\n\n[[GopherVR]] is a 3D virtual reality variant of the original Gopher system.\n\n==Client software==\n===Web browsers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Browser\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Version\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | {{nowrap|First supported}}\n! scope=\"col\" | {{nowrap|Last supported}}\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Camino (web browser)|Camino]]\n| {{included|1.0}}\n| {{included|2.1.2}}\n| Always uses port 70.\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Classilla]]\n| {{included|9.0}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n| Hardcoded to port 70 from 9.0–9.2; whitelisted ports from 9.2.1.\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[cURL]]\n| {{included|7.21.2<br>{{small|(October 2010)}}}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n| cURL is a command-line file transfer utility\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[ELinks]]\n| {{optional|0.10.0}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Fonseca|first=Jonas|title=elinks-users ANNOUNCE ELinks-0.10.0 (Thelma)|url=http://linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/elinks-users/2004-December/000785.html|publisher=[[Linux From Scratch]]|access-date=22 May 2010|date=24 December 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220130659/http://linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/elinks-users/2004-December/000785.html|archivedate=20 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n| {{dunno}}\n| Offers support as a build option\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Web (web browser)|Epiphany]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{dropped|2.26.3}}\n|Disabled after switch to [[WebKit]]\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Galeon]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|2.0.7}}\n| \n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Google Chrome]]\n| {{Needs|With extension only}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11345|title=Issue 11345: gopher protocol doesn't work|access-date=25 July 2011|date=2 May 2009|author=hotaru.firefly|publisher=Google|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n| {{N/A}}\n| The Overbite extension<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/|title=The Overbite Project @ Floodgap -- Gopher Client Software for Modern Operating Systems, Browsers and Mobile Devices (OverbiteFF [Firefox], Overbite Android)|author=|date=|website=gopher.floodgap.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111060216/http://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/|archivedate=11 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> that automatically forwards to Gopher proxies is no longer compatible with Chrome.\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Internet Explorer]]\n| {{N/A}}\n| {{optional|6.0 SP1+}}\n| Supported added by MS02-047 to IE 6 SP1 can be enabled in the [[Windows Registry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-047.mspx |title=Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-047 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=28 February 2003 |access-date=23 March 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61CUyjRrX?url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-047.mspx |archivedate=25 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Always uses port 70.\n|-\n! {{rh2}} | [[Internet Explorer for Mac]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|5.2.3}}\n| PowerPC-only\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[K-Meleon]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n|\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Konqueror]]\n| {{Needs|With plug-in only}}\n| {{dunno}}\n| Requires kio_gopher plug-in<ref>{{cite web|url=http://userbase.kde.org/Kio_gopher|title=Kio gopher - KDE UserBase Wiki|author=|date=|website=userbase.kde.org|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501125030/https://userbase.kde.org/Kio_gopher|archivedate=1 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[libwww]]\n| {{included|1.0c<br>{{small|(December 1992)}}}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n| libwww is an [[Application programming interface|API]] for internet applications\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Line Mode Browser]]\n| {{included||1.1<br>{{small|(January 1992)}}}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n|\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|Present(3.0)}}\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Mozilla Firefox]]\n| {{included|0.0}}\n| {{dropped|3.6}}\n| Built-in support dropped from Firefox 4.0 onwards;<ref>{{cite web | url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=388195| title=Bug 388195 – Remove gopher protocol support for Firefox | access-date=15 June 2010}}</ref> can be added back to [https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-add-technology-modernizing Firefox < 57] with [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/overbiteff/ OverbiteFF] and Firefox > 57 with [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/overbitewx/ OverbiteWX].

The Gopher protocol was strongly oriented towards a menu-document design and presented an alternative to the [[World Wide Web]] in [[History of the World Wide Web|its early stages]], but ultimately [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) became the dominant protocol.

It offers some features not natively supported by the Web and imposes a much stronger hierarchy on information stored on it. Its text menu interface is well-suited to computing environments that rely heavily on remote [[Computer terminal#Text terminals|text-oriented computer terminals]], which were still common at the time of its creation in 1991, and the simplicity of its protocol facilitated a wide variety of client implementations. More recent Gopher revisions and graphical clients added support for multimedia.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Gopher was preferred by many network administrators for using fewer network resources than Web services.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Moore's Law saved us from the Gopher web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/03/how-moores-law-saved-the-web.html|date=12 March 2009|access-date=20 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831183201/http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/03/how-moores-law-saved-the-web.html|archivedate=31 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nGopher's hierarchical structure provided a platform for the first large-scale electronic library connections.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1UoH2vGKE8C&pg=PA69|title=Electronic collection management|author=Suzan D.

Its central goals were, as stated in RFC 1436:\n\n* A file-like hierarchical arrangement that would be familiar to users.\n* A simple syntax.\n* A system that can be created quickly and inexpensively.\n* Extending the file system metaphor, such as searches.\n\nGopher combines document hierarchies with collections of services, including [[Wide area information server|WAIS]], the [[Archie search engine|Archie]] and [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]] [[Search engine (computing)|search engines]], and gateways to other information systems such as [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) and [[Usenet]].\n\nThe general interest in [[Campus-Wide Information Systems]] (CWISs)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/bit.listserv.cwis-l/browse_frm/thread/11db689fbe802834/bc8a60ab89926a4b?lnk=st&q=cwis+gopher&rnum=482&hl=en#bc8a60ab89926a4b |title=Google Groups archive of bit.listserv.cwis-l discussion |publisher=Google  |access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref> in higher education at the time, and the ease with which a Gopher server could be set up to create an instant CWIS with links to other sites' online directories and resources were the factors contributing to Gopher's rapid adoption.\n\nThe name was coined by Anklesaria as a play on several meanings of the word \"gopher\".<ref name=\"gophervideo\">{{Cite AV media\n |people      = Mark McCahill, Farhad Anklesaria\n |title       = \"Smart Solutions: Internet Gopher\"\n |url         = http://mediamill.cla.umn.edu/mediamill/display/69597\n |format      = Flash\n |publisher   = University of Minnesota Media Mill\n |location    = Minneapolis\n |time        = 2:40\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720093228/http://mediamill.cla.umn.edu/mediamill/display/69597\n |archivedate = 20 July 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} McCahill credits Anklesaria with naming Gopher</ref> The [[University of Minnesota]] mascot is the gopher,<ref>{{cite web| title = Gophersports.com – Official Web Site of University of Minnesota Athletics| url = http://www.gophersports.com/| access-date = 17 August 2010| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100814175230/http://www.gophersports.com/| archivedate = 14 August 2010| df = dmy-all}}</ref> a [[gofer]] is an assistant who \"goes for\" things, and a [[gopher]] burrows through the ground to reach a desired location.<ref name=\"gopher_protocol_rise_and_fall\">{{cite web | url=https://www.minnpost.com/business/2016/08/rise-and-fall-gopher-protocol | title=The rise and fall of the Gopher protocol | publisher=minnpost.com | access-date=12 August 2016 | author=Gihring, Tim}}</ref>\n\n==Decline==\nThe [[World Wide Web]] was in its infancy in 1991, and Gopher services quickly became established. By the late 1990s, Gopher had ceased expanding. Several factors contributed to Gopher's stagnation:\n\n* In February 1993, the [[University of Minnesota]] announced that it would charge licensing fees for the use of its implementation of the Gopher server.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.funet.fi/pub/vms/networking/gopher/gopher-software-licensing-policy.ancient |title=Subject: University of Minnesota Gopher software licensing policy |publisher=Funet.fi |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref><ref name=\"gopher_protocol_rise_and_fall\" /> Users became concerned that fees might also be charged for independent implementations.<ref>{{cite web|author=JQ Johnson |url=https://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1mj6cb$6gm@pith.uoregon.edu |title=Message from discussion gopher licensing |publisher=Google|date=25 February 1993 |access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Joel Rubin |url=https://groups.google.com/groups?selm=36e4c2f1.10244576@nntp.best.ix.netcom.com |title=CW from the VOA server page – rec.radio.shortwave |publisher=Google|date=3 March 1999 |access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref>  Gopher expansion stagnated, to the advantage of the World Wide Web, to which [[CERN]] disclaimed ownership.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hacking Capitalism: The Free and Open Source Software Movement|author=Johan Söderberg|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|page=25|isbn=0-415-95543-2}}</ref> In September 2000, the University of Minnesota re-licensed its Gopher software under the [[GNU General Public License]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.infosystems.gopher/4A-LS_A6qtA/nT89yWKzzsIJ |title=Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref>\n* Gopher client functionality was quickly duplicated by the early [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser, which subsumed its protocol.\n* Gopher has a more rigid structure than the free-form [[HTML]] of the Web. Every Gopher document has a defined format and type, and the typical user navigates through a single server-defined menu system to get to a particular document. This can be quite different from the way a user finds documents on the Web.\n\nGopher remains in active use by its enthusiasts, and there have been attempts to revive Gopher on modern platforms and mobile devices. One attempt is The Overbite Project, which hosts various browser extensions and modern clients.\n\n===Server census===\n*{{As of|2012}}, there remained about 160 gopher servers indexed by [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica-2]],<ref name=\"Veronica report\">{{cite web|url=http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher/0/v2/vstat |title=Floodgap Gopher-HTTP gateway gopher://gopher/0/v2/vstat |website=Gopher.floodgap.com |date= |access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref> reflecting a slow growth from 2007 when there were fewer than 100.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://db.tidbits.com/article/8909 |title=Down the Gopher Hole |last=Kaiser |first=Cameron |publisher=TidBITS |date=19 March 2007 |access-date=23 March 2007}}</ref> They are typically infrequently updated.

At a minimum, whatever a person can do with data files on a [[CD-ROM]], one can do on Gopher.\n\nA Gopher system consists of a series of hierarchical hyperlinkable menus. The choice of menu items and titles is controlled by the administrator of the server.\n{{Double image|center|Floodgap gopher top menu.PNG|250|Floodgap gopher fun menu.PNG|{{#expr: (183 * 1249 / 755) round 0}}|The top level menu of a Gopher server. Selecting the \"Fun and Games\" menu item...|...takes the user to the \"Fun and Games\" menu.}}\n\nSimilar to a file on a Web server, a file on a Gopher server can be linked to as a menu item from any other Gopher server. Many servers take advantage of this inter-server linking to provide a directory of other servers that the user can access.\n\n===Protocol===\nThe Gopher protocol was first described in RFC 1436. [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] has assigned [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[List of well-known ports (computing)|port]] 70 to the Gopher protocol.\n\nThe protocol is simple to negotiate, making it possible to browse without using a client. A standard gopher session may therefore appear as follows:\n\n<pre>\n/Reference\n1CIA World Factbook     /Archives/mirrors/textfiles.com/politics/CIA    gopher.quux.org 70\n0Jargon 4.2.0   /Reference/Jargon 4.2.0 gopher.quux.org 70      +\n1Online Libraries       /Reference/Online Libraries     gopher.quux.org 70     +\n1RFCs: Internet Standards       /Computers/Standards and Specs/RFC      gopher.quux.org 70\n1U.S. Gazetteer /Reference/U.S. Gazetteer       gopher.quux.org 70      +\niThis file contains information on United States        fake    (NULL)  0\nicities, counties, and geographical areas.  It has      fake    (NULL)  0\nilatitude/longitude, population, land and water area,   fake    (NULL)  0\niand ZIP codes. fake    (NULL)  0\ni       fake    (NULL)  0\niTo search for a city, enter the city's name.  To search        fake    (NULL) 0\nifor a county, use the name plus County -- for instance,        fake    (NULL) 0\niDallas County. fake    (NULL)  0\n</pre>\n\nHere, the client has established a TCP connection with the server on port 70, the standard gopher port. The client then sends a string followed by a carriage return followed by a [[Newline|line feed]] (a \"CR + LF\" sequence). This is the selector, which identifies the document to be retrieved. If the item selector were an empty line, the default directory would be selected. The server then replies with the requested item and closes the connection. According to the protocol, before the connection is closed, the server should send a full-stop (i.e., a period character) on a line by itself. However, as is the case here, not all servers conform to this part of the protocol and the server may close the connection without returning the final full-stop.\n\nIn this example, the item sent back is a gopher menu, a directory consisting of a sequence of lines each of which describes an item that can be retrieved. Most clients will display these as [[hypertext]] links, and so allow the user to navigate through gopherspace by following the links.<ref name=\"wwwunleashed\" />\n\nAll lines in a gopher menu are terminated by \"CR + LF\", and consist of five fields: the ''item type'' as the very first character (see below), the ''display string'' (i.e., the description text to display), a ''selector'' (i.e., a file-system pathname), ''host name'' (i.e., the domain name of the server on which the item resides), and ''port'' (i.e., the port number used by that server). The item type and display string are joined without a space; the other fields are separated by the tab character.\n\nBecause of the simplicity of the Gopher protocol, tools such as [[netcat]] make it possible to download Gopher content easily from the command line:\n echo jacks/jack.exe | nc gopher.example.org 70 > jack.exe\nThe protocol is also supported by [[cURL]] as of 7.21.2-DEV.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curl: Re: Gopher patches for cURL (includes test suite)|url=http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-08/0339.html|access-date=25 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927155457/http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-08/0339.html|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Source code of a menu===\nGopher menu items are defined by lines of [[tab-separated values]] in a [[text file]]. This file is sometimes called a ''gophermap''. As the [[source code]] to a gopher menu, a gophermap is roughly analogous to an [[HTML]] file for a [[web page]]. Each tab-separated line (called a ''selector line'') gives the [[client software]] a description of the menu item: what it is, what it's called, and where it leads. The client displays the menu items in the order that they appear in the gophermap.\n\nThe first character in a selector line indicates the ''item type'', which tells the client what kind of file or protocol the menu item points to. This helps the client decide what to do with it. Gopher's item types are a more basic precursor to the [[media type]] system used by the Web and [[email attachment]]s.\n\nThe item type is followed by the ''user display string'' (a description or label that represents the item in the menu); the selector (a [[Path (computing)|path]] or other string for the resource on the server); the ''hostname'' (the [[domain name]] or [[IP address]] of the server), and the [[network port]].\n\nFor example: The following selector line generates a link to the \"/home\" [[Directory (computing)|directory]] at the [[subdomain]] gopher.floodgap.com, on [[Port (computer networking)|port]] 70. The item type of {{var|1}} indicates that the resource is a Gopher menu. The string \"Floodgap Home\" is what the user  sees in the menu.\n\n 1Floodgap Home\t/home\tgopher.floodgap.com\t70\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Item type !! User display string !! Selector !! Hostname !! [[Port (computer networking)|Port]] \n|-\n| 1 || Floodgap Home || /home || gopher.floodgap.com || 70\n|}\n\nIn addition to selector lines, a gophermap may contain ''comment lines''. Comment lines are not for [[code comments]]; rather, they are lines of text sent to the client to display alongside the menu items, such as for a menu description or welcome message. A comment line contains no [[tab character]]s.\n\n====Item types====\nIn a Gopher menu's source code, a one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. This code may either be a digit or a letter of the alphabet; letters are [[case-sensitive]].\n\nThe [[technical specification]] for Gopher, RFC 1436, defines 14 item types. A one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. Item type {{code|3}} is an [[error code]] for [[exception handling]]. Gopher client authors improvised item types {{code|h}} (HTML), {{code|i}} (informational message), and {{code|s}} ([[sound file]]) after the publication of RFC 1436.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" {{partial|Canonical types}}\n|-\n| {{okay|'''0'''}} || [[Text file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''1'''}} || Gopher submenu\n|-\n| {{okay|'''2'''}} || [[CCSO Nameserver]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''3'''}} || Error code returned by a Gopher server to indicate failure\n|-\n| {{okay|'''4'''}} || [[BinHex]]-encoded file (primarily for [[Macintosh]] computers)\n|-\n| {{okay|'''5'''}} || [[DOS]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''6'''}} || [[uuencoded]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''7'''}} || Gopher [[full-text search]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''8'''}} || [[Telnet]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''9'''}} || [[Binary file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''+'''}} || Mirror or alternate server (for [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] or in case of primary server [[downtime]])\n|-\n| {{okay|'''g'''}} || [[GIF]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''I'''}} || [[Image file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''T'''}} || [[Telnet 3270]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" {{unofficial|Non-canonical types}} \n|-\n| style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''h''' || [[HTML]] file\n|-\n| style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''i''' || Informational message\n|-\n| style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''s''' || [[Sound file]] (especially the [[WAV]] format) \n|}\n\n====URL links====\nHistorically, to create a link to a Web server, \"GET /\" was used as a pseudo-selector to emulate an [[HTTP]] [[GET request]]. [[John Goerzen]] created an addition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gopher.quux.org/Archives/Mailing%20Lists/gopher/gopher.2002-02 |title=Gopher: gopher.2002-02 |publisher=Gopher.quux.org |date= |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref> to the Gopher protocol, commonly referred to as \"[[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] links\", that allows links to any protocol that supports URLs. For example, to create a link to http://gopher.quux.org/, the item type is {{code|h}}, the display string is the title of the link, the item selector is \"<nowiki>URL:http://gopher.quux.org/</nowiki>\", and the domain and port are that of the originating Gopher server (so that clients that do not support URL links will query the server and receive an HTML redirection page).\n\n===Related technology===\nThe master Gopherspace search engine is [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]]. Veronica offers a keyword search of all the public Internet Gopher server menu titles. A Veronica search produces a menu of Gopher items, each of which is a direct pointer to a Gopher data source. Individual Gopher servers may also use localized search engines specific to their content such as [[Jughead (search engine)|Jughead]] and [[Jughead (search engine)|Jugtail]].\n\n[[GopherVR]] is a 3D virtual reality variant of the original Gopher system.\n\n==Client software==\n===Web browsers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Browser\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Version\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | {{nowrap|First supported}}\n! scope=\"col\" | {{nowrap|Last supported}}\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Camino (web browser)|Camino]]\n| {{included|1.0}}\n| {{included|2.1.2}}\n| Always uses port 70.\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Classilla]]\n| {{included|9.0}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n| Hardcoded to port 70 from 9.0–9.2; whitelisted ports from 9.2.1.\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[cURL]]\n| {{included|7.21.2<br>{{small|(October 2010)}}}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n| cURL is a command-line file transfer utility\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[ELinks]]\n| {{optional|0.10.0}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Fonseca|first=Jonas|title=elinks-users ANNOUNCE ELinks-0.10.0 (Thelma)|url=http://linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/elinks-users/2004-December/000785.html|publisher=[[Linux From Scratch]]|access-date=22 May 2010|date=24 December 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220130659/http://linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/elinks-users/2004-December/000785.html|archivedate=20 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n| {{dunno}}\n| Offers support as a build option\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Web (web browser)|Epiphany]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{dropped|2.26.3}}\n|Disabled after switch to [[WebKit]]\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Galeon]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|2.0.7}}\n| \n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Google Chrome]]\n| {{Needs|With extension only}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11345|title=Issue 11345: gopher protocol doesn't work|access-date=25 July 2011|date=2 May 2009|author=hotaru.firefly|publisher=Google|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n| {{N/A}}\n| The Overbite extension<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/|title=The Overbite Project @ Floodgap -- Gopher Client Software for Modern Operating Systems, Browsers and Mobile Devices (OverbiteFF [Firefox], Overbite Android)|author=|date=|website=gopher.floodgap.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111060216/http://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/|archivedate=11 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> that automatically forwards to Gopher proxies is no longer compatible with Chrome.\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Internet Explorer]]\n| {{N/A}}\n| {{optional|6.0 SP1+}}\n| Supported added by MS02-047 to IE 6 SP1 can be enabled in the [[Windows Registry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-047.mspx |title=Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-047 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=28 February 2003 |access-date=23 March 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61CUyjRrX?url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-047.mspx |archivedate=25 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Always uses port 70.\n|-\n! {{rh2}} | [[Internet Explorer for Mac]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|5.2.3}}\n| PowerPC-only\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[K-Meleon]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n|\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Konqueror]]\n| {{Needs|With plug-in only}}\n| {{dunno}}\n| Requires kio_gopher plug-in<ref>{{cite web|url=http://userbase.kde.org/Kio_gopher|title=Kio gopher - KDE UserBase Wiki|author=|date=|website=userbase.kde.org|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501125030/https://userbase.kde.org/Kio_gopher|archivedate=1 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[libwww]]\n| {{included|1.0c<br>{{small|(December 1992)}}}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n| libwww is an [[Application programming interface|API]] for internet applications\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Line Mode Browser]]\n| {{included||1.1<br>{{small|(January 1992)}}}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n|\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|Present}}\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]]\n| {{dunno}}\n| {{included|Present(3.0)}}\n|-\n! {{rh}} | [[Mozilla Firefox]]\n| {{included|0.0}}\n| {{dropped|3.6}}\n| Built-in support dropped from Firefox 4.0 onwards;<ref>{{cite web | url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=388195| title=Bug 388195 – Remove gopher protocol support for Firefox | access-date=15 June 2010}}</ref> can be added back to [https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-add-technology-modernizing Firefox < 57] with [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/overbiteff/ OverbiteFF] and Firefox > 57 with [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/overbitewx/ OverbiteWX].

The Gopher protocol was strongly oriented towards a menu-document design and presented an alternative to the [[World Wide Web]] in [[History of the World Wide Web|its early stages]], but ultimately [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) became the dominant protocol.

It offers some features not natively supported by the Web and imposes a much stronger hierarchy on information stored on it. Its text menu interface is well-suited to computing environments that rely heavily on remote [[Computer terminal#Text terminals|text-oriented computer terminals]], which were still common at the time of its creation in 1991, and the simplicity of its protocol facilitated a wide variety of client implementations.

Its central goals were, as stated in RFC 1436:\n\n* A file-like hierarchical arrangement that would be familiar to users.\n* A simple syntax.\n* A system that can be created quickly and inexpensively.\n* Extending the file system metaphor, such as searches.\n\nGopher combines document hierarchies with collections of services, including [[Wide area information server|WAIS]], the [[Archie search engine|Archie]] and [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]] [[Search engine (computing)|search engines]], and gateways to other information systems such as [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) and [[Usenet]].\n\nThe general interest in [[Campus-Wide Information Systems]] (CWISs)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/bit.listserv.cwis-l/browse_frm/thread/11db689fbe802834/bc8a60ab89926a4b?lnk=st&q=cwis+gopher&rnum=482&hl=en#bc8a60ab89926a4b |title=Google Groups archive of bit.listserv.cwis-l discussion |publisher=Google  |access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref> in higher education at the time, and the ease with which a Gopher server could be set up to create an instant CWIS with links to other sites' online directories and resources were the factors contributing to Gopher's rapid adoption.\n\nThe name was coined by Anklesaria as a play on several meanings of the word \"gopher\".<ref name=\"gophervideo\">{{Cite AV media\n |people      = Mark McCahill, Farhad Anklesaria\n |title       = \"Smart Solutions: Internet Gopher\"\n |url         = http://mediamill.cla.umn.edu/mediamill/display/69597\n |format      = Flash\n |publisher   = University of Minnesota Media Mill\n |location    = Minneapolis\n |time        = 2:40\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720093228/http://mediamill.cla.umn.edu/mediamill/display/69597\n |archivedate = 20 July 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} McCahill credits Anklesaria with naming Gopher</ref> The [[University of Minnesota]] mascot is the gopher,<ref>{{cite web| title = Gophersports.com – Official Web Site of University of Minnesota Athletics| url = http://www.gophersports.com/| access-date = 17 August 2010| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100814175230/http://www.gophersports.com/| archivedate = 14 August 2010| df = dmy-all}}</ref> a [[gofer]] is an assistant who \"goes for\" things, and a [[gopher]] burrows through the ground to reach a desired location.<ref name=\"gopher_protocol_rise_and_fall\">{{cite web | url=https://www.minnpost.com/business/2016/08/rise-and-fall-gopher-protocol | title=The rise and fall of the Gopher protocol | publisher=minnpost.com | access-date=12 August 2016 | author=Gihring, Tim}}</ref>\n\n==Decline==\nThe [[World Wide Web]] was in its infancy in 1991, and Gopher services quickly became established. By the late 1990s, Gopher had ceased expanding. Several factors contributed to Gopher's stagnation:\n\n* In February 1993, the [[University of Minnesota]] announced that it would charge licensing fees for the use of its implementation of the Gopher server.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.funet.fi/pub/vms/networking/gopher/gopher-software-licensing-policy.ancient |title=Subject: University of Minnesota Gopher software licensing policy |publisher=Funet.fi |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref><ref name=\"gopher_protocol_rise_and_fall\" /> Users became concerned that fees might also be charged for independent implementations.<ref>{{cite web|author=JQ Johnson |url=https://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1mj6cb$6gm@pith.uoregon.edu |title=Message from discussion gopher licensing |publisher=Google|date=25 February 1993 |access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Joel Rubin |url=https://groups.google.com/groups?selm=36e4c2f1.10244576@nntp.best.ix.netcom.com |title=CW from the VOA server page – rec.radio.shortwave |publisher=Google|date=3 March 1999 |access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref>  Gopher expansion stagnated, to the advantage of the World Wide Web, to which [[CERN]] disclaimed ownership.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hacking Capitalism: The Free and Open Source Software Movement|author=Johan Söderberg|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|page=25|isbn=0-415-95543-2}}</ref> In September 2000, the University of Minnesota re-licensed its Gopher software under the [[GNU General Public License]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.infosystems.gopher/4A-LS_A6qtA/nT89yWKzzsIJ |title=Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref>\n* Gopher client functionality was quickly duplicated by the early [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser, which subsumed its protocol.\n* Gopher has a more rigid structure than the free-form [[HTML]] of the Web. Every Gopher document has a defined format and type, and the typical user navigates through a single server-defined menu system to get to a particular document. This can be quite different from the way a user finds documents on the Web.\n\nGopher remains in active use by its enthusiasts, and there have been attempts to revive Gopher on modern platforms and mobile devices. One attempt is The Overbite Project, which hosts various browser extensions and modern clients.\n\n===Server census===\n*{{As of|2012}}, there remained about 160 gopher servers indexed by [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica-2]],<ref name=\"Veronica report\">{{cite web|url=http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher/0/v2/vstat |title=Floodgap Gopher-HTTP gateway gopher://gopher/0/v2/vstat |website=Gopher.floodgap.com |date= |access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref> reflecting a slow growth from 2007 when there were fewer than 100.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://db.tidbits.com/article/8909 |title=Down the Gopher Hole |last=Kaiser |first=Cameron |publisher=TidBITS |date=19 March 2007 |access-date=23 March 2007}}</ref> They are typically infrequently updated.

The Floodgap list referred to is at [https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher/1/new Floodgap: new Gopher servers] and does not itself refer to April Fools' Day.</ref>\n\n*In November 2014 Veronica indexed 144 gopher servers,<ref name=\"Veronica report\" /> reflecting a small drop from 2012, but within these servers Veronica indexed approximately 3&nbsp;million unique selectors.\n\n*In March 2016 Veronica indexed 135 gopher servers,<ref name=\"Veronica report\" /> within which it indexed approximately 4&nbsp;million unique selectors. \n\n*In March 2017 Veronica indexed 133 gopher servers,<ref name=\"Veronica report\" /> within which it indexed approximately 4.9&nbsp;million unique selectors.\n\n*In May 2018 Veronica indexed 260 gopher servers, <ref name=\"Veronica report\" /> within which it indexed approximately 3.7&nbsp;million unique selectors.\n\n==Technical details==\nThe conceptualization of knowledge in \"Gopher space\" or a \"cloud\" as specific information in a particular file, and the prominence of the FTP, influenced the technology and the resulting functionality of Gopher.\n\n=== Gopher characteristics ===\nGopher is designed to function and to appear much like a mountable read-only global [[Distributed file system|network file system]] (and software, such as [[gopherfs]], is available that can actually mount a Gopher server as a [[Filesystem in Userspace|FUSE]] resource).  At a minimum, whatever a person can do with data files on a [[CD-ROM]], one can do on Gopher.\n\nA Gopher system consists of a series of hierarchical hyperlinkable menus. The choice of menu items and titles is controlled by the administrator of the server.\n{{Double image|center|Floodgap gopher top menu.PNG|250|Floodgap gopher fun menu.PNG|{{#expr: (183 * 1249 / 755) round 0}}|The top level menu of a Gopher server. Selecting the \"Fun and Games\" menu item...|...takes the user to the \"Fun and Games\" menu.}}\n\nSimilar to a file on a Web server, a file on a Gopher server can be linked to as a menu item from any other Gopher server. Many servers take advantage of this inter-server linking to provide a directory of other servers that the user can access.\n\n===Protocol===\nThe Gopher protocol was first described in RFC 1436. [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] has assigned [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[List of well-known ports (computing)|port]] 70 to the Gopher protocol.\n\nThe protocol is simple to negotiate, making it possible to browse without using a client. A standard gopher session may therefore appear as follows:\n\n<pre>\n/Reference\n1CIA World Factbook     /Archives/mirrors/textfiles.com/politics/CIA    gopher.quux.org 70\n0Jargon 4.2.0   /Reference/Jargon 4.2.0 gopher.quux.org 70      +\n1Online Libraries       /Reference/Online Libraries     gopher.quux.org 70     +\n1RFCs: Internet Standards       /Computers/Standards and Specs/RFC      gopher.quux.org 70\n1U.S. Gazetteer /Reference/U.S. Gazetteer       gopher.quux.org 70      +\niThis file contains information on United States        fake    (NULL)  0\nicities, counties, and geographical areas.  It has      fake    (NULL)  0\nilatitude/longitude, population, land and water area,   fake    (NULL)  0\niand ZIP codes. fake    (NULL)  0\ni       fake    (NULL)  0\niTo search for a city, enter the city's name.  To search        fake    (NULL) 0\nifor a county, use the name plus County -- for instance,        fake    (NULL) 0\niDallas County. fake    (NULL)  0\n</pre>\n\nHere, the client has established a TCP connection with the server on port 70, the standard gopher port. The client then sends a string followed by a carriage return followed by a [[Newline|line feed]] (a \"CR + LF\" sequence). This is the selector, which identifies the document to be retrieved. If the item selector were an empty line, the default directory would be selected. The server then replies with the requested item and closes the connection. According to the protocol, before the connection is closed, the server should send a full-stop (i.e., a period character) on a line by itself. However, as is the case here, not all servers conform to this part of the protocol and the server may close the connection without returning the final full-stop.\n\nIn this example, the item sent back is a gopher menu, a directory consisting of a sequence of lines each of which describes an item that can be retrieved. Most clients will display these as [[hypertext]] links, and so allow the user to navigate through gopherspace by following the links.<ref name=\"wwwunleashed\" />\n\nAll lines in a gopher menu are terminated by \"CR + LF\", and consist of five fields: the ''item type'' as the very first character (see below), the ''display string'' (i.e., the description text to display), a ''selector'' (i.e., a file-system pathname), ''host name'' (i.e., the domain name of the server on which the item resides), and ''port'' (i.e., the port number used by that server). The item type and display string are joined without a space; the other fields are separated by the tab character.\n\nBecause of the simplicity of the Gopher protocol, tools such as [[netcat]] make it possible to download Gopher content easily from the command line:\n echo jacks/jack.exe | nc gopher.example.org 70 > jack.exe\nThe protocol is also supported by [[cURL]] as of 7.21.2-DEV.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curl: Re: Gopher patches for cURL (includes test suite)|url=http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-08/0339.html|access-date=25 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927155457/http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-08/0339.html|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Source code of a menu===\nGopher menu items are defined by lines of [[tab-separated values]] in a [[text file]]. This file is sometimes called a ''gophermap''. As the [[source code]] to a gopher menu, a gophermap is roughly analogous to an [[HTML]] file for a [[web page]]. Each tab-separated line (called a ''selector line'') gives the [[client software]] a description of the menu item: what it is, what it's called, and where it leads. The client displays the menu items in the order that they appear in the gophermap.\n\nThe first character in a selector line indicates the ''item type'', which tells the client what kind of file or protocol the menu item points to. This helps the client decide what to do with it. Gopher's item types are a more basic precursor to the [[media type]] system used by the Web and [[email attachment]]s.\n\nThe item type is followed by the ''user display string'' (a description or label that represents the item in the menu); the selector (a [[Path (computing)|path]] or other string for the resource on the server); the ''hostname'' (the [[domain name]] or [[IP address]] of the server), and the [[network port]].\n\nFor example: The following selector line generates a link to the \"/home\" [[Directory (computing)|directory]] at the [[subdomain]] gopher.floodgap.com, on [[Port (computer networking)|port]] 70. The item type of {{var|1}} indicates that the resource is a Gopher menu. The string \"Floodgap Home\" is what the user  sees in the menu.\n\n 1Floodgap Home\t/home\tgopher.floodgap.com\t70\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Item type !! User display string !! Selector !! Hostname !! [[Port (computer networking)|Port]] \n|-\n| 1 || Floodgap Home || /home || gopher.floodgap.com || 70\n|}\n\nIn addition to selector lines, a gophermap may contain ''comment lines''. Comment lines are not for [[code comments]]; rather, they are lines of text sent to the client to display alongside the menu items, such as for a menu description or welcome message. A comment line contains no [[tab character]]s.\n\n====Item types====\nIn a Gopher menu's source code, a one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. This code may either be a digit or a letter of the alphabet; letters are [[case-sensitive]].\n\nThe [[technical specification]] for Gopher, RFC 1436, defines 14 item types. A one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. Item type {{code|3}} is an [[error code]] for [[exception handling]]. Gopher client authors improvised item types {{code|h}} (HTML), {{code|i}} (informational message), and {{code|s}} ([[sound file]]) after the publication of RFC 1436.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" {{partial|Canonical types}}\n|-\n| {{okay|'''0'''}} || [[Text file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''1'''}} || Gopher submenu\n|-\n| {{okay|'''2'''}} || [[CCSO Nameserver]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''3'''}} || Error code returned by a Gopher server to indicate failure\n|-\n| {{okay|'''4'''}} || [[BinHex]]-encoded file (primarily for [[Macintosh]] computers)\n|-\n| {{okay|'''5'''}} || [[DOS]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''6'''}} || [[uuencoded]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''7'''}} || Gopher [[full-text search]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''8'''}} || [[Telnet]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''9'''}} || [[Binary file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''+'''}} || Mirror or alternate server (for [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] or in case of primary server [[downtime]])\n|-\n| {{okay|'''g'''}} || [[GIF]] file\n|-\n| {{okay|'''I'''}} || [[Image file]]\n|-\n| {{okay|'''T'''}} || [[Telnet 3270]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" {{unofficial|Non-canonical types}} \n|-\n| style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''h''' || [[HTML]] file\n|-\n| style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''i''' || Informational message\n|-\n| style=\"background:#adffe6; text-align:center\" | '''s''' || [[Sound file]] (especially the [[WAV]] format) \n|}\n\n====URL links====\nHistorically, to create a link to a Web server, \"GET /\" was used as a pseudo-selector to emulate an [[HTTP]] [[GET request]]. [[John Goerzen]] created an addition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gopher.quux.org/Archives/Mailing%20Lists/gopher/gopher.2002-02 |title=Gopher: gopher.2002-02 |publisher=Gopher.quux.org |date= |access-date=2015-08-12}}</ref> to the Gopher protocol, commonly referred to as \"[[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] links\", that allows links to any protocol that supports URLs. For example, to create a link to http://gopher.quux.org/, the item type is {{code|h}}, the display string is the title of the link, the item selector is \"<nowiki>URL:http://gopher.quux.org/</nowiki>\", and the domain and port are that of the originating Gopher server (so that clients that do not support URL links will query the server and receive an HTML redirection page).\n\n===Related technology===\nThe master Gopherspace search engine is [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]]. Veronica offers a keyword search of all the public Internet Gopher server menu titles. A Veronica search produces a menu of Gopher items, each of which is a direct pointer to a Gopher data source.
