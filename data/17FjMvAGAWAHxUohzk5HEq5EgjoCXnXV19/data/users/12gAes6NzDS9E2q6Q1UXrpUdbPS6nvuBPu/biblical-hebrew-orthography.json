The old Babylonian vocalization wrote a superscript ס above the ש to indicate it took the value /s/, while the Masoretes added the [[shin dot]] to distinguish between the two varieties of the letter.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Sperber|1959|p=81}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=77}}</ref> The Aramaic script began developing special final forms for certain letters in the 5th century&nbsp;BCE, though this was not always a consistent rule (as reflected in the Qumran practice).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Yardeni|1997|p=38}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|p=210}}</ref>\n\n==''Matres lectionis''==\n\nThe original Hebrew alphabet consisted only of [[consonants]], but gradually the letters א, ה, ו, י, also became used to indicate vowels, known as ''[[matres lectionis]]'' (Latin: \"mothers of reading\") when used in this function.<ref name=\"s17\" /><ref name=\"to1\" /> It is thought that this was a product of phonetic development: for instance, *bayt 'house' shifted to בֵּית in construct state but retained its spelling.<ref name=\"b6\">{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=6}}</ref> While no examples of early Hebrew orthography have been found, older [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and [[Moabite language|Moabite]] texts show how First Temple period Hebrew would have been written.<ref name=\"to1\">{{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|pp=221–223}}</ref> Phoenician inscriptions from the tenth century&nbsp;BCE do not indicate ''matres lectionis'' in the middle or the end of a word: ז ( = זה), לפנ (= לפני), similarly to the Hebrew [[Gezer Calendar]]: שערמ (= שעורים), ירח (= ירחו?).<ref name=\"to1\" /> ''Matres lectionis'' were later added word-finally, for instance the [[Mesha inscription]] has בנתי (= בניתי), בללה (= בלילה); however at this stage they were not yet used word-medially, compare [[Siloam inscription]] זדה versus אש =) איש).<ref name=\"to1\" /> The relative terms ''defective'' and ''full'' or ''plene'' are used to refer to alternative spellings of a word with less or more ''matres lectionis'', respectively.<ref name=\"to1\" /><ref group=\"nb\">[[Ktiv male]], the Hebrew term for full spelling, has become de rigueur in Modern Hebrew.</ref>\n\nThe Hebrew Bible was presumably originally written in a more defective orthography than found in any of the texts known today.<ref name=\"to1\" /> Of the extant textual witnesses of the Hebrew Bible, the Masoretic text is generally the most conservative in its use of ''matres lectionis'', with the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] and its forebearers being more full and the Qumran tradition showing the most liberal use of vowel letters.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|pp=96,108,222}}</ref> The Masoretic text mostly uses vowel letters for long vowels, showing the tendency to mark all long vowels except for word-internal /aː/.<ref name=\"b6\" /><ref group=\"nb\">There are rare-cases of <א> being used medially as a true vowel letter, e.g. דָּאג for the usual דָּג 'fish'. Most cases, however, of <&#x200E;א> being used as a vowel letter stem from conservative spelling of words which originally contained /ʔ/, e.g. רֹאשׁ 'head' from original */raʔʃ/. See {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=86}}.</ref> However, there are a number of exceptions, e.g. when the following syllable contains a vowel letter (as in קֹלֹוֹת 'voices' rather than קוֹלוֹת) or when a vowel letter already marks a consonant (so גּוֹיִם 'nations' rather than גּוֹיִים*), and within the Bible there is often little consistency in spelling.<ref name=\"b6\" /> In the Qumran tradition, o- and u-type vowels, including short holem (מושה, פוה, חושך), qamets hatuf (חוכמה, כול), and hatef qamets (אוניה), are usually represented by <ו>.<ref name=\"tq1\">{{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|pp=108–109}}</ref><ref name=\"sq\">{{Harvcoltxt|Sáenz-Badillos|1993|p=136}}</ref> <י> is generally used for both long [iː] and tsere (אבילים, מית), and final [iː] is often written as יא- in analogy to היא, הביא, e.g. כיא, sometimes מיא.<ref name=\"tq1\" /><ref name=\"sq\" /> <ה> is found finally in forms like חוטה (Tiberian חוטא), קורה (Tiberian קורא), while <א> may be used for a-quality in final position (e.g. עליהא) and in medial position (e.g. יאתום)<ref name=\"tq1\" /> Pre-Samaritan and Samaritan texts show full spellings in many categories (e.g. כוחי vs. Masoretic כחי in Genesis 49:3) but only rarely show full spelling of the Qumran type (but see Genesis 24:41b Samaritan נקיא vs. Masoretic נקי).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|pp=96–97}}</ref>\n\n== Vocalization ==\n{{Further|Tiberian vocalization|Babylonian vocalization|Palestinian vocalization|Secunda (Hexapla)}}\n\nIn general the vowels of Biblical Hebrew were not indicated in the original text, but various sources attest them at various stages of development. Greek and Latin transcriptions of words from the Biblical text provide early evidence of the nature of Biblical Hebrew vowels.

For example, by the time of Origen <η αι> were pronounced [iː ɛː], a merger which had already begun around 100&nbsp;BCE, while in the Secunda they are used to represent Hebrew /eː aj/, see {{Harvcoltxt|Janssens|1982|pp=14}}.</ref>). In the 7th and 8th centuries&nbsp;CE various systems of vocalic notation were developed to indicate vowels in the Biblical text.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ben-Ḥayyim|2000|p=5}}</ref> The most prominent, best preserved, and the only system still in use, is the [[Tiberian vocalization]] system, created by scholars known as Masoretes around 850&nbsp;CE.<ref name=\"b7\">{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=7}}</ref><ref name=\"rvoc\" /> There are also various extant manuscripts making use of less common vocalization systems ([[Babylonian vocalization|Babylonian]], and [[Palestinian vocalization|Palestinian]]), known as ''superlinear vocalizations'' because their vocalization marks are placed above the letters.<ref name=\"b7\" /><ref name=\"rvoc\" /><ref group=\"nb\">The Palestinian system has two main subtypes and shows great variation. {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=7}} The Babylonian vocalization occurred in two main types (simple / ''einfach'' and complex / ''kompliziert''), with various subgroups differing as to their affinity with the Tiberian tradition. {{Harvcoltxt|Sáenz-Badillos|1993|pp=97–99}}</ref><ref group=\"nb\">In the Babylonian and Palestinian systems only the most important vowels were written, see {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=118}}.</ref> In addition, the [[Samaritan Hebrew|Samaritan]] reading tradition is independent of these systems, and was occasionally notated with a separate vocalization system.<ref name=\"rvoc\">{{Harvcoltxt|Rendsburg|1997|pp=68–69}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ben-Ḥayyim|2000|p=6}}</ref><ref group=\"nb\">Almost all vocalized manuscripts use the [[Masoretic Text]]. However there are some vocalized Samaritan manuscripts from the Middle Ages, see {{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|p=40}}</ref> These systems often record vowels at different stages of historical development; for example, the name of the Judge [[Samson]] is recorded in Greek as Σαμψών ''Sampsōn'' with the first vowel as /a/, while Tiberian שִמְשוֹן /ʃimʃon/ with /i/ shows the effect of the law of attenuation.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Waltke|O'Connor|1990|p=25}}</ref> All of these systems together are used to reconstruct the original vocalization of Biblical Hebrew.\n\nThe Tiberian vowel-sign ''šwa'' (ְ ) was used both to indicate lack of a vowel (''quiescent šwa'') and as another symbol to represent the phoneme /ă/, also represented by ''ḥataf pataḥ'' (ֲ).<ref name=\"b117-118\">{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=117–118}}</ref><ref name=\"b105-106\">{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=105–106}}</ref> Before a laryngeal-pharyngeal, mobile šwa was pronounced as an ultrashort copy of the following vowel, e.g. וּבָקְעָה [uvɔqɔ̆ʕɔ], and as [ĭ] preceding /j/, e.g. תְדֵמְּיוּ֫נִי /θăðammĭjuni/.<ref name=\"b105-106\" /> By contrast, ḥataf pataḥ would only used be used when pronounced [ă].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=118}}</ref> In the Palestinian system these echo vowels were written with full vowel letters, see {{Harvcoltxt|Yahalom|1997|pp=12,18–19}} Pronunciation of šwa is attested by alternations in manuscripts like ארֲריך~ארְריך, ואשמֳעָה~ואשמְעָה.<ref name=\"b105-106\" /> Use of ḥataf vowels was considered mandatory under gutturals but optional under other letters.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Yeivin|1980|p=283}}</ref>\n\n== Punctuation ==\n\nAt an early stage, documents written in the paleo-Hebrew script were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran.<ref name=\"tsp\" /> Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for Biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nachmanides in his introduction to the Torah.<ref name=\"tsp\" /> Word division using spaces was commonly used from the beginning of the 7th century&nbsp;BCE for documents in the Aramaic script.<ref name=\"tsp\">{{Harvcoltxt|Tov|1992|pp=208–209}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses [[cantillation]] marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=7,143}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Yeivin|1980|pp=157–158}}</ref>\n\n== Reading traditions ==\n\nWhile the Tiberian, Babylonian, and Palestinian reading traditions are extinct, various other systems of pronunciation have evolved over time, notably the [[Yemenite Hebrew language|Yemenite]], [[Sephardi Hebrew language|Sephardi]], [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]], and [[Samaritan Hebrew language|Samaritan]] traditions. [[Modern Hebrew]] pronunciation is also used by some to read Biblical texts. The modern reading traditions do not stem solely from the Tiberian system; for instance, the Sephardic tradition's distinction between qamatz gadol and qatan is pre-Tiberian.<ref name=\"length\">{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=110–111}}</ref> However, the only orthographic system used to mark vowels is the Tiberian vocalization.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Biblical Hebrew]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book|last = Ben-Ḥayyim|first = Ze'ev|title = A Grammar of Samaritan Hebrew|year = 2000|publisher = The Hebrew University Magnes Press|location= Jerusalem|ref=harv|isbn=1-57506-047-7}}\n*{{cite book|last = [[Joshua Blau]]|first =|title = Phonology and Morphology of Biblical Hebrew|year = 2010|publisher = Eisenbrauns|location= Winona Lake, Indiana|ref=harv}}\n*{{citation|last=Rendsburg |first=Gary A. |year=1997 |contribution=Ancient Hebrew Phonology |pages=65–83 |title=Phonologies of Asia and Africa |editor-last=Kaye |editor-first=Alan |publisher=Eisenbrauns |url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/component/docman/doc_view/93-ancient-hebrew-phonology |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720041841/http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/component/docman/doc_view/93-ancient-hebrew-phonology |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}\n*{{cite book|last=Sáenz-Badillos|first=Angel|title=A History of the Hebrew Language|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Tov|first=Emanuel|title=Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible|year=1992|publisher=Augsburg Fortress|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0-8006-2687-7|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Waltke|first1=Bruce K.|last2 = O'Connor|first2=M.|title = An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax|year=1990|publisher=Eisenbrauns|location=Winona Lake, Indiana|isbn=0-931464-31-5|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last = Yardeni|first = Ada|title = The Book of Hebrew Script|year = 1997|publisher = Carta|location= Jerusalem|isbn=965-220-369-6|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Yeivin|first=Israel|title = Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah|year=1980|publisher=Scholars Press|isbn=0-89130-373-1|ref=harv}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n{{Hebrew language}}\n{{Language orthographies}}\n\n[[Category:Language of the Hebrew Bible|Orthography]]\n[[Category:Hebrew language|Orthograpy, Biblical]]",
