These organisms are classified as a [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], fungi, which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.\n\nA characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is [[chitin]] in their [[cell wall]]s. Similar to animals, fungi are [[heterotroph]]s; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting [[digestive enzyme]]s into their environment. Fungi do not [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesize]]. Growth is their means of mobility, except for spores (a few of which are flagellated), which may travel through the air or water. Fungi are the principal [[Decomposer|decomposers]] in ecological systems. These and other differences place fungi in a single group of related organisms, named the ''Eumycota'' (''true fungi'' or ''Eumycetes''), which share a [[common ancestor]] (form a ''[[monophyletic]] group''), an interpretation that is also strongly supported by [[molecular phylogenetics]]. This fungal group is distinct from the structurally similar [[Mycetozoa|myxomycetes]] (slime molds) and [[oomycete]]s (water molds). The discipline of [[biology]] devoted to the study of fungi is known as [[mycology]] (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] μύκης ''mykes'', mushroom). In the past, mycology was regarded as a branch of [[botany]], although it is now known fungi are genetically more closely related to animals than to plants.\n\nAbundant worldwide, most fungi are inconspicuous because of the small size of their structures, and their [[Crypsis|cryptic]] lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include [[Symbiosis|symbionts]] of plants, animals, or other fungi and also [[parasites]]. They may become noticeable when [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting]], either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycling]] and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and [[Tuber (genus)|truffles]]; as a [[Bread#Leavening|leavening]] agent for bread; and in the [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] of various food products, such as [[wine]], [[beer]], and [[soy sauce]]. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of [[antibiotic]]s, and, more recently, various [[enzyme]]s produced by fungi are used [[Enzyme#Industrial applications|industrially]] and in [[protease#Occurrence|detergents]]. Fungi are also used as [[biological pesticide]]s to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce [[Bioactive compound|bioactive]] compounds called [[mycotoxin]]s, such as [[alkaloid]]s and [[polyketide]]s, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain [[psychotropic]] compounds and are consumed [[Recreational drug use|recreationally]] or in traditional [[Entheogen|spiritual ceremonies]]. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant [[Pathogenic fungi|pathogens]] of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., [[rice blast disease]]) or food [[Food spoilage|spoilage]] can have a large impact on human [[Food security|food supplies]] and local economies.\n\nThe fungus kingdom encompasses an enormous diversity of [[taxon|taxa]] with varied ecologies, [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] strategies, and [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] ranging from unicellular aquatic [[chytrid]]s to large mushrooms. However, little is known of the true [[biodiversity]] of Kingdom Fungi, which has been estimated at 2.2 million to 3.8 million species.<ref name=Lucking2017/>  Of these, only about 120,000 have been described, with over 8,000 species known to be detrimental to plants and at least 300 that can be pathogenic to humans.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2017120|title=Stop neglecting fungi|author=|date=25 July 2017|journal=Nature Microbiology|volume=2|issue=8|pages=17120|doi=10.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.120|pmid=28741610}}</ref> Ever since the pioneering 18th and 19th century [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] works of [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]], and [[Elias Magnus Fries]], fungi have been [[biological classification|classified]] according to their morphology (e.g., characteristics such as spore color or microscopic features) or [[physiology]]. Advances in [[molecular genetics]] have opened the way for [[DNA sequencing|DNA analysis]] to be incorporated into taxonomy, which has sometimes challenged the historical groupings based on morphology and other traits. [[Phylogenetic]] studies published in the last decade have helped reshape the classification within Kingdom Fungi, which is divided into one [[Kingdom (biology)#Definition and associated terms|subkingdom]], seven [[phylum|phyla]], and ten subphyla.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe English word ''fungus'' is directly adopted from the [[Latin]] ''fungus'' (mushroom), used in the writings of [[Horace]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]].<ref name=Simpson1979/> This in turn is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ''sphongos'' (σφόγγος \"sponge\"), which refers to the [[macroscopic]] structures and morphology of mushrooms and molds;<ref name=Ainsworth2>Ainsworth, p. 2.</ref> the root is also used in other languages, such as the German ''Schwamm'' (\"sponge\") and ''Schimmel'' (\"mold\").<ref name=\"Mitzka1960\"/> \n\nThe word ''mycology'' is derived from the Greek ''mykes'' (μύκης \"mushroom\") and ''logos'' (λόγος \"discourse\").<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., p. 1.</ref> It denotes the scientific study of fungi.  The Latin adjectival form of \"mycology\" (''mycologicæ'') appeared as early as 1796 in a book on the subject by [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Persoon |first1=Christiaan Hendrik |title=Observationes Mycologicae |date=1796 |publisher=Peter Philipp Wolf |location=Leipzig, (Germany) |volume=Part 1 |language=Latin |url=http://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/ing/Libro.php?Libro=5680}}</ref> The word appeared in English as early as 1824 in a book by [[Robert Kaye Greville]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greville |first1=Robert Kaye |title=Scottish Cryptogamie Flora: Or Coloured Figures and Descriptions of Cryptogamic Plants, Belonging Chiefly to the Order Fungi |date=1824 |publisher=Maclachland and Stewart |location=Edinburgh, Scotland |volume=vol. 2 |page=65 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433008943957;view=1up;seq=45}}  From p. 65:  \"This little plant will probably not prove rare in Great Britain, when mycology shall be more studied.\"</ref> In 1836 the English naturalist [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]]'s publication ''The English Flora of Sir James Edward Smith, Vol. 5.'' also refers to mycology as the study of fungi. <ref name=Ainsworth2>Ainsworth, p. 2.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=James Edward |last2=Hooker |first2=William Jackson, ed. |editor1-last=Berkeley |editor1-first=Miles Joseph |title=The English Flora of Sir James Edward Smith |date=1836 |publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green & Longman |location=London, England |volume=vol. 5, part II:  \"Class XXIV.

Like plants, fungi often grow in soil and, in the case of [[mushroom]]s, form conspicuous [[fruit bodies]], which sometimes resemble plants such as [[mosses]]. The fungi are now considered a separate kingdom, distinct from both plants and animals, from which they appear to have [[genetic divergence|diverged]] around one billion years ago (around the start of the [[Neoproterozoic]] Era).<ref name=Bruns2006/><ref name=\"Baldauf1993\"/> Some morphological, biochemical, and genetic features are shared with other organisms, while others are unique to the fungi, clearly separating them from the other kingdoms:\n\nShared features:\n* With other [[eukaryote]]s: Fungal cells contain [[membrane-bound]] [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] with [[chromosomes]] that contain DNA with [[Noncoding DNA|noncoding regions]] called [[intron]]s and coding regions called [[exons]]. Fungi have membrane-bound cytoplasmic [[organelles]] such as [[mitochondria]], [[sterol]]-containing membranes, and [[ribosomes]] of the [[80S]] type.<ref>Deacon, p. 4.</ref> They have a characteristic range of soluble carbohydrates and storage compounds, including [[sugar alcohol]]s (e.g., [[mannitol]]), [[disaccharide]]s, (e.g., [[trehalose]]), and [[polysaccharide]]s (e.g., [[glycogen]], which is also found in animals<ref name=Deacon4>Deacon, pp. 128–129.</ref>).\n* With animals: Fungi lack [[chloroplast]]s and are [[heterotroph]]ic organisms and so require preformed [[organic compound]]s as energy sources.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 28–33.</ref>\n* With plants: Fungi have a cell wall<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 31–32.</ref> and [[vacuole]]s.<ref name=Shoji2006/> They reproduce by both sexual and asexual means, and like [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|basal]] plant groups (such as [[fern]]s and [[moss]]es) produce [[spore]]s.

To overcome this limitation, some fungi, such as ''[[Armillaria]]'', form [[Mycelial cord|rhizomorphs]],<ref name=Mikhail2005/> which resemble and perform functions similar to the [[root]]s of plants.

The [[Species#The isolation species concept in more detail|biological species concept]] discriminates species based on their ability to [[mating in fungi|mate]]. The application of [[Molecular biology|molecular]] tools, such as [[DNA sequencing]] and phylogenetic analysis, to study diversity has greatly enhanced the resolution and added robustness to estimates of [[genetic diversity]] within various taxonomic groups.<ref name=Hibbett2007/>\n\n== Mycology ==\n[[Mycology]] is the branch of [[biology]] concerned with the systematic study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy, and their use to humans as a source of medicine, food, and [[entheogen|psychotropic substances]] consumed for religious purposes, as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. The field of [[phytopathology]], the study of plant diseases, is closely related because many plant pathogens are fungi.<ref name=Struck2006/>\n\n[[File:Pier Antonio Micheli.jpg|thumb|upright|In 1729, [[Pier Antonio Micheli]] first published descriptions of fungi.]]\n\nThe use of fungi by humans dates back to prehistory; [[Ötzi the Iceman]], a well-preserved mummy of a 5,300-year-old [[Neolithic]] man found frozen in the Austrian Alps, carried two species of [[polypore]] mushrooms that may have been used as [[tinder]] (''[[Fomes fomentarius]]''), or for medicinal purposes (''[[Piptoporus betulinus]]'').<ref name=Peintner1998/> Ancient peoples have used fungi as food sources–often unknowingly–for millennia, in the preparation of leavened bread and fermented juices. Some of the oldest written records contain references to the destruction of crops that were probably caused by pathogenic fungi.<ref>Ainsworth, p. 1.</ref>\n\n=== History ===\nMycology is a relatively new science that became systematic after the development of the [[microscope]] in the 17th century. Although fungal spores were first observed by [[Giambattista della Porta]] in 1588, the seminal work in the development of mycology is considered to be the publication of [[Pier Antonio Micheli]]'s 1729 work ''Nova plantarum genera''.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 1–2.</ref> Micheli not only observed spores but also showed that, under the proper conditions, they could be induced into growing into the same species of fungi from which they originated.<ref>Ainsworth, p. 18.</ref> Extending the use of the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial system of nomenclature]] introduced by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Species plantarum]]'' (1753), the Dutch [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] (1761–1836) established the first classification of mushrooms with such skill as to be considered a founder of modern mycology. Later, [[Elias Magnus Fries]] (1794–1878) further elaborated the [[Biological classification|classification]] of fungi, using spore color and microscopic characteristics, methods still used by taxonomists today. Other notable early contributors to mycology in the 17th–19th and early 20th centuries include [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]], [[August Carl Joseph Corda]], [[Anton de Bary]], the brothers [[Louis René Tulasne|Louis René]] and [[Charles Tulasne]], [[Arthur Henry Reginald Buller|Arthur H. R. Buller]], [[Curtis Gates Lloyd|Curtis G. Lloyd]], and [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]]. The 20th century has seen a modernization of mycology that has come from advances in [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]], and [[biotechnology]]. The use of [[DNA sequencing]] technologies and phylogenetic analysis has provided new insights into fungal relationships and [[biodiversity]], and has challenged traditional morphology-based groupings in fungal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].<ref name=Hawksworth2006/>\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n=== Microscopic structures ===\n[[File:Penicillium labeled cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|alt=Monochrome micrograph showing ''Penicillium'' hyphae as long, transparent, tube-like structures a few micrometres across.

Hyphae grow at their tips (apices); new hyphae are typically formed by emergence of new tips along existing hyphae by a process called ''branching'', or occasionally growing hyphal tips fork, giving rise to two parallel-growing hyphae.<ref name=Harris2008/> Hyphae also sometimes fuse when they come into contact, a process called hyphal fusion (or [[anastomosis]]). These growth processes lead to the development of a [[mycelium]], an interconnected network of hyphae.<ref name=\"Alexopoulos et al., p. 30\"/> Hyphae can be either [[septum|septate]] or [[coenocytic]]. Septate hyphae are divided into compartments separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, that are formed at [[right angle]]s to the cell wall giving the hypha its shape), with each compartment containing one or more nuclei; coenocytic hyphae are not compartmentalized.<ref>Deacon, p. 51.</ref> Septa have [[Pit connection#Characteristics|pores]] that allow [[cytoplasm]], [[organelle]]s, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the dolipore septum in fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota.<ref>Deacon, p. 57.</ref> Coenocytic hyphae are in essence [[multinucleate]] supercells.<ref name=Chang2004/>\n\nMany species have developed specialized hyphal structures for nutrient uptake from living hosts; examples include [[haustoria]] in plant-parasitic species of most fungal phyla, and [[arbuscular mycorrhiza|arbuscules]] of several [[mycorrhiza]]l fungi, which penetrate into the host cells to consume nutrients.<ref name=Parniske2008/>\n\nAlthough fungi are [[opisthokont]]s—a grouping of evolutionarily related organisms broadly characterized by a single posterior [[flagellum]]—all phyla except for the [[chytrids]] have lost their posterior flagella.<ref name=Steenkamp2006/> Fungi are unusual among the eukaryotes in having a cell wall that, in addition to [[glucan]]s (e.g., β-1,3-glucan) and other typical components, also contains the [[biopolymer]] chitin.<ref name=Stevens2006/>\n\n=== Macroscopic structures ===\n[[File:Armillaria ostoyae MO.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A cluster of large, thick-stem, light-brown gilled mushrooms growing at the base of a tree|''[[Armillaria solidipes]]'']]\nFungal mycelia can become visible to the naked eye, for example, on various surfaces and [[substrate (biology)|substrates]], such as damp walls and spoiled food, where they are commonly called [[mold]]s.

This form of [[radiotrophic fungus|\"radiotrophic\"]] growth has been described for only a few species, the effects on growth rates are small, and the underlying [[Biophysics|biophysical]] and biochemical processes are not well known.<ref name=Dadachova2007/> This process might bear similarity to [[carbon fixation|CO<sub>2</sub> fixation]] via [[Visible spectrum|visible light]], but instead uses ionizing radiation as a source of energy.<ref name=Dadachova2008/>\n\n== Reproduction ==\n[[File:Polyporus squamosus Molter.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two thickly stemmed brownish mushrooms with scales on the upper surface, growing out of a tree trunk|''[[Polyporus squamosus]]'']]\nFungal reproduction is complex, reflecting the differences in lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 48–56.</ref> It is estimated that a third of all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages within the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of a species, the [[teleomorph]] and the [[anamorph]].<ref>Kirk ''et al''., p. 633.</ref> Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized structures for sexual or asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing [[propagule]]s.\n\n=== Asexual reproduction ===\n[[Asexual reproduction]] occurs via vegetative spores ([[conidium|conidia]]) or through [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|mycelial fragmentation]]. Mycelial fragmentation occurs when a fungal mycelium separates into pieces, and each component grows into a separate mycelium. Mycelial fragmentation and vegetative spores maintain [[clone (genetics)|clonal]] populations adapted to a specific [[Ecological niche|niche]], and allow more rapid dispersal than sexual reproduction.<ref name=Heitman2005/> The \"Fungi imperfecti\" (fungi lacking the perfect or sexual stage) or [[Deuteromycota]] comprise all the species that lack an observable sexual cycle.<ref name=Alcamo2004/> [[Deuteromycota]] is not an accepted taxonomic clade, and is now taken to mean simply fungi that lack a known sexual stage.\n\n=== Sexual reproduction ===\n{{see also|Mating in fungi|Sexual selection in fungi}}\nSexual reproduction with [[meiosis]] has been directly observed in all fungal phyla except [[Glomeromycota]] <ref name=Redecker2006/> (genetic analysis suggests meiosis in Glomeromycota as well). It differs in many aspects from sexual reproduction in animals or plants. Differences also exist between fungal groups and can be used to discriminate species by morphological differences in sexual structures and reproductive strategies.<ref name=Guarro1999/><ref name=Taylor2000/> Mating experiments between fungal isolates may identify species on the basis of biological species concepts.<ref name=Taylor2000/> The major fungal groupings have initially been delineated based on the morphology of their sexual structures and spores; for example, the spore-containing structures, [[ascus|asci]] and [[basidium|basidia]], can be used in the identification of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, respectively. Fungi employ two [[mating system]]s: [[heterothallic]] species allow mating only between individuals of opposite [[mating type]], whereas [[homothallic]] species can mate, and sexually reproduce, with any other individual or itself.<ref name=Metzenberg1990/>\n\nMost fungi have both a [[haploid]] and a [[diploid]] stage in their life cycles. In sexually reproducing fungi, compatible individuals may combine by fusing their hyphae together into an interconnected network; this process, [[anastomosis]], is required for the initiation of the sexual cycle. Many ascomycetes and basidiomycetes go through a [[dikaryotic]] stage, in which the nuclei inherited from the two parents do not combine immediately after cell fusion, but remain separate in the hyphal cells (see [[heterokaryosis]]).<ref>Jennings and Lysek, pp. 107–114.</ref>\n[[File:Morelasci.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Microscopic view of numerous translucent or transparent elongated sac-like structures each containing eight spheres lined up in a row|The 8-spore asci of ''[[Morchella elata]]'', viewed with [[phase contrast microscopy]]]]\n\nIn ascomycetes, dikaryotic hyphae of the [[hymenium]] (the spore-bearing tissue layer) form a characteristic ''hook'' at the hyphal septum. During [[cell division]], formation of the hook ensures proper distribution of the newly divided nuclei into the apical and basal hyphal compartments. An ascus (plural ''asci'') is then formed, in which [[karyogamy]] (nuclear fusion) occurs. Asci are embedded in an [[ascocarp]], or fruiting body. Karyogamy in the asci is followed immediately by meiosis and the production of [[ascospore]]s. After dispersal, the ascospores may germinate and form a new haploid mycelium.<ref>Deacon, p. 31.</ref>\n\nSexual reproduction in basidiomycetes is similar to that of the ascomycetes. Compatible haploid hyphae fuse to produce a dikaryotic mycelium. However, the dikaryotic phase is more extensive in the basidiomycetes, often also present in the vegetatively growing mycelium. A specialized anatomical structure, called a [[clamp connection]], is formed at each hyphal septum. As with the structurally similar hook in the ascomycetes, the clamp connection in the basidiomycetes is required for controlled transfer of nuclei during cell division, to maintain the dikaryotic stage with two genetically different nuclei in each hyphal compartment.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 492–493.</ref> A [[basidiocarp]] is formed in which club-like structures known as [[basidia]] generate haploid [[basidiospores]] after karyogamy and meiosis.<ref>Jennings and Lysek, p. 142.</ref> The most commonly known basidiocarps are mushrooms, but they may also take other forms (see [[Fungus#Morphology|Morphology]] section).\n\nIn fungi formerly classified as [[Zygomycota]], haploid hyphae of two individuals fuse, forming a [[gametangium]], a specialized cell structure that becomes a fertile [[gamete]]-producing cell. The gametangium develops into a [[zygospore]], a thick-walled spore formed by the union of gametes. When the zygospore germinates, it undergoes [[meiosis]], generating new haploid hyphae, which may then form asexual [[sporangiospore]]s. These sporangiospores allow the fungus to rapidly disperse and germinate into new genetically identical haploid fungal mycelia.<ref>Deacon, pp. 21–24.</ref>\n\n=== Spore dispersal ===\nBoth asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores are often actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as traveling through the air over long distances.[[File:Cyathus stercoreus Fruchtkörper.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A brown, cup-shaped fungus with several greyish disc-shaped structures lying within|The bird's nest fungus ''[[Cyathus stercoreus]]'']] Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as [[hydrophobin]]s), enable efficient spore ejection.<ref name=Linder2005/> For example, the structure of the [[ascus|spore-bearing cells]] in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of [[osmolyte|substances]] affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air.<ref name=Trail2007/> The forcible discharge of single spores termed ''ballistospores'' involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000&nbsp;[[G-force|g]];<ref name=Pringle2005/> the net result is that the spore is ejected 0.01–0.02&nbsp;cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below.<ref>Kirk ''et al''., p. 495.</ref> Other fungi, like the [[puffballs]], rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The [[Nidulariaceae|bird's nest fungi]] use the force of falling water drops to liberate the spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies.<ref name=Brodie1975/> Another strategy is seen in the [[stinkhorns]], a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.<ref>Alexopoulos ''et al''., p. 545.</ref>\n\nThe most common means of spore dispersal is by wind - species using this form of dispersal often produce dry or hydrophobic spores which do not absorb water and are readily scattered by raindrops, for example. Most of the researched species of fungus are transported by wind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/wong/BOT135/Lect05_b.htm|title=Spore Dispersal in Fungi|website=www.botany.hawaii.edu|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://herbarium.usu.edu/fun-with-fungi/dispersal|title=Dispersal|website=herbarium.usu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Other sexual processes ===\nBesides regular sexual reproduction with meiosis, certain fungi, such as those in the genera ''[[Penicillium]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus]]'', may exchange genetic material via [[parasexuality|parasexual]] processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and [[plasmogamy]] of fungal cells.<ref>Jennings and Lysek, pp. 114–115.</ref> The frequency and relative importance of parasexual events is unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known to play a role in intraspecific hybridization<ref name=Furlaneto1992/> and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.<ref name=Schardl2003/>\n\n== Evolution ==\n{{Main|Evolution of fungi}}\n\nIn contrast to [[Evolutionary history of plants|plants]] and [[Evolutionary history of life|animals]], the early fossil record of the fungi is meager. Factors that likely contribute to the under-representation of fungal species among fossils include the nature of fungal [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]], which are soft, fleshy, and easily degradable tissues and the microscopic dimensions of most fungal structures, which therefore are not readily evident. Fungal fossils are difficult to distinguish from those of other microbes, and are most easily identified when they resemble [[Extant taxon|extant]] fungi.<ref name=Donoghue2004/> Often recovered from a [[Permineralization|permineralized]] plant or animal host, these samples are typically studied by making thin-section preparations that can be examined with [[optical microscope|light microscopy]] or [[transmission electron microscopy]].<ref>Taylor and Taylor, p. 19.</ref> Researchers study [[compression fossil]]s by dissolving the surrounding matrix with acid and then using light or [[scanning electron microscopy]] to examine surface details.<ref>Taylor and Taylor, pp. 7–12.</ref>\n\nThe earliest fossils possessing features typical of fungi date to the [[Paleoproterozoic]] era, some {{ma|2400}} ([[annum|Ma]]); these multicellular [[benthic]] organisms had filamentous structures capable of [[anastomosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bengtson |first1=Stefan |last2=Rasmussen |first2=Birger |last3=Ivarsson |first3=Magnus |last4=Muhling |first4=Janet |last5=Broman |first5=Curt |last6=Marone|first6=Federica |last7=Stampanoni |first7=Marco |last8=Bekker |first8=Andrey |title=Fungus-like mycelial fossils in 2.4-billion-year-old vesicular basalt |journal=Nature Ecology & Evolution |date=24 April 2017 |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=0141 |doi=10.1038/s41559-017-0141 |pmid=28812648 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0141#s1}}</ref> Other studies (2009) estimate the arrival of fungal organisms at about 760–1060&nbsp;Ma on the basis of comparisons of the rate of evolution in closely related groups.<ref name=Lucking2009/> For much of the [[Paleozoic]] Era (542–251&nbsp;Ma), the fungi appear to have been aquatic and consisted of organisms similar to the extant [[chytrid]]s in having flagellum-bearing spores.<ref name=James2006b/> The evolutionary adaptation from an aquatic to a terrestrial lifestyle necessitated a diversification of ecological strategies for obtaining nutrients, including [[parasitism]], [[Saphrotrophic nutrition|saprobism]], and the development of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationships such as [[mycorrhiza]] and lichenization.<ref>Taylor and Taylor, pp. 84–94 and 106–107.</ref> Recent (2009) studies suggest that the ancestral ecological state of the [[Ascomycota]] was saprobism, and that independent [[lichen]]ization events have occurred multiple times.<ref name=Schoch2009/>\n\nIt is presumed that the fungi colonized the land during the [[Cambrian]] (542–488.3&nbsp;Ma), long before land plants.<ref name=Brundrett2002/> Fossilized hyphae and spores recovered from the [[Ordovician]] of Wisconsin (460&nbsp;Ma) resemble modern-day [[Glomerales]], and existed at a time when the land flora likely consisted of only non-vascular [[bryophyte]]-like plants.<ref name=Redecker2000/> [[Prototaxites]], which was probably a fungus or lichen, would have been the tallest organism of the late [[Silurian]].

Efforts among researchers are now underway to establish and encourage usage of a unified and more consistent [[Botanical nomenclature|nomenclature]].<ref name=Hibbett2007/><ref name=Celio2006/> Fungal species can also have multiple scientific names depending on their life cycle and mode (sexual or asexual) of reproduction.

Piepenbring).png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Main groups of fungi.]]\nThe major [[phylum|phyla]] (sometimes called divisions) of fungi have been classified mainly on the basis of characteristics of their sexual [[reproduction|reproductive]] structures. Currently, seven phyla are proposed: Microsporidia, Chytridiomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Neocallimastigomycota, Glomeromycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota.<ref name=Hibbett2007/>\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that the [[Microsporidia]], unicellular parasites of animals and protists, are fairly recent and highly derived [[endobiotic]] fungi (living within the tissue of another species).<ref name=James2006b/><ref name=Gill2006/> One 2006 study concludes that the Microsporidia are a sister group to the true fungi; that is, they are each other's closest evolutionary relative.<ref name=Liu2006/> Hibbett and colleagues suggest that this analysis does not clash with their classification of the Fungi, and although the Microsporidia are elevated to phylum status, it is acknowledged that further analysis is required to clarify evolutionary relationships within this group.<ref name=Hibbett2007/>\n\nThe [[Chytridiomycota]] are commonly known as chytrids. These fungi are distributed worldwide. Chytrids and their close relatives [[Neocallimastigomycota]] and [[Blastocladiomycota]] (below) are the only fungi with active motility, producing [[zoospore]]s that are capable of active movement through aqueous phases with a single [[flagellum]], leading early [[taxonomist]]s to classify them as [[protist]]s. [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular phylogenies]], inferred from [[rRNA]] sequences in [[ribosome]]s, suggest that the Chytrids are a [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] group divergent from the other fungal phyla, consisting of four major [[clade]]s with suggestive evidence for [[paraphyly]] or possibly [[polyphyly]].<ref name=James2006/>\n\nThe [[Blastocladiomycota]] were previously considered a taxonomic clade within the Chytridiomycota. Recent molecular data and [[ultrastructure|ultrastructural]] characteristics, however, place the Blastocladiomycota as a sister clade to the Zygomycota, Glomeromycota, and Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). The blastocladiomycetes are [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophs]], feeding on decomposing organic matter, and they are parasites of all eukaryotic groups. Unlike their close relatives, the chytrids, most of which exhibit [[Biological life cycle#Haplontic life cycle|zygotic meiosis]], the blastocladiomycetes undergo [[Biological life cycle#Haplodiplontic life cycle|sporic meiosis]].<ref name=James2006b/>\n\nThe [[Neocallimastigomycota]] were earlier placed in the phylum Chytridomycota. Members of this small phylum are [[anaerobic organism]]s, living in the digestive system of larger herbivorous mammals and in other terrestrial and aquatic environments enriched in cellulose (e.g., domestic waste landfill sites).<ref name=Lockhart2006/> They lack [[mitochondria]] but contain [[hydrogenosome]]s of mitochondrial origin.

This phylum includes [[morel]]s, a few [[mushroom]]s and [[Tuber (genus)|truffles]], unicellular [[yeast]]s (e.g., of the genera ''[[Saccharomyces]]'', ''[[Kluyveromyces]]'', ''[[Pichia]]'', and ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]''), and many filamentous fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts (e.g. lichens). Prominent and important genera of filamentous ascomycetes include ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Penicillium]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', and ''[[Claviceps]]''. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called [[anamorph]]ic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest [[teleomorph]]s in the Ascomycota.<ref name=Samuels2006/> Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, ascomycetes have been used for elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'').<ref name=Radford1997/>\n\nMembers of the [[Basidiomycota]], commonly known as the club fungi or basidiomycetes, produce meiospores called [[basidiospore]]s on club-like stalks called [[basidium|basidia]].

The slime molds were studied also as [[protozoa]]ns, leading to a [[ambiregnal]], duplicated taxonomy.\n\nUnlike true fungi, the [[cell wall]]s of oomycetes contain [[cellulose]] and lack [[chitin]]. Hyphochytrids have both chitin and cellulose. Slime molds lack a cell wall during the assimilative phase (except labyrinthulids, which have a wall of scales), and ingest nutrients by ingestion ([[phagocytosis]], except labyrinthulids) rather than absorption ([[osmotrophy]], as fungi, labyrinthulids, oomycetes and hyphochytrids). Neither water molds nor slime molds are closely related to the true fungi, and, therefore, [[taxonomist]]s no longer group them in the kingdom Fungi. Nonetheless, studies of the oomycetes and myxomycetes are still often included in [[mycology]] textbooks and primary research literature.<ref name=Blackwell2004/>\n\nThe [[Eccrinales]] and [[Amoebidiales]] are [[opisthokont]] [[protist]]s, previously thought to be zygomycete fungi. Other groups now in [[Opisthokonta]] (e.g., ''[[Corallochytrium]]'', [[Ichthyosporea]]) were also at given time classified as fungi. The genus ''[[Blastocystis]]'', now in [[Stramenopiles]], was originally classified as a yeast. ''[[Ellobiopsis]]'', now in [[Alveolata]], was considered a chytrid. The [[bacteria]] were also included in fungi in some classifications, as the group Schizomycetes.\n\nThe [[Rozellida]] clade, including the \"ex-chytrid\" ''[[Rozella]]'', is a genetically disparate group known mostly from environmental DNA sequences that is a sister group to fungi. Members of the group that have been isolated lack the chitinous cell wall that is characteristic of fungi.\n\nThe [[nucleariid]]s may be the next sister group to the eumycete clade, and as such could be included in an expanded fungal kingdom.<ref name=\"ShalchianTabrizi2008\"/>\n\nMany [[Actinomycetales]] ([[Actinobacteria]]), a group with many filamentous bacteria, were also long believed to be fungi.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:PinMould on Peach LowMag Scale.jpg|thumb|A pin mold decomposing a peach]]\nAlthough often inconspicuous, fungi occur in every environment on [[Earth]] and play very important roles in most [[ecosystems]].

Plants have evolved efficient defense systems against pathogenic microbes such as ''U. maydis''. A rapid defense reaction after pathogen attack is the [[oxidative burst]] where the plant produces [[reactive oxygen species]] at the site of the attempted invasion. ''U. maydis'' can respond to the oxidative burst with an oxidative stress response, regulated by the gene ''[[YAP1]]''. The response protects ''U. maydis'' from the host defense, and is necessary for the pathogen's virulence.<ref name=Molina2007/> Furthermore, ''U. maydis'' has a well-established recombinational [[DNA repair]] system which acts during mitosis and meiosis.<ref name=Kojic2006/> The system may assist the pathogen in surviving DNA damage arising from the host plant's oxidative defensive response to infection.<ref name=Michod2008/>\n\n''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' is an encapsulated yeast that can live in both plants and animals. ''C. neoformans'' usually infects the lungs, where it is phagocytosed by [[alveolar macrophage]]s.<ref name=Fan2005/> Some ''C. neoformans'' can survive [[intracellular|inside]] macrophages, which appears to be the basis for [[latency period|latency]], disseminated disease, and resistance to antifungal agents. One mechanism by which ''C. neoformans'' survives the hostile macrophage environment is by up-regulating the expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response.<ref name=Fan2005 /> Another mechanism involves [[meiosis]]. The majority of ''C. neoformans'' are mating \"type a\". Filaments of mating \"type a\" ordinarily have haploid nuclei, but they can become diploid (perhaps by endoduplication or by stimulated nuclear fusion) to form [[blastospore]]s. The diploid nuclei of blastospores can undergo meiosis, including recombination, to form haploid basidiospores that can be dispersed.<ref name=Lin2005/> This process is referred to as monokaryotic fruiting. this process requires a gene called ''[[DMC1]]'', which is a conserved homologue of genes ''[[recA]]'' in bacteria and ''[[RAD51]]'' in eukaryotes, that mediates homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis and repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Thus, ''C. neoformans'' can undergo a meiosis, monokaryotic fruiting, that promotes recombinational repair in the oxidative, DNA damaging environment of the host macrophage, and the repair capability may contribute to its virulence.<ref name=Michod2008/><ref name=Lin2005/>\n\n==Human use==\n[[File:S cerevisiae under DIC microscopy.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Microscopic view of five spherical structures; one of the spheres is considerably smaller than the rest and attached to one of the larger spheres|''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' cells shown with [[Differential interference contrast microscopy|DIC microscopy]]]]\nThe human use of fungi for food preparation or preservation and other purposes is extensive and has a long history.

Although naturally occurring penicillins such as [[penicillin G]] (produced by ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'') have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, a wide range of other penicillins can be produced by [[Chemical synthesis|chemical modification]] of the natural penicillins.

''[[Agaricus bisporus]]'', sold as button mushrooms when small or Portobello mushrooms when larger, is the most widely cultivated species in the West, used in salads, soups, and many other dishes. Many Asian fungi are commercially grown and have increased in popularity in the West. They are often available fresh in [[grocery store]]s and markets, including straw mushrooms (''[[Volvariella volvacea]]''), oyster mushrooms (''[[Pleurotus ostreatus]]''), shiitakes (''[[Lentinula edodes]]''), and [[enokitake]] (''[[Flammulina]]'' spp.).<ref name=Stamets2000/>\n\n[[File:Blue Stilton Quarter Front.jpg|thumb|alt=A corner of cheese with greenish streaks through it|[[Stilton cheese]] veined with ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]'']]\n\nMany other mushroom species are [[Mushroom hunting|harvested from the wild]] for personal consumption or commercial sale. [[Lactarius deliciosus|Milk mushrooms]], [[morel]]s, [[chanterelle]]s, [[truffles]], [[Craterellus|black trumpets]], and ''porcini'' mushrooms (''[[Boletus edulis]]'') (also known as king boletes) demand a high price on the market. They are often used in gourmet dishes.<ref>Hall, pp. 13–26.</ref>\n\nCertain types of cheeses require inoculation of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the [[blue cheese|blue]] color in cheeses such as [[Stilton cheese|Stilton]] or [[Roquefort]], which are made by inoculation with ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]''.<ref name=Kinsella1976/> Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, [[roquefortine C]], patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.<ref name=Erdogan2004/>\n\n===Poisonous fungi===\n[[File:Amanita phalloides 1.JPG|upright|thumb|alt=Two light yellow-green mushrooms with stems and caps, one smaller and still in the ground, the larger one pulled out and laid beside the other to show its bulbous stem with a ring|''[[Amanita phalloides]]'' accounts for the majority of fatal [[mushroom poisoning]]s worldwide. It sometimes lacks the greenish color seen here.]]\n\nMany mushroom species are [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] to humans, with toxicities ranging from slight digestive problems or [[allergy|allergic]] reactions as well as [[hallucination]]s to severe organ failures and death. Genera with mushrooms containing deadly toxins include ''[[Conocybe]]'', ''[[Galerina]]'', ''[[Lepiota]]'', and, the most infamous, ''[[Amanita]]''.<ref name=Orr1979/> The latter genus includes the destroying angel ''([[Amanita virosa|A.&nbsp;virosa]])'' and the death cap ''([[Amanita phalloides|A.&nbsp;phalloides]])'', the most common cause of deadly mushroom poisoning.<ref name=Vetter1998/> The false morel (''[[Gyromitra esculenta]]'') is occasionally considered a delicacy when cooked, yet can be highly toxic when eaten raw.<ref name=Leathem2007/> ''[[Tricholoma equestre]]'' was considered edible until it was implicated in serious poisonings causing [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name=KarlsonStiber2003/> [[Amanita muscaria|Fly agaric]] mushrooms (''Amanita muscaria'') also cause occasional non-fatal poisonings, mostly as a result of ingestion for its [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] properties. Historically, fly agaric was used by different peoples in Europe and Asia and its present usage for religious or [[shamanism|shamanic]] purposes is reported from some ethnic groups such as the [[Koryaks|Koryak people]] of north-eastern [[Siberia]].<ref name=Michelot2003/>\n\nAs it is difficult to accurately identify a safe mushroom without proper training and knowledge, it is often advised to assume that a wild mushroom is poisonous and not to consume it.<ref>Hall, p. 7.</ref><ref name=Ammirati1987/>\n\n=== Pest control ===\n[[File:Beauveria.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two dead grasshoppers with a whitish fuzz growing on them|Grasshoppers killed by ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'']]\n\nIn agriculture, fungi may be useful if they actively compete for nutrients and space with [[pathogen]]ic microorganisms such as bacteria or other fungi via the [[competitive exclusion principle]],<ref name=LopezGomez2006/> or if they are [[parasitism|parasites]] of these pathogens. For example, certain species may be used to eliminate or suppress the growth of harmful plant pathogens, such as insects, [[mites]], [[weed]]s, [[nematodes]], and other fungi that cause diseases of important [[crop]] plants.<ref name=\"urlUSDA Biocontrol\"/> This has generated strong interest in practical applications that use these fungi in the [[biological control]] of these agricultural pests. [[Entomopathogenic fungi]] can be used as [[biopesticides]], as they actively kill insects.<ref name=\"urlwww.uvminnovations.com\"/> Examples that have been used as [[biological insecticide]]s are ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'', ''[[Metarhizium]]'' spp, ''[[Hirsutella]]'' spp, ''[[Paecilomyces]]'' (''Isaria'') spp, and ''[[Lecanicillium lecanii]]''.<ref name=Deshpande1999/><ref name=Thomas2007/> [[Endophytic]] fungi of grasses of the genus ''[[Neotyphodium]]'', such as ''[[Neotyphodium coenophialum|N. coenophialum]]'', produce alkaloids that are toxic to a range of invertebrate and vertebrate [[herbivores]]. These alkaloids protect grass plants from [[herbivory]], but several endophyte alkaloids can poison grazing animals, such as cattle and sheep.<ref name=Bush1997/> Infecting cultivars of [[pasture]] or [[forage]] grasses with ''Neotyphodium'' endophytes is one approach being used in [[plant breeding|grass breeding]] programs; the fungal strains are selected for producing only alkaloids that increase resistance to herbivores such as insects, while being non-toxic to livestock.<ref name=Bouton2002/>\n\n=== Bioremediation ===\n{{See also|Mycoremediation}}\nCertain fungi, in particular [[white rot|white-rot]] fungi, can degrade [[insecticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s, [[pentachlorophenol]], [[creosote]], [[coal tar]]s, and heavy fuels and turn them into [[carbon dioxide]], water, and basic elements.<ref name=Christian2005/> Fungi have been shown to [[biomineralization|biomineralize]] [[uranium]] [[oxide]]s, suggesting they may have application in the [[bioremediation]] of radioactively polluted sites.<ref name=BBC2008/><ref name=Fomina2007/><ref name=Fomina2008/>\n\n=== Model organisms ===\nSeveral pivotal discoveries in biology were made by researchers using fungi as [[model organisms]], that is, fungi that grow and sexually reproduce rapidly in the laboratory. For example, the [[one gene-one enzyme hypothesis]] was formulated by scientists using the bread mold ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'' to test their biochemical theories.<ref name=Beadle1941/> Other important model fungi are ''[[Aspergillus nidulans]]'' and the yeasts ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'', each of which with a long history of use to investigate issues in eukaryotic [[cell biology]] and [[genetics]], such as [[cell cycle]] regulation, [[chromatin]] structure, and [[gene regulation]]. Other fungal models have more recently emerged that address specific biological questions relevant to [[medicine]], [[plant pathology]], and industrial uses; examples include ''[[Candida albicans]]'', a dimorphic, opportunistic human pathogen,<ref name=Datta1989/> ''[[Magnaporthe grisea]]'', a plant pathogen,<ref name=Dean2005/> and ''[[Pichia pastoris]]'', a yeast widely used for eukaryotic [[protein production]].<ref name=Daly2005/>\n\n=== Others ===\nFungi are used extensively to produce industrial chemicals like [[citric acid|citric]], [[gluconic acid|gluconic]], [[lactic acid|lactic]], and [[malic acid|malic]] acids,<ref name=Schlegel1993/> and [[industrial enzymes]], such as [[lipase]]s used in [[biological detergent]]s,<ref name=Joseph2008/> [[cellulase]]s used in making [[cellulosic ethanol]]<ref name=Kumar2008/> and [[stonewashed jeans]],<ref name=nysaes/> and [[amylase]]s,<ref name=OlempskaBeer2006/> [[invertase]]s, [[protease]]s and [[xylanase]]s.<ref name=Polizeli2005/> Several species, most notably ''[[Psilocybin mushroom]]s'' (colloquially known as ''magic mushrooms''), are ingested for their [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] properties, both
