This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment, such as [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV), or interception of electronically transmitted information, such as [[Internet traffic]]. It can also include simple technical methods, such as [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|human intelligence gathering]] and [[postal interception]].\n\nSurveillance is used by [[government]]s for intelligence gathering, prevention of crime, the protection of a process, person, group or object, or the investigation of crime. It is also used by criminal organizations to plan and commit crimes, and by businesses to gather intelligence on their competitors, suppliers or customers.\n\nSurveillance can be viewed as a violation of [[privacy]], and as such is often opposed by [[civil liberties]] activists. A [[liberal democracy]] may have laws which restrict domestic government and private use of surveillance. [[Authoritarian]] governments seldom have any domestic restrictions, and international [[espionage]] is common among all types of countries.\n\nConcerns have been raised about surveillance with regards to the [[Internet of things]]. Where surveillance technology is used for identification, monitoring, location tracking or to gain access to buildings and networks.\n\n==Methods==\n\n===Computer===\n[[File:IAO-logo.png|thumb|right|200px| Official seal of the [[Information Awareness Office]] – a U.S. agency which developed technologies for [[mass surveillance]]]]\n{{Main |Computer surveillance}}\n\nThe vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of [[data mining|data]] and [[traffic analysis|traffic]] on the [[Internet]].<ref name=\"sciam-internet\">{{cite news|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=internet-eavesdropping|title=Internet Eavesdropping: A Brave New World of Wiretapping |last=Diffie|first=Whitfield|author2=Susan Landau |date=August 2008|work=Scientific American|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref> In the United States for example, under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by federal law enforcement agencies.<ref name=\"eff-calea-archive\">{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html|title=CALEA Archive – Electronic Frontier Foundation|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=March 14, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503035053/http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html|archivedate=May 3, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"eff-calea-summary\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/calea|title=CALEA: The Perils of Wiretapping the Internet|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"eff-calea-faq\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq|title=CALEA: Frequently Asked Questions|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=March 14, 2009|date=2007-09-20}}</ref>\n\nThere is far too much data on the Internet for human investigators to manually search through all of it.

Originally developed for counterterrorism purposes by the military, they work by broadcasting powerful signals that cause nearby cell phones to transmit their [[Mobile identification number|IMSI number]], just as they would to normal cell phone towers. Once the phone is connected to the device, there is no way for the user to know that they are being tracked. The operator of the stingray is able to extract information such as location, phone calls, and text messages, but it is widely believed that the capabilities of the StingRay extend much further. A lot of controversy surrounds the StingRay because of its powerful capabilities and the secrecy that surrounds it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hampton|first=Brittany|year=2012|title=From Smartphones to Stingrays: Can the Fourth Amendment Keep up with the Twenty-First Century Note|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/branlaj51&amp;div=8&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|journal=University of Louisville Law Review|volume=Fifty One|pages=159–176|via=Law Journal Library}}</ref>\n\nMobile phones are also commonly used to collect location data.

They are often connected to a recording device or [[IP network]], and may be watched by a [[security guard]] or [[law enforcement officer]]. Cameras and recording equipment used to be relatively expensive and required human personnel to monitor camera footage, but analysis of footage has been made easier by automated software that organizes digital video footage into a searchable [[database]], and by video analysis software (such as [[VIRAT]] and [[Human Identification at a Distance|HumanID]]). The amount of footage is also drastically reduced by motion sensors which only record when motion is detected. With cheaper production techniques, surveillance cameras are simple and inexpensive enough to be used in home security systems, and for everyday surveillance.\n\nAs of 2016, there are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide. About 65% of these cameras are installed in Asia.

The data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations, but is also regularly shared with government agencies. It can be used as a form of [[business intelligence]], which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and/or services to be desirable by their customers. Although there is a common belief that monitoring can increase productivity, it can also create consequences such as increasing chances of deviant behavior and creating punishments that are not equitable to their actions. Additionally, monitoring can cause resistance and backlash because it insinuates an employer’s suspicion and lack of trust.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=Denise|date=2017|title=Toward a Sociology of Privacy|url=|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=43|issue=1|pages=249–269|doi=10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053643}}</ref>\n\n===Data mining and profiling===\n[[Data mining]] is the application of statistical techniques and programmatic algorithms to discover previously unnoticed relationships within the data. [[Data profiling]] in this context is the process of assembling information about a particular individual or group in order to generate a profile&nbsp;— that is, a picture of their patterns and behavior. Data profiling can be an extremely powerful tool for psychological and [[social network analysis]]. A skilled analyst can discover facts about a person that they might not even be consciously aware of themselves.<ref name=\"profiling-euro\">{{cite book|authorlink1=Mireille Hildebrandt|last=Hildebrandt|first=Mireille|author2=Serge Gutwirth |title=Profiling the European Citizen: Cross Disciplinary Perspectives|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4020-6913-0}}</ref>\n\nEconomic (such as credit card purchases) and social (such as telephone calls and emails) transactions in modern society create large amounts of stored [[data]] and records. In the past, this data was documented in paper records, leaving a \"[[paper trail]]\", or was simply not documented at all. Correlation of paper-based records was a laborious process—it required human intelligence operators to manually dig through documents, which was time-consuming and incomplete, at best.\n\nBut today many of these records are electronic, resulting in an \"[[Digital footprint|electronic trail]]\". Every use of a bank machine, payment by credit card, use of a phone card, call from home, checked out library book, rented video, or otherwise complete recorded transaction generates an electronic record. Public records—such as birth, court, tax and other records—are increasily being digitized and made available online. In addition, due to laws like [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act|CALEA]], web traffic and online purchases are also available for profiling. Electronic record-keeping makes data easily collectable, storable, and accessible—so that high-volume, efficient aggregation and analysis is possible at significantly lower costs.\n\nInformation relating to many of these individual transactions is often easily available because it is generally not guarded in isolation, since the information, such as the title of a movie a person has rented, might not seem sensitive. However, when many such transactions are [[government databases|aggregated]] they can be used to assemble a detailed profile revealing the actions, habits, beliefs, locations frequented, [[social network analysis|social connections]], and preferences of the individual. This profile is then used, by programs such as [[ADVISE]]<ref name=\"data-sweep\">{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0209/p01s02-uspo.html|title=US Plans Massive Data Sweep|last=Clayton|first=Mark|date=February 9, 2006|work=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref> and [[TALON (database)|TALON]], to determine whether the person is a military, criminal, or political threat.\n\nIn addition to its own aggregation and profiling tools, the government is able to access information from third parties&nbsp;— for example, banks, credit companies or employers, etc.&nbsp;— by requesting access informally, by compelling access through the use of subpoenas or other procedures,<ref name=\"cdt-fbi-subpoenas\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdt.org/security/usapatriot/030924cdt.shtml |title=Administrative Subpoenas for the FBI: A Grab for Unchecked Executive Power |last=Flint |first=Lara |date=September 24, 2003 |work=The Center For Democracy & Technology (official site) |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308183232/http://cdt.org/security/usapatriot/030924cdt.shtml |archivedate=March 8, 2009 }}</ref> or by purchasing data from commercial data aggregators or data brokers.

Some nations have an [[Identity document|identity card]] system to aid identification, whilst others are considering it but face public opposition. Other documents, such as [[passport]]s, [[Driver's license|driver's licenses,]] [[library card]]s, banking or [[credit card]]s are also used to verify identity.\n\nIf the form of the identity card is \"machine-readable\", usually using an encoded magnetic stripe or identification number (such as a [[Social Security number]]), it corroborates the subject's identifying data. In this case it may create an electronic trail when it is checked and scanned, which can be used in profiling, as mentioned above.\n\n===Wireless Tracking===\nThis section refers to traking methods that involve the monitoring of devices through the aid of wireless signals.\n\n====Mobile phones====\nMobile carrier antennas are also commonly used to collect geolocation data on mobile phones. The geographical location of a powered mobile phone (and thus the person carrying it) can be determined easily (whether it is being used or not), using a technique known as [[multilateration]] to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several [[cell towers]] near the owner of the phone.<ref name=\"bbc-phone-locate\"/><ref name=\"foxnews-phone-locate\"/> Dr. Victor Kappeler<ref>{{cite web|last=Kappeler|first=Victor|title=Forget the NSA: Police May be a Greater Threat to Privacy|url=http://www.plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/forget-nsa-police-may-be-greater-threat-privacy}}</ref>  of Eastern Kentucky University indicates that police surveillance is a strong concern, stating the following statistics from 2013:\n{{quote|Of the 321,545 law enforcement requests made to Verizon, 54,200 of these requests were for \"content\" or \"location\" information—not just cell phone numbers or IP addresses.

The tags can be read from several meters away. They are extremely inexpensive, costing a few cents per piece, so they can be inserted into many types of everyday products without significantly increasing the price, and can be used to track and identify these objects for a variety of purposes.\n\nSome companies appear to be \"tagging\" their workers by incorporating RFID tags in employee ID badges.

They argue that surveillance can reduce crime by three means: by deterrence, by observation, and by reconstruction. Surveillance can deter by increasing the chance of being caught, and by revealing the [[modus operandi]]. This requires a minimal level of [[invasive observation|invasiveness]].<ref name =\"Deviant Behaviour - Socially accepted observation of behaviour for security\">[http://www.fp7-tactics.eu/files/documents/Deviant%20Behaviour-Socially%20accepted%20observation%20of%20behaviour%20for%20security.pdf Deviant Behaviour – Socially accepted observation of behaviour for security], Jeroen van Rest</ref>\n\nAnother method on how surveillance can be used to fight criminal activity is by linking the information stream obtained from them to a recognition system (for instance, a camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system). This can for instance auto-recognize fugitives and direct police to their location.\n\nA distinction here has to be made however on the type of surveillance employed. Some people that say support video surveillance in city streets may not support indiscriminate telephone taps and vice versa. Besides the types, the way in how this surveillance is done also matters a lot; i.e. indiscriminate telephone taps are supported by much fewer people than say telephone taps only done to people suspected of engaging in illegal activities.\n\nSurveillance can also be used to give human operatives a tactical advantage through improved situational awareness, or through the use of automated processes, i.e. [[video analytics]]. Surveillance can help reconstruct an incident and prove guilt through the availability of footage for forensics experts. Surveillance can also influence subjective security if surveillance resources are visible or if the consequences of surveillance can be felt.\n\nSome of the surveillance systems (such as the camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system mentioned above) can also have other uses besides countering criminal activity.

The most concern of detriment is securing the lives of those who live under total surveillance willingly, educating the public to those under peaceful watch while identifying terrorist and those who use the same surveillance systems and mechanisms in opposition to peace, against civilians, and to disclose lives removed from the laws of the land.\n\nIn addition, a significant risk of private data collection stems from the fact that this risk is too much unknown to be readily assessed today.

This allows the State to control the populace without having to resort to physical force, which is expensive and otherwise problematic.<ref name=\"foucault-discipline\">{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|year=1979|pages=201–202}}</ref>\n\nWith the development of digital technology, individuals have become increasingly perceptible to one another, as surveillance becomes virtual. Online surveillance is the utilization of the internet to observe one's activity.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Superconnected: the internet, digital media, and techno-social life|last=Chayko|first=Mary|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2017|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref> Corporations, citizens, and governments participate in tracking others' behaviours for motivations that arise out of business relations, to curiosity, to legality. In her book ''Superconnected'', Chayko differentiates between two types of surveillance: vertical and horizontal.<ref name=\":1\" /> Vertical surveillance occurs when there is a dominant force, such as the government that is attempting to control or regulate the actions of a given society. Such powerful authorities often justify their incursions as a means to protect society from threats of violence or terrorism. Some individuals question when this becomes an infringement on civil rights.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHorizontal diverges from vertical surveillance as the tracking shifts from an authoritative source to an everyday figure, such as a friend, coworker, or stranger that is interested in one's mundane activities.<ref name=\":1\" /> Individuals leave traces of information when they are online that reveal their interests and desires of which others observe. While this can allow people to become interconnected and develop social connections online, it can also increase potential risk to harm, such as [[cyberbullying]] or censoring/stalking by strangers, reducing privacy.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn addition, [[Simone Browne]] argues that surveillance wields an immense racializing quality such that it operates as \"racializing surveillance.\" Browne uses racializing surveillance to refer to moments when enactments of surveillance are used to reify boundaries, borders, and bodies along racial lines and where the outcome is discriminatory treatment of those who are negatively racialized by such surveillance. Browne argues racializing surveillance pertains to policing what is “in or out of place.”<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nishiyama |first1=Hidefumi|title=Surveillance as Race Struggle: On Browne's Dark Matters |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/646864/summary |journal=Theory & Event |volume=20 | issue=1 |date=2017 |pages=280–285 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |via=Project MUSE}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Browne |first1=Simone |title=Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness |date=October 2, 2015 |publisher=Duke University Press Books |isbn=978-0822359197 |pages=224}}</ref>\n\n====Privacy====\nNumerous [[civil rights]] groups and [[privacy]] groups oppose surveillance as a violation of people's right to privacy. Such groups include: [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]], [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[American Civil Liberties Union]]\n\nThere have been several lawsuits such as [[Hepting v. AT&T]] and [[EPIC v. Department of Justice]] by groups or individuals, opposing certain surveillance activities.\n\nLegislative proceedings such as those that took place during the [[Church Committee]], which investigated domestic intelligence programs such as [[COINTELPRO]], have also weighed the pros and cons of surveillance.\n\n;Court Cases\n\n[[People v. Diaz|People vs. Diaz (2011)]] was a court case in the realm of cell phone privacy, even though the decision was later overturned. In this case, Gregory Diaz was arrested during a sting operation for attempting to sell ecstasy.  During his arrest, police searched Diaz's phone and found more incriminating evidence including SMS text messages and photographs depicting illicit activities.  During his trial, Diaz attempted to have the information from his cell phone removed from evidence, but the courts deemed it as lawful and Diaz's appeal was denied on the California State Court level and, later, the Supreme Court level.  Just three short years after, this decision was overturned in the case Riley vs. California (2014).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1033744.html|title=People vs. Diaz|last=Court of Appeal, Second District, Division 6, California.|date=July 30, 2008|website=FindLaw|access-date=Feb 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Riley v. California|Riley vs. California (2014)]] was an extremely vital [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] case in which a man was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting.  A few days after the shooting the police made an arrest of the suspect (Riley), and, during the arrest, the police searched him.  However, this search was not only of Riley's person, but also the police opened and searched his cell phone, finding pictures of other weapons, drugs, and of Riley showing gang signs.  In court, the question arose whether searching the phone was lawful or if the search was protected by the 4th amendment of the constitution.  The decision held that the search of Riley's cell phone during the arrest was illegal, and that it was protected by the 4th Amendment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/13-132|title=Riley v.

Developments in the late twentieth century have caused counter surveillance to dramatically grow in both scope and complexity, such as the Internet, increasing prevalence of electronic [[security systems]], high-altitude (and possibly armed) [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]], and large corporate and government computer databases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stratfor.com/secrets_countersurveillance|title=The Secrets of Countersurveillance|publisher=Security Weekly|date=June 6, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Inverse surveillance]] is the practice of the reversal of surveillance on other individuals or groups (e.g., citizens photographing police). Well-known examples are [[Rodney King|George Holliday]]'s recording of the [[Rodney King]] beating and the organization [[Copwatch]], which attempts to monitor police officers to prevent [[police brutality]].  Counter-surveillance can be also used in applications to prevent corporate spying, or to track other criminals by certain criminal entities. It can also be used to deter stalking methods used by various entities and organizations.\n\n''[[Sousveillance]]'' is inverse surveillance, involving the recording by private individuals, rather than government or corporate entities.<ref>{{cite news\n | last =Birch\n | first =Dave\n | title =The age of sousveillance\n | work =[[The Guardian]]\n | pages =\n | language =\n | publisher =\n | date =July 14, 2005\n | url =https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/jul/14/comment.comment\n | accessdate = August 6, 2007\n| location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\n===In literature===\n* [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' portrays a fictional [[totalitarian]] surveillance society with a very simple (by today's standards) [[mass surveillance]] system consisting of human operatives, informants, and two-way \"telescreens\" in people's homes. Because of the impact of this book, mass-surveillance technologies are commonly called \"Orwellian\" when they are considered problematic.\n* The novel ''[[mistrust]]'' highlights the negative effects from the overuse of surveillance at Reflection House. The central character Kerryn installs secret cameras to monitor her housemates – see also [[Paranoia]].\n* The book ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', as well as a film and TV series based on it, portray a totalitarian Christian [[theocracy]] where all citizens are kept under constant surveillance.\n* In the book ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', [[Lisbeth Salander]] uses computers to get information on people, as well as other common surveillance methods, as a freelancer.\n* ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' a British [[graphic novel]] written by [[Alan Moore]]\n* [[Dave Eggers|David Egger's]] novel ''[[The Circle (Eggers novel)|The Circle]]'' exhibits a world where a single company called \"The Circle\" produces all of the latest and highest quality technologies from computers and smartphones, to surveillance cameras known as \"See-Change cameras\". This company becomes associated with politics when starting a movement where politicians go \"transparent\" by wearing See-Change cameras on their body to prevent keeping secrets from the public about their daily work activity. In this society, it becomes mandatory to share personal information and experiences because it is The Circle's belief that everyone should have access to all information freely. However, as Eggers illustrates, this takes a toll on the individuals and creates a disruption of power between the governments and the private company. The Circle presents extreme ideologies surrounding mandatory surveillance. Eamon Bailey, one of the Wise Men, or founders of The Circle, believes that possessing the tools to access information about anything or anyone, should be a human right given to all of the world's citizens.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Circle|last=Eggers|first=David|publisher=Alfred A.

One major goal of The Circle is to have all of the world's information filtered through The Circle, a process they call \"Completion\".<ref name=\":0\" /> A single, private company would then have full access and control over all information and privacy of individuals and governments. Ty Gospodinov, the first founder of The Circle, has major concerns about the completion of the circle. He warns that this step would give The Circle too much power and control, and would quickly lead to [[totalitarianism]].\n\n===In music===\n* The [[Dead Kennedys]]' song \"I Am The Owl\" is about government surveillance and [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] of political groups.\n* The [[Vienna Teng]] song \"Hymn of Acxiom\" is about corporate data collection and surveillance.\n\n===Onscreen===\n{{Main|List of films featuring surveillance}}\n\n* The film ''[[Gattaca]]'' portrays a society that uses [[biometric]] surveillance to distinguish between people who are genetically engineered \"superior\" humans and genetically natural \"inferior\" humans.\n* In the movie ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', the police and government intelligence agencies use [[micro aerial vehicles]] in [[SWAT]] operations and for surveillance purposes.\n* [[HBO]]'s crime-drama series ''[[The Sopranos]]'' regularly portrays the FBI's surveillance of the [[DiMeo Crime Family]]. Audio devices they use include \"[[Covert listening device|bugs]]\" placed in strategic locations (e.g., in \"[[I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano]]\" and \"[[Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood]]\") and hidden microphones worn by operatives (e.g., in \"[[Rat Pack (The Sopranos)|Rat Pack]]\") and informants (e.g., in \"[[Funhouse (The Sopranos)|Funhouse]]\", \"[[Proshai, Livushka]]\" and \"[[Members Only (The Sopranos)|Members Only]]\").
