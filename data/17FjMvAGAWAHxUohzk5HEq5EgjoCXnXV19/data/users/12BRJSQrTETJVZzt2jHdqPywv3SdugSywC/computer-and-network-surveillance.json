This monitoring is often carried out covertly and may be completed by governments, corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent government agencies.\n\nComputer and network surveillance programs are widespread today and almost all [[Internet traffic]] can be monitored.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/fbi-wants-widespread-monitoring-of-illegal-internet-activity/ | title=FBI wants widespread monitoring of 'illegal' Internet activity | work=CNET | accessdate=25 March 2014 | author=Anne Broache}}</ref>\n\nSurveillance allows governments and other agencies to maintain [[social control]], recognize and monitor threats, and prevent and investigate [[criminal]] activity. With the advent of programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, technologies such as [[NarusInsight|high-speed surveillance computers]] and [[Surveillance#Biometric|biometrics]] software, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.<ref name=\"us-surveillance-soc\">{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/privacy/gen/index.html|title=Is the U.S. Turning Into a Surveillance Society?|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many [[civil rights]] and [[privacy]] groups, such as [[Reporters Without Borders]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens will result in a [[mass surveillance]] society, with limited political and/or personal freedoms.

A [[Packet Capture Appliance]] intercepts these packets, so that they may be examined and analyzed. Computer technology is needed to perform [[traffic analysis]] and sift through intercepted data to look for important/useful information. Under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install such packet capture technology so that Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies are able to intercept all of their customers' [[broadband Internet]] and [[voice over Internet protocol]] (VoIP) traffic.<ref>[http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf American Council on Education vs. FCC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907032500/http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf |date=2012-09-07 }}, Decision, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 9 June 2006.

More people are potentially subject to Internet surveillance. There are advantages and disadvantages to network monitoring. For instance, systems described as \"Web 2.0\"<ref name=\"Reilly, T. 2005\">O'Reilly, T. (2005). What is Web 2.0: Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software. O’Reilly Media, 1-5.</ref> have greatly impacted modern society. Tim O’ Reilly, who first explained the concept of \"Web 2.0\",<ref name=\"Reilly, T. 2005\"/> stated that Web 2.0 provides communication platforms that are \"user generated\", with self-produced content, motivating more people to communicate with friends online.<ref>Fuchs, C. (2011). New Media, Web 2.0 and Surveillance. Sociology Compass, 134-147.</ref> However, Internet surveillance also has a disadvantage. One researcher from [[Uppsala University]] said \"Web 2.0 surveillance is directed at large user groups who help to hegemonically produce and reproduce surveillance by providing user-generated (self-produced) content. We can characterize Web 2.0 surveillance as mass self-surveillance\".<ref>Fuchs, C. (2011). Web 2.0, Presumption, and Surveillance. Surveillance & Society, 289-309.</ref> Surveillance companies monitor people while they are focused on work or entertainment. Yet, employers themselves also monitor their employees. They do so in order to protect the company's assets and to control public communications but most importantly, to make sure that their employees are actively working and being productive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anthony Denise, Celeste Campos-Castillo, Christine Horne|date=2017|title=Toward a Sociology of Privacy|url=|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=43|pages=249–269|doi=10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053643}}</ref> This can emotionally affect people; this is because it can cause emotions like jealousy.

Currently, virtual assistant such as Amazon's Alexa cannot call 911 or local services.<ref name=\"Smart Devices Call Cops\">{{Cite web|url=https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/should-smart-devices-automatically-call-cops|title=Should Smart Devices Be Able to Automatically Call the Cops?|access-date=November 10, 2017|work=How Stuff Works}}</ref> They are constantly listening for a command and recording parts of conversations that will help improve algorithms.

The data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations, but is also regularly shared with government agencies. It can be used as a form of [[business intelligence]], which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and/or services to be desirable by their customers. The data can be also sold to other corporations so that they can use it for the aforementioned purpose, or it can be used for direct marketing purposes, such as [[targeted advertisement]]s, where ads are targeted to the user of the search engine by analyzing their search history and emails<ref name=\"nytimes-onlineads\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/technology/01Privacy.html?_r=1|title=F.T.C. to Review Online Ads and Privacy|last=Story|first=Louise|date=November 1, 2007|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-17}}</ref> (if they use free webmail services), which are kept in a database.<ref name=\"surv-in-society\"/>\n\nOne important component of prevention is establishing the business purposes of monitoring, which may include the following:\n* Preventing misuse of resources. Companies can discourage unproductive personal activities such as online shopping or web surfing on company time. Monitoring employee performance is one way to reduce unnecessary [[network traffic]] and reduce the consumption of [[network bandwidth]].\n* Promoting adherence to policies. Online surveillance is one means of verifying employee observance of company networking policies.\n* Preventing lawsuits. Firms can be held liable for discrimination or employee harassment in the workplace. Organizations can also be involved in infringement suits through employees that distribute copyrighted material over corporate networks.\n* Safeguarding records. Federal legislation requires organizations to protect personal information. Monitoring can determine the extent of compliance with company policies and programs overseeing information security. Monitoring may also deter unlawful appropriation of personal information, and potential spam or viruses.\n* Safeguarding company assets. The protection of [[intellectual property]], [[trade secret]]s, and business strategies is a major concern. The ease of information transmission and storage makes it imperative to monitor employee actions as part of a broader policy.\nA second component of prevention is determining the ownership of technology resources. The ownership of the firm's networks, servers, computers, files, and e-mail should be explicitly stated. There should be a distinction between an employee's personal electronic devices, which should be limited and proscribed, and those owned by the firm.\n\nFor instance, [[Google search]] stores identifying information for each web search. An [[IP address]] and the search phrase used are stored in a database for up to 18 months.<ref name=\"cnet-googlelogs\">{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13739_3-10038963-46.html|title=Debunking Google's log anonymization propaganda|last=Soghoian|first=Chris|date=September 11, 2008|work=CNET News|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> Google also scans the content of emails of users of its Gmail webmail service in order to create targeted advertising based on what people are talking about in their personal email correspondences.<ref name=\"joshi\">{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/every-move-you-make-google-will-be-watching-you/57071/on|title=  Every move you make, Google will be watching you|last=Joshi|first=Priyanki|date=March 21, 2009|work=Business Standard|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> Google is, by far, the largest Internet advertising agency—millions of sites place Google's advertising banners and links on their websites in order to earn money from visitors who click on the ads.

The [[Department of Homeland Security]] has openly stated that it uses data collected from consumer credit and direct marketing agencies for augmenting the profiles of individuals that it is monitoring.<ref name=\"surv-in-society\">{{cite news|url=http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/observer/story.html?id=ade6d795-4e7a-4ede-9fc1-f7bf929849c8&p=1|title=Are we addicted to being watched?|last=Butler|first=Don|date=January 31, 2009|work=The Ottawa Citizen|publisher=canada.com|accessdate=26 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722200908/http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/observer/story.html?id=ade6d795-4e7a-4ede-9fc1-f7bf929849c8&p=1|archive-date=22 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Malicious software==\n{{Further|Spyware|Computer virus|Trojan (computer security)|Keylogger|Backdoor (computing)}}\n\nIn addition to monitoring information sent over a computer network, there is also a way to examine data stored on a computer's [[hard drive]], and to monitor the activities of a person using the computer. A surveillance program installed on a computer can search the contents of the hard drive for suspicious data, can monitor computer use, collect [[password]]s, and/or report back activities in real-time to its operator through the Internet connection.<ref name=FTC2005>[http://www.ftc.gov/os/2005/03/050307spywarerpt.pdf \"Spyware Workshop: Monitoring Software on Your OC: Spywae, Adware, and Other Software\"], Staff Report, U.S. Federal Trade Commission, March 2005. Retrieved 7 September 2013.</ref> Keylogger is an example of this type of program. Normal keylogging programs store their data on the local hard drive, but some are programmed to automatically transmit data over the network to a remote computer or Web server.\n\nThere are multiple ways of installing such software. The most common is remote installation, using a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] created by a [[computer virus]] or [[Trojan (computer security)|trojan]]. This tactic has the advantage of potentially subjecting multiple computers to surveillance.  Viruses often spread to thousands or millions of computers, and leave \"backdoors\" which are accessible over a network connection, and enable an intruder to remotely install software and execute commands. These viruses and trojans are sometimes developed by government agencies, such as [[CIPAV]] and [[Magic Lantern (software)|Magic Lantern]]. More often, however, viruses created by other people or [[spyware]] installed by marketing agencies can be used to gain access through the security breaches that they create.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aycock, John|title=Computer Viruses and Malware|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=978-0-387-30236-2|url=https://www.springer.com/computer/security+and+cryptology/book/978-0-387-30236-2}}</ref>\n\nAnother method is [[Security cracking|\"cracking\"]] into the computer to gain access over a network. An attacker can then install surveillance software remotely. [[Server (computing)|Server]]s and computers with permanent [[broadband]] connections are most vulnerable to this type of attack.<ref>[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/18/office_workers_give_away_passwords/ \"Office workers give away passwords for a cheap pen\"],  John Leyden, ''The Register'', 8 April 2003.
