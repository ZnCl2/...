''Factorio'' began development in 2012 by the [[Prague]]-based Wube Software. It was released in [[early access]] in 2016, it will be officially released on September 25, 2020. An [[Indiegogo]] campaign in 2013 raised more than its goal, and early access versions have been sold on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and other [[Digital distribution|distributors]] to raise further funds.\n\nThe game follows an engineer who crash-landed on an alien planet and must harvest resources and create industry to build a rocket;<ref name=Zabijte>{{cite web|last=Dobrovský|first=Pavel|title=Zabijte planetu průmyslem v české budovatelské strategii Factorio|url=https://games.tiscali.cz/preview/zabijte-planetu-prumyslem-v-ceske-budovatelske-strategii-factorio-238255|work=Games.cz|accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref> however, as an [[open world|open-world game]], players can continue the game past the end of the storyline. The game has both [[single-player]] and [[multiplayer]] modes.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Factorio'' is a [[construction and management simulation|construction and management]] game focused on resource-gathering with [[real-time strategy]] and [[Survival horror|survival]] elements and influences from the ''BuildCraft'' and ''IndustrialCraft'' mods for the video game ''[[Minecraft]]''.<ref name=\"reddit.com\"/> The player survives by locating and harvesting resources to craft various tools and machines, which in turn create more advanced materials that allow for the progression to more sophisticated technologies and machines. The game progresses as the player continues to build and manage their automated factory-style system, which automates the mining, transportation, processing, and assembly of resources and products. Players research advanced technologies that allow them to create new structures, items, and upgrades, starting with basic automation and eventually leading to oil refining, robots, and power armor.<ref name=apg>{{cite web|last=Jauch |first=Daniel |title=Our Nation's Factorio Review |url=http://apgnation.com/archives/2014/05/15/2020/nations-factorio-review |work=APGNation |accessdate=16 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517121814/http://apgnation.com/archives/2014/05/15/2020/nations-factorio-review |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=IS>{{cite web|last=Priestman|first=Chris|title=Factorio Is A Machine-Fetishist’s Best Friend|url=http://indiestatik.com/2013/04/15/factorio/|work=Indie Statik|accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe current version of the game is formally \"won\" by launching a rocket, although choosing to ignore this goal and instead continue building a factory is possible, as ''Factorio'' is an [[open world]] game. Construction of a rocket requires massive amounts of resources, motivating the player to set up a sizable, effective factory in order to achieve this goal.\n\n===Combat===\nThe player is concerned with defending themselves and their factory from the planet's [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] fauna, known as 'Biters', 'Spitters', and 'Worms', who become increasingly hostile as pollutant emissions created by the player's factory increase, necessitating consideration of the balance between the player's production and the enemy's aggressiveness. The player can utilize defensive turrets, tanks, and other weapons to eliminate enemies.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/07/28/factorio-alpha-review/ |title=The Lighthouse Customer: Factorio| last=Livingston| first=Christopher| date=28 July 2014| accessdate=4 June 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"content\">{{cite web|url=https://www.factorio.com/content|title=Factorio – Content|work=www.factorio.com|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref> As the game progresses, enemies evolve and become harder to defeat.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nMultiplayer mode allows people to play together cooperatively or versus one another both [[LAN|locally]] and via the internet.<ref name=\"F4\" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://sandboxdb.com/factorio-gets-multiplayer/ | archive-url=https://archive.is/20141121161205/http://sandboxdb.com/factorio-gets-multiplayer/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=21 November 2014 | title=Factorio Gets Multiplayer | publisher=SandboxDB | date=1 November 2014 | accessdate=21 November 2014 | author=Rogers, Tristan }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Version 0.15.0 - Factorio Forums |url=https://forums.factorio.com/44505 |website=forums.factorio.com |accessdate=5 June 2019 |quote=\"New scenarios: PvP...\"}}</ref> Factorio supports both [[Game server#Dedicated server|dedicated servers]] as well as player-hosted [[Game server#Listen server|listen servers]].

The developers offer an online portal on the ''Factorio'' website for mod developers to host their content. To help support the modding community, there is an in-game mod manager that allows players to quickly download mods hosted on the ''Factorio'' website. Modifications to the game are written in [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]].\n\n==Development==\nThe game has been developed by a team of developers from [[Prague]] since mid 2012. The development team originally consisted of a single person, but has grown larger. Wube Software was created in September 2014 by Michal Kovařík and Tomáš Kozelek in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]. To fund the game the development team began an [[Indiegogo]] campaign, which started on 31 January 2013 and concluded on 3 March 2013. The campaign raised [[Euro|€]]21,626 of the €17,000 goal.<ref name=RPS1>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Graham|title=Factorio Trailer Looks Like A Fun Factory, Has Demo|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/05/02/factorio-trailer-demo/|work=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=IGG>{{cite web|title=Factorio|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/factorio|work=Indiegogo|accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=May2014>{{cite web|last=Kozelek|first=Tomas|title=Here we are|url=http://www.factorio.com/blog/post/here-we-are|website=www.factorio.com|accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref> Following the crowdfunding success, Wube sold [[early access]] editions of the game to raise further funds.
