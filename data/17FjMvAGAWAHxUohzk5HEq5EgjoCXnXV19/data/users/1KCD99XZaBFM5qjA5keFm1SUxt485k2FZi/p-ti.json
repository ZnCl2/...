According to Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, ''piti'' is a stimulating, exciting and energizing quality, as opposed to the calmness of ''sukha''.<ref>Buddhadasa Bhikkhu (Author), Santikaro Bhikkhu (Translator). Mindfulness With Breathing : A Manual for Serious Beginners. 1988, p. 69</ref> \n\nPiti is a joyful [[Saṅkhāra|samskara]] (formation) associated with no object so the practitioner is not attaining it by desire. It is often translated with the English word \"rapture\" and is distinguished from the longer-lasting meditative \"joy\" or \"happiness\" (Pali, Sanskrit: ''[[sukha]]'') which is a subtler feeling that arises along with ''pīti''.\n\n==Absorption factor==\n{{JhanaFactors|expanded=1|nobiblio=1}}\nIn [[Buddhist meditation]], the development of concentrative absorption (Sanskrit: ''dhyāna''; Pali: ''[[jhāna]]'') is canonically described in terms of the following five factors:\n* directed thought (''[[vitakka]]'')\n* pondering (''[[vicāra]]'')\n* physical pleasure (''pīti'')\n* happiness/joy/bliss (''sukha'')\n* equanimity (''[[upekkhā]]'')<ref>See, for instance, ''Samādha{{IAST|ṅ}}ga Sutta'' (a/k/a, ''Pañca{{IAST|ṅ}}gikasamādhi Sutta'', [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 5.28) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.028.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997).]</ref>\n\nBoth ''pīti'' and ''sukha'' are born of seclusion from the five hindrances and mental quietude. The 5th century CE ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' distinguishes between ''pīti'' and ''sukha'' in the following experiential manner:\n:And wherever the two are associated, happiness [here, Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli's translation of ''pīti''] is the contentedness at getting a desirable object, and bliss [''sukha''] is the actual experiencing of it when got. Where there is happiness [''pīti''] there is bliss (pleasure) [''sukha'']; but where there is bliss [''sukha''] there is not necessarily happiness [''pīti'']. Happiness is included in the [[sankhara|formations]] [[skandha|aggregate]]; bliss is included in the [[vedana|feeling]] aggregate. If a man exhausted in a desert saw or heard about a pond on the edge of a wood, he would have happiness; if he went into the wood's shade and used the water, he would have bliss....<ref>[[Visuddhimagga|Vsm]]. IV, 100 (Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli, 1999, p. 142). Similarly, see also the [[Abhidhamma]]'s [[atthakatha|commentary]], ''Atthasalini'' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html (Bodhi, 1980).]</ref>\n\n==Fivefold classification==\nAs the meditator experiences tranquillity (''[[samatha]]''), one of five kinds of physical pleasure (''piti'') will arise. These are:\n\n*'''Weak rapture''' only causes [[goose bumps|piloerection]]. \n*'''Short rapture''' evocates some thunder \"from time to time\". \n*'''Going down rapture''' explodes inside the body, like waves. \n*'''Exalting rapture''' \"makes the body jump to the sky\".\n*'''Fulfilling rapture''' seems to be a huge flood of a mountain stream.\n\nNote only the last two are considered specifically piti. The first four are just a preparation for the last one, which is the jhanic factor.<ref>[[Visuddhimagga|Vsm]].
