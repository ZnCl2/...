In the earliest texts and ancient myths of Hinduism, ''dharma'' meant cosmic law, the rules that created the universe from chaos, as well as rituals; in later [[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]], [[Puranas]] and the [[Indian epic poetry|Epics]], the meaning became refined, richer, and more complex, and the word was applied to diverse contexts.<ref name=phph>see:\n*English translated version by Jarrod Whitaker (2004): Horsch, Paul, \"From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma\", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5–6, pp. 423–448; Original peer reviewed publication in German: Horsch, Paul, \"Vom Schoepfungsmythos zum Weltgesetz\", in ''Asiatische Studien: Zeitschrift der Schweizerischen Gesellschaft für Asiankunde'', Volume 21 (Francke: 1967), pp. 31–61;\n*English translated version by Donald R.

Kane)|History of Dharmasastra]]'', in the hymns of the Rigveda the word dharma appears at least fifty-six times, as an adjective or noun. According to Paul Horsch,<ref name=paulhorsch>Horsch, Paul, \"From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma\", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 423-448.</ref> the word dharma has its origin in the myths of Vedic Hinduism. The Brahman (whom all the gods make up), claim the hymns of the Rig Veda, created the universe from chaos, they hold (dhar-) the earth and sun and stars apart, they support (dhar-) the sky away and distinct from earth, and they stabilise (dhar-) the quaking mountains and plains.<ref name=paulhorsch/><ref>RgVeda 6.70.1, 8.41.10, 10.44.8, for secondary source see [[Karl Friedrich Geldner]], Der Rigveda in Auswahl (2 vols.), Stuttgart; and [[Harvard Oriental Series]], 33-36, Bd.1-3: 1951.</ref> The gods, mainly [[Indra]], then deliver and hold order from disorder, harmony from chaos, stability from instability – actions recited in the Veda with the root of word dharma.<ref name=phph/> In hymns composed after the mythological verses, the word dharma takes expanded meaning as a cosmic principle and appears in verses independent of gods. It evolves into a concept, claims Paul Horsch,<ref name=paulhorsch/> that has a dynamic functional sense in [[Atharvaveda]] for example, where it becomes the cosmic law that links cause and effect through a subject. Dharma, in these ancient texts, also takes a ritual meaning. The ritual is connected to the cosmic, and \"dharmani\" is equated to ceremonial devotion to the principles that gods used to create order from disorder, the world from chaos.<ref>Paul Horsch, \"From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma\", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 430-431.</ref> Past the ritual and cosmic sense of dharma that link the current world to mythical universe, the concept extends to ethical-social sense that links human beings to each other and to other life forms. It is here that dharma as a concept of law emerges in Hinduism.<ref>P.

[[Ṛta]] in Vedas is the truth and cosmic principle which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it.<ref>Barbara Holdrege (2004), \"Dharma\" in: Mittal & Thursby (Editors) The Hindu World, New York: Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-21527-7}}, pp. 213–248.</ref><ref name=koller/> [[Māyā]] in Rig-veda and later literature means illusion, fraud, deception, magic that misleads and creates disorder,<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0800/mw__0844.html Māyā] Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, {{ISBN|978-8120603691}}</ref> thus is contrary to reality, laws and rules that establish order, predictability and harmony. Paul Horsch<ref name=paulhorsch/> suggests Ṛta and dharma are parallel concepts, the former being a cosmic principle, the latter being of moral social sphere; while Māyā and dharma are also analogous concepts, the former being that which corrupts law and moral life, the later being that which strengthens law and moral life.<ref name=koller>Koller, J.

It is, claims Van Buitenen, the pursuit and execution of one's nature and true calling, thus playing one's role in cosmic concert.

In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent.\n\nIn the Second Book of [[Ramayana]], for example, a peasant asks the King to do what dharma morally requires of him, the King agrees and does so even though his compliance with the law of dharma costs him dearly. Similarly, dharma is at the centre of all major events in the life of Rama, Sita, and Lakshman in Ramayana, claims Daniel Ingalls.<ref name=danielingalls>Daniel H. H.

The issue is debated by the characters, finally the right prevails over wrong, the good over evil.

Near the end of the epic, the god Yama, referred to as dharma in the text, is portrayed as taking the form of a dog to test the compassion of Yudishthira, who is told he may not enter paradise with such an animal, but refuses to abandon his companion, for which decision he is then praised by dharma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17003.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 17: Mahaprasthanika Parva: Section 3|publisher=}}</ref> The value and appeal of the Mahabharata is not as much in its complex and rushed presentation of metaphysics in the 12th book, claims Ingalls,<ref name=danielingalls/> because Indian metaphysics is more eloquently presented in other Sanskrit scriptures; the appeal of Mahabharata, like Ramayana, is in its presentation of a series of moral problems and life situations, to which there are usually three answers given, according to Ingalls:<ref name=danielingalls/> one answer is of [[Bhima]], which is the answer of brute force, an individual angle representing materialism, egoism, and self; the second answer is of [[Yudhishthira]], which is always an appeal to piety and gods, of social virtue and of tradition; the third answer is of introspective [[Arjuna]], which falls between the two extremes, and who, claims Ingalls, symbolically reveals the finest moral qualities of man. The Epics of Hinduism are a symbolic treatise about life, virtues, customs, morals, ethics, law, and other aspects of dharma.<ref>There is considerable amount of literature on dharma-related discussion in Hindu Epics: of Egoism versus Altruism, Individualism versus Social Virtues and Tradition; for examples, see:\n* Johann Jakob Meyer (1989), Sexual life in ancient India, {{ISBN|8120806387}}, Motilal Banarsidass, pp. 92-93; Quote – \"In Indian literature, especially in Mahabharata over and over again is heard the energetic cry – Each is alone.

Man is born alone, alone he lives, alone he dies, alone he tastes the fruit of his deeds and his ways, it is only his work that bears him company. (...) Our body and spiritual organism is ever changing; what belongs, then, to us? (...) Thus, too, there is really no teacher or leader for anyone, each is his own Guru, and must go along the road to happiness alone.

Of these, the most cited one is ''[[Manusmriti]]'', which describes the four ''Varnas'', their rights and duties.<ref name=alfh>[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] (2011), ''Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative'', {{ISBN|978-0195394238}}, Oxford University Press, pp. 215-227.</ref> Most texts of Hinduism, however, discuss ''dharma'' with no mention of ''Varna'' ([[Caste system in India|caste]]).<ref>Thapar, R. (1995), The first millennium BC in northern India, Recent perspectives of early Indian history, 80-141.</ref> Other dharma texts and Smritis differ from Manusmriti on the nature and structure of Varnas.<ref name=alfh/> Yet, other texts question the very existence of varna. [[Bhrigu]], in the Epics, for example, presents the theory that dharma does not require any varnas.<ref>Thomas R. Trautmann (1964), \"On the Translation of the Term Varna\", ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', Vol. 7, No. 2 (Jul., 1964), pp. 196-201.</ref> In practice, medieval India is widely believed to be a socially stratified society, with each social strata inheriting a profession and being endogamous. Varna was not absolute in Hindu dharma; individuals had the right to renounce and leave their Varna, as well as their [[Ashrama (stage)|asramas]] of life, in search of moksa.<ref name=alfh/><ref>see:\n* Van Buitenen, J.

(1972), \"Dharma: an expression of universal order\", ''Philosophy East and West'', 22(2), pp. 131-144.</ref> While neither Manusmriti nor succeeding Smritis of Hinduism ever use the word varnadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas), or varnasramadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas and asramas), the scholarly commentary on Manusmriti use these words, and thus associate dharma with varna system of India.<ref name=alfh/><ref>Kane, P.V.

(1993). ''The Asrama System: The history and hermeneutics of a religious institution'', New York: [[Oxford University Press]].</ref>\n\nAt the individual level, some texts of Hinduism outline [[Ashrama (stage)|four āśrama]]s, or stages of life as individual's dharma. These are:<ref>Alban G. Widgery, \"The Principles of Hindu Ethics\", ''International Journal of Ethics'', Vol. 40, No. 2 (Jan., 1930), pp. 232-245.</ref> (1) [[Brahmacharya|brahmacārya]], the life of preparation as a student, (2) [[Grihastha|gṛhastha]], the life of the householder with family and other social roles, (3) [[Vanaprastha|vānprastha]] or aranyaka, the life of the forest-dweller, transitioning from worldly occupations to reflection and renunciation, and (4) [[sannyāsa]], the life of giving away all property, becoming a recluse and devotion to moksa, spiritual matters.\n\nThe four stages of life complete the four human strivings in life, according to Hinduism.<ref name=jkkpwg/> Dharma enables the individual to satisfy the striving for stability and order, a life that is lawful and harmonious, the striving to do the right thing, be good, be virtuous, earn religious merit, be helpful to others, interact successfully with society. The other three strivings are [[Artha]] – the striving for means of life such as food, shelter, power, security, material wealth, etc.; [[Kama]] – the striving for sex, desire, pleasure, love, emotional fulfillment, etc.; and [[Moksa]] – the striving for spiritual meaning, liberation from life-rebirth cycle, self-realisation in this life, etc. The four stages are neither independent nor exclusionary in Hindu dharma.<ref name=jkkpwg>see:\n* Koller, J.

For example, according to Adam Bowles,<ref name=adambowles>Adam Bowles (2007), Dharma, Disorder, and the Political in Ancient India, Brill's Indological Library (Book 28), {{ISBN|978-9004158153}}, Chapter 3.</ref> [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] 11.1.6.24 links social prosperity and ''dharma'' through water. Waters come from rains, it claims; when rains are abundant there is prosperity on the earth, and this prosperity enables people to follow Dharma – moral and lawful life. In times of distress, of drought, of poverty, everything suffers including relations between human beings and the human ability to live according to dharma.<ref name=adambowles/>\n\nIn Rajadharmaparvan 91.34-8, the relationship between poverty and dharma reaches a full circle.

In Hindu philosophy, justice, social harmony, and happiness requires that people live per dharma. The [[Dharmashastra]] is a record of these guidelines and rules.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gächter|first=Othmar|title=Anthropos|journal=Anthropos institute|year=1998}}</ref> The available evidence suggest India once had a large collection of dharma related literature (sutras, shastras); four of the sutras survive and these are now referred to as Dharmasutras.<ref name=polivelle/> Along with laws of Manu in Dharmasutras, exist parallel and different compendium of laws, such as the laws of Narada and other ancient scholars.<ref>Donald Davis, Jr., \"A Realist View of Hindu Law\", ''Ratio Juris''.

However, the term dharma can also be transliterated from its original form.  \n\n===Buddha's teachings===\n<!--\"Sacca-kiriya\" links here. Please adjust link there if this section is removed or renamed. Thanks.-->\nFor practicing Buddhists, references to \"dharma\" (''dhamma'' in Pali) particularly as \"the Dharma\", generally means the teachings of the Buddha, commonly known throughout the East as Buddha-Dharma. It includes especially the discourses on the fundamental principles (such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]), as opposed to the parables and to the poems.\n\nThe status of Dharma is regarded variably by different Buddhist traditions. Some regard it as an ultimate truth, or as the fount of all things which lie beyond the \"[[three realms]]\" (Sanskrit: ''tridhatu'') and the \"wheel of becoming\" (Sanskrit: ''[[bhavachakra]]''), somewhat like the pagan Greek and Christian [[logos]]: this is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'' (Sanskrit). Others, who regard the Buddha as simply an enlightened human being, see the Dharma as the [[essence]] of the \"84,000 different aspects of the teaching\" (Tibetan: ''chos-sgo brgyad-khri bzhi strong'') that the Buddha gave to various types of people, based upon their individual propensities and capabilities.\n\nDharma refers not only to the sayings of the Buddha, but also to the later traditions of interpretation and addition that the various [[schools of Buddhism]] have developed to help explain and to expand upon the Buddha's teachings. For others still, they see the Dharma as referring to the \"truth\", or the ultimate reality of \"the way that things really are\" (Tib. Cho).\n\nThe Dharma is one of the [[Three Jewels]] of Buddhism in which practitioners of Buddhism seek refuge, or that upon which one relies for his or her lasting happiness. The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], meaning the mind's perfection of enlightenment, the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], meaning the teachings and the methods of the Buddha, and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], meaning the monastic community who provide guidance and support to followers of the Buddha.\n\n===Chan Buddhism===\nDharma is employed in [[Ch'an]] in a specific context in relation to transmission of authentic doctrine, understanding and bodhi; recognised in [[Dharma transmission]].\n\n==Jainism==\n{{Main article|Dharma (Jainism)}}\n[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|140px|Jainism]]\n\nThe word Dharma in Jainism is found in all its key texts.
