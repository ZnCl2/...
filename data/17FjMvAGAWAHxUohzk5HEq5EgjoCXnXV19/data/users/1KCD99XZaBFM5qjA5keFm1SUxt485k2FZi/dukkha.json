According to Winthrop Sargeant,{{quote|The ancient Aryans who brought the Sanskrit language to India were a nomadic, horse- and cattle-breeding people who travelled in horse- or ox-drawn vehicles. ''Su'' and ''dus'' are prefixes indicating good or bad. The word ''kha'', in later Sanskrit meaning \"sky,\" \"ether,\" or \"space,\" was originally the word for \"hole,\" particularly an axle hole of one of the Aryan's vehicles. Thus ''sukha'' … meant, originally, \"having a good axle hole,\" while ''duhkha'' meant \"having a poor axle hole,\" leading to discomfort.{{sfn|Sargeant|2009|p=303}}}}\n\n[[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]], American [[vipassana]] teacher and writer, explains the etymology as follows:\n{{quote|The word ''dukkha'' is made up of the prefix ''du'' and the root ''kha''. ''Du'' means “bad” or “difficult.” ''Kha'' means “empty.” “Empty,” here, refers to several things—some specific, others more general. One of the specific meanings refers to the empty axle hole of a wheel. If the axle fits badly into the center hole, we get a very bumpy ride. This is a good analogy for our ride through [[saṃsāra]].{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=289}}}}\n\nHowever, according to [[Monier Monier-Williams]], the actual roots of the [[Pali]] term [[wikt:dukkha|''dukkha'']] appear to be [[Sanskrit]] [[wikt:दुस्-|दुस्-]] (''dus-'', \"bad\") + [[wikt:स्था|स्था]] (''stha'', \"to stand\").{{Sfn|Monier-Williams|1899|p=483, entry note:&nbsp;|ps=\"according to grammarians properly written ''dush-kha'' and said to be from ''dus'' and ''kha'' [cf. ''su-khá'']; but more probably a Prākritized form for duḥ-stha'', q.v.\"}}  Regular phonological changes in the development of Sanskrit into the various [[Prakrit]]s led to a shift from ''dus-sthā'' to ''duḥkha'' to ''dukkha''.\n\n==Buddhism==\nContemporary translators of Buddhist texts use a variety of English words to convey the aspects of ''dukkha''. Early Western translators of Buddhist texts (before the 1970s) typically translated the Pali term ''dukkha'' as \"suffering.\" Later translators have emphasized that \"suffering\" is too limited a translation for the term dukkha, and have preferred to either leave the term untranslated or to clarify that translation with terms such as anxiety, distress, frustration, unease, unsatisfactoriness, etc.{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle locations 524-528}}{{sfn|Prebish|1993}}{{sfn|Keown|2003}} Many contemporary teachers, scholars, and translators have used the term \"unsatisfactoriness\" to emphasize the subtlest aspects of dukkha.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|1998|p=38}}{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Smith|Novak|2009|loc=Kindle location 2769}}{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 932-934}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2011|p=6}} Contemporary translators have used a variety of English words to translate the term ''dukkha'',{{refn|group=note|Contemporary translators have used a variety of English words to translate the term ''dukkha''; translators commonly use different words to translate aspects of the term. For example, ''dukkha'' has been translated as follows in many contexts:\n* Suffering (Harvey, Williams, Keown, Anderson, Gombrich, Thich Nhat Hanh, Ajahn Succito, Chogyam Trungpa, Rupert Gethin, Dalai Lama, ''et al.'')\n* Pain (Harvey, Williams, Keown, Anderson, Huxter, Gombrich, et al)\n* Unsatisfactoriness (Dalai Lama, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Rupert Gethin, ''et al.'')\n* Stress [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]](<ref>https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html</ref><ref>https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.086.than.html bottom\n</ref>\n* Sorrow\n* Anguish\n* Affliction (Brazier)\n* Dissatisfaction (Pema Chodron, Chogyam Trunpa)\n* Distress (Walpola Rahula)\n* Frustration (Dalai Lama, ''Four Noble Truths'', p.&nbsp;38)\n* Misery\n* Anxiety (Chogyam Trungpa, ''The Truth of Suffering'', pp.&nbsp;8–10)\n* Uneasiness (Chogyam Trungpa)\n* Unease (Rupert Gethin)\n* Unhappiness}}\nand many translators prefer to leave the term untranslated.{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 542-550}}\n\nWithin the Buddhist sutras, dukkha is divided in three categories:\n* ''Dukkha-dukkha'', the dukkha of painful experiences. This includes the physical and mental sufferings of [[Jāti (Buddhism)|birth]], [[Jarāmaraṇa|aging]], [[Byādhi (Buddhism)|illness]], [[Jarāmaraṇa|dying]]; distress from what is not desirable.\n* ''Viparinama-dukkha'', the dukkha of pleasant or happy experiences changing to unpleasant when the causes and conditions that produced the pleasant experiences cease.\n* ''Sankhara-dukkha'', the dukkha of conditioned experience. This includes \"a basic unsatisfactoriness pervading all existence, all forms of life, because all forms of life are changing, impermanent and without any inner core or substance.\"<ref group=web name=bodhi1>[http://www.beyondthenet.net/dhamma/fourNoble.htm ''The Four Noble Truths - By Bhikkhu Bodhi]</ref> On this level, the term indicates a lack of satisfaction, a sense that things never measure up to our expectations or standards.\n\nVarious sutras sum up how life in this \"mundane world\" is regarded to be ''dukkha'', starting with ''[[saṃsāra|samsara]]'', the ongoing process of death and rebirth itself:{{refn|group=note|name=\"PW\"|Paul Williams: \"All rebirth is due to karma and is impermanent. Short of attaining enlightenment, in each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with the completely impersonal causal nature of one's own karma. The endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath, is samsara.\"{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=74-75}}}}\n# [[Jāti (Buddhism)|Birth]] is dukkha, [[Jarāmaraṇa|aging]] is dukkha, [[Byādhi (Buddhism)|illness]] is dukkha, [[Jarāmaraṇa|death]] is dukkha; \n# Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are dukkha; \n# Association with the unbeloved is dukkha; separation from the loved is dukkha; \n# Not getting what is wanted is dukkha. \n# In conclusion, the five [[skandhas|clinging-aggregates]] are dukkha.\n\n''Dukkha'' is one of the [[three marks of existence]], namely ''dukkha'' (\"suffering\"), ''[[anatta]]'' (not-self), ''[[anicca]]'' (\"impermanence\").\n\nThe Buddhist tradition emphasizes the importance of developing insight into the nature of ''dukkha'', the conditions that cause it, and how it can be overcome. This process is formulated in the teachings on the [[Four Noble Truths]].\n\n==Hinduism==\nIn [[Hindu]] literature, the earliest [[Upanishads|Upani{{IAST|ṣ}}ads]] — the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|{{IAST|Bṛhadāraṇyaka}}]] and the [[Chandogya Upanishad|{{IAST|Chāndogya}}]] — in all likelihood predate the advent of Buddhism.{{refn|group=note|See, e.g., [[Patrick Olivelle]] (1996), ''Upani{{IAST|ṣ}}ads'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), {{ISBN|978-0-19-283576-5}}, p. xxxvi: \"The scholarly consensus, well-founded I think, is that the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|{{IAST|Bṛhadāraṇyaka}}]] and the {{IAST|Chāndogya}} are the two earliest [[Upanishads|Upani{{IAST|ṣ}}ads]]....
