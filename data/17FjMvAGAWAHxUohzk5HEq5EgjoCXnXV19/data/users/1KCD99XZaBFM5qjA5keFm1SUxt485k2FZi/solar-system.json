For comparison, the radius of the Sun is {{cvt|0.0047|AU|km|sigfig=1}}. Thus, the Sun occupies 0.00001% (10<sup>−5</sup> %) of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly one millionth (10<sup>−6</sup>) that of the Sun. Jupiter, the largest planet, is {{convert|5.2|AU|km}} from the Sun and has a radius of {{convert|71000|km|AU|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, whereas the most distant planet, Neptune, is {{convert|30|AU|km|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} from the Sun.\n\nWith a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus.

Because metallic elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the [[asteroid belt]], [[Kuiper belt]], and [[Oort cloud]].
