This view is found in the writing of Bharata Muni, the author of the ancient ''[[Natyasastra]]'' text.

According to [[Thomas Trautmann]], after this period of \"[[Indomania]]\", a certain hostility to Sanskrit and to Indian culture in general began to assert itself in early 19th century Britain, manifested by a neglect of Sanskrit in British academia. This was the beginning of a general push in favour of the idea that India should be culturally, religiously and linguistically assimilated to Britain as far as possible. Trautmann considers two separate and logically opposite sources for the growing hostility: one was \"[[Anti-Indian sentiment|British Indophobia]]\", which he calls essentially a developmentalist, progressivist, liberal, and non-racial-essentialist critique of Hindu civilisation as an aid for the improvement of India along European lines; the other was [[scientific racism]], a theory of the English \"common-sense view\" that Indians constituted a \"separate, inferior and unimprovable race\".<ref name=\"Trautmann2004\">{{cite book|author=Thomas R.

Roughly contemporary with the Brahmi, [[Kharosthi]] was used in the northwest of the subcontinent. Sometime between the fourth and eighth centuries, the [[Gupta script]], derived from Brahmi, became prevalent. Around the eighth century, the [[Śāradā script|''Śāradā'' script]] evolved out of the Gupta script. The latter was displaced in its turn by [[Devanagari]] in the 11th or 12th century, with intermediary stages such as the [[Siddhaṃ script]]. In [[East India]], the [[Odia alphabet]], and the [[Bengali alphabet]], were used.\n\nIn the south, where [[Dravidian languages]] predominate, scripts used for Sanskrit include the [[Kannada alphabet|Kannada]], [[Telugu script|Telugu]], the [[Malayalam script|Malayalam]] and [[Grantha alphabet]]s.<ref>{{cite news |date=21 November 2007 |title=Tamil Brahmi script in Egypt |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tamil-brahmi-script-in-egypt/article1952611.ece |newspaper=The Hindu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/Harappan-people-used-an-older-form-of-Brahmi-script-Expert/articleshow/17136460.cms|title=Harappan people used an older form of Brahmi script: Expert|work=The Times of India}}</ref>\n\n=== Romanisation ===\n{{Main|Devanagari transliteration|International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration}}\nSince the late 18th century, Sanskrit has been [[transliteration|transliterated]] using the [[Latin alphabet]]. The system most commonly used today is the IAST ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]]), which has been the academic standard since 1888. [[ASCII]]-based transliteration schemes have also evolved because of difficulties representing Sanskrit characters in computer systems. These include [[Harvard-Kyoto]] and [[ITRANS]], a transliteration scheme that is used widely on the Internet, especially in Usenet and in email, for considerations of speed of entry as well as rendering issues. With the wide availability of [[Unicode]]-aware web browsers, IAST has become common online. It is also possible to type using an [[alphanumeric keyboard]] and transliterate to Devanagari using software like Mac OS X's international support.\n\nEuropean scholars in the 19th century generally preferred Devanagari for the transcription and reproduction of whole texts and lengthy excerpts. However, references to individual words and names in texts composed in European Languages were usually represented with Roman transliteration. From the 20th century onwards, because of production costs, textual editions edited by Western scholars have mostly been in [[Romanised]] transliteration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shashir.autodidactus.org/shashir_umich/sanskrit_transcription.html|title=Modern Transcription of Sanskrit|publisher=autodidactus.org}}</ref>\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2016}}\n{{Main|Sanskrit grammar}}\n{{See also|Vedic Sanskrit grammar}}\n\nThe Sanskrit grammatical tradition, [[Vyākaraṇa]], one of the six [[Vedanga]]s, began in the late [[Vedic period]] and culminated in the ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' of Pāṇini, which consists of 3990 sutras (ca. fifth century BCE). About a century after Pāṇini (around 400 BCE), [[Kātyāyana]] composed ''Vārtika''s on the Pāṇini sũtras. [[Patanjali]], who lived three centuries after Pāṇini, wrote the ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'', the \"Great Commentary\" on the ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' and ''Vārtika''s. Because of these three ancient Vyākaraṇins (grammarians), this grammar is called ''Trimuni Vyākarana''. To understand the meaning of the sutras, Jayaditya and Vāmana wrote a commentary, the ''Kāsikā'', in 600 CE. Pāṇinian grammar is based on 14 [[Shiva]] sutras (aphorisms), where the whole ''mātrika'' (alphabet) is abbreviated. This abbreviation is called the ''Pratyāhara''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abhyankar|first1=Kashinath|title=A Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar|date=1986|publisher=Maharaja Sayajirao University|location=Baroda|url=http://lukashevichus.info/knigi/abhyankar_shukla_sans_gram_dic.pdf}}</ref>\n\nSanskrit verbs are categorized into ten classes, which can be conjugated to form the [[Present tense|present]], [[imperfect]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[optative mood|optative]], [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], [[aorist]], [[Future tense|future]], and [[conditional mood]]s and tenses.
