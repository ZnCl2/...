These ''[[Sutra|sutta]]''s (discourses) stress the practice of [[sati (Buddhism)|sati]] (mindfulness) \"for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the extinguishing of suffering and grief, for walking on the path of truth, for the realization of ''[[nirvana (Buddhism)|nibbāna]]''.\"{{refn|group=note|Famously, the Buddha declares at the beginning of this discourse: \"This is the direct way [Pāli: ''ekāyano ... maggo''],{{refn|group=subnote|While recognizing that ''ekāyano ... maggo'' is \"more commonly\" translated as \"the only path,\" Anālayo (2006, pp. 27-29) argues that ''ekāyano ... maggo'' is best translated as \"direct path\" based on the contextual meaning of ''ekāyano'' in the Mahāsīhanāda Sutta ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 12, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.012.ntbb.html Ñanamoli & Bodhi, 1994], where ''ekāyano'' describes a \"one way only\" path), its absence from other suttas, implications of speedy realization within the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta itself, and commentarial elaboration.

It can be interpreted as \"{{IAST|sati-paṭṭhāna}}\" (\"foundation of mindfulness\") or \"{{IAST|sati-upaṭṭhāna}}\" (\"presence of mindfulness\").{{refn|group=note|Anālayo (2006), pp. 29-30, argues that the analysis of the term as ''{{IAST|sati-upaṭṭhāna}}'' is a more etymologically correct derivation as ''{{IAST|upaṭṭhāna}}'' appears both throughout the [[Pali Canon]] and in the Sanskrit translation of this sutta; whereas the ''{{IAST|paṭṭhāna}}'' is only found in the [[Abhidhamma]] and post-nikaya [[Pali literature|Pali commentary]].}}\n\nIn regard to the prefix \"Maha-\" in the Pāli title of DN 22, this simply means \"great,\" or \"larger\" and likely refers to DN 22's expanded section on mindfulness of the Fourth Noble Truths.\n\nTwo suttas that focus on practice are the Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing) and the Satipatthana (Four Foundations of Mindfulness).\n\nThe Anapanasati Sutta translations and commentaries include one by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Buddhadasa’s Mindfulness with Breathing for Serious Beginners, [[Larry Rosenberg]]’s book Breath by Breath, and Thich Nhat Hanh’s book Breathe!

These are then further broken down into the following sections and subsections:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n#Body (''Kāyā'')\n#*Breathing (also see the [[Anapanasati Sutta]])\n#*Postures (Walking, Standing, Sitting, Lying Down)\n#*[[Sampajanna|Clear Comprehending]]\n#*[[Patikulamanasikara|Reflections on Repulsiveness of the Body]]\n#*Reflections on [[Mahābhūta|Material Elements]]\n#*[[Maranasati|Cemetery Contemplations]]\n#Sensations/Feelings (''[[Vedanā]]'')\n#* pleasant or unpleasant or neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant (neutral) feelings\n#* worldly or spiritual feelings\n#Mind/Consciousness (''[[Citta|Cittā]]''){{refn|group=note|Regarding English translations of ''citta'', Thanissaro (2000) and VRI (1996) translate it as \"mind\" while Nyanasatta (1994) and Soma (1999; 2003) translate it as \"consciousness.\"  Partly based on material from this discourse, Oxford-trained Dr. Sue Hamilton argues that ''citta'' is best translated as \"state of mind\" while ''[[vijnana|viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a]]'' is \"consciousness of\" (Hamilton, 2001, pp. 105-114).}}\n#* lust (''sarāga{{IAST|ṃ}}'') or without lust (''vītarāga{{IAST|ṃ}}'')\n#* hate (''sadosa{{IAST|ṃ}}'') or without hate (''vītadosa{{IAST|ṃ}}'')\n#* delusion (''samoha{{IAST|ṃ}}'') or without delusion (''vītamoha{{IAST|ṃ}}'')\n#* contracted (''sa{{IAST|ṅ}}khitta{{IAST|ṃ}}'') or scattered (''vikkhitta{{IAST|ṃ}}'')\n#* lofty (''mahaggata{{IAST|ṃ}}'') or not lofty (''amahaggata{{IAST|ṃ}}''){{refn|group=note|''Mahaggata'' is literally \"become great.\" According to the Pali commentary, ''amahaggata'' (''not'' become-great) refers to the \"conscious state of the plane of existence of sense experience\" (''[[kāma]]''), while ''mahaggata'' refers to the higher planes of forms (''rūpāvacara'') and formlessness (''arūpāvacara'') (Soma, 2003, p. 115).}}\n#* surpassable (''sa-uttara{{IAST|ṃ}}'') or unsurpassed (''anuttara{{IAST|ṃ}}''){{refn|group=note|The commentarial treatment of ''anuttara'' (\"unsurpassed\") and ''sa-uttara'' (\"surpassable\") is similar to its analysis of ''mahaggata'' (\"become great\") and ''amahaggata'' (\"not become great\") above (Soma, 2003, p. 115).}}\n#* quieted (''samāhita{{IAST|ṃ}}'') or not quieted (''asamāhita{{IAST|ṃ}}'')\n#* released (''vimutta{{IAST|ṃ}}'') or not released (''avimutta{{IAST|ṃ}}'')\n#Elements of the Buddhist teachings (''[[Dhamma|Dhammā]]''){{refn|group=note|\"Dhammas\" is often translated as \"mentalobjects\". Anālayo (2006), pp. 182-86, justly points out that translating ''dhamma'' as \"mental object\" (or anything similar, such as \"mental contents\" in this article) is problemmatic for multiple reasons, including that the three prior ''satipatthāna'' (body, sensations, mind) can become mental objects in themselves, and that those objects (such as the hindrances, aggregates and sense bases) identified under this ''satipatthāna'' (''dhamma'') are far from an exhaustive list of all possible mental objects. Thus, Anālayo more closely identifies this sutta's ''dhamma'' as \"mental factors and categories,\" \"classificatory schemes,\" and \"frameworks or points of reference to be applied during contemplation\" (p. 183). Anālayo (p. 183, ''nn''. 2, 3) quotes Gyori (1996, p. 24) as stating that contemplation of these ''dhamma'' \"are specifically intended to invest the mind with a soteriological orientation,\" and Gombrich (1996, p. 36) as writing that contemplating these ''dhamma'' teaches one \"to see the world through Buddhist spectacles.\" According to Sharf, in the ''Satipațțhāna-sutta'' the term ''sati'' means to remember the dharmas, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942}} According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way to liberation, \"constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths.\"{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=46}}{{refn|group=note|Frauwallner, E. (1973), ''History of Indian Philosophy'', trans. V.M. Bedekar, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass.

According to Bhikkhu Sujato, it seems to emphasize [[samatha]] or calm abiding, while the Theravadin version emphasizes [[Vipassana]] or insight.<ref>Sujato, A History of Mindfulness, 2005.</ref> The text also often refers to 'bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs' instead of just male bhikkhus.\n\nA section on ''Smṛtyupasthāna'' is found in various Tibetan and Chinese recensions of large [[Prajñāpāramitā]] sutras, such as the 25,000 line version translated by [[Edward Conze]]. This skeletal version of the Smṛtyupasthāna is incorporated into the larger sutra and thus appears as part of the Buddha's discourse to Subhuti. It only outlines specific practices for the contemplation of the body, the other three satipatthanas are simply enumerated.<ref>''[http://www.bswa.org/modules/mydownloads/singlefile.php?cid=19&lid=335 Sujato.

and,\n*is more measured in their responses or quick reacting.\nBased on these two dimensions the commentary's recommended personality-based ''satipaṭṭhāna'' is reflected in the grid shown at right.\n\nSoma (2003, p. xxiv) adds that ''all'' practitioners (regardless of their character and temperament) should also practice mindfulness of Postures (moving, standing, sitting, lying down) and [[Sampajanna|Clear Understanding]], about which he writes: \"The whole practice of mindfulness depends on the correct grasp of the exercises included in the two parts referred to here.\"\n\n===Single-focused, successive and simultaneous practices===\nThere are a variety of ways that one could use the methods described in the {{IAST|Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta}} including:\n\n# Focus on a single method.{{refn|group=note|In support of a single-method practice, Analāyo (2006), p.&nbsp;22, comments:\n:Several [Pali Canon] discourses relate the practice of a single ''{{IAST|satipaṭṭhāna}}'' directly to realization.  Similarly, the commentaries assign to each single ''{{IAST|satipaṭṭhāna}}'' meditation the capacity to lead to full awakening.  This may well be why a high percentage of present-day meditation teachers focus on the use of a single meditation technique, on the ground that a single-minded and thorough perfection of one meditation technique can cover all aspects of ''{{IAST|satipaṭṭhāna}}'', and thus be sufficient to gain realization.\nAmong those teachers who Analāyo uses to exemplify this teaching method are [[S. N. Goenka]] and Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo.  While justifying such a practice, Analāyo (2006), p.&nbsp;23, nonetheless adds this caveat: \n:Thus any single meditation practice from the ''{{IAST|satipaṭṭhāna}}'' scheme is capable of leading to deep insight.... Nonetheless, an attempt to cover all four ''{{IAST|satipaṭṭhānas}}'' in one's practice ... ensures speedy progress and a balanced and comprehensive development.}} The method most written about in the English language is that of mindfulness of breath.<ref>Also see the [[Anapanasati Sutta]].</ref>\n# Practice the various methods individually in succession. \n# Maintain breath mindfulness as a primary object while using other methods to address non-breath stimuli.{{refn|group=note|This is espoused in various ways &ndash; either implicitly or explicitly &ndash; by numerous teachers such as [[Henepola Gunaratana|Gunaratana]], 1996; [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Goldstein]], 1987; and, [[Nhat Hanh]], 2005.  In such an approach, the central instructions relate to breath meditation but additional instructions are provided for dealing with mindfulness in daily life (Clear Comprehension) and unwholesome mental content such as the Hindrances or the [[fetters]] (which are referenced in the {{IAST|Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta}} in regard to sense-base mindfulness).  Typical of such approaches, Thanissaro (2000) writes:\n:At first glance, the four frames of reference for satipatthana practice sound like four different meditation exercises, but [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.118.than.html MN 118] makes clear that they can all center on a single practice: keeping the breath in mind. When the mind is with the breath, all four frames of reference are right there. The difference lies simply in the subtlety of one's focus. It's like learning to play the piano. As you get more proficient at playing, you also become sensitive in listening to ever more subtle levels in the music. This allows you to play even more skillfully. In the same way, as a meditator get more skilled in staying with the breath, the practice of satipatthana gives greater sensitivity in peeling away ever more subtle layers of participation in the present moment until nothing is left standing in the way of total release.}}\n# Practice multiple methods either in tandem or in a context-driven manner.{{refn|group=note|For instance, Analāyo (2006), pp. 21-23, has pointed out that the first three body-centered methods suggest different depths or a progression of practice based on one's activity.  For example, one engaged in simply walking or standing (two of the so-called \"postures\") could be mindful of gross sensory stimulation; then when one is silent and planning to speak, one could first contemplate one's purpose in speaking (indicative of Clear Comprehension); in addition, while one is sitting still with a focus on one's in-breath and out-breath, one is able to pursue a deeper development of [[samatha]] and [[vipassana]] as part of formal breath meditation.}}\n\n==English commentaries==\n*{{cite book|last=Nhất Hạnh|first=Thích|authorlink=Thích Nhất Hạnh|title=Transformation and Healing: Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness|publisher=[[Parallax Press]]|year=2002|ISBN=978-1888375626}}\n*{{cite book|author=Analayo|authorlink=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Satipatthana: The Direct Path to Realization|publisher=Windhorse Publications|year=2004|ISBN=978-1899579549}}\n*{{cite book|last=Gunaratana|first=Bhante|authorlink=Henepola Gunaratana|title=The Four Foundations of Mindfulness in Plain English|publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]]|year=2014|ISBN=978-1614290384}}\n*{{cite book|last=Goenka|first=S.N.|authorlink=S.
