According to [[L. S.

R.

Nevertheless, they were considered correct by the Pali tradition, which didn't correct them.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}} According to K.R. Norman, the basic set is as follows:{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=219, 222}}\n* idam dukkham, \"this is pain\"\n* ayam dukkha-samudayo, \"this is the origin of pain\"\n* ayam dukkha-nirodha, \"this is the cessation of pain\"\n* ayam dukkha-nirodha-gamini patipada, \"this is the path leading to the cessation of pain.\"  The key terms in the longer version of this expression, ''dukkha-nirodha-gamini Patipada'', can be translated as follows:\n:* ''Gamini'': leading to, making for<ref group=web>[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=pali&query=g%C4%81min%C4%AB&matchtype=exact&display=utf8 Pali Text Society Dictionary]</ref>\n:* ''Patipada'': road, path, way; the means of reaching a goal or destination<ref group=web>[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#pq Access to Insight Glossary - pq]</ref>\n\n===Alternative formulations===\nAccording to L.S. Cousins, the four truths are not restricted to the well-known form where ''dukkha'' is the subject. Other forms take \"the world, the arising of the world\" or \"the [[Asava|āsavas]], the arising of the āsavas\" as their subject. According to Cousins, \"the well-known form is simply shorthand for all of the forms.\"{{sfn|Cousins|2001|p=36}} \"The world\" refers to the [[saṅkhāra]]s, that is, all compounded things,<ref group=web>[http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/7.2-Rohitassa-S-s2.26-piya.pdf The Dharmafarers, ''Rhitassa Sutra'' (Samyutta Nikaya 2.26)]</ref> or to the [[Ayatana|six sense spheres]].{{sfn|Choong|2000|p=84}}\n\nThe various terms all point to the same basic idea of Buddhism, as described in [[Skandha|five skandhas]] and [[Twelve Nidānas|twelve nidānas]]: sense-contact with objects leads to sensation, perception, [[Saṅkhāra]] ('inclinations', c.q. craving etc.), and consciousness. The ''Twelve Nidānas'' describe how this also leads to rebirth: from sensation comes craving, from craving comes karma, from karma comes rebirth. The aim of the Buddhist path is to reverse this causal chain: when there is no (response to) sensation, there is no craving, no karma, no rebirth.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2000|p=840}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=55-59}}\n\n===Truths for the noble ones===\nThe Pali terms ''ariya sacca'' (Sanskrit: ''arya satya'') are commonly translated as \"noble truths\". This translation is a convention started by the earliest translators of Buddhist texts into English. According to K.R. Norman, this is just one of several possible translations.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} According to [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]],{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}\n{{quote|[T]here is no particular reason why the Pali expression ariyasaccani should be translated as 'noble truths'. It could equally be translated as 'the nobles' truths', or 'the truths for nobles', or 'the nobilising truths', or 'the truths of, possessed by, the noble ones' [...] In fact the Pali expression (and its Sanskrit equivalent) can mean all of these, although the Pali commentators place 'the noble truths' as the least important in their understanding.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}}}\n\nThe term \"arya\" was later added to the four truths.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}}{{sfn|Analayo|2013|p=15}} The term ''[[Arya (Buddhism)|ariya]]'' (Sanskrit: ''arya'') can be translated as \"noble\", \"not ordinary\", \"valuable\", \"precious\".{{refn|group=note|Ajahn Sucitto states: \"So the four truths (ariya sacca) are generally called “noble” truths, although one might also translate ariya as “precious.” \"{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|loc=Kindle Location 122}} }} \"pure\",{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} Paul Williams:\n{{quote|The Aryas are the noble ones, the saints, those who have attained 'the fruits of the path', 'that middle path the Tathagata has comprehended which promotes sight and knowledge, and which tends to peace, higher wisdom, enlightenment, and Nibbana'.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=52}}}}\n\nThe term ''[[satya|sacca]]'' (Sanskrit: ''[[satya]]'') is a central term in Indian thought and religion. It is typically translated as \"truth\"; but it also means \"that which is in accord with reality\", or \"reality\". According to [[Rupert Gethin]], the four truths are \"four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening.\"{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}} They function as \"a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought.\"{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}{{refn|group=note|name=\"Gethin_framework\"|Gethin: \"The word satya (Pali sacca) can certainly mean truth, but it might equally be rendered as 'real' or 'actual thing'. That is, we are not dealing here with propositional truths with which we must either agree or disagree, but with four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening. [...] This is not to say that the Buddha's discourses do not contain theoretical statements of the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation, but these descriptions function not so much as dogmas of the Buddhist faith as a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought.\"{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}}} According to K.R. Norman, probably the best translation is \"the truth[s] of the noble one (the Buddha).\"{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} It is a statement of how things are seen by a Buddha, how things really are when seen correctly. It is the truthful way of seeing,{{refn|group=note|'\"Truth\", ''satya'' (Sanskrit), ''sacca'' (Pali), derived from ''sat'', being, how it is.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}}} Through not seeing things this way, and behaving accordingly, we suffer.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}{{refn|group=note|Contemporary Buddhist teacher [[Mingyur Rinpoche]] describes the four ''arya satya'' as \"Four Pure Insights into the Way Things Are\".{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} Contemporary scholar Peter Harvey translates ''arya satya'' as \"True Realities for the Spiritually Ennobled\".{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=52}}}}\n\n===Symbolic and propositional function===\n[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Dharmacakra]], often used to represent the Noble Eightfold Path]]\n\nAccording to Anderson, the four truths have both a symbolic and a propositional function:\n{{quote|... the four noble truths are truly set apart within the body of the Buddha's teachings, not because they are by definition sacred, but because they are both a symbol and a doctrine and transformative within the sphere of right view. As one doctrine among others, the four noble truths make explicit the structure within which one should seek enlightenment; as a symbol, the four noble truths evoke the possibility of enlightenment. As both, they occupy not only a central but a singular position within the Theravada canon and tradition.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=230-231}}}}\n\nAs a symbol, they refer to the possibility of awakening, as represented by the Buddha, and are of utmost importance:\n{{quote|[W]hen the four noble truths are regarded in the canon as the first teaching of the Buddha, they function as a view or doctrine that assumes a symbolic function. Where the four noble truths appear in the guise of a religious symbol in the ''Sutta-pitaka'' and the ''Vinaya-pitaka'' of the Pali canon, they represent the enlightenment experience of the Buddha and the possibility of enlightenment for all Buddhists within the cosmos.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55}}}}\n\nAs a proposition, they are part of the matrix or \"network of teachings,\" in which they are \"not particularly central,\"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} but have an equal place next to other teachings,{{sfn|Anderson|2011|p=127-128}} describing how release from craving is to be reached.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=230-231}} A long recognized feature of the Theravada canon is that it lacks an \"overarching and comprehensive structure of the path to ''nibbana''.\"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=131}} The sutras form a network or matrix, and the four truths appear within this \"network of teachings,\" which have to be taken together.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}}{{refn|group=note|name=\"Gethin_framework\"}} Within this network, \"the four noble truths are one doctrine among others and are not particularly central,\"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} but are a part of \"the entire ''dhamma'' matrix.\"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86}} The four noble truths are be set and learnt in that network, learning \"how the various teachings intersect with each other,\"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86-87}} and refer to the various Buddhist techniques, which are all explicitly and implicitly part of the passages which refer to the four truths.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=132}} According to Anderson,\n{{quote|There is no single way of understanding the teachings: one teaching may be used to explain another in one passage; the relationship may be reversed or altered in other talks.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86}}}}\n\n===''Dukkha'' and its ending===\nAs a proposition, the four truths defy an exact definition, but refer to and express the basic orientation of [[Buddhism]]:{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=59}} [[Upādāna|clinging and craving]] to temporary states and things is ultimately unsatisfactory and painful, ''dukkha'',{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=45-46}} and leads to repeated rebirth and \"redeath.\"\n<!--** START OF NOTE (\"SAMSARA\") **-->{{refn|group=note|name=\"Samsara\"|On samsara, rebirth and redeath:<br><br>* Mahasatipatthana-sutta: \"And what, ''bhkkhus'', is the noble truth that is the arising of pain?

While traditional Theravada saw little room for meditation practice, a subordinate role for lay Buddhists, and the attainment of ''nirvana'' as impossible in our times, reformists advocated the practice of meditation by lay Buddhists, as a means to preserve the pre-colonial order, which centered around Buddhism.

So embedded is this Indian soteriological framework in Buddhism that Buddhists might find it unintelligible that one would even consider questioning it. For to dispense with such key doctrines as rebirth, the law of kamma, and liberation from the cycle of birth and death would surely undermine the entire edifice of Buddhism itself. Yet for those who have grown up outside of Indian culture, who feel at home in a modernity informed by the natural sciences, to then be told that one cannot “really” practise the dharma unless one adheres to the tenets of ancient Indian soteriology makes little sense. The reason people can no longer accept these beliefs need not be because they reject them as false, but because such views are too much at variance with everything else they know and believe about the nature of themselves and the world.

The possibility of achieving nirvana is primarily a concern for Buddhist monastics, while the laity are more concerned with avoiding karma that would propel them to a miserable rebirth, and with accumulating meritorious karma that will lead to a favorable rebirth and, in the long run, to ultimate liberation. (...) As a direct result of their belief in the efficacy of karma, Theravada lay Buddhists commonly make offerings of food, goods, and money to the ordained Sangha.

Their solution was to postulate a fundamental difference between the inner soul or self and the body. The inner self is unchangeable, and unaffected by actions. By insight into this difference, one was liberated. To equal this emphasis on insight, Buddhists presented insight into their most essential teaching as equally liberating. What exactly was regarded as the central insight \"varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha.\"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}}} This change is reflected in the canon, where, according to Bronkhorst,\n{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}\n\nThe ideas on what exactly constituted this \"liberating insight\" was not fixed but developed over time.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chpter 7}} According to Bronkhorst, in [[Presectarian Buddhism|earliest Buddhism]] the four truths did not serve as a description of \"liberating insight\".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} Initially the term ''prajna'' served to denote this \"liberating insight.\" Later on, ''prajna'' was replaced in the suttas by the \"four truths.\"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} This happened in those texts where practicing the four jhanas preceded the attainment of \"liberating insight,\" and where this practice of the four jhanas then culminates in \"liberating insight.\"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}} This \"liberating insight\" came to be defined as \"insight into the four truths,\" which is presented as the \"liberating insight\" which constituted the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], or \"enlightenment\" of the Buddha.

that the cause of sorrow is desire.\"{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=72-73}} Childers, drawing on Gogerly and Hardy, writes that \"existence is suffering; human passion (''tanhã'' - desire) is the cause of continued existence.\"{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=120}}}} This colonial project had a strong influence on some strands of Buddhism, culminating in socalled [[Protestant Buddhism]], which incorporated several essentially Protestant attitudes regarding religion, such as the emphasis on written texts.{{sfn|Gombrich|Obeyesekere|1988}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{refn|group=note|See David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/06/24/protestant-buddhism/ ''Protestant Buddhism''], [https://vividness.live/2011/06/28/a-new-world-religion/ ''A new World Religion''] and [https://vividness.live/2011/06/24/problems-with-scripture/ ''Problems with scripture''].}} According to Gimello, Rahula's book is an example of this Protestant Budhism, and \"was created in an accommodating response to western expectations, and in nearly diametrical opposition to Buddhism as it had actually been practised in traditional Theravada.\"{{refn|group=note|Gimello (2004), as quoted in Taylor (2007).{{sfn|Taylor|2007|p=361}}}}\n\nHendrick Kern proposed in 1882 that the model of the four truths may be an analogy with classical Indian medicine, in which the four truths function as a medical diagnosis, and the Buddha is presented as a physician.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}{{refn|group=note|Kern's model:{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 909-911}}{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=52}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=42}}\n# ''The truth of dukkha:'' identifying the illness and the nature of the illness (the [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]])\n# ''The truth of origin:''  identifying the [[Cause (medicine)|causes of the illness]]\n# ''The truth of cessation:'' identifying a cure for the illness (the [[prognosis]])\n# ''The truth of the path:'' recommending a treatment for the illness that can bring about a cure (the [[Medical prescription|prescription]])}} Kern's analogy became rather popular,{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}{{refn|group=note|See,<ref>{{harvtxt|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 909-911}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Lopez|2001|p=52}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Williams|2002|p=42}}</ref>}} but \"there is not sufficient historical evidence to conclude that the Buddha deliberately drew upon a clearly defined medical model for his fourfold analysis of human pain.\"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}\n\nAccording to Anderson, those scholars who did not place the four truths at the center of Buddhism, either \"located the four truths in a fuller reading of the Theravada canon and the larger context of South Asian literature,\" or \"located the teaching within an experience of Buddhism as practiced in a contemporary setting.\"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=198}} According to Anderson, \"these autors suggest a more complex reading of the four noble truths than those who locate the teaching as the key to or as a crucial element within the grand scheme of Buddhism.\"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=198}}\n\n==Appearance within the discourses==\nThe developing Buddhist tradition inserted the four truths, using various formulations, at various sutras.{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} They are being used both as a symbol of all dhammas and the Buddha's awakening, and as a set of propositions which function within a matrix of teachings.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=86}} According to Anderson, there is no single way to understand the teachings; one teaching may be used to explain another teaching, and vice versa. The teachings form a network, which should be apprehended as such to understand how the various teachings intersect with each other.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=86-87}}\n\n===Symbolic function===\n\n====''Mahasaccaka Sutta''====\nThe ''Mahasaccaka Sutta'' (\"The Greater Discourse to Saccaka\", Majjhima Nikaya 36) gives one of several versions of the Buddha's way to liberation.{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26, \"The Noble Search,\" also gives an account, which is markedly different, omitting the ascetic practices and the four truths.}} He attains the three knowledges, namely knowledge of his former lifes, knowledge of death and rebirth, and knowledge of the destruction of the taints,{{refn|group=note|Which keep one trapped in ''samsara''.}} the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995}} After going through the four dhyanas, and gaining the first two knowledges, the story proceeds:\n{{quote|I directed my mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the intoxicants [suffering ... origin ... cessation ... path] [intoxicants (''asava'') ... origin ... cessation ... path] My mind was liberated [...] the knowledge arose that it was liberated.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=102-103}}}}\n\nBronkhorst dismisses the first two knowledges as later additions, and proceeds to notice that the recognition of the intoxicants is modelled on the four truths. According to Bronkhorst, those are added the bridge the original sequence of \"I directed my mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the intoxicants. My mind was liberated\", which was interrupted by the addition of the four truths. Bronkhorst points out that those do not fit here, since the four truths culminate in the knowledge of the path to be followed, while the Buddha himself is already liberated at that point.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=103-104}}\n\n====''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta''====\n[[File:Gandharan - Expounding the Law - Walters 2551.jpg|right|thumb|A relief depicting the first discourse of the Buddha, from the 2nd century (Kushan).<ref group=web>[http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21971 Expounding the Law], [[The Walters Art Museum]]</ref> The Walters Art Museum.

When, however, these seekers encounter the doctrine of rebirth, they often balk, convinced it just doesn't make sense.

Some dismiss it as just a piece of cultural baggage, \"ancient Indian metaphysics,\" that the Buddha retained in deference to the world view of his age.

The teaching of rebirth crops up almost everywhere in the Canon, and is so closely bound to a host of other doctrines that to remove it would virtually reduce the Dhamma to tatters.

To the contrary, they even say that rebirth occurs \"with the breakup of the body, after death,\" which clearly implies they intend the idea of rebirth to be taken quite literally.\"<ref group=web name=\"BB-rebirth\"/>}} [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], as another example, rejects the \"modern argument\" that \"one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth.\" He states, \"rebirth has always been a central teaching in the Buddhist tradition.\"<ref group=web name=\"TB_Rebirth\">Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/truth_of_rebirth.html ''The Truth of Rebirth. And Why it Matters for Buddhist Practice'']</ref>{{refn|group=note|Thanissaro Bhikkhu: \"A second modern argument against accepting the canonical accounts of what's known in awakening — and in particular, the knowledge of rebirth achieved in awakening — is that one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth. After all, all the factors leading to suffering are all immediately present to awareness, so there should be no need, when trying to abandon them, to accept any premises about where they may or may not lead in the future.<br>This objection, however, ignores the role of appropriate attention on the path. As we noted above, one of its roles is to examine and abandon the assumptions that underlie one's views on the metaphysics of personal identity. Unless you're willing to step back from your own views — such as those concerning what a person is, and why that makes rebirth impossible — and subject them to this sort of examination, there's something lacking in your path. You'll remain entangled in the questions of inappropriate attention, which will prevent you from actually identifying and abandoning the causes of suffering and achieving the full results of the practice.<br><br>In addition, the terms of appropriate attention — the four noble truths — are not concerned simply with events arising and passing away in the present moment. They also focus on the causal connections among those events, connections that occur both in the immediate present and over time. If you limit your focus solely to connections in the present while ignoring those over time, you can't fully comprehend the ways in which craving causes suffering: not only by latching on to the four kinds of nutriment, but also giving rise to the four kinds of nutriment as well.<ref group=web name=\"TB_Rebirth\"/>}}{{refn|group=note|According to Konik: {{quote|No doubt, according to the early Indian Buddhist tradition, the Buddha's great discovery, as condensed in his experience of nirvana, involved the remembrance of his many former existences, presupposing as fact the reality of a never-ending process of rebirth as a source of deep anxiety, and an acceptance of the Buddha's overcoming of that fate as ultimate liberation.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}}}}}\n\nAccording to Owen Flanagan, the Dalai Lama states that \"Buddhists believe in rebirth\" and that this belief has been common among his followers. However, the Dalai Lama's belief, adds Flanagan, is more sophisticated than ordinary Buddhists, because it is not the same as [[reincarnation]]--rebirth in Buddhism is envisioned as happening without the assumption of an \"atman, self, soul\", but rather through a \"consciousness conceived along the [[anatta|anatman]] lines\".{{sfn|Flanagan|2014|pp=233-234 with note 1}}{{refn|group=note|The Dalai Lama himself is regarded to be an incarnation of the thirteen previous Dalai Lamas, who are all manifestations of [[Avalokitasvara]].{{sfn|Chitkara|1998|p=39}}}} The doctrine of rebirth is considered mandatory in Tibetan Buddhism, and across many Buddhist sects.{{sfn|Flanagan|2014|pp=234-235 with note 5}}\n\nAccording to Christopher Gowans, for \"most ordinary Buddhists, today as well as in the past, their basic moral orientation is governed by belief in karma and rebirth\".{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 76–88}} Buddhist morality hinges on the hope of well being in this lifetime or in future rebirths, with nirvana (enlightenment) a project for a future lifetime. A denial of karma and rebirth undermines their history, moral orientation and religious foundations.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 76–88}} According to Keown, most Buddhists in Asia do accept these traditional teachings, and seek better rebirth.{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60–63, 74-85, 185-187}}{{refn|group=note|The vast majority of Buddhist lay people, states Kevin Trainor, have historically pursued Buddhist rituals and practices motivated with rebirth into Deva realm.{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=62}} Fowler and others concur with Trainor, stating that better rebirth, not nirvana, has been the primary focus of a vast majority of lay Buddhists.

For this reason, [[B. R. Ambedkar]], the founder of Navayana, discarded much of traditional Buddhism, including the Four Noble Truths, karma and rebirth, thus turning his new religion into a Marxist-oriented vehicle for [[class struggle]] and social action.<ref name=blackburn1>Anne M.
