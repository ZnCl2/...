The principle is applied in the [[Twelve Nidānas|twelve links]] of dependent origination doctrine in [[Buddhism]], which describes the chain of causes which result in [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and [[dukkha]] (suffering). By breaking the chain, liberation from suffering can be attained.

If it is asked, 'Who is it that sees? Is it the window or the person that actually sees?' the answer is, 'The window does not possess the ability to see; it is only the person who sees.' If it is again asked, 'Will the person be able to see things on the outside without the window (if he is confined to a room without the window or with the window closed)?' the answer will be, 'It is not possible to see things through the wall without the window. One can only see through the window.' Similarly, in the case of seeing, there are two separate realities of the eye and seeing. (So the eye does not have the ability to see without the eye-consciousness. The eye-consciousness itself cannot see anything without the organ.) The eye is not seeing, nor is seeing the eye, yet there cannot be an act of seeing without the eye. In reality, seeing comes into being depending on the eye. It is now evident that in the body there are only two distinct elements of materiality (eye) and mentality (eye-consciousness) at every moment of seeing.

According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the importance of the ''Upanisa Sutta'' which brings together the 12 Nidanas (as analysis of arising of suffering) and Transcendental Dependent Arising (as analysis of supramundane transcendence of suffering) is that:\n\n<blockquote>In addition to giving a clear, explicit account of the conditional structure of the liberative progression, this sutta has the further advantage of bringing the supramundane form of dependent arising into immediate connection with its familiar samsaric counterpart. By making this connection it brings into prominence the comprehensive character of the principle of conditionality — its ability to support and explain both the process of compulsive involvement which is the origin of suffering and the process of disengagement which leads to deliverance from suffering. Thereby it reveals dependent arising to be the key to the unity and coherence of the Buddha's teaching.<ref>Bhikkhu Bodhi. Transcendental Dependent Arising.

The sutta states that \"suffering is the supporting condition for faith\", thereby linking it with the last nidana in the 12 nidana chain. As Bhikkhu Bodhi explains: \"it is the experience of suffering which first tears us out of our blind absorption in the immediacy of temporal being and sets us in search of a way to its transcendence.\" Faith also comes about through the hearing of the exposition of true Dhamma (teaching). Faith also leads to the practice of [[Buddhist ethics|morality]] (sila).\n|-\n|Joy (''pāmojja'')\n|From confidence in the sources of refuge and contemplation on them, a sense of joy arises\n|-\n|[[Pīti|Rapture]] (''pīti'')\n|Generally, the application of [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] is needed for the arising of rapture or bliss, though some rare individuals might experience rapture simply from the joy which arises from faith and a clear conscience arising from moral living. The meditative states called [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhanas]] are states of elevated rapture.\n|-\n|[[Passaddhi|Tranquillity]] (''passaddhi'')\n|In the higher states of meditation, rapture gives way to a calm sense of tranquility. \n|-\n|[[Sukha|Happiness]] (''sukha'')\n|A subtler state than rapture, a pleasant feeling. \n|-\n|[[Samadhi (Buddhism)|Concentration]] (''samādhi'')\n|\"The wholesome unification of the mind\", totally free from distractions and unsteadiness. \n|-\n|''yathābhūta-ñānadassana''\n|\"Knowledge and vision of things as they really are\". With a peaceful and concentrated mind, one is now able to practice the development of insight (''[[Vipassanā|vipassana]] bhavana),'' the first phase of which is insight into the nature of the [[Skandha|five aggregates]]''.'' Only ''pañña,'' the wisdom which penetrates the true nature of phenomena, can destroy the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements]] which keep beings bound to samsara. This wisdom is not mere conceptual understanding, but a kind of direct experience akin to visual perception which sees the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness of all phenomena. In Northern Buddhist traditions and Mahayana works, insight into [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] is further emphasized. \n|-\n|Disenchantment (''nibbidā'')\n|Noticing the passing away of phenomena, the fact that nothing is stable, reliable or permanent, gives rise to a sense of disenchantment towards them.

Bodhi: \"The retrospective cognition of release involves two acts of ascertainment. The first, called the \"knowledge of destruction\" ''(khaya ñana),'' ascertains that all defilements have been abandoned at the root; the second, the \"knowledge of non-arising\" ''(anuppade ñana),'' ascertains that no defilement can ever arise again.\"  \n|}\n*\n\n===Karma===\nThe Karma theory of Buddhism is integrated into its Twelve Nidanas doctrine, and has been extensively commented on by ancient Buddhist scholars such as [[Nagarjuna]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Ray Billington |title=Understanding Eastern Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dACFAgAAQBAJ |year=2002|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-79348-8 |pages=57–58, 73–74 note 1 }}</ref> Karma consists of any intentional action, whether of body or speech or in mind, which can be either advantageous (merit) or disadvantageous (demerit).

Because of his vast influence in the development of Theravada scholasticism, this model has been very influential in the Theravada school. According to Akira Hirakawa and Paul Groner, this \"embryological\" interpretation which links dependent origination with rebirth was also promoted by the [[Sarvastivadin]] school (a north Indian branch of the [[Sthavira nikāya]]) as evidenced by the [[Abhidharmakosa]] of [[Vasubandhu]].<ref name=\"Hirakawa page 178\">Hirakawa; Groner, A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna, page 178</ref>\n\nAnother Theravada interpretation of the twelve links sees them as explaining psychological or phenomenological processes in the present moment. In Buddhaghosa's Sammohavinodani, a commentary to the [[Vibhanga]] of the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]], the principle of Dependent Origination is explained as occurring entirely within the space of one mind moment.<ref>Ven. Prayudh Payutto, Dependent Origination: the Buddhist Law of Conditionality, http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books3/Payutto_Bhikkhu_Dependent_Origination.htm#C5</ref> According to [[Prayudh Payutto]] there is material in the [[Vibhanga]] which discusses both models, the three lifetimes model and the phenomenological mind moment model.\n\nThis thesis is also defended by Bhikkhu [[Buddhadasa]]'s ''Paticcasamuppada: Practical Dependent Origination.'' In this interpretation, Birth and Death refer not to physical birth and death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the \"emergence of the ego\". According to Buddhadhasa: \"dependent arising is a phenomenon that lasts an instant; it is impermanent. Therefore, Birth and Death must be explained as phenomena within the process of dependent arising in everyday life of ordinary people. Right Mindfulness is lost during contacts of the Roots and surroundings. Thereafter, when vexation due to greed, anger, and ignorance is experienced, the ego has already been born. It is considered as one 'birth'\".<ref>Buddhadhasa, Paticcasamuppada: \nPractical Dependent Origination, http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books6/Bhikkhu_Buddhadasa_Paticcasamuppada.htm</ref>\n\nThe [[Abhidharmakosa]] also outlines three other models of the 12 links that were used by the Sarvastivada schools apart from the three lifetimes model:<ref name=\"Hirakawa page 178\"/>\n\n#Instantaneous – All 12 links are present in the same instant.\n#Prolonged – The interdependence and causal relationship of dharmas or phenomenal events arising at different times.\n#Serial – The causal relationship of the twelve links arising and ceasing in continuous series of moments.\n\nDiscussing the three lifetimes model, Alex Wayman states that it is different from the Vajrayana view, because Theravadins denied ''bardo'' or an intermediate state between death and rebirth. This denial necessitated placing the first two nidanas of the \"dependent origination\" chain into the past life.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman |title=Buddhist Insight: Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7 |pages=186–187 }}</ref> The Tibetan Buddhism tradition allocates the twelve nidanas differently between various lives.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman |title=Buddhist Insight: Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7 |pages=184–186 }}</ref>\n\n===Mahayana===\n{{Main|Madhyamaka}}\nIn the [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy, to say that an object is \"empty\" is synonymous with saying that it is dependently originated. [[Nāgārjuna]] equates [[Sunyata|emptiness]] with dependent origination in [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] 24.18-19;{{sfn|Mabja Tsondru|2011|p=67-71, 447-477}} \n{{quote|Whatever arises dependently<br/>\nIs explained as empty.<br/>\nThus dependent attribution<br/>\nIs the middle way.\n\nSince there is nothing whatever<br/>\nThat is not dependently existent,<br/>\nFor that reason there is nothing<br/>\nWhatsoever that is not empty.{{sfn|Geshe Sonam Rinchen|2006|p=21}}}}\n\nIn his analysis, [[svabhāva]] is somewhat redefined from the [[Sarvastivada]]-[[Vaibhāṣika]] interpretation to mean: ''inherent existence'' or ''self-characterization.'' Nagarjuna notably rejected the idea of ''dharmas'' containing [[svabhāva]], meaning 'a self-sustaining, permanent, or unchanging identity.' If a ''dharma'' was inherently what-it-was from its own side, what need would there be for causes and conditions to bring that object into being? If any object was characterized by 'being-itself,' then it has no need to dependently rely on anything else. Further, such an identity or self-characterization would prevent the process of dependent origination. Inherence would prevent any kind of origination at all, for things would simply always have been, and things would always continue to be. Madhyamaka suggests that uncharacterized mere experiences—with no specific qualities—are designated by conceptual labels, and this brings them into being (See [[Prasaṅgika#N.C4.81g.C4.81rjuna.27s Merely Designated Causality|Prasaṅgika Merely Designated Causality]]). According to Nagarjuna, even the principle of causality itself is dependently originated, and hence it is empty. \n\n[[Madhyamaka]] is interpreted in different ways by different traditions. In the Tibetan [[Gelug]] school, all dharmas are said to lack any {{'}}''inherent''{{'}} existence, according to the Tibetan scholar [[Tsongkhapa]] in his Ocean of Reasoning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aaari.info/notes/03-06-06Tam2.pdf|title=Mula by Jay Garfield|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n====Dzogchen====\nIn the [[Dzogchen]] tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the concept of dependent origination is considered to be complementary to the concept of emptiness. Specifically, this tradition emphasizes the indivisibility of appearance and emptiness—also known as the relative and absolute aspects of reality:{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}\n* Appearance (relative truth) refers to the concept that all appearances are dependently originated;\n* Emptiness (absolute or ultimate truth) refers to the concept that the \"nature\" of all phenomena is emptiness—lacking inherent existence.\n\nIn [[Mipham Rinpoche]]'s ''Beacon of Certainty'', this relationship is explained using the metaphor of the reflection of the moon in water.{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}  According to this metaphor:{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}\n* The ''nature'' of all phenomena is like the reflection of the moon in water—completely lacking inherent existence. However,\n* The ''appearance'' of the moon in the water is an expression of dependent origination—the appearance is completely dependent upon causes and conditions.\n\nOne of the founders of Tibetan Buddhism, [[Padmasambhava]], emphasized his respect for this relationship as follows:\n{{quote|Though my View is as spacious as the sky,<br> \nMy actions and respect for cause and effect are as fine as grains of flour.{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|p=169}}}}\n\n[[Sogyal Rinpoche]] states all things, when seen and understood in their true relation, are not independent but interdependent with all other things. A tree, for example, cannot be isolated from anything else. It has no independent existence, states Rinpoche.{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|loc=Kindle Locations 849-863}}\n\n====Hua Yen school====\nThe [[Huayan school]] taught the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena, as expressed in [[Indra's net]]. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one thing. This philosophy is based in the tradition of the great Madhyamaka scholar [[Nagarjuna]] and, more specifically, on the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]. Regarded by [[D.T. Suzuki]] as the crowning achievement of Buddhist philosophy, the ''Avatamsaka Sutra'' elaborates in great detail on the principal of dependent origination. This sutra describes a cosmos of infinite realms upon realms, mutually containing one another.\n\n====Zen====\n[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] states, \"''Pratitya samutpada'' is sometimes called the teaching of cause and effect, but that can be misleading, because we usually think of cause and effect as separate entities, with cause always preceding effect, and one cause leading to one effect. According to the teaching of Interdependent Co-Arising, cause and effect co-arise (''samutpada'') and everything is a result of multiple causes and conditions... In the sutras, this image is given: \"Three cut reeds can stand only by leaning on one another. If you take one away, the other two will fall.\" In Buddhist texts, one cause is never enough to bring about an effect. A cause must, at the same time, be an effect, and every effect must also be the cause of something else. This is the basis, states Hanh, for the idea that there is no first and only cause, something that does not itself need a cause.{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1999|pp=221-222}}\n\n==Scholarly interpretations==\n[[Jay L. Garfield]] states that [[Mulamadhyamikakarika]] uses the causal relation to understand the nature of reality, and of our relation to it. This attempt is similar to the use of causation by Hume, Kant, and Schopenhauer as they present their arguments.

If it is again asked, 'Will the person be able to see things on the outside without the window (if he is confined to a room without the window or with the window closed)?' the answer will be, 'It is not possible to see things through the wall without the window. One can only see through the window.' Similarly, in the case of seeing, there are two separate realities of the eye and seeing. (So the eye does not have the ability to see without the eye-consciousness. The eye-consciousness itself cannot see anything without the organ.) The eye is not seeing, nor is seeing the eye, yet there cannot be an act of seeing without the eye. In reality, seeing comes into being depending on the eye.

According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the importance of the ''Upanisa Sutta'' which brings together the 12 Nidanas (as analysis of arising of suffering) and Transcendental Dependent Arising (as analysis of supramundane transcendence of suffering) is that:\n\n<blockquote>In addition to giving a clear, explicit account of the conditional structure of the liberative progression, this sutta has the further advantage of bringing the supramundane form of dependent arising into immediate connection with its familiar samsaric counterpart. By making this connection it brings into prominence the comprehensive character of the principle of conditionality — its ability to support and explain both the process of compulsive involvement which is the origin of suffering and the process of disengagement which leads to deliverance from suffering. Thereby it reveals dependent arising to be the key to the unity and coherence of the Buddha's teaching.<ref>Bhikkhu Bodhi. Transcendental Dependent Arising. A Translation and Exposition of the Upanisa Sutta. 1995</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Pali treatise named the ''Nettipakarana,'' names this \"transcendental dependent arising\" ''(lokuttara-paticcasamuppada)'',<ref>Bhikkhu Bodhi.

The sutta states that \"suffering is the supporting condition for faith\", thereby linking it with the last nidana in the 12 nidana chain. As Bhikkhu Bodhi explains: \"it is the experience of suffering which first tears us out of our blind absorption in the immediacy of temporal being and sets us in search of a way to its transcendence.\" Faith also comes about through the hearing of the exposition of true Dhamma (teaching). Faith also leads to the practice of [[Buddhist ethics|morality]] (sila).\n|-\n|Joy (''pāmojja'')\n|From confidence in the sources of refuge and contemplation on them, a sense of joy arises\n|-\n|[[Pīti|Rapture]] (''pīti'')\n|Generally, the application of [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] is needed for the arising of rapture or bliss, though some rare individuals might experience rapture simply from the joy which arises from faith and a clear conscience arising from moral living. The meditative states called [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhanas]] are states of elevated rapture.\n|-\n|[[Passaddhi|Tranquillity]] (''passaddhi'')\n|In the higher states of meditation, rapture gives way to a calm sense of tranquility. \n|-\n|[[Sukha|Happiness]] (''sukha'')\n|A subtler state than rapture, a pleasant feeling. \n|-\n|[[Samadhi (Buddhism)|Concentration]] (''samādhi'')\n|\"The wholesome unification of the mind\", totally free from distractions and unsteadiness. \n|-\n|''yathābhūta-ñānadassana''\n|\"Knowledge and vision of things as they really are\". With a peaceful and concentrated mind, one is now able to practice the development of insight (''[[Vipassanā|vipassana]] bhavana),'' the first phase of which is insight into the nature of the [[Skandha|five aggregates]]''.'' Only ''pañña,'' the wisdom which penetrates the true nature of phenomena, can destroy the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements]] which keep beings bound to samsara. This wisdom is not mere conceptual understanding, but a kind of direct experience akin to visual perception which sees the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness of all phenomena. In Northern Buddhist traditions and Mahayana works, insight into [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] is further emphasized. \n|-\n|Disenchantment (''nibbidā'')\n|Noticing the passing away of phenomena, the fact that nothing is stable, reliable or permanent, gives rise to a sense of disenchantment towards them.

The first, called the \"knowledge of destruction\" ''(khaya ñana),'' ascertains that all defilements have been abandoned at the root; the second, the \"knowledge of non-arising\" ''(anuppade ñana),'' ascertains that no defilement can ever arise again.\"  \n|}\n*\n\n===Karma===\nThe Karma theory of Buddhism is integrated into its Twelve Nidanas doctrine, and has been extensively commented on by ancient Buddhist scholars such as [[Nagarjuna]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Ray Billington |title=Understanding Eastern Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dACFAgAAQBAJ |year=2002|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-79348-8 |pages=57–58, 73–74 note 1 }}</ref> Karma consists of any intentional action, whether of body or speech or in mind, which can be either advantageous (merit) or disadvantageous (demerit).

Because of his vast influence in the development of Theravada scholasticism, this model has been very influential in the Theravada school. According to Akira Hirakawa and Paul Groner, this \"embryological\" interpretation which links dependent origination with rebirth was also promoted by the [[Sarvastivadin]] school (a north Indian branch of the [[Sthavira nikāya]]) as evidenced by the [[Abhidharmakosa]] of [[Vasubandhu]].<ref name=\"Hirakawa page 178\">Hirakawa; Groner, A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna, page 178</ref>\n\nAnother Theravada interpretation of the twelve links sees them as explaining psychological or phenomenological processes in the present moment. In Buddhaghosa's Sammohavinodani, a commentary to the [[Vibhanga]] of the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]], the principle of Dependent Origination is explained as occurring entirely within the space of one mind moment.<ref>Ven. Prayudh Payutto, Dependent Origination: the Buddhist Law of Conditionality, http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books3/Payutto_Bhikkhu_Dependent_Origination.htm#C5</ref> According to [[Prayudh Payutto]] there is material in the [[Vibhanga]] which discusses both models, the three lifetimes model and the phenomenological mind moment model.\n\nThis thesis is also defended by Bhikkhu [[Buddhadasa]]'s ''Paticcasamuppada: Practical Dependent Origination.'' In this interpretation, Birth and Death refer not to physical birth and death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the \"emergence of the ego\". According to Buddhadhasa: \"dependent arising is a phenomenon that lasts an instant; it is impermanent. Therefore, Birth and Death must be explained as phenomena within the process of dependent arising in everyday life of ordinary people. Right Mindfulness is lost during contacts of the Roots and surroundings. Thereafter, when vexation due to greed, anger, and ignorance is experienced, the ego has already been born. It is considered as one 'birth'\".<ref>Buddhadhasa, Paticcasamuppada: \nPractical Dependent Origination, http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books6/Bhikkhu_Buddhadasa_Paticcasamuppada.htm</ref>\n\nThe [[Abhidharmakosa]] also outlines three other models of the 12 links that were used by the Sarvastivada schools apart from the three lifetimes model:<ref name=\"Hirakawa page 178\"/>\n\n#Instantaneous – All 12 links are present in the same instant.\n#Prolonged – The interdependence and causal relationship of dharmas or phenomenal events arising at different times.\n#Serial – The causal relationship of the twelve links arising and ceasing in continuous series of moments.\n\nDiscussing the three lifetimes model, Alex Wayman states that it is different from the Vajrayana view, because Theravadins denied ''bardo'' or an intermediate state between death and rebirth. This denial necessitated placing the first two nidanas of the \"dependent origination\" chain into the past life.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman |title=Buddhist Insight: Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7 |pages=186–187 }}</ref> The Tibetan Buddhism tradition allocates the twelve nidanas differently between various lives.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman |title=Buddhist Insight: Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7 |pages=184–186 }}</ref>\n\n===Mahayana===\n{{Main|Madhyamaka}}\nIn the [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy, to say that an object is \"empty\" is synonymous with saying that it is dependently originated. [[Nāgārjuna]] equates [[Sunyata|emptiness]] with dependent origination in [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] 24.18-19;{{sfn|Mabja Tsondru|2011|p=67-71, 447-477}} \n{{quote|Whatever arises dependently<br/>\nIs explained as empty.<br/>\nThus dependent attribution<br/>\nIs the middle way.\n\nSince there is nothing whatever<br/>\nThat is not dependently existent,<br/>\nFor that reason there is nothing<br/>\nWhatsoever that is not empty.{{sfn|Geshe Sonam Rinchen|2006|p=21}}}}\n\nIn his analysis, [[svabhāva]] is somewhat redefined from the [[Sarvastivada]]-[[Vaibhāṣika]] interpretation to mean: ''inherent existence'' or ''self-characterization.'' Nagarjuna notably rejected the idea of ''dharmas'' containing [[svabhāva]], meaning 'a self-sustaining, permanent, or unchanging identity.' If a ''dharma'' was inherently what-it-was from its own side, what need would there be for causes and conditions to bring that object into being? If any object was characterized by 'being-itself,' then it has no need to dependently rely on anything else. Further, such an identity or self-characterization would prevent the process of dependent origination. Inherence would prevent any kind of origination at all, for things would simply always have been, and things would always continue to be. Madhyamaka suggests that uncharacterized mere experiences—with no specific qualities—are designated by conceptual labels, and this brings them into being (See [[Prasaṅgika#N.C4.81g.C4.81rjuna.27s Merely Designated Causality|Prasaṅgika Merely Designated Causality]]). According to Nagarjuna, even the principle of causality itself is dependently originated, and hence it is empty. \n\n[[Madhyamaka]] is interpreted in different ways by different traditions. In the Tibetan [[Gelug]] school, all dharmas are said to lack any {{'}}''inherent''{{'}} existence, according to the Tibetan scholar [[Tsongkhapa]] in his Ocean of Reasoning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aaari.info/notes/03-06-06Tam2.pdf|title=Mula by Jay Garfield|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n====Dzogchen====\nIn the [[Dzogchen]] tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the concept of dependent origination is considered to be complementary to the concept of emptiness. Specifically, this tradition emphasizes the indivisibility of appearance and emptiness—also known as the relative and absolute aspects of reality:{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}\n* Appearance (relative truth) refers to the concept that all appearances are dependently originated;\n* Emptiness (absolute or ultimate truth) refers to the concept that the \"nature\" of all phenomena is emptiness—lacking inherent existence.\n\nIn [[Mipham Rinpoche]]'s ''Beacon of Certainty'', this relationship is explained using the metaphor of the reflection of the moon in water.{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}  According to this metaphor:{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}\n* The ''nature'' of all phenomena is like the reflection of the moon in water—completely lacking inherent existence. However,\n* The ''appearance'' of the moon in the water is an expression of dependent origination—the appearance is completely dependent upon causes and conditions.\n\nOne of the founders of Tibetan Buddhism, [[Padmasambhava]], emphasized his respect for this relationship as follows:\n{{quote|Though my View is as spacious as the sky,<br> \nMy actions and respect for cause and effect are as fine as grains of flour.{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|p=169}}}}\n\n[[Sogyal Rinpoche]] states all things, when seen and understood in their true relation, are not independent but interdependent with all other things. A tree, for example, cannot be isolated from anything else. It has no independent existence, states Rinpoche.{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|loc=Kindle Locations 849-863}}\n\n====Hua Yen school====\nThe [[Huayan school]] taught the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena, as expressed in [[Indra's net]]. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one thing. This philosophy is based in the tradition of the great Madhyamaka scholar [[Nagarjuna]] and, more specifically, on the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]. Regarded by [[D.T. Suzuki]] as the crowning achievement of Buddhist philosophy, the ''Avatamsaka Sutra'' elaborates in great detail on the principal of dependent origination. This sutra describes a cosmos of infinite realms upon realms, mutually containing one another.\n\n====Zen====\n[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] states, \"''Pratitya samutpada'' is sometimes called the teaching of cause and effect, but that can be misleading, because we usually think of cause and effect as separate entities, with cause always preceding effect, and one cause leading to one effect. According to the teaching of Interdependent Co-Arising, cause and effect co-arise (''samutpada'') and everything is a result of multiple causes and conditions... In the sutras, this image is given: \"Three cut reeds can stand only by leaning on one another. If you take one away, the other two will fall.\" In Buddhist texts, one cause is never enough to bring about an effect. A cause must, at the same time, be an effect, and every effect must also be the cause of something else. This is the basis, states Hanh, for the idea that there is no first and only cause, something that does not itself need a cause.{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1999|pp=221-222}}\n\n==Scholarly interpretations==\n[[Jay L. Garfield]] states that [[Mulamadhyamikakarika]] uses the causal relation to understand the nature of reality, and of our relation to it. This attempt is similar to the use of causation by Hume, Kant, and Schopenhauer as they present their arguments. Nagarjuna uses causation to present his arguments on how one individualizes objects, orders one's experience of the world, and understands agency in the world.{{sfn|Garfield|1994}}\n\nThe concept of ''pratītyasamutpāda'' has also been compared to Western [[metaphysics]], the study of reality. Schilbrack states that the doctrine of interdependent origination seems to fit the definition of a metaphysical teaching, by questioning whether there is anything at all.{{sfn|Schilbrack|2002}} Hoffman disagrees, and asserts that pratītyasamutpāda should not be considered a metaphysical doctrine in the strictest sense, since it does not confirm nor deny specific entities or realities.{{refn|group=quote|Hoffman states: \"Suffice it to emphasize that the doctrine of dependent origination is not a metaphysical doctrine, in the sense that it does not affirm or deny some super-sensible entities or realities; rather, it is a proposition arrived at through an examination and analysis of the world of phenomena ...\"{{sfn|Hoffman|1996|p=177}} }}\n\nNoa Ronkin states that while Buddha suspends all views regarding certain metaphysical questions, he is not an anti-metaphysician: nothing in the texts suggests that metaphysical questions are completely meaningless, instead Buddha taught that sentient experience is dependently originated and that whatever is dependently originated is conditioned, impermanent, subject to change, and lacking independent selfhood.{{sfn|Ronkin|2009}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Twelve Nidānas]]\n* [[Bhavacakra]]\n* [[Five Skandhas]]\n* [[Reality in Buddhism]]\n* [[Three marks of existence]]\n* [[Alan Watts]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|2}}\n\n==Quotes==\n{{reflist|group=quote|2}}\n\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Printed sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation| last = Anyen Rinpoche| year =2012 | title =Journey to Certainty | publisher =Wisdom Publications }}\n* {{Citation|last =Bhikkhu Thanissaro|title=The Shape of Suffering: A study of Dependent Co-arising|year=2008|publisher=Metta Forest Monastery|url=http://www.dhammatalks.org/Archive/Writings/DependentCo-arising.pdf}}\n* {{Citation| editor-last =Bowker | editor-first =John | year =1997 |title =The [[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]] | publisher =Oxford}}\n* {{Citation| last =Dalai Lama| year =1992| title =The Meaning of Life, translated and edited by Jeffrey Hopkins| publisher =Wisdom}}\n* {{Citation| last =Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse| year =2011| title =What Makes You Not a Buddhist| publisher =Shambhala, Kindle Edition}}\n* {{Citation|last=Edelglass|first=William|title=Buddhist Philosophy: Essential Readings|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-532817-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjVQB03cVMMC|publisher=Oxford University Press|display-authors=etal}}\n* {{Citation| last =Garfield| first =  Jay L.| year=1994 | title= Dependent Arising and the Emptiness of Emptiness: Why did Nagarjuna start with Causation?| url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Nagarjuna/Dependent_Arising.htm| publisher=''Philosophy East and West'', Volume 44, Number 2 April 1994}}\n* {{Citation| last =Gethin | first = Rupert | year =1998 | title =Foundations of Buddhism | publisher =Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-289223-2}}\n* {{Citation| last =Goldstein | first = Joseph | year =2002 | title =One Dharma: The Emerging Western Buddhism | publisher =HarperCollins}}\n* {{Citation| last =Harvey | first =Peter | year =1990 |title =An Introduction to Buddhism | publisher =Cambridge University Press}}\n* {{Citation| last =Hoffman | first =Frank J.| year =1996 |title =Pāli Buddhism| publisher =Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkgdeAx_oMoC&pg=PA177&dq=dependent+origination+metaphysical#PPA177,M1|display-authors=etal}}\n* {{Citation | last =Hopkins | first =Jeffrey | year =1983 | title =Meditation on Emptiness | publisher =Wisdom Publications | isbn=978-0861710140}}\n* {{Citation| last= Lama Zopa Rinpoche | year=2009| title= How Things Exist: Teachings on Emptiness | publisher=Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive, Kindle Edition}}\n* {{Citation| last =Lopez | first =Donald S.| year =2001 | title =The Story of Buddhism | publisher =HarperCollins }}\n* {{Citation| last =Mabja Tsondru | year =2011 | title =Ornament of Reason | publisher =Snow Lion }}\n* {{Citation|last=Ronkin|first=Noa| year=2009|title=Theravada Metaphysics and Ontology|work=Buddhist Philosophy: Essential Readings |editor=Edelglass|display-editors= etal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjVQB03cVMMC&source=gbs_navlinks_s |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-532817-2}}\n* {{Citation| last =Schilbrack| first =Kevin| year =2002 |title =Thinking through Myths: Philosophical Perspectives | publisher =Routledge | isbn=0-415-25461-2}}\n* {{Citation| last1 =Smith| first1=Huston|last2=Novak|first2=Philip| year=2009| title= Buddhism: A Concise Introduction | publisher=HarperOne, Kindle Edition}}\n* {{Citation| last =Sogyal Rinpoche| year =2009| title =The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying| publisher =Harper Collins, Kindle Edition}}\n* {{Citation| last= Thich Nhat Hanh | year =1999 | title =The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching | publisher = Three River Press}}\n* {{Citation| last= Williams |first=Paul | year =2002 | title =Buddhist Thought | publisher = Taylor & Francis, Kindle Edition}}\n* {{Citation| last= Walpola Rahula | year =2007| title =What the Buddha Taught| publisher = Grove Press, Kindle Edition}}\n{{refend}}\n\n===Web-sources===\n{{Reflist|group=web}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Bucknell, Roderick S.
