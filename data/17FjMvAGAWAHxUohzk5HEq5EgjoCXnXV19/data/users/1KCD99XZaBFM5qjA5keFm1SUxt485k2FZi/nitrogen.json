It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician [[Daniel Rutherford]] in 1772. Although [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] and [[Henry Cavendish]] had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name ''nitrogène'' was suggested by French chemist [[Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal]] in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in [[nitric acid]] and [[nitrate]]s. [[Antoine Lavoisier]] suggested instead the name '''''azote''''', from the Greek άζωτικός \"no life\", as it is an [[asphyxiant gas]]; this name is instead used in many languages, such as [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as [[hydrazine]], [[azide]]s and [[azo compound]]s.\n\nNitrogen is the lightest member of [[pnictogen|group 15]] of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. The name comes from the Greek πνίγειν \"to choke\", directly referencing nitrogen's asphyxiating properties. It is a common element in the [[universe]], estimated at about [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|seventh in total abundance]] in the [[Milky Way]] and the [[Solar System]]. At [[standard temperature and pressure]], two atoms of the element [[chemical bond|bind]] to form '''dinitrogen''', a colourless and odorless [[diatomic molecule|diatomic]] [[gas]] with the formula N<sub>2</sub>. Dinitrogen forms about 78% of [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], making it the most abundant uncombined element. Nitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in [[amino acid]]s (and thus [[protein]]s), in the [[nucleic acid]]s ([[DNA]] and [[RNA]]) and in the energy transfer molecule [[adenosine triphosphate]]. The [[Composition of the human body|human body contains]] about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The [[nitrogen cycle]] describes movement of the element from the air, into the [[biosphere]] and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere.\n\nMany industrially important compounds, such as [[ammonia]], nitric acid, organic nitrates ([[propellant]]s and [[explosive]]s), and [[cyanide]]s, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong [[triple bond]] in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any [[diatomic molecule]] after [[carbon monoxide]] (CO),<ref>[http://www.wiredchemist.com/chemistry/data/bond_energies_lengths.html Common Bond Energies (D) and Bond Lengths (r)]. wiredchemist.com</ref> dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N<sub>2</sub> into useful [[Chemical compound|compounds]], but at the same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form '''nitrogen gas''' releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial [[fertiliser]]s, and fertiliser nitrates are key [[pollutant]]s in the [[eutrophication]] of water systems.\n\nApart from its use in fertilisers and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as [[Kevlar]] used in high-strength fabric and [[cyanoacrylate]] used in [[superglue]]. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including [[antibiotic]]s. Many drugs are mimics or [[prodrug]]s of natural nitrogen-containing [[Cell signaling|signal molecules]]: for example, the organic nitrates [[nitroglycerin]] and [[nitroprusside]] control [[blood pressure]] by metabolizing into [[nitric oxide]]. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural [[caffeine]] and [[morphine]] or the synthetic [[amphetamine]]s, act on receptors of animal [[neurotransmitter]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rutherford Daniel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Daniel Rutherford]], discoverer of nitrogen]]\nNitrogen compounds have a very long history, [[ammonium chloride]] having been known to [[Herodotus]].

''sticken'' \"to choke or suffocate\") and still remains in English in the common names of many nitrogen compounds, such as [[hydrazine]] and compounds of the [[azide]] ion.

Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. [[Nitrogen fixation]] by industrial processes like the [[Frank–Caro process]] (1895–1899) and [[Haber–Bosch process]] (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, to the extent that half of global [[food production]] (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers.<ref name=\"Haber100\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ngeo325 | title = How a century of ammonia synthesis changed the world |year = 2008 | last1 = Erisman | first1 = Jan Willem | last2 = Sutton | first2 = Mark A. | last3 = Galloway | first3 = James | last4 = Klimont | first4 = Zbigniew | last5 = Winiwarter | first5 = Wilfried | journal = Nature Geoscience | volume = 1 | issue = 10 | page = 636|bibcode = 2008NatGe...1..636E }}</ref> At the same time, use of the [[Ostwald process]] (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as [[feedstock]] in the manufacture of [[explosives]] in the [[World war|World Wars]] of the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation |editor-last=Ostwald |editor-first=Wilhelm |editorlink=Wilhelm Ostwald |title=Improvements in the Manufacture of Nitric Acid and Nitrogen Oxides |country-code=GB |series-number=190200698 |subscription=|issue-date=March 20, 1902 |publication-date=January 9, 1902}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |editor-last=Ostwald |editor-first=Wilhelm |editorlink=Wilhelm Ostwald |title=Improvements in and relating to the Manufacture of Nitric Acid and Oxides of Nitrogen |country-code=GB |series-number=190208300 |subscription= |issue-date=February 26, 1903 |publication-date=December 18, 1902}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Atomic===\n[[File:Neon orbitals.JPG|thumb|upright=1.6|right|The shapes of the five orbitals occupied in nitrogen.

The 2p subshell is very small and has a very similar radius to the 2s shell, facilitating [[orbital hybridization|orbital hybridisation]]. It also results in very large electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in the 2s and 2p shells, resulting in very high electronegativities. [[Hypervalent molecule|Hypervalency]] is almost unknown in the 2p elements for the same reason, because the high electronegativity makes it difficult for a small nitrogen atom to be a central atom in an electron-rich [[three-center four-electron bond]] since it would tend to attract the electrons strongly to itself. Thus, despite nitrogen's position at the head of group 15 in the periodic table, its chemistry shows huge differences from that of its heavier congeners [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], and [[bismuth]].<ref name=Kaupp>{{cite journal |last=Kaupp |first=Martin |date=1 December 2006 |title=The role of radial nodes of atomic orbitals for chemical bonding and the periodic table |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b624/3805138ab8701ce5b4aa580f626992ff2fde.pdf |journal=Journal of Computational Chemistry |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=320–25 |doi=10.1002/jcc.20522 |access-date=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nNitrogen may be usefully compared to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen as well as its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth). Although each period 2 element from lithium to nitrogen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group from magnesium to sulfur (known as the [[diagonal relationship]]s), their degree drops off quite abruptly past the boron–silicon pair, so that the similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present. Nitrogen resembles oxygen far more than it does carbon with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for [[hydrogen bond]]ing and the ability to form [[coordination complex]]es by donating its [[lone pair]]s of electrons. It does not share carbon's proclivity for [[catenation]], with the longest chain of nitrogen yet discovered being composed of only eight nitrogen atoms (PhN=N–N(Ph)–N=N–N(Ph)–N=NPh). One property nitrogen does share with both its horizontal neighbours is its preferentially forming multiple bonds, typically with carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms, through p<sub>''π''</sub>–p<sub>''π''</sub> interactions; thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and thus has very much lower [[melting point|melting]] (−210&nbsp;°C) and [[boiling point]]s (−196&nbsp;°C) than the rest of its group, as the N<sub>2</sub> molecules are only held together by weak [[van der Waals interaction]]s and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles. This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the [[nitrogen oxide]]s, [[nitrite]]s, [[nitrate]]s, [[nitro compound|nitro-]], [[nitroso]]-, [[azo compound|azo]]-, and [[diazo]]-compounds, [[azide]]s, [[cyanate]]s, [[thiocyanate]]s, and [[imino]]-derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth.

The more well-characterised ways are the end-on M←N≡N (''[[hapticity|η]]''<sup>1</sup>) and M←N≡N→M (''[[bridging ligand|μ]]'', bis-''η''<sup>1</sup>), in which the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms are donated to the metal cation. The less well-characterised ways involve dinitrogen donating electron pairs from the triple bond, either as a [[bridging ligand]] to two metal cations (''μ'', bis-''η''<sup>2</sup>) or to just one (''η''<sup>2</sup>). The fifth and unique method involves triple-coordination as a bridging ligand, donating all three electron pairs from the triple bond (''μ''<sub>3</sub>-N<sub>2</sub>). A few complexes feature multiple N<sub>2</sub> ligands and some feature N<sub>2</sub> bonded in multiple ways. Since N<sub>2</sub> is isoelectronic with [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[acetylene]] (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), the bonding in dinitrogen complexes is closely allied to that in [[carbonyl]] compounds, although N<sub>2</sub> is a weaker ''σ''-donor and ''π''-acceptor than CO. Theoretical studies show that ''σ'' donation is a more important factor allowing the formation of the M–N bond than ''π'' back-donation, which mostly only weakens the N–N bond, and end-on (''η''<sup>1</sup>) donation is more readily accomplished than side-on (''η''<sup>2</sup>) donation.<ref name=Greenwood412/>\n\nToday, dinitrogen complexes are known for almost all the transition metals, accounting for several hundred compounds. They are normally prepared by three methods:<ref name=Greenwood412/>\n# Replacing labile ligands such as [[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]], [[hydride|H<sup>−</sup>]], or [[carbon monoxide|CO]] directly by nitrogen: these are often reversible reactions that proceed at mild conditions.\n# Reducing metal complexes in the presence of a suitable coligand in excess under nitrogen gas. A common choice include replacing chloride ligands by [[dimethylphenylphosphine]] (PMe<sub>2</sub>Ph) to make up for the smaller number of nitrogen ligands attached than the original chlorine ligands.\n# Converting a ligand with N–N bonds, such as hydrazine or azide, directly into a dinitrogen ligand.\nOccasionally the N≡N bond may be formed directly within a metal complex, for example by directly reacting coordinated [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>) with [[nitrous acid]] (HNO<sub>2</sub>), but this is not generally applicable. Most dinitrogen complexes have colours within the range white-yellow-orange-red-brown; a few exceptions are known, such as the blue [{Ti(''η''<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>}<sub>2</sub>-(N<sub>2</sub>)].<ref name=Greenwood412/>\n\n===Nitrides, azides, and nitrido complexes===\nNitrogen bonds to almost all the elements in the periodic table except the first three [[noble gas]]es, [[helium]], [[neon]], and [[argon]], and some of the very short-lived elements after [[bismuth]], creating an immense variety of binary compounds with varying properties and applications.<ref name=Greenwood412/> Many binary compounds are known: with the exception of the nitrogen hydrides, oxides, and fluorides, these are typically called [[nitride]]s. Many stoichiometric phases are usually present for most elements (e.g. MnN, Mn<sub>6</sub>N<sub>5</sub>, Mn<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, Mn<sub>2</sub>N, Mn<sub>4</sub>N, and Mn<sub>''x''</sub>N for 9.2 < ''x'' < 25.3). They may be classified as \"salt-like\" (mostly ionic), covalent, \"diamond-like\", and metallic (or [[interstitial compound|interstitial]]), although this classification has limitations generally stemming from the continuity of bonding types instead of the discrete and separate types that it implies. They are normally prepared by directly reacting a metal with nitrogen or ammonia (sometimes after heating), or by thermal decomposition of metal amides:<ref name=Greenwood417>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 417–20</ref>\n:3 Ca + N<sub>2</sub> → Ca<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>\n:3 Mg + 2 NH<sub>3</sub> → Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub> (at 900&nbsp;°C)\n:3 Zn(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> → Zn<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub> + 4 NH<sub>3</sub>\nMany variants on these processes are possible.The most ionic of these nitrides are those of the [[alkali metal]]s and [[alkaline earth metal]]s, Li<sub>3</sub>N (Na, K, Rb, and Cs do not form stable nitrides for steric reasons) and M<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub> (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba). These can formally be thought of as salts of the N<sup>3−</sup> anion, although charge separation is not actually complete even for these highly electropositive elements. However, the alkali metal [[azide]]s NaN<sub>3</sub> and KN<sub>3</sub>, featuring the linear {{chem|N|3|-}} anion, are well-known, as are Sr(N<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Ba(N<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Azides of the B-subgroup metals (those in [[group 11 element|groups 11]] through [[chalcogen|16]]) are much less ionic, have more complicated structures, and detonate readily when shocked.<ref name=Greenwood417/>\n\n[[File:Borazin Mesomers.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Mesomeric structures of borazine, (–BH–NH–)<sub>3</sub>]]\nMany covalent binary nitrides are known. Examples include [[cyanogen]] ((CN)<sub>2</sub>), [[triphosphorus pentanitride]] (P<sub>3</sub>N<sub>5</sub>), [[disulfur dinitride]] (S<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>), and [[tetrasulfur tetranitride]] (S<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>). The essentially covalent [[silicon nitride]] (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) and [[germanium nitride]] (Ge<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) are also known: silicon nitride in particular would make a promising [[ceramic]] if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it. In particular, the [[boron group|group 13]] nitrides, most of which are promising [[semiconductor]]s, are isoelectronic with graphite, diamond, and [[silicon carbide]] and have similar structures: their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended. In particular, since the B–N unit is isoelectronic to C–C, and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen, much of [[organic chemistry]] finds an echo in boron–nitrogen chemistry, such as in [[borazine]] (\"inorganic [[benzene]]\"). Nevertheless, the analogy is not exact due to the ease of [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons, which is not possible in a wholly carbon-containing ring.<ref name=Greenwood417/>\n\nThe largest category of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN, M<sub>2</sub>N, and M<sub>4</sub>N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned in the gaps in a metallic cubic or [[hexagonal close-packed]] lattice. They are opaque, very hard, and chemically inert, melting only at very high temperatures (generally over 2500&nbsp;°C). They have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals. They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.<ref name=Greenwood417/>\n\nThe nitride anion (N<sup>3−</sup>) is the strongest ''π'' donor known amongst ligands (the second-strongest is O<sup>2−</sup>). Nitrido complexes are generally made by thermal decomposition of azides or by deprotonating ammonia, and they usually involve a terminal {≡N}<sup>3−</sup> group. The linear azide anion ({{chem|N|3|-}}), being isoelectronic with [[nitrous oxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[cyanate]], forms many coordination complexes. Further catenation is rare, although {{chem|N|4|4-}} (isoelectronic with [[carbonate]] and [[nitrate]]) is known.<ref name=Greenwood417/>\n\n===Hydrides===\n[[File:Nitrogen electrode potentials.svg|thumb|right|upright=2.3|Standard reduction potentials for nitrogen-containing species.

It is a colourless alkaline gas with a characteristic pungent smell. The presence of [[hydrogen bonding]] has very significant effects on ammonia, conferring on it its high melting (−78&nbsp;°C) and boiling (−33&nbsp;°C) points. As a liquid, it is a very good solvent with a high heat of vaporisation (enabling it to be used in vacuum flasks), that also has a low viscosity and electrical conductivity and high [[dielectric constant]], and is less dense than water. However, the hydrogen bonding in NH<sub>3</sub> is weaker than that in H<sub>2</sub>O due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen and the presence of only one lone pair in NH<sub>3</sub> rather than two in H<sub>2</sub>O. It is a weak base in aqueous solution ([[acid dissociation constant|p''K''<sub>''b''</sub>]] 4.74); its conjugate acid is [[ammonium]], {{chem|NH|4|+}}. It can also act as an extremely weak acid, losing a proton to produce the amide anion, {{chem|NH|2|-}}. It thus undergoes self-dissociation, similar to water, to produce ammonium and amide. Ammonia burns in air or oxygen, though not readily, to produce nitrogen gas; it burns in fluorine with a greenish-yellow flame to give [[nitrogen trifluoride]]. Reactions with the other nonmetals are very complex and tend to lead to a mixture of products. Ammonia reacts on heating with metals to give nitrides.<ref name=Greenwood420>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 420–26</ref>\n\nMany other binary nitrogen hydrides are known, but the most important are [[hydrazine]] (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) and [[hydrogen azide]] (HN<sub>3</sub>). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, [[hydroxylamine]] (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similarly to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0&nbsp;°C, boiling point 113.5&nbsp;°C, density 1.00&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia.<ref name=Greenwood426/> It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.<ref name=\"Vieira\">{{cite journal | last = Vieira | first = R. |author2=C.

[[Nitrogen trifluoride]] (NF<sub>3</sub>, first prepared in 1928) is a colourless and odourless gas that is thermodynamically stable, and most readily produced by the electrolysis of molten [[ammonium fluoride]] dissolved in anhydrous [[hydrogen fluoride]]. Like [[carbon tetrafluoride]], it is not at all reactive and is stable in water or dilute aqueous acids or alkalis. Only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent, and it reacts with [[copper]], arsenic, antimony, and bismuth on contact at high temperatures to give [[tetrafluorohydrazine]] (N<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>). The cations {{chem|NF|4|+}} and {{chem|N|2|F|3|+}} are also known (the latter from reacting tetrafluorohydrazine with strong fluoride-acceptors such as [[arsenic pentafluoride]]), as is ONF<sub>3</sub>, which has aroused interest due to the short N–O distance implying partial double bonding and the highly polar and long N–F bond. Tetrafluorohydrazine, unlike hydrazine itself, can dissociate at room temperature and above to give the radical NF<sub>2</sub>•. [[Fluorine azide]] (FN<sub>3</sub>) is very explosive and thermally unstable. [[Dinitrogen difluoride]] (N<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) exists as thermally interconvertible ''cis'' and ''trans'' isomers, and was first found as a product of the thermal decomposition of FN<sub>3</sub>.<ref name=Greenwood438/>\n\n[[Nitrogen trichloride]] (NCl<sub>3</sub>) is a dense, volatile, and explosive liquid whose physical properties are similar to those of [[carbon tetrachloride]], although one difference is that NCl<sub>3</sub> is easily hydrolysed by water while CCl<sub>4</sub> is not. It was first synthesised in 1811 by [[Pierre Louis Dulong]], who lost three fingers and an eye to its explosive tendencies. As a dilute gas it is less dangerous and is thus used industrially to bleach and sterilise flour. [[Nitrogen tribromide]] (NBr<sub>3</sub>), first prepared in 1975, is a deep red, temperature-sensitive, volatile solid that is explosive even at −100&nbsp;°C. [[Nitrogen triiodide]] (NI<sub>3</sub>) is still more unstable and was only prepared in 1990.

The reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar: [[nitryl fluoride]] (FNO<sub>2</sub>) and [[nitryl chloride]] (ClNO<sub>2</sub>) are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents.<ref name=Greenwood438/>\n\n===Oxides===\n{{main article|Nitrogen oxide}}\n[[File:Nitrogen dioxide at different temperatures.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|right|Nitrogen dioxide at −196&nbsp;°C, 0&nbsp;°C, 23&nbsp;°C, 35&nbsp;°C, and 50&nbsp;°C. {{chem|NO|2}} converts to colourless dinitrogen tetroxide ({{chem|N|2|O|4}}) at low temperatures, and reverts to {{chem|NO|2}} at higher temperatures.]]\nNitrogen forms nine molecular oxides, some of which were the first gases to be identified: N<sub>2</sub>O ([[nitrous oxide]]), NO ([[nitric oxide]]), N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ([[dinitrogen trioxide]]), NO<sub>2</sub> ([[nitrogen dioxide]]), N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> ([[dinitrogen tetroxide]]), N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> ([[dinitrogen pentoxide]]), N<sub>4</sub>O ([[nitrosylazide]]),<ref name=Greenwood443>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 443–58</ref> and N(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub> ([[trinitramide]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rahm |first=Martin |last2=Dvinskikh |first2=Sergey V. |last3=Furó |first3=István |last4=Brinck |first4=Tore |date=23 December 2010 |title=Experimental Detection of Trinitramide, N(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub> |journal=[[Angewandte Chemie]] International Edition |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1145–48 |doi=10.1002/anie.201007047}}</ref> All are thermally unstable towards decomposition to their elements. One other possible oxide that has not yet been synthesised is [[oxatetrazole]] (N<sub>4</sub>O), an aromatic ring.<ref name=Greenwood443/>\n\nNitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), better known as laughing gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten [[ammonium nitrate]] at 250&nbsp;°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for [[cream|sprayed canned whipped cream]], and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot be considered to be the [[inorganic anhydride|anhydride]] of [[hyponitrous acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or [[ozone]] at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N<sup>+</sup>O<sup>−</sup>↔<sup>−</sup>N=N<sup>+</sup>=O): above 600&nbsp;°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.<ref name=Greenwood443/>\n\nNitric oxide (NO) is the simplest stable molecule with an odd number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, it is an important cellular [[signaling molecule]] involved in many physiological and pathological processes.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=10390607|year=1999|last1=Hou|first1=Y.

G.|title=Current trends in the development of nitric oxide donors|volume=5|issue=6|pages=417–41|journal=Current pharmaceutical design}}</ref> It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200&nbsp;°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a ''π''* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the ''cis'' isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.<ref name=Greenwood443/>\n\nBlue dinitrogen trioxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is only available as a solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to [[nitrosonium]] and [[nitrate]] in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form [[nitric acid]]. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and [[USSR]] by the late 1950s. This is because it is a [[hypergolic propellant]] in combination with a [[hydrazine]]-based [[Rocket propellant|rocket fuel]] and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.<ref name=Greenwood443/>\n\nThe thermally unstable and very reactive dinitrogen pentoxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) is the anhydride of [[nitric acid]], and can be made from it by dehydration with [[phosphorus pentoxide]]. It is of interest for the preparation of explosives.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Talawar, M.

In the solid state it is ionic with structure [NO<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>[NO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>−</sup>; as a gas and in solution it is molecular O<sub>2</sub>N–O–NO<sub>2</sub>. Hydration to nitric acid comes readily, as does analogous reaction with [[hydrogen peroxide]] giving [[peroxonitric acid]] (HOONO<sub>2</sub>). It is a violent oxidising agent. Gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide decomposes as follows:<ref name=Greenwood443/>\n:N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> {{eqm}} NO<sub>2</sub> + NO<sub>3</sub> → NO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + NO\n:N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + NO {{eqm}} 3 NO<sub>2</sub>\n\n===Oxoacids, oxoanions, and oxoacid salts===\nMany nitrogen [[oxoacid]]s are known, though most of them are unstable as pure compounds and are known only as aqueous solution or as salts. [[Hyponitrous acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a weak diprotic acid with the structure HON=NOH (p''K''<sub>a1</sub> 6.9, p''K''<sub>a2</sub> 11.6). Acidic solutions are quite stable but above pH 4 base-catalysed decomposition occurs via [HONNO]<sup>−</sup> to nitrous oxide and the hydroxide anion. [[Hyponitrite]]s (involving the {{chem|N|2|O|2|2-}} anion) are stable to reducing agents and more commonly act as reducing agents themselves. They are an intermediate step in the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, which occurs in the [[nitrogen cycle]]. Hyponitrite can act as a bridging or chelating bidentate ligand.<ref name=Greenwood459>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 459–72</ref>\n\n[[Nitrous acid]] (HNO<sub>2</sub>) is not known as a pure compound, but is a common component in gaseous equilibria and is an important aqueous reagent: its aqueous solutions may be made from acidifying cool aqueous [[nitrite]] ({{chem|NO|2|-}}, bent) solutions, although already at room temperature disproportionation to [[nitrate]] and nitric oxide is significant. It is a weak acid with p''K''<sub>''a''</sub> 3.35 at 18&nbsp;°C. They may be [[titration|titrimetrically]] analysed by their oxidation to nitrate by [[permanganate]]. They are readily reduced to nitrous oxide and nitric oxide by [[sulfur dioxide]], to hyponitrous acid with [[tin]](II), and to ammonia with [[hydrogen sulfide]]. Salts of [[hydrazinium]] {{chem|N|2|H|5|+}} react with nitrous acid to produce azides which further react to give nitrous oxide and nitrogen. [[Sodium nitrite]] is mildly toxic in concentrations above 100&nbsp;mg/kg, but small amounts are often used to cure meat and as a preservative to avoid bacterial spoilage. It is also used to synthesise hydroxylamine and to diazotise primary aromatic amines as follows:<ref name=Greenwood459/>\n:ArNH<sub>2</sub> + HNO<sub>2</sub> → [ArNN]Cl + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nNitrite is also a common ligand that can coordinate in five ways. The most common are nitro (bonded from the nitrogen) and nitrito (bonded from an oxygen). Nitro-nitrito isomerism is common, where the nitrito form is usually less stable.<ref name=Greenwood459/>\n\n[[File:Fuming nitric acid 40ml.jpg|thumb|right|Fuming nitric acid contaminated with yellow nitrogen dioxide]]\n[[Nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>) is by far the most important and the most stable of the nitrogen oxoacids. It is one of the three most used acids (the other two being [[sulfuric acid]] and [[hydrochloric acid]]) and was first discovered by the alchemists in the [[13th century]]. It is made by catalytic oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide, which is oxidised to nitrogen dioxide, and then dissolved in water to give concentrated nitric acid. In the [[United States|United States of America]], over seven million tonnes of nitric acid are produced every year, most of which is used for nitrate production for fertilisers and explosives, among other uses. Anhydrous nitric acid may be made by distilling concentrated nitric acid with phosphorus pentoxide at low pressure in glass apparatus in the dark. It can only be made in the solid state, because upon melting it spontaneously decomposes to nitrogen dioxide, and liquid nitric acid undergoes [[Molecular autoionization|self-ionisation]] to a larger extent than any other covalent liquid as follows:<ref name=Greenwood459/>\n:2 HNO<sub>3</sub> {{eqm}} {{chem|H|2|NO|3|+}} + {{chem|NO|3|-}} {{eqm}} H<sub>2</sub>O + [NO<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> + [NO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>−</sup>\nTwo hydrates, HNO<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O and HNO<sub>3</sub>·3H<sub>2</sub>O, are known that can be crystallised. It is a strong acid and concentrated solutions are strong oxidising agents, though [[gold]], [[platinum]], [[rhodium]], and [[iridium]] are immune to attack. A 3:1 mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, called ''[[aqua regia]]'', is still stronger and successfully dissolves gold and platinum, because free chlorine and nitrosyl chloride are formed and chloride anions can form strong complexes. In concentrated sulfuric acid, nitric acid is protonated to form [[nitronium]], which can act as an electrophile for aromatic nitration:<ref name=Greenwood459/>\n:HNO<sub>3</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> {{eqm}} {{chem|NO|2|+}} + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + 2 {{chem|HSO|4|-}}\nThe thermal stabilities of [[nitrate]]s (involving the trigonal planar {{chem|NO|3|-}} anion) depends on the basicity of the metal, and so do the products of decomposition (thermolysis), which can vary between the nitrite (for example, sodium), the oxide (potassium and [[lead]]), or even the metal itself ([[silver]]) depending on their relative stabilities. Nitrate is also a common ligand with many modes of coordination.<ref name=Greenwood459/>\n\nFinally, although orthonitric acid (H<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>), which would be analogous to [[orthophosphoric acid]], does not exist, the tetrahedral [[orthonitrate]] anion {{chem|NO|4|3-}} is known in its sodium and potassium salts:<ref name=Greenwood459/>\n:<chem>{NaNO3} + Na2O ->[\\ce{Ag~crucible}] [\\ce{300^\\circ C~for~7 days}] Na3NO4</chem>\nThese white crystalline salts are very sensitive to water vapour and carbon dioxide in the air:<ref name=Greenwood459/>\n:Na<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> → NaNO<sub>3</sub> + NaOH + NaHCO<sub>3</sub>\nDespite its limited chemistry, the orthonitrate anion is interesting from a structural point of view due to its regular tetrahedral shape and the short N–O bond lengths, implying significant polar character to the bonding.<ref name=Greenwood459/>\n\n===Organic nitrogen compounds===\nNitrogen is one of the most important elements in [[organic chemistry]]. Many organic [[functional group]]s involve a [[carbon–nitrogen bond]], such as [[amide]]s (RCONR<sub>2</sub>), [[amine]]s (R<sub>3</sub>N), [[imine]]s (RC(=NR)R), [[imide]]s (RCO)<sub>2</sub>NR, [[azide]]s (RN<sub>3</sub>), [[azo compound]]s (RN<sub>2</sub>R), [[cyanate]]s and [[isocyanate]]s (ROCN or RCNO), [[nitrate]]s (RONO<sub>2</sub>), [[nitrile]]s and [[isonitrile]]s (RCN or RNC), [[nitrite]]s (RONO), [[nitro compound]]s (RNO<sub>2</sub>), [[nitroso compound]]s (RNO), [[oxime]]s (RCR=NOH), and [[pyridine]] derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in [[quaternary ammonium salt]]s, R<sub>4</sub>N<sup>+</sup>), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and [[pyrrole]] is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an [[aromaticity|aromatic]] ring.<ref name=Jerry>{{JerryMarch}}</ref> The amount of nitrogen in a [[chemical substance]] can be determined by the [[Kjeldahl method]].<ref>{{cite book|year=2008|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6754-9_9066|isbn=978-1-4020-6753-2|title=Encyclopedia of Genetics, Genomics, Proteomics and Informatics|page=1063|chapter=Kjeldahl Method}}</ref> In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of [[nucleic acids]], [[amino acid]]s and thus [[protein]]s, and the energy-carrying molecule [[adenosine triphosphate]] and is thus vital to all life on Earth.<ref name=Jerry/>\n\n==Occurrence==\n[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Schematic representation of the [[Nitrogen cycle|flow of nitrogen compounds]] through a land environment]]\n{{see also|Nitrogen cycle}}\n\nNitrogen is the most common pure element in the earth, making up 78.1% of the entire volume of the atmosphere.<ref name=Greenwood406/> Despite this, it is [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|not very abundant]] in Earth's crust, making up only 19&nbsp;[[parts per million]] of this, on par with [[niobium]], [[gallium]], and [[lithium]]. The only important nitrogen minerals are [[nitre]] ([[potassium nitrate]], saltpetre) and [[sodanitre]] ([[sodium nitrate]], Chilean saltpetre). However, these have not been an important source of nitrates since the 1920s, when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common.<ref name=Greenwood407>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 407–09</ref>\n\nNitrogen compounds constantly interchange between the atmosphere and living organisms. Nitrogen must first be processed, or \"[[nitrogen fixation|fixed]]\", into a plant-usable form, usually ammonia. Some nitrogen fixation is done by lightning strikes producing the nitrogen oxides, but most is done by [[diazotroph]]ic bacteria through enzymes known as [[nitrogenase]]s (although today industrial nitrogen fixation to ammonia is also significant). When the ammonia is taken up by plants, it is used to synthesise proteins. These plants are then digested by animals who use the nitrogen compounds to synthesise their own proteins and excrete nitrogen–bearing waste. Finally, these organisms die and decompose, undergoing bacterial and environmental oxidation and [[denitrification]], returning free dinitrogen to the atmosphere. Industrial nitrogen fixation by the [[Haber process]] is mostly used as fertiliser, although excess nitrogen–bearing waste, when leached, leads to [[eutrophication]] of freshwater and the creation of marine [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]], as nitrogen-driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die. Furthermore, nitrous oxide, which is produced during denitrification, attacks the atmospheric [[ozone layer]].<ref name=Greenwood407/>\n\nMany saltwater fish manufacture large amounts of [[trimethylamine oxide]] to protect them from the high [[osmosis|osmotic]] effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to [[dimethylamine]] is responsible for the early odour in unfresh saltwater fish.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=15186102|date=Jun 2004|author=Nielsen, M.
