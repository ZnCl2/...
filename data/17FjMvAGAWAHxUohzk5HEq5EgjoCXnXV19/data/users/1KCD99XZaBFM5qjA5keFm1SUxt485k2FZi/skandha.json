Comparison with the five skandhas shows that the chain contains logical inconsistencies, which can be explained when the chain is considered to be a later elaboration.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}} This way it is explainable that nāma-rūpa in consciousness in the nine-fold are the beginning or start, while in the twelve-fold chain they are preceded by ignorance and formations. Those can only exist when ''nāma-rūpa'' in consciousness are present.\nSchumann also proposes that the twelve-fold is extended over three existences, and illustrates the succession of rebirths. While Buddhaghosa in Vasubandhu maintains a 2-8-2 schema, Schumann maintains a 3-6-3 scheme, putting the five skandhas alongside the twelve nidānas.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''Schumann''\n|-\n| '''The 12-fold chain'''\n| '''the 5 skandhas'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''First existence''\n|-\n| ||1.

''vidya''), and thus being the basis for the creation of a [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]] relationship between \"self\" and \"other.\"{{refn|group=lower-alpha|This type of analysis of the aggregates (where ignorance conditions the five aggregates) might be akin to that described by the [[Twelve Nidanas]].}}\n\nAccording to [[Trungpa tülkus|Trungpa Rinpoche]],<ref>Trungpa Rinpoche 1976, pp.&nbsp;20–22</ref> the five skandhas are \"a set of Buddhist concepts which describe experience as a five-step process\" and that \"the whole development of the five skandhas...is an attempt on our part to shield ourselves from the truth of our insubstantiality,\" while \"the practice of meditation is to see the transparency of this shield.\" <ref>Trungpa Rinpoche 1976, p.&nbsp;23</ref>\n\n====Deity yoga====\nTrungpa Rinpoche writes (2001, p.&nbsp;38):\n{{quote|[S]ome of the details of tantric iconography are developed from abhidharma [that is, in this context, detailed analysis of the aggregates].  Different colors and feelings of this particular consciousness, that particular emotion, are manifested in a particular deity wearing such-and-such a costume, of certain particular colors, holding certain particular sceptres in his hand.
