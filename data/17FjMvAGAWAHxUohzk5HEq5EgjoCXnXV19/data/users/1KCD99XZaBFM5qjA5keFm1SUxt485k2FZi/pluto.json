It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered.\n\nPluto was discovered by [[Clyde Tombaugh]] in 1930 and was originally considered to be the [[Planets beyond Neptune|ninth planet]] from the Sun. After 1992, its status as a [[planet]] was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt. In 2005, [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a dwarf planet in the [[scattered disc]] which is 27% more massive than Pluto, was discovered. This led the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) to [[IAU definition of planet|define the term \"planet\"]] formally in 2006, during their 26th General Assembly. That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet.\n\nPluto is the largest and second-most-massive known dwarf planet in the [[Solar System]], and the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the [[Sun]]. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small—about one-sixth the mass of the [[Moon]] and one-third its volume. It has a moderately [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s or AU (4.4–7.4 billion&nbsp;km) from the Sun. This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than [[Neptune]], but a stable [[orbital resonance]] with Neptune prevents them from colliding.  Light from the Sun takes about 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance (39.5&nbsp;AU).\n\nPluto has [[moons of Pluto|five known moons]]: [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] (the largest, with a diameter just over half that of Pluto), [[Styx (moon)|Styx]], [[Nix (moon)|Nix]], [[Kerberos (moon)|Kerberos]], and [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]]. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a [[binary system]] because the [[barycenter]] of their orbits does not lie within either body.\n\nOn July 14, 2015, the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft became the first spacecraft to [[planetary flyby|fly by]] Pluto. During its brief flyby, ''New Horizons'' made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons. In September 2016, astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of [[tholin]]s, [[organic compound|organic]] [[macromolecule]]s that may be ingredients for the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]], and produced from [[methane]], [[nitrogen]] and other gases released from the [[atmosphere of Pluto]] and transferred about {{convert|19,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the orbiting moon.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Discovery ===\n{{Further|Planets beyond Neptune}}\n[[File:Pluto discovery plates.png|left|thumb|alt=The same area of night sky with stars, shown twice, side by side.

Tombaugh.jpeg|left|thumb|upright|Clyde Tombaugh, in Kansas]]\nIn the 1840s, [[Urbain Le Verrier]] used [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]] to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet [[Neptune]] after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of [[Uranus]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems |first=Ken |last=Croswell |location=New York |publisher=The Free Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-684-83252-4 |page=43 |ref=harv}}</ref> Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune.\n\nIn 1906, [[Percival Lowell]]—a wealthy Bostonian who had founded [[Lowell Observatory]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], in 1894—started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet, which he termed \"[[Planet X]]\".<ref name=\"Tombaugh1946\" /> By 1909, Lowell and [[William Henry Pickering|William H. Pickering]] had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet.<ref name=\"Hoyt\" /> Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were.<ref name=\"Hoyt\" /><ref name=\"Littman1990\" /> There are fourteen other known [[precovery]] observations, with the oldest made by the [[Yerkes Observatory]] on August 20, 1909.<ref name=\"BuchwaldDimarioWild2000\" />\n\nPercival's widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband's legacy, and the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=50}} [[Vesto Melvin Slipher]], the observatory director, gave the job of locating Planet X to 23-year-old [[Clyde Tombaugh]], who had just arrived at the observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=50}}\n\nTombaugh's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a [[blink comparator]], he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=52}} After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the [[Harvard College Observatory]] on March 13, 1930.<ref name=\"Hoyt\" />\n\n=== Name ===\nThe discovery made headlines around the globe.<ref>For example: \"Ninth Planet Discovered on Edge of Solar System: First Found in 84 Years\".

These suggestions were disregarded.<ref name=\"Mager\" /><!-- self-published source -->\n\nThe name Pluto, after the [[Pluto (mythology)|god of the underworld]], was proposed by [[Venetia Burney]] (1918–2009), an eleven-year-old schoolgirl in [[Oxford]], England, who was interested in [[classical mythology]].<ref name=\"Venetia\" /> She suggested it in a conversation with her grandfather [[Falconer Madan]], a former librarian at the [[University of Oxford]]'s [[Bodleian Library]], who passed the name to astronomy professor [[Herbert Hall Turner]], who cabled it to colleagues in the United States.<ref name=\"Venetia\" />\n\nEach member of the Lowell Observatory was allowed to vote on a short-list of three potential names: [[Minerva]] (which was already the name for an asteroid), [[Cronus]] (which had lost reputation through being proposed by the unpopular astronomer [[Thomas Jefferson Jackson See]]), and Pluto. Pluto received every vote.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|pp=54–55}} The name was announced on May 1, 1930.<ref name=\"Venetia\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Pluto Research at Lowell |url=https://lowell.edu/in-depth/pluto/pluto-research-at-lowell/|website=Lowell Observatory |accessdate=March 22, 2017 |quote=In a Lowell Observatory Circular dated May 1, 1930, the Observatory designated Pluto as the name for the new planet, based on the suggestion of 11-year-old Venetia Burney of England.}}</ref> Upon the announcement, Madan gave Venetia £5 (equivalent to {{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|5|1930|2014|r=-2}}}} [[GBP]], or 450 [[USD]] in 2014){{Inflation-fn|UK}} as a reward.<ref name=\"Venetia\" />\n\nThe final choice of name was helped in part by the fact that the first two letters of ''Pluto'' are the initials of Percival Lowell. Pluto's [[astronomical symbol]] ([[File:Pluto symbol.svg|20px]], [[Unicode]] U+2647, ♇) was then created as a [[monogram]] constructed from the letters \"PL\".<ref name=\"JPL/NASA Pluto's Symbol\" /> Pluto's [[astrological symbol]] resembles that of Neptune ([[File:Neptune symbol.svg|20px]]), but has a circle in place of the middle prong of the trident ([[File:Pluto's astrological symbol.svg|20px]]).\n\nThe name was soon embraced by wider culture. In 1930, [[Walt Disney]] was apparently inspired by it when he introduced for [[Mickey Mouse]] a canine companion named [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], although [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animator [[Ben Sharpsteen]] could not confirm why the name was given.<ref name=\"Heinrichs2006\" /> In 1941, [[Glenn T.

In 1931, Pluto was calculated to be roughly the mass of [[Earth]], with further calculations in 1948 bringing the mass down to roughly that of [[Mars]].<ref name=\"Nicholson et al 1930\" /><ref name=\"Kuiper 10.1086/126255\" /> In 1976, Dale Cruikshank, Carl Pilcher and David Morrison of the [[University of Hawaii]] calculated Pluto's [[Albedo#Astronomical albedo|albedo]] for the first time, finding that it matched that for methane ice; this meant Pluto had to be exceptionally luminous for its size and therefore could not be more than 1 percent the mass of Earth.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=57}} (Pluto's albedo is {{nowrap|1.4–1.9}} times that of Earth.<ref name=\"Pluto Fact Sheet\" />)\n\nIn 1978, the discovery of Pluto's moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] allowed the measurement of Pluto's mass for the first time: roughly 0.2% that of Earth, and far too small to account for the discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X, notably by [[Robert Sutton Harrington]],<ref name=\"SeidelmannHarrington1988\" /> failed. In 1992, [[E. Myles Standish|Myles Standish]] used data from ''[[Voyager 2]]'''s flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised the estimates of Neptune's mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, the discrepancies, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished.<ref name=\"Standish1993\" /> Today, the majority of scientists agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist.<ref name=\"Standage2000\" /> Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto's actual orbit and its position at that time; [[Ernest W. Brown]] concluded soon after Pluto's discovery that this was a coincidence,<ref name=\"Tenn1994\" /> a view still held today.<ref name=\"Standish1993\" />\n\n=== Classification ===\n{{Further|Definition of planet}}\n{{TNO imagemap}}\n\nFrom 1992 onward, many bodies were discovered orbiting in the same volume as Pluto, showing that Pluto is part of a population of objects called the [[Kuiper belt]]. This made its official status as a planet controversial, with many questioning whether Pluto should be considered together with or separately from its surrounding population. Museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting Pluto from planetary models of the Solar System. The [[Hayden Planetarium]] reopened—in February 2000, after renovation—with a model of only eight planets, which made headlines almost a year later.<ref name=\"Tyson2001\" />\n\nAs objects increasingly closer in size to Pluto were discovered in the region, it was argued that Pluto should be reclassified as one of the Kuiper belt objects, just as [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], [[3 Juno|Juno]] and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] lost their planet status after the discovery of many other [[asteroid]]s. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at [[Caltech]] announced the discovery of a new [[trans-Neptunian object]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the [[tenth planet]], although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet.<ref name=\"NASA-JPL press release 07-29-2005\" /> Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.<ref name=\"what\" />\n\n==== IAU classification ====\n{{Main|IAU definition of planet}}\n\nThe debate came to a head in August 2006, with an [[IAU definition of planet|IAU resolution]] that created an official definition for the term \"planet\". According to this resolution, there are three conditions for an object in the [[Solar System]] to be considered a planet:\n# The object must be in orbit around the [[Sun]].\n# The object must be massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity. More specifically, its own gravity should pull it into a shape defined by [[hydrostatic equilibrium]].\n# It must have [[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared the neighborhood]] around its orbit.<ref name=\"IAU2006 GA26-5-6\" /><ref name=\"IAU0603\" />\n\nPluto fails to meet the third condition. Its mass is substantially less than the combined mass of the other objects in its orbit: 0.07 times, in contrast to Earth, which is 1.7 million times the remaining mass in its orbit (excluding the moon).<ref name=\"what\" /><ref name=\"IAU0603\" /> The IAU further decided that bodies that, like Pluto, meet criteria 1 and 2, but do not meet criterion 3 would be called [[dwarf planet]]s. In September 2006, the IAU included Pluto, and Eris and its moon [[Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia]], in their [[Minor Planet Catalogue]], giving them the official [[minor planet designation]]s \"(134340) Pluto\", \"(136199) Eris\", and \"(136199) Eris I Dysnomia\".<ref name=\"IAUC 8747\" /> Had Pluto been included upon its discovery in 1930, it would have likely been designated 1164, following [[1163 Saga]], which was discovered a month earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi#top |title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere has been some resistance within the astronomical community toward the reclassification.<ref name=\"geoff2006c\" /><ref name=\"Ruibal-1999\" /><ref name=\"Britt-2006\" /> [[Alan Stern]], principal investigator with [[NASA]]'s ''New Horizons'' mission to Pluto, derided the IAU resolution, stating that \"the definition stinks, for technical reasons\".<ref name=\"geoff2006a\" /> Stern contended that, by the terms of the new definition, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune, all of which share their orbits with asteroids, would be excluded.<ref name=\"newscientistspace\" /> He argued that all big spherical moons, including the [[Moon]], should likewise be considered planets.<ref name=\"News.discovery.com\" /> He also stated that because less than five percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community.<ref name=\"newscientistspace\" /> [[Marc W. Buie]], then at the Lowell Observatory petitioned against the definition.<ref name=\"Buie2006 IAU response\" /> Others have supported the IAU. [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], the astronomer who discovered Eris, said \"through this whole crazy circus-like procedure, somehow the right answer was stumbled on. It's been a long time coming.

Pluto moves about 7 degrees east per decade with small [[apparent retrograde motion]] as seen from Earth. Pluto was closer to the Sun than Neptune between 1979 and 1999.}}\nPluto's orbital period is currently about 248 years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially different from those of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] called the [[ecliptic]]. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately [[orbital inclination|inclined]] relative to the ecliptic (over 17°) and moderately [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] ([[elliptical]]). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies closer to the Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto–Charon barycenter came to [[apsis|perihelion]] on September 5, 1989,<ref name=\"jpl-ssd-horizons\" />{{efn|name = Perihelion}} and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.<ref name=\"pluto990209\" />\n\nIn the long term, Pluto's orbit is [[chaos theory|chaotic]]. Computer simulations can be used to predict its position for several million years (both [[time reversibility|forward and backward]] in time), but after intervals longer than the [[Lyapunov time]] of 10–20 million years, calculations become speculative: Pluto is sensitive to immeasurably small details of the Solar System, hard-to-predict factors that will gradually change Pluto's position in its orbit.<ref name=\"sussman88\" /><ref name=\"wisdom91\" />\n\nThe [[semi-major axis]] of Pluto's orbit varies between about 39.3 and 39.6&nbsp;[[astronomical unit|au]] with a period of about 19,951 years, corresponding to an orbital period varying between 246 and 249 years. The semi-major axis and period are presently getting longer.<ref name=williams71 />\n\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width = 225\n | image1 = Plutoorbit1.5sideview.gif\n | image2 = TheKuiperBelt Orbits Pluto Polar.svg\n | caption1 = Orbit of Pluto—ecliptic view.

When Pluto is closest to the Sun, and hence closest to Neptune's orbit as viewed from above, it is also the farthest above Neptune's path. Pluto's orbit passes about 8 [[astronomical unit|AU]] above that of Neptune, preventing a collision.<ref name=\"huainn01\" /><ref name=\"Hunter2004\" /><ref name=\"malhotra-9planets\" />\n\nThis alone is not enough to protect Pluto; [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its [[apsidal precession|orbital precession]]) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. However, Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 [[orbital resonance]] with [[Neptune]]: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near [[perihelion]], Neptune is over 50° behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130° ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17&nbsp;AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11&nbsp;AU).<ref name=\"malhotra-9planets\" /> The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.<ref name=williams71 />\n\nThe 2:3 resonance between the two bodies is highly stable, and has been preserved over millions of years.<ref name=\"sp-345\" /> This prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another, and so the two bodies can never pass near each other. Even if Pluto's orbit were not inclined, the two bodies could never collide.<ref name=\"malhotra-9planets\" /> The long term stability of the mean-motion resonance is due to phase protection. If Pluto's period is slightly shorter than 3/2 of Neptune its orbit relative to Neptune will drift, causing it to make closer approaches behind Neptune's orbit. The strong gravitational pull between the two causes [[angular momentum]] to be transferred to Pluto, at Neptune's expense. This moves Pluto into a slightly larger orbit, where it travels slightly more slowly, according to [[Kepler's third law]]. After many such repetitions, Pluto is sufficiently slowed, and Neptune sufficiently sped up, that Pluto orbit relative to Neptune drifts in the opposite direction until the process is reversed. The whole process takes about 20,000 years to complete.<ref name=\"malhotra-9planets\" /><ref name=\"sp-345\" /><ref name=\"Cohen_Hubbard_1965\">{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=C. J.|last2=Hubbard|first2=E. C.|title=Libration of the close approaches of Pluto to Neptune|journal=Astronomical Journal|date=1965|volume=70|page=10|doi=10.1086/109674|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1965AJ.....70...10C|bibcode=1965AJ.....70...10C}}</ref>\n\n==== Other factors ====\n\nNumerical studies have shown that over millions of years, the general nature of the alignment between the orbits of Pluto and Neptune does not change.<ref name=\"huainn01\" /><ref name=\"williams71\" /> There are several other resonances and interactions that enhance Pluto's stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).\n\nFirst, Pluto's [[argument of perihelion]], the angle between the point where it crosses the ecliptic and the point where it is closest to the Sun, [[libration|librates]] around 90°.<ref name=\"williams71\" /> This means that when Pluto is closest to the Sun, it is at its farthest above the plane of the Solar System, preventing encounters with Neptune. This is a consequence of the [[Kozai mechanism]],<ref name=\"huainn01\" /> which relates the eccentricity of an orbit to its inclination to a larger perturbing body—in this case Neptune. Relative to Neptune, the amplitude of libration is 38°, and so the angular separation of Pluto's perihelion to the orbit of Neptune is always greater than 52° {{nowrap|(90°–38°)}}. The closest such angular separation occurs every 10,000 years.<ref name=\"sp-345\" />\n\nSecond, the longitudes of ascending nodes of the two bodies—the points where they cross the ecliptic—are in near-resonance with the above libration. When the two longitudes are the same—that is, when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and the Sun—Pluto's perihelion lies exactly at 90°, and hence it comes closest to the Sun when it is highest above Neptune's orbit. This is known as the ''1:1 superresonance''. All the [[Jovian planets]], particularly Jupiter, play a role in the creation of the superresonance.<ref name=\"huainn01\" />\n\n=== Quasi-satellite ===\n\nIn 2012, it was hypothesized that [[15810 Arawn]] could be a [[quasi-satellite]] of Pluto, a specific type of co-orbital configuration.<ref name=\"quasi\" /> According to the hypothesis, the object would be a quasi-satellite of Pluto for about 350,000 years out of every two-million-year period.<ref name=\"quasi\" /><ref name=\"S&T\" /> This hypothesis was disproven in 2016, when more-accurate observations of the position of Arawn were made by ''New Horizons''.<ref name=\"2016maynasa\">{{cite web\n|title=New Horizons Collects First Science on a Post-Pluto Object\n|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-horizons-collects-first-science-on-a-post-pluto-object}}</ref>\n\n== Rotation ==\n\nPluto's [[rotation period]], its day, is equal to 6.39 [[Earth]] days.<ref name=\"axis\" /> Like [[Uranus]], Pluto rotates on its \"side\" in its orbital plane, with an axial tilt of 120°, and so its seasonal variation is extreme; at its [[solstice]]s, one-fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight, whereas another fourth is in continuous darkness.<ref name=\"oregon\" /> The reason for this unusual orientation has been debated. Research from [[University of Arizona]] has suggested that it may be due to the way that a body's spin will always adjust to minimise energy. This could mean a body reorienting itself to put extraneous mass near the equator and regions lacking mass tend towards the poles. This is called ''[[polar wander]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kirschvink|first=Joseph L.|last2=Ripperdan|first2=Robert L.|last3=Evans|first3=David A.|date=July 25, 1997|title=Evidence for a Large-Scale Reorganization of Early Cambrian Continental Masses by Inertial Interchange True Polar Wander|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/277/5325/541|journal=Science|language=en|volume=277|issue=5325|pages=541–545|doi=10.1126/science.277.5325.541|issn=0036-8075}}</ref> According to a paper released from the University of Arizona, this could be caused by masses of frozen nitrogen building up in shadowed areas of the dwarf planet. These masses would cause the body to reorient itself, leading to its unusual axial tilt of 120°. The buildup of nitrogen is due to Pluto's vast distance from the Sun. At the equator, temperatures can drop to {{convert|-240|C|F K}}, causing nitrogen to freeze as water would freeze on Earth. The same effect seen on Pluto would be observed on Earth if the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] was several times larger.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keane|first=James T.|last2=Matsuyama|first2=Isamu|last3=Kamata|first3=Shunichi|last4=Steckloff|first4=Jordan K.|title=Reorientation and faulting of Pluto due to volatile loading within Sputnik Planitia|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature20120|journal=Nature|volume=540|issue=7631|pages=90–93|doi=10.1038/nature20120|pmid=27851731|bibcode = 2016Natur.540...90K |year=2016}}</ref>\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:Pluto-01 Stern 03 Pluto Color TXT.jpg|thumb|High-resolution [[New Horizons#Ralph telescope|MVIC]] image of Pluto in enhanced color to bring out differences in surface composition]]\n[[File:NH-Pluto-WaterIceDetected-BlueRegions-Released-20151008.jpg|thumb|left|Regions where water ice has been detected (blue regions)]]\n{{Main|Geology of Pluto|Geography of Pluto}}\n\n=== Surface ===\nThe plains on Pluto's surface are composed of more than 98 percent [[solid nitrogen|nitrogen ice]], with traces of methane and [[carbon monoxide]].<ref name=\"tobias\" /> [[Nitrogen]] and carbon monoxide are most abundant on the anti-Charon face of Pluto (around 180° longitude, where [[Tombaugh Regio]]'s western lobe, [[Sputnik Planitia]], is located), whereas methane is most abundant near 300° east.<ref name=Grundy_2013 /> The mountains are made of water ice.<ref name=\"drake-natgeo\">{{cite web | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151109-astronomy-pluto-nasa-new-horizons-volcano-moons-science/| title = Floating Mountains on Pluto—You Can't Make This Stuff Up| last = Drake| first = Nadia| date = November 9, 2015| publisher = [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]| access-date = December 23, 2016}}</ref> Pluto's surface is quite varied, with large differences in both brightness and color.<ref name=\"Buie_2010 light curve\" /> Pluto is one of the most contrastive bodies in the Solar System, with as much contrast as [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]].<ref name=\"Buie_web_map\" /> The color varies from charcoal black, to dark orange and white.<ref name=\"Hubble2010\" /> Pluto's color is more similar to that of [[Io (moon)|Io]] with slightly more orange and significantly less red than [[Mars]].<ref name=\"Buie_2010 surface-maps\" /> [[Geography of Pluto|Notable geographical features]] include Tombaugh Regio, or the \"Heart\" (a large bright area on the side opposite Charon), [[Cthulhu Regio|Cthulhu Macula]],<ref name = \"Pluto System after New Horizons\"/> or the \"Whale\" (a large dark area on the trailing hemisphere), and the \"[[Brass Knuckles (Pluto)|Brass Knuckles]]\" (a series of equatorial dark areas on the leading hemisphere). \n\nSputnik Planitia, the western lobe of the \"Heart\", is a 1,000&nbsp;km-wide basin of frozen nitrogen and carbon monoxide ices, divided into polygonal cells, which are interpreted as [[convection cell]]s that carry floating blocks of water ice crust and [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] pits towards their margins;<ref name=\"lakdawalla-DPS-2016-10-26\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2016/10251718-dpsepsc-new-horizons-pluto.html\n| title = DPS/EPSC update on New Horizons at the Pluto system and beyond\n| last = Lakdawalla| first = Emily| author-link=Emily Lakdawalla| date = October 26, 2016\n| publisher = [[The Planetary Society]]| access-date = October 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"McKinnon2016\">{{cite journal|last1=McKinnon|first1=W.

Rather, it is considered a member of a linked population called the [[scattered disc]].\n\nA large number of Kuiper belt objects, like Pluto, are in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune. KBOs with this orbital resonance are called \"[[plutino]]s\", after Pluto.<ref name=\"Jewitt2004\" />\n\nLike other members of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is thought to be a residual [[planetesimal]]; a component of the original [[protoplanetary disc]] around the [[Sun]] that failed to fully coalesce into a full-fledged planet. Most astronomers agree that Pluto owes its current position to a [[planetary migration|sudden migration]] undergone by Neptune early in the Solar System's formation. As Neptune migrated outward, it approached the objects in the proto-Kuiper belt, setting one in orbit around itself (Triton), locking others into resonances, and knocking others into chaotic orbits. The objects in the [[scattered disc]], a dynamically unstable region overlapping the Kuiper belt, are thought to have been placed in their current positions by interactions with Neptune's migrating resonances.<ref name=\"Hahn2005\" /> A computer model created in 2004 by Alessandro Morbidelli of the [[Côte d'Azur Observatory|Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur]] in [[Nice]] suggested that the migration of Neptune into the Kuiper belt may have been triggered by the formation of a 1:2 resonance between Jupiter and Saturn, which created a gravitational push that propelled both Uranus and Neptune into higher orbits and caused them to switch places, ultimately doubling Neptune's distance from the Sun. The resultant expulsion of objects from the proto-Kuiper belt could also explain the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] 600&nbsp;million years after the Solar System's formation and the origin of the [[Jupiter trojan]]s.<ref name=\"Levison2007\" /> It is possible that Pluto had a near-circular orbit about 33 AU from the Sun before Neptune's migration [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] it into a resonant capture.<ref name=\"Malhotra1995\" /> The Nice model requires that there were about a thousand Pluto-sized bodies in the original planetesimal disk, which included Triton and Eris.<ref name=\"Levison2007\" />\n\n== Observation and exploration ==\nPluto's distance from Earth makes its in-depth study and [[Space exploration|exploration]] difficult.

Observations were made of the change in the total average brightness of the Pluto–Charon system during the eclipses. For example, eclipsing a bright spot on Pluto makes a bigger total brightness change than eclipsing a dark spot. Computer processing of many such observations can be used to create a brightness map. This method can also track changes in brightness over time.<ref name=\"YoungBinzelCrane2001\" /><ref name=\"BuieTholenHorne1992\" />\n\nBetter maps were produced from images taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST), which offered higher [[angular resolution|resolution]], and showed considerably more detail,<ref name=\"Buie_web_map\" /> resolving variations several hundred kilometers across, including polar regions and large bright spots.<ref name=\"Buie_2010 surface-maps\" /> These maps were produced by complex computer processing, which finds the best-fit projected maps for the few pixels of the Hubble images.<ref name=\"Buie_mapmaking\" /> These remained the most detailed maps of Pluto until the flyby of ''New Horizons'' in July 2015, because the two cameras on the HST used for these maps were no longer in service.<ref name=\"Buie_mapmaking\" />\n\n=== Exploration ===\n{{Main|Exploration of Pluto|New Horizons|}}\n[[File:Pluto-Map-Annotated.jpg|thumb|The portions of Pluto's surface mapped by ''New Horizons'' (annotated)]]\nThe ''New Horizons'' spacecraft, which [[planetary flyby|flew by]] Pluto in July 2015, is the first and so far only attempt to explore Pluto directly.

In early 2007 the craft made use of a [[gravity assist]] from [[Jupiter]].\n\n''New Horizons'' made its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015, after a 3,462-day journey across the Solar System. Scientific observations of Pluto began five months before the closest approach and continued for at least a month after the encounter. Observations were conducted using a [[remote sensing]] package that included [[digital imaging|imaging]] instruments and a radio science investigation tool, as well as [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] and other experiments. The scientific goals of ''New Horizons'' were to characterize the global geology and morphology of Pluto and its moon Charon, map their surface composition, and analyze Pluto's neutral atmosphere and its escape rate.

The last objective could be accomplished using laser pulses to generate a complete topographic map of Pluto. ''New Horizons'' principal investigator Alan Stern has advocated for a [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]-style orbiter that would launch around 2030 (the 100th anniversary of Pluto's discovery) and use Charon's gravity to adjust its orbit as needed to fulfill science objectives after arriving at the Pluto system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/36697-pluto-orbiter-mission-after-new-horizons.html|title=Going Back to Pluto?
