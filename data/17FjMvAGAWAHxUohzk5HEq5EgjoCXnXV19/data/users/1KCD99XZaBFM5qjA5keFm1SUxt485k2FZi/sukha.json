Among the early scriptures, 'sukha' is set up as a contrast to 'preya' (प्रेय) meaning a transient pleasure, whereas the pleasure of 'sukha' has an authentic state happiness within a being that is lasting. In the [[Pāli Canon]], the term is used in the context of describing [[Laity|laic]] pursuits, meditative absorptions, and intra-psychic phenomena.\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to Monier-Williams (1964), the etymology of ''sukha'' is \"said to be ''su'' ['good'] + ''kha'' ['aperture'] and to mean originally 'having a good axle-hole'....\"  Thus, for instance, in the [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]] ''sukha'' denotes \"running swiftly or easily\" (applied, e.g., to chariots).  ''Sukha'' is juxtaposed with ''du{{IAST|ḥ}}kha'' (Sanskrit; Pali: ''[[dukkha]]''; often translated as \"suffering\"), which was established as the major motivating life principles in early Vedic religion. This theme of the centrality of dukkha was developed in later years in both Vedic and the offshoot Buddhist traditions. The elimination of dukkha is the ''raison d'être'' of early Buddhism.<ref>Monier-Williams (1964), p. 1220, entry for \"Sukhá\" (retrieved from http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw1220-suUti.pdf).  Square-bracketed words (\"good\" and \"aperture\") are based on Monier-Williams, pp. 334, 1219.</ref><ref>Regarding the relationship between ''sukha'' and ''dukkha'', Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-5), p. 716, entry for \"Sukha\" (retrieved from http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1:262.pali), simply identifies that ''[[dukkha]]'' is one of the antonyms of ''sukha'' (along with ''asukha'') and, in such contexts, is sometimes spelled ''dukha''.</ref>\n\n==Pali literature==\n{{TheravadaBuddhism}}\nIn the Pali Canon and related [[Pali literature|literature]], the term is used in a general sense to refer to \"well-being and happiness\" (''hitasukha'') in either this present life or future lives.  In addition, it is a technical term associated with describing a factor of meditative absorption ([[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhāna]]) and a sensory-derived feeling ([[vedanā]]).\n\n===General life pursuit===\nIn the Pali Canon, the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] discusses with different lay persons \"well-being and happiness\" (''hitasukha'') \"visible in this present life\" (''di{{IAST|ṭṭ}}ha-dhamma'') and \"pertaining to the future life\" (''samparāyika''), as exemplified by the following [[sutra|suttas]].<ref>See Bodhi (2005), pp. 3-4, ''passim''.</ref>\n\n====Anana Sutta====\nIn the ''Ana{{IAST|ṇ}}a Sutta'' ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.62), the Buddha describes four types of happiness for a \"[[Householder (Buddhism)|householder]] partaking of sensuality\" (''gihinā [[kāma]]-bhoginā''):\n* the happiness of earning (''atthi-sukha'') wealth by just and righteous means\n* the happiness of using (''bhoga-sukha'') wealth liberally on family, friends, & on meritorious deeds\n* the happiness of debtlessness (''ana{{IAST|ṇ}}a-sukha'') be free from debts\n* the happiness of blamelessness (''anavajja-sukha''), to live a faultless and pure life without committing evil in thought, word, and deed\nOf these, the wise (''sumedhaso'') know that the happiness of blamelessness is by far the greatest householder happiness.<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 127-8; and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.062.than.html Thanissaro (1997a).]  Pali is based on the Sri Lanka [[Tripitaka]] Project (SLTP) edition, retrieved 2008-05-08 from \"MettaNet\" at http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/4Anguttara-Nikaya/Anguttara2/4-catukkanipata/007-pattakammavaggo-p.html.  Bodhi's translation omits the last verse (which praises happiness of blamelessness) which can be found in both Thanissaro's translation and the SLTP.</ref>  Economic and material happiness is not worth one sixteenth part of the spiritual happiness arising out of a faultless and good life.\n\n====Kalama Sutta====\nIn the ''Kālāmā Sutta'' ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.65), townspeople ask the Buddha how they are to ascertain which spiritual teaching is true.  The Buddha counsels that one should \"enter and dwell\" (''upasampajja vihareyyātha'') in \"things\" or \"qualities\" (''[[dhamma|dhammā]]'') that are:\n* skillful (''kusalā''), \n* blameless (''anavajjā''), \n* praised by the wise (''viññuppasatthā''), and\n* when put into practice, are conducive to well-being and happiness (''samattā samādinnā hitāya sukhāya''<ref>Note that here, as elsewhere, through textual parallelism, ''sukha'' (\"happiness\") is used as the opposite of ''[[dukkha]]'' (\"suffering\").</ref>'' sa{{IAST|ṃ}}vattantī'')\nUsing the latter criterion, the Buddha then asks the townspeople to assess greed (''lobha''), hate (''dosa'') and delusion (''moha'') whereby it is agreed that entering and dwelling in non-greed, non-hate and non-delusion lead to well-being and happiness.  The Buddha states that, given this understanding, a noble disciple (''ariyasāvako'')<ref>Note that \"noble disciples\" (''ariyasāvako'') include laypeople.  See \"[[Śrāvaka]].\"</ref> pervades all directions with [[metta|lovingkindness]], [[Karuṇā|compassion]], [[mudita|sympathetic joy]] and [[upekkha|equanimity]] (see the four ''[[brahmavihara]]s''); and, by doing so, one purifies oneself, avoids evil-induced consequences, lives a happy present life and, if there is a future karmic [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], one will be born in a [[Buddhist cosmology|heavenly world]].<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 88-91; and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html Thanissaro (1994).] Pali is based on the SLTP tipitaka retrieved 2008-05-08 from \"MettaNet\" at http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/4Anguttara-Nikaya/Anguttara1/3-tikanipata/007-mahavaggo-p.html.

May the Blessed One teach the [[Dhamma]] for those like us, for our happiness & well-being in this life, for our happiness & well-being in lives to come.\"<ref>[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.054.than.html Thanissaro (1995).]</ref>\nIn a manner somewhat similar to his exposition in the aforementioned ''Ana{{IAST|ṇ}}a Sutta'', the Buddha identifies four sources that lead to well-being and happiness in the current life:\n* productive efforts (''u{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hāna-sampadā'') in one's livelihood,\n* protective efforts (''ārakkha-sampadā'') regarding ones wealth in terms of possible theft or disaster,\n* virtuous friendship ([[kalyana mittata|''kalyā{{IAST|ṇ}}a-mittatā'']]), and\n* even-headed living (''sama-jīvikatā''), abstaining from womanizing, drunkenness, gambling and evil friendships. \nIn terms of well-being and happiness in the next life, the Buddha identifies the following sources:\n* faith (''[[Śraddhā|saddhā]]'') in the fully enlightened Buddha;\n* virtue (''[[sīla]]''), as exemplified by the [[Five Precepts]];\n* generosity (''cāga''), giving charity and [[Alms#Buddhism|alms]]; and,\n* wisdom (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|paññā]]''), having insight into the arising and passing of things.<ref>Bodhi (2005), pp. 124-6; and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.054.than.html Thanissaro (1995).]</ref>\n\n====Mettā practice====\nAs indicated above, in the ''Kālāmā Sutta'', the Buddha identifies the practice of the four divine abodes (''brahmavihara'') as being conducive to ''one's own'' well-being and happiness. The first of these abodes is [[mettā]] (benevolence, kindness) which is, for instance, classically expressed in the Pali canon's ''Karaniya Mettā Sutta'' (\"Scripture of Compassionate Benevolence\") ([[Suttanipata|Sn]] 1.8) by the sincere wish (in English and Pali):\n{| style=\"margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-right:1em\" | May all beings be at ease!<ref>[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.1.08.amar.html Amaravati Sangha (2004).]</ref> \n| style=\"padding-left:1em\" | ''Sabbe sattā bhavantu sukhitattā.''\n|}\nSimilarly, the Pali commentaries ([[Suttanipata|SN]]-[[Atthakatha|A]] 128) explicitly define ''mettā'' as \"the desire to bring about the well-being and happiness [of others]\" (''hita-sukha-upanaya-kāmatā'')<ref>Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-5), p. 197, entry for \"[[Karuṇā]],\" retrieved at {{cite web |url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:356.pali |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711002204/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:356.pali |archivedate=2012-07-11 |df= }}.</ref>  Thus, in Buddhism, to dwell wishing for others' general happiness is conducive to the development of one's own happiness.\n\n===Feeling attribute===\nIn the Buddhist frameworks of the five aggregates (Sanskrit: ''[[skandha]]''; Pali: ''khandha'') and dependent origination (Sanskrit: ''pratītyasamutpāda''; Pali: paticcasamuppāda), \"feelings\" or \"sensations\" (''[[vedanā]]'') arise from the contact of an external object (such as a visual object or sound) with a [[ayatana|sensory organ]] (such as the eye or ear) and consciousness.  In the [[Pali Canon]], such feelings are generally described to be of one of three types: pleasant (''sukha''), unpleasant (''dukkha''), or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant (''adukkha-asukha'').<ref>See, for instance, ''Datthabba Sutta'' ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 36.5; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn36/sn36.005.nypo.html Nyanaponika, 1983)] and ''Chachakka Sutta'' ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 148; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.148.than.html Thanissaro, 1998).] \n</ref>\n\n===Absorption factor===\nIn [[Buddhist meditation]], the development of concentrative absorption (Sanskrit: ''dhyāna''; Pali: ''[[jhāna]]'') is canonically described in terms of the following five factors:\n# applied thought (''[[vitakka]]'')\n# sustained thought (''[[vicāra]]'')\n# joy/rapture/happiness (''[[pīti]]'')\n# happiness/pleasure/bliss (''sukha'')\n# equanimity (''[[upekkhā]]'')<ref>See, for instance, ''Samādha{{IAST|ṅ}}ga Sutta'' (a/k/a, ''Pañca{{IAST|ṅ}}gikasamādhi Sutta'', [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 5.28) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.028.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997b).]</ref>\n\n{{JhanaFactors|expanded=1}}\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, both ''pīti'' and ''sukha'' are born of bodily seclusion and mental quietude.  The ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' distinguishes between ''pīti'' and ''sukha'' in the following experiential manner:\n:And wherever the two are associated, happiness [here, Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli's translation of ''pīti''] is the contentedness at getting a desirable object, and bliss [''sukha''] is the actual experiencing of it when got.  Where there is happiness [''pīti''] there is bliss (pleasure) [''sukha'']; but where there is bliss [''sukha''] there is not necessarily happiness [''pīti''].  Happiness is included in the [[sankhara|formations]] [[skandha|aggregate]]; bliss is included in the [[vedana|feeling]] aggregate.  If a man exhausted in a desert saw or heard about a pond on the edge of a wood, he would have happiness; if he went into the wood's shade and used the water, he would have bliss....<ref>[[Visuddhimagga|Vsm]]. IV, 100 (Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli, 1999, p. 142).  Similarly, see also the [[Abhidhamma]]'s [[atthakatha|commentary]], ''Atthasalini'' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html (Bodhi, 1980).]</ref>\n\nProviding a bare-bones conditional chain of events that overlaps the above more narrative exposition, the ''Upanisa Sutta'' ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.23) states that ''sukha'' arises from tranquillity (''[[passaddhi]]'') of the body and mind, and in turn gives rise to concentration (''[[samādhi]]'').<ref>[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html Bodhi (1980)] and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.023.than.html Thanissaro (1997c).]</ref> Citing traditional post-canonical Pali literature related to this discourse, Bodhi (1980) adds the following functional definition of ''sukha'':\n:The [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|subcommentary]] to the ''Upanisa Sutta'' explains ''sukha'' as the happiness of the access to absorption. The term 'access' (upacara) denotes the stage in the cultivation of serenity immediately preceding full absorption, the intended goal of [[samatha meditation|serenity meditation]]. Access is characterized by the abandonment of the [[five hindrances]] and the arising of the 'counterpart sign,' the self-luminous object of interior perception which is the focal point for the higher stages of concentration.\n\n===As a characterization of awakening===\n[[Nirvāṇa|Nibbāna]] (Sanskrit: ''Nirvāṇa'') entails the foundational extinction or \"blowing out\" of the processes of unwholesome [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|desire, aversion, and delusion]]. From the perspective of awakened experience, the latter deleterious processes are appreciated as \"agitations\" of the mind. In comparative contrast to such agitation, ''sukha'' and its cognates are at places in the [[Pali Canon]] used to characterize the calm of Nibbāna, the \"Unconditioned,\" as a bliss:\n\n:The born, come-to-be, produced, \n:The made, the conditioned, the transient, \n:Conjoined with decay and death, \n:A nest of disease, perishable, \n:Sprung from nutriment and craving's cord — \n:That is not fit to take delight in.\n\n:The escape from that, the peaceful, \n:Beyond reasoning, everlasting, \n:The not-born, the unproduced, \n:The sorrowless state that is void of stain, \n:The cessation of states linked to suffering, \n:The stilling of the conditioned — bliss.<ref>[[Itivuttaka]] 2.16, Ireland trans., at http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.2.042-049x.irel.html#iti-043</ref>\n\n==Sanskrit literature==\nIn the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali#Asana|Yoga Sūtras]], Patañjali uses the word 'sukha' when he defines asana as the balance between \"Sukha\" and \"Stirah\" (strength, steadiness, firmness).\n\n==Neuroscientific basis==\nSome researchers have proposed that a \"shift\" in the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex is what supports a state of inner fulfillment and equanimity.\n<ref>DAVIDSON RJ, KABAT-ZINN J, SCHUMACHER J et al.
