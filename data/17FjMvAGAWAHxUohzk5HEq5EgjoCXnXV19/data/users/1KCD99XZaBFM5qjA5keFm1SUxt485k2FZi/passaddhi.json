As part of [[Buddhist meditation|cultivated]] mental factors, ''passaddhi'' is preceded by rapture (''pīti'') and precedes concentration (''samādhi'').\n\n''Passaddhi'' is identified as a wholesome factor in the following canonical contexts:\n* the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''sambojjhangas'') \n* meditative absorptions (''[[jhana]]ni'')\n* transcendental dependent arising (''lokuttara-[[paticcasamuppada]]'')\n\n==Canonical references==\nIn various Buddhist [[Pali Canon|canonical]] schema, the calming of the body, speech and various mental factors is associated with gladness (''pāmojja'', ''pāmujja''), rapture (''pīti''), and pleasure (''{{IAST|sukhaṃ}}'') and leads to the concentration needed for release from suffering.\n\n===Meditative calming===\nCalming (''{{IAST|passambhayaṃ}}'') bodily and mental formations is the culmination of each of the first two tetrads of meditation instructions in the [[Pali Canon]]'s famed [[Anapanasati Sutta]]:\n<center>\n{| cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 style=\"text-align:left\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| [1]\n| Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'....\n| ''{{IAST|Dīghaṃ vā assasanto dīghaṃ assasāmīti pajānāti}}....''\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| [2]\n| Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'....\n| ''{{IAST|Rassaṃ vā assasanto rassaṃ assasāmīti pajānāti}}....''\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| [3]\n| He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body....'\n| ''{{IAST|Sabbakāyapaṭisaṃvedī assasissāmīti sikkhati}}....''\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| [4]\n| He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication....'\n| ''{{IAST|Passambhayaṃ kāyasaṅkhāraṃ assasissāmīti sikkhati}}....''\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| &nbsp;<br>[5]\n| &nbsp;<br>He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to rapture....'\n| &nbsp;<br>''{{IAST|Pītipaṭisaṃvedī assasissāmīti sikkhati}}....''\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| [6]\n| He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure....'\n| ''{{IAST|Sukhapaṭisaṃvedī assasissāmīti sikkhati}}....''\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| [7]\n| He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication....'\n| ''{{IAST|Cittasaṅkhārapaṭisaṃvedī assasissāmīti sikkhati}}....''\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| [8]\n| He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming mental fabrication....'<ref>The ''Anapanasati Sutta'' ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 118) in English [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.118.than.html (Thanissaro,  2006).]</ref>\n| ''{{IAST|Passambhayaṃ cittasaṅkhāraṃ assasissāmīti sikkhati}}....''<ref>The ''Anapanasati Sutta'' ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 118) in Pali [http://www.mettanet.org/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/2Majjhima-Nikaya/Majjhima3/118-anappanasati-p.html (SLTP, n.d.-a).]</ref>\n|}\n</center>\n\n===''Sati, pāmojja, pīti, passaddhi, sukho''===\nAs indicated in the prior and future sections and highlighted here, a number of discourses identify the concurrent arising of the following wholesome mental states with the development of [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] (''sati''):\n:* ''pāmojja'' or ''pāmujja'' (\"gladness\" or \"joy\")\n:* ''pīti'' (\"rapture\" or \"joy\")\n:* ''passaddhi'' (\"tranquility\" or \"serenity\" or \"calm\")\n:* ''sukho'' (\"happiness\" or \"pleasure\").\n\nBy establishing mindfulness, one overcomes the [[Five Hindrances]] (''pañca nīvaraṇi''), gives rise to gladness, rapture, pleasure and tranquillizes the body (''kāyo passambhati''); such bodily tranquillity (''passaddhakāyo'') leads to higher states of concentration (''samādhi'') as indicated in this Pali-recorded discourse ascribed to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]:\n<center>\n{| cellpadding=15 cellspacing=0 style=\"text-align:left\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| Seeing that [these five hindrances] have been abandoned<br>within him, he becomes glad.<br>Glad, he becomes enraptured.<br>Enraptured, his body grows tranquil.<br>His body tranquil, he is sensitive to pleasure.<br>Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.<ref>The Samaññaphala Sutta ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 2) in English [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html (Thanissaro,  1997).]  The same verse is in the Potthapada Sutta (DN 9) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.09.0.than.html (Thanissaro, 2003).]</ref>\n| ''{{IAST|Tassime pañca nīvaraṇe pahīṇe<br>attani samanupassato pāmojjaṃ jāyati.<br>Pamuditassa pīti jāyati.<br>Pītimanassa kāyo passambhati.<br>Passaddhakāyo sukhaṃ vedeti.<br>Sukhino cittaṃ samādhiyati.}}''<ref>''{{IAST|Sāmaññaphalasuttaṃ}}'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 2) in Pali [http://www.mettanet.org/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/1Digha-Nikaya/Digha1/02samannaphala-p.html (SLTP, n.d.-c), para. 61;] and, ''{{IAST|Poṭṭhapādasuttaṃ}}'' (DN 9) in Pali [http://www.mettanet.org/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/1Digha-Nikaya/Digha1/09-potthapada-p.html (SLTP, n.d.-b), para. 33.]</ref>\n|}\n</center>\n\nSimilarly, with the realization of wisdom (or, as below, \"discernment\") (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|paññā]]'') these wholesome states arise:\n<center>\n{| cellpadding=15 cellspacing=0 style=\"text-align:left\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| When defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown, and one enters & remains in the culmination & abundance of discernment, having known & realized it for oneself in the here & now, there is joy, rapture, serenity, mindfulness, alertness, and a pleasant/happy abiding.<ref>The Potthapada Sutta (DN 9) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.09.0.than.html (Thanissaro, 2003).]</ref>\n| ''{{IAST|Saṅkilesikā ceva dhammā pahīyissanti.

Among the factors of enlightenment, serenity (''passadhi'') is preceded by rapture (''[[pīti]]'') and leads to concentration (''[[Samadhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]]'') as further described by the Buddha in the [[Anapanasati Sutta]]:\n:\"For one enraptured at heart, the body grows calm and the mind grows calm. When the body & mind of a monk enraptured at heart grow calm, then serenity as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.\n:\"For one who is at ease — his body calmed — the mind becomes concentrated.

According to [Commentary] they are implied in the 'cessation of perception and feelings' (for the attainment of which they are a condition).\"</ref>\n\n===Arahantship condition===\nPassaddhi is a \"supporting condition\" for the \"destruction of the cankers\" (''āsava-khaye''), that is, the achievement of [[Arhat|Arahantship]].  More specifically, in describing a set of supporting conditions that move one from [[samsara|samsaric]] suffering (see [[Dependent Origination]]) to destruction of the cankers, the Buddha describes the following progression of conditions:\n# suffering (''[[dukkha]]'')\n# faith (''[[saddha|saddhā]]'')\n# joy (''pāmojja'', ''pāmujja'')\n# rapture (''pīti'')\n# tranquillity (''passaddhi'')\n# happiness (''[[sukha]]'')\n# concentration (''[[samadhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]]'')\n# knowledge and vision of things as they are (''{{IAST|yathābhūta-ñāna-dassana}}'')\n# disenchantment with worldly life (''nibbidā'')\n# dispassion (''virāga'')\n# freedom, release, emancipation, deliverance (''vimutti'')\n# knowledge of destruction of the cankers (''{{IAST|āsava-khaye-ñāna}}'')<ref>[[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.23 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.023.bodh.html (Bodhi, 1980, 1995).]</ref>\nIn the [[Pali literature]], this sequence that enables one to transcend worldly suffering is referred to as the \"transcendental dependent arising\" (''lokuttara-[[paticcasamuppada]]'').<ref>Bodhi (1980, 1995) states that the para[[Pali Canon|canonical]] [[Nettipakarana]] provides this label for SN 12.23's secondary sequence.</ref>\n\n===Abhidhammic wholesome state===\nIn the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]]'s [[Dhammasangani]], the first chapter identifies 56 states of material-world consciousness that are wholesome, including \"lightness of sense and thought,\" upon which the text elaborates:\n:What on that occasion is repose of sense (kayāpassaddhi)?\n:The serenity, the composure which there is on that occasion, the calming, the tranquillizing, the tranquillity of the [[skandha]]s of feeling, perception and syntheses &mdash; this is the serenity of sense that there then is.\n:What on that occasion is serenity of thought (cittapassaddhi)?\n:The serenity, the composure which there is on that occasion, the calming, the tranquillizing, the tranquillity of the skandha of intellect &mdash; this is the serenity of thought that there then is.<ref>Rhys Davids (1900), pp. 1-4 (consciousness states xxxix and xl), 23, verses 40 and 41.  Based on the second paragraph of this excerpt and the third excerpted paragraph's use of the word ''citta'', it is evident that Rhys Davids uses the word \"intellect\" here for what is traditionally referred to in the ''khandha'' model as ''[[vijnana|viññana]]''.</ref>\n\n==Post-canonical Pali texts==\n''Passaddhi'' is referenced in the [[Visuddhimagga]] and other Pali commentarial (''[[atthakatha]]'') texts.\n\n===Tranquillity's nutriments===\nIn the Visuddhimagga, the enlightenment factors (''[[bojjhanga]]s'') are discussed in the context of skills for developing absorption (''[[jhana|jhāna]]'').<ref>Buddhaghosa & {{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} (1999), IV:42-66, pp. 127-134.</ref>  In particular, the Visuddhimagga recommends that in order to develop the skill of \"restrain[ing] the mind on an occasion when it should be restrained\" (such as when it is \"agitated through over-energeticness, etc.\"), one should develop tranquillity (''passaddhi''), concentration (''samādhi'') and equanimity (''upekkhā'').<ref>Buddhaghosa & {{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} (1999), p. 131.</ref>  Towards this end, the Visuddhimagga identifies seven things from which bodily and mental tranquillity arise:\n# \"using superior food\"\n# \"living in a good climate\"\n# \"maintaining a pleasant posture\"\n# \"keeping to the middle\"\n# \"avoidance of violent persons\"\n# \"cultivation of persons tranquil in body\"\n# \"resoluteness upon that [tranquillity].\"<ref>Buddhaghosa & {{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} (1999), p. 132 (square brackets included in original text).  According to Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25), ''op. cit.'', similar information is found in the [[Vibhanga]]-[[Atthakatha]] 282.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Jhana]] (Meditative absorption)\n*[[Paticcasamuppada]] (Dependent Origination)\n**[[Twelve Nidanas]] (12 Causes)\n*[[Samatha]]\n*[[Seven factors of enlightenment]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n* [[Bhikkhu Bodhi|Bodhi, Bhikkhu]] (trans., ed.)
