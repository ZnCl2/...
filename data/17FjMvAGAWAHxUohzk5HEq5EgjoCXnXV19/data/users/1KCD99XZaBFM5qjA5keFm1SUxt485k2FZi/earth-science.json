It is the branch of science dealing with the physical constitution of the earth and its atmosphere. Earth science is the study of our planet’s physical characteristics, from earthquakes to raindrops, and floods to fossils. Earth science can be considered to be a branch of [[planetary science]], but with a much older history. “Earth science” is a broad term that encompasses four main branches of study, each of which is further broken down into more specialized fields.\n\nThere are both [[reductionism|reductionist]] and [[holism|holistic]] approaches to Earth sciences. It is also the study of the Earth and its neighbors in space. Some Earth [[Scientist|scientists]] use their knowledge of the Earth to locate and develop energy and mineral resources. Others study the impact of human activity on Earth's environment, and design methods to protect the planet. Some use their knowledge about Earth processes such as [[Volcano|volcanoes]], [[Earthquake|earthquakes]], and [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] to plan communities that will not expose people to these dangerous events. \n\nThe Earth sciences can include the study of [[geology]], the [[lithosphere]], and the large-scale structure of the Earth's interior, as well as the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], and [[biosphere]]. Typically, Earth scientists use tools from [[geography]], [[chronology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[mathematics]] to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth works and evolves. Earth science affects our everyday lives. For example, meteorologists study the weather and watch for dangerous storms. Hydrologists study water and warn of floods. Seismologists study earthquakes and try to predict where they will strike. Geologists study rocks and help to locate useful minerals. Earth scientists mainly work “in the field”—climbing mountains, exploring the seabed, crawling through caves, or wading in swamps. They measure and collect samples (such as rocks or river water), then they record their findings on charts and maps.\n\n== Fields of study ==\nThe following [[branches of science|fields of science]] are generally categorized within the Earth sciences:\n* [[Physical geography]], covers aspects of [[geomorphology]], [[pedology (soil study)|soil study]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[climatology]], and [[biogeography]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/1b.html|title=1(b). Elements of Geography – 2nd Edition, by M. Pidwirny, 2006|work=physicalgeography.net}}</ref>\n* [[Geology]] describes the [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] parts of the [[Earth's crust]] (or [[lithosphere]]) and its historic development. Major subdisciplines are [[mineralogy]] and [[petrology]], [[geochemistry]], geomorphology, [[paleontology]], [[stratigraphy]], [[structural geology]], [[engineering geology]], and [[sedimentology]].<ref>{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|p=20}}</ref><ref\nname=\"smith 5\">{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=5}}</ref>\n* [[Geophysics]] and [[geodesy]] investigate the [[figure of the Earth|shape of the Earth]], its reaction to forces and its [[magnetic field|magnetic]] and [[gravity field]]s. Geophysicists explore the [[Inner core|Earth's core]] and [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] as well as the [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] and [[Seismology|seismic]] activity of the lithosphere.<ref name=\"smith 5\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=geodesy&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o7=&o5=&o1=1&o6=&o4=&o3=&h=0|title=WordNet Search – 3.1|work=princeton.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/geodesy/welcome.html|title=NOAA National Ocean Service Education: Global Positioning Tutorial|work=noaa.gov}}</ref> Geophysics is commonly used to supplement the work of [[geologist]]s in developing a comprehensive understanding of crustal geology, particularly in mineral and petroleum exploration. [[Seismologist]]s use geophysics to understand plate tectonic shifting, as well as predict seismic activity. See [[geophysical survey]].\n* [[Soil science]] covers the outermost layer of the Earth's crust that is subject to soil formation processes (or [[pedosphere]]).<ref>[http://soil.gsfc.nasa.gov/ped/pedosph.htm Elissa Levine, 2001, The Pedosphere As A Hub] broken link? {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030004610/http://soil.gsfc.nasa.gov/ped/pedosph.htm |date=October 30, 2007 }}</ref> Major subdisciplines include [[edaphology]] and [[Pedology (soil study)|pedology]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~doetqp-p/courses/env320/lec1/Lec1.html|title=Duane Gardiner, Lecture: Why Study Soils? excerpted from Miller, R.W. & D.T.

This field of study differentiates the study of the Earth, from the study of other planets in the [[Solar System]]; the Earth being the only planet teeming with life.\n* [[Hydrology]], [[Oceanography]] and [[Limnology]] are a study revolved around the movement, distribution, and quality of the water and involves all the components of the hydrologic cycle on the earth and its atmosphere (or [[hydrosphere]]). \"Sub-disciplines of hydrology include hydrometeorology, surface water hydrology, hydrogeology, watershed science, forest hydrology, and water chemistry.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flatheadwatershed.org/watershed/hydrology.shtml|title=Hydrology of the Watershed|last=Craig|first=Kendall|authorlink=Craig N. Kendall}}</ref>\n* [[Glaciology]] covers the [[ice|icy]] parts of the Earth (or [[cryosphere]]).\n* [[Atmospheric sciences]] cover the [[gas]]eous parts of the Earth (or [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]) between the surface and the [[exosphere]] (about 1000&nbsp;km). Major subdisciplines include meteorology, climatology, [[atmospheric chemistry]], and [[atmospheric physics]].\n\n== Earth's interior ==\n[[File:Volcano q.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[volcanic]] eruption is the release of stored energy from below the surface of Earth.<!---originating from radioactive decay and season gravitational sorting in Earth's core and mantle, and residual energy gained during the Earth's formation---><ref>Encyclopedia of Volcanoes, Academic Press, London, 2000</ref>]]\n\n[[Plate tectonics]], [[mountain]] ranges, [[volcano]]es, and [[earthquake]]s are [[geology|geological phenomena]] that can be explained in terms of physical and chemical processes in the [[Earth's crust]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html|title=Earth's Energy Budget|work=ou.edu}}</ref>\n\n<!-- A diagram is needed here. -->\nBeneath the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] lies the [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] which is heated by the [[radioactive decay]] of [[heavy elements]]. The mantle is not quite solid and consists of [[magma]] which is in a state of semi-perpetual [[wikt:convection|convection]]. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as [[plate tectonics]].<ref>{{harvnb|Simison|2007|loc=paragraph 7}}</ref><ref name=\"adams tectonics\">{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|pp= 94–95, 100, 102}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|pp= 13–17, 218, G-6}}</ref><ref name=\"oldroyd tectonics\">{{harvnb|Oldroyd|2006|pp= 101,103,104}}</ref>\n\nPlate tectonics might be thought of as the process by which the Earth is resurfaced. As the result of [[seafloor spreading]], new crust and lithosphere is created by the flow of magma from the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] to the near surface, through fissures, where it cools and solidifies. Through  [[subduction]], oceanic crust and lithosphere returns to the convecting mantle.<ref name=\"adams tectonics\" /><ref name=\"oldroyd tectonics\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=327}}</ref>\n\nAreas of the crust where new crust is created are called ''divergent boundaries'', those where it is brought back into the Earth are ''convergent boundaries'' and those where plates slide past each other, but no new lithospheric material is created or destroyed, are referred to as [[transform fault|transform]] (or conservative) boundaries<ref name=\"adams tectonics\" /><ref name=\"oldroyd tectonics\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=331}}</ref> [[Earthquakes]] result from the movement of the lithospheric plates, and they often occur near convergent boundaries where parts of the crust are forced into the Earth as part of subduction.<ref name=\"smith subduction\">{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|pp= 325–26, 329}}</ref>\n\n<!-- A diagram is needed here. -->\n[[Volcanoes]] result primarily from the melting of subducted crust material.

In all, the atmosphere is made up of about 78.0% [[nitrogen]], 20.9% [[oxygen]], and 0.92% [[argon]]. 75% of the gases in the atmosphere are located within the troposphere, the bottom-most layer. The remaining one percent of the atmosphere (all but the nitrogen, oxygen, and argon) contains small amounts of other gases including CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapors.<ref name=\"adams atmosphere\">{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|pp= 107–08}}</ref> Water vapors and CO<sub>2</sub> allow the Earth's atmosphere to catch and hold the Sun's energy through a phenomenon called the [[greenhouse effect]].<ref>{{harvnb|American Heritage|p= 770}}</ref> This allows Earth's surface to be warm enough to have liquid water and support life. In addition to storing heat, the atmosphere also protects living organisms by shielding some of the Earth's surface from [[cosmic rays]]—of which are often incorrectly thought to be deflected by the [[magnetic field]]. <ref>{{Citation|last=Parker|first=Eugene|title=Shielding Space|publisher=Scientific American|date=March 2006 |url=https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/Shielding/docs/Parker_06.pdf}}</ref> The magnetic field—created by the internal motions of the core—produces the [[magnetosphere]] which protects the Earth's atmosphere from the [[solar wind]].<ref>{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|pp= 21–22}}</ref> As the Earth is [[Age of the earth|4.5 billion]] years old,<ref name=\"age earth\">{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=183}}</ref> it would have lost its atmosphere by now if there were no protective magnetosphere.\n\n== Earth's magnetic field ==\nAn [[electromagnet]] is a magnet that is created by an electric current.<ref>{{harvnb|American Heritage|p= 576}}</ref> The Earth has a solid iron [[Earth core|inner core]] surrounded by fluid [[outer core]] that convects;<ref name=\"oldroyd core\" /> therefore, the Earth is an [[electromagnet]].

Studies typically fall into one of three categories: observational, experimental, or theoretical. Earth scientists often conduct sophisticated computer analysis or go to many of the world's most exotic locations to study Earth phenomena (e.g. Antarctica or hot spot island chains).\n\nA foundational idea within the study Earth science is the notion of uniformitarianism. Uniformitarianism dictates that \"ancient geologic features are interpreted by understanding active processes that are readily observed.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In other words, any geologic processes at work in the present have operated in the same ways throughout geologic time. This enables those who study Earth's history to apply knowledge of how Earth processes operate in the present to gain insight into how the planet has evolved and changed throughout deep history.\n\n== Earth's spheres ==\n{{Nature timeline}}\nEarth science generally recognizes four spheres, the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]];<ref name=\"wheeling\">[http://www2.cet.edu/ete/hilk4/intro/spheres.html Earth's Spheres] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831022404/http://www2.cet.edu/ete/hilk4/intro/spheres.html |date=August 31, 2007 }}. ©1997–2000.
