If you think major changes should be made, please post your suggestions on the discussion page-->\n\nWhile the Noble Eightfold Path is best-known in the west, a wide variety of practices and stages have been used and described in the Buddhist traditions. Basic practices include ''sila'' (ethics), ''samadhi'' (meditation, ''dhyana'') and ''prajna'' (wisdom), as described in the Noble Eightfold Path. An important additional practice is a kind and compassionate attitude toward every living being and the world. [[Buddhist devotion|Devotion]] is also important in some Buddhist traditions, and in the Tibetan traditions visualizations of deities and mandalas are important. The value of textual study is regarded differently in the various Buddhist traditions. It is central to Theravada and highly important to Tibetan Buddhism, while the Zen tradition takes an ambiguous stance.\n\n===Refuge in the Three Jewels===\n[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|alt=stone footprint Gautama Buddha with Dharmachakra and Three Jewels|Relic depicting a footprint of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] with [[Dharmachakra]] and [[Three Jewels|triratna]], 1st century CE, [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]]]]\n{{Main article|Refuge (Buddhism)|Three Jewels}}\n\nTraditionally, the first step in most Buddhist schools requires taking Three Refuges, also called the Three Jewels ([[Sanskrit]]: ''triratna'', [[Pali]]: ''tiratana'') as the foundation of one's religious practice.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=249}} Pali texts employ the [[Hinduism|Brahmanical]] motif of the triple refuge, found in the ''[[Rigveda]]'' 9.97.47, ''Rigveda'' 6.46.9 and ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' 2.22.3–4.{{sfn|Shults|2014|p=108}} Tibetan Buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge, in the ''[[lama]]''. The three refuges are believed by Buddhists to be protective and a form of reverence.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=249}}\n\nThe Three Jewels are:{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=244–245}}\n*The [[Buddha]], the Gotama, the Blessed One, the Awakened with true knowledge\n*The [[Dharma]], the precepts, the practice, the Four Truths, the Eightfold Path\n*The [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], order of monks, the community of Buddha's disciples\n\nReciting the three refuges is considered in Buddhism not as a place to hide, rather a thought that purifies, uplifts and strengthens.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=244–245}}\n\n===The Buddhist path===\n\n====Theravada – Noble Eightfold Path====\n[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=ship's wheel with eight spokes represents the Noble Eightfold Path|The ''[[Dharmachakra]]'' represents the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].]]\n{{Main article|Noble Eightfold Path|Buddhist Paths to liberation}}\n\nAn important guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the [[Middle Way]] (''madhyamapratipad''). It was a part of Buddha's first sermon, where he presented the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] that was a 'middle way' between the extremes of asceticism and hedonistic sense pleasures.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=23, 81}}{{Sfn|Keown|1996|pp=24, 59}} In Buddhism, states Harvey, the doctrine of \"dependent arising\" (conditioned arising, ''pratītyasamutpāda'') to explain rebirth is viewed as the 'middle way' between the doctrines that a being has a \"permanent soul\" involved in rebirth (eternalism) and \"death is final and there is no rebirth\" (annihilationism).{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=72}}{{Sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2003|p=49, ''antagrahadrsti''}}\n\nIn the Theravada canon, the Pali-suttas, various often irreconcilable sequences can be found. According to Carol Anderson, the Theravada canon lacks \"an overriding and comprehensive structure of the path to ''nibbana''.\"{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=131}} Nevertheless, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], or \"Eightfold Path of the Noble Ones\", has become an important description of the Buddhist path. It consists of a set of eight interconnected factors or conditions, that when developed together, lead to the cessation of [[dukkha]].{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|pp=87-88}} These eight factors are: Right View (or Right Understanding), Right Intention (or Right Thought), Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.\n\nThis Eightfold Path is the fourth of the [[Four Noble Truths]], and asserts the path to the cessation of ''dukkha'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=81–83}}{{sfn|Anderson|2013|pp=64–65}} The path teaches that the way of the enlightened ones stopped their craving, clinging and [[karma|karmic]] accumulations, and thus ended their endless cycles of rebirth and suffering.{{Sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=253–255 }}{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|pp=1–13}}{{Sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2012|p=52}}\n\nThe Noble Eightfold Path is grouped into [[Three disciplines of Buddhism|three basic divisions]], as follows:{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=12–13}}{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=83–85}}{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|pp=47–48}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Their solution was to postulate a fundamental difference between the inner soul or self and the body. The inner self is unchangeable, and unaffected by actions. By insight into this difference, one was liberated. To equal this emphasis on insight, Buddhists presented insight into their most essential teaching as equally liberating. What exactly was regarded as the central insight \"varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha.\"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=54-55, 96, 99}}}}\n\nBronkhorst suggests that the conception of what exactly constituted \"liberating insight\" for Buddhists developed over time.

The ''[[Sutta Pitaka]]'' contains words attributed to the Buddha. The ''[[Abhidhamma|Abhidhamma Pitaka]]'' contain expositions and commentaries on the Sutta, and these vary significantly between Buddhist schools.\n\nThe Pāli Tipitaka is the only surviving early Tipitaka. According to some sources, some early schools of Buddhism had five or seven pitakas.{{sfn|Skilling|1992|p=114}} Much of the material in the Canon is not specifically \"Theravadin\", but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of teachings.

That path is explained as being built upon the motivation to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name ''Mahāyāna'' (lit., ''the Great Vehicle'').

Richard Gombrich states that the monastic assembly recitations of the Buddha's teaching likely began during Buddha's lifetime, similar to the First Council, that helped compose Buddhist scriptures.{{sfn|Williams|2005|pp=175–176}}\n\nThe [[Second Buddhist council]] resulted in the first schism in the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], probably caused by a group of reformists called Sthaviras who split from the conservative majority [[Mahāsāṃghika]]s.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=89–90}} After unsuccessfully trying to modify the [[Vinaya]], a small group of \"elderly members\", i.e. ''sthaviras'', broke away from the majority [[Mahāsāṃghika]] during the Second Buddhist council, giving rise to the Sthavira sect.<ref>Skilton, Andrew.

The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more [[stupa|stūpas]] (Buddhist religious memorials) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and into neighbouring lands such as Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of [[Sri Lanka]] south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia.\n\nThis period marks the first known spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts of Aśoka]], emissaries were sent to various countries west of India to spread Buddhism (Dharma), particularly in eastern provinces of the neighbouring [[Seleucid Empire]], and even farther to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] kingdoms of the Mediterranean.

This school played a critical role in the spreading of Buddhism to central Asia and China and eventually to other parts of the far east. Further, some of the earliest written documents of the Buddhist faith are the [[Gandharan Buddhist texts]], dating from about the 1st century CE, and connected to the Dharmaguptaka school. These texts are written in the Kharosthi script, a script that was predominantly used in the [[Greco-Bactrian]] and [[Indo-Greek]] kingdoms of northern India and that played a prominent role in the coinage and inscriptions of their kings.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 278\">Warder, A.K.

Speaking of Zen in general, Buddhist scholar Stephen Hodge writes: \"... practitioners of Zen believe that Enlightenment, the awakening of the Buddha-mind or Buddha-nature, is our natural state, but has been covered over by layers of negative emotions and distorted thoughts.
