Marcus|David Marcus]] who previously was in charge of [[Facebook Messenger|Messenger]]. According to [[The Verge]] Facebook is planning to launch its own [[cryptocurrency]] for facilitating payments on the platform<ref>https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/11/17344318/facebook-cryptocurrency-token-blockchain-report-david-marcus</ref>.\n\n==Types of blockchains==\nCurrently, there are three types of blockchain networks - public blockchains, private blockchains and [[consortium]] blockchains.\n\n===Public blockchains===\nA public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an [[internet]] connection can send [[Financial transaction|transactions]]{{dn|date=March 2018}} to it as well as become a [[validator]] (i.e., participate in the execution of a [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus protocol]]). <ref name=Perfectial>{{cite web|title= How Companies Can Leverage Private Blockchains to Improve Efficiency and Streamline Business Processes|url=https://perfectial.com/blog/leveraging-private-blockchains-improve-efficiency-streamline-business-processes/|website=Perfectial}}</ref>{{sps|date=April 2018}} Usually, such networks offer [[Incentive|economic incentives]] for those who secure them and utilize some type of a [[Proof-of-stake|Proof of Stake]] or [[Proof-of-work system|Proof of Work]] algorithm. \n\nSome of the largest, most known public blockchains are Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n===Private blockchains===\nA private blockchain is permissioned.<ref name=\"btit\"/> One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted.\n\nThis type of blockchains can be considered a middle-ground for companies that are interested in the blockchain technology in general but are not comfortable with a level of control offered by public networks. Typically, they seek to [[Incorporation (business)|incorporate]] blockchain into their accounting and record-keeping procedures without sacrificing autonomy and running the risk of exposing sensitive data to the public internet.\n\n===Consortium blockchains===\nA consortium blockchain is often said to be semi-decentralized. It, too, is permissioned but instead of a single [[organization]] controlling it, a number of companies might each operate a [[Node (networking)|node]] on such a network. The administrators of a consortium chain restrict users’ reading rights as they see fit and only allow a limited set of trusted nodes to execute a consensus protocol.\n\n==Academic research==\n[[File:BlockchainPanelDiscussionAtIEEETechIgnite2017.jpg|thumb|Blockchain panel discussion at the first [[IEEE Computer Society]] TechIgnite conference]]\n\nIn October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] access to $100 of bitcoin. The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Catalini|first=Christian|last2=Tucker|first2=Catherine E.|date=11 August 2016|title=Seeding the S-Curve?
