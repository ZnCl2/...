The classification and nature of various [[Doctrine|doctrinal]], [[Buddhist philosophy|philosophical]] or [[Culture|cultural]] facets of the schools of Buddhism is vague and has been interpreted in many different ways, often due to the sheer number (perhaps thousands) of different sects, subsects, movements, etc. that have made up or currently make up the whole of Buddhist traditions. The sectarian and conceptual divisions of Buddhist thought are part of the modern framework of [[Buddhist studies]], as well as [[comparative religion]] in [[Asia]].\n\nFrom a largely [[English-language]] standpoint, and to some extent in most of [[Western world|Western]] [[academia]], Buddhism is separated into two groups at its foundation: [[Theravada|Theravāda]], literally \"the Teaching of the Elders\" or \"the Ancient Teaching,\" and [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]], literally the \"Great Vehicle.\" The most common classification among scholars is threefold, with Mahāyāna itself split between the traditional Mahāyāna teachings, and the [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] teachings which emphasize esotericism.\n\n== Classifications ==\nThe ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Religion'' distinguishes three types of classification of Buddhism, separated into \"Movements\", \"Nikāyas\" and \"Doctrinal schools\":{{Clarify|date=March 2012}}\n\n* Schools:\n** [[Theravada]], ''primarily in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]].''\n** [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]], ''primarily in [[East Asia]].''\n** [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]], ''primarily in [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[Mongolia]] and the Russian republic of [[Kalmykia]].''\n* [[Nikāya]]s, or monastic fraternities, three of which survive at the present day:\n** [[Theravada|Theravāda]], in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]]\n** [[Dharmaguptaka]], in [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]\n** [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]], in the Tibetan tradition\n* Doctrinal schools\n**[[Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika_distinction|Svatantrika & Prasaṅgika]]\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe terminology for the major divisions of Buddhism can be confusing, as Buddhism is variously divided by scholars and practitioners according to geographic, historical, and philosophical criteria, with different terms often being used in different contexts. The following terms may be encountered in descriptions of the major Buddhist divisions:\n\n; \"Conservative Buddhism\": an alternative name for the early Buddhist schools.\n; \"[[Early Buddhist schools]]\": the schools into which Buddhism became divided in its first few centuries; only one of these survives as an independent school, Theravāda\n; \"[[East Asian Buddhism]]\": a term used by scholars<ref>B & G, Gethin, R & J, P & K</ref> to cover the Buddhist traditions of Japan, Korea, and most of China and Southeast Asia\n; \"Eastern Buddhism\": an alternative name used by some scholars<ref name=\"Penguin, Harvey\">Penguin, Harvey</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} for East Asian Buddhism; also sometimes used to refer to all traditional forms of Buddhism, as distinct from Western(ized) forms.\n; \"[[Ekayāna]] (one yana): Mahayana texts such as the Lotus Sutra and the Avatamsaka Sutra sought to unite all the different teachings into a single great way. These texts serve as the inspiration for using the term Ekayāna in the sense of \"one vehicle\". This \"one vehicle\" became a key aspect of the doctrines and practices of Tiantai and Tendai Buddhist sects, which subsequently influenced Chán and Zen doctrines and practices. In Japan, the one-vehicle teaching of the Lotus Sutra also inspired the formation of the Nichiren sect.\n; \"Esoteric Buddhism\": usually considered synonymous with \"Vajrayāna\".<ref>''Encyclopedia of Religion'', Macmillan, New York, volume 2, page 440</ref> Some scholars have applied the term to certain practices found within the Theravāda, particularly in Cambodia.<ref>''Indian Insights'', Luzac, London, 1997</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}\n; \"Hīnayāna\": literally meaning \"lesser vehicle.\" It is considered a controversial term when applied by the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] to mistakenly refer to the Theravāda school, and as such is widely viewed as condescending and pejorative.<ref>\"Hinayana (literally, 'inferior way') is a polemical term, which self-described Mahāyāna (literally, 'great way') Buddhist literature uses to denigrate its opponents\", p. 840, ''MacMillan Library Reference Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', 2004</ref> Moreover, Hīnayāna refers to the now non extant schools with limited set of views, practices and results, prior to the development of the Mahāyāna traditions. The term is currently most often used as a way of describing a stage on the path in Tibetan Buddhism, but is often mistakenly confused with the contemporary Theravāda tradition, which is far more complex, diversified and profound, than the literal and limiting definition attributed to Hīnayāna .<ref>Ray, Reginald A (2000) ''Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism,'' p.240</ref> Its use in scholarly publications is now also considered controversial.<ref>\"The supposed Mahayana-Hinayana dichotomy is so prevalent in Buddhist literature that it has yet fully to loosen its hold over scholarly representations of the religion\", p. 840, MacMillan Library Reference Encyclopedia of Buddhism, 2004</ref>\n\n; \"Lamaism\": an old term, still sometimes used, synonymous with Tibetan Buddhism; widely considered derogatory.\n; \"[[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]]\": a movement that emerged from [[early Buddhist schools]], together with its later descendants, East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism.  Vajrayāna traditions are sometimes listed separately. The main use of the term in East Asian and Tibetan traditions is in reference to spiritual levels,<ref name=\"Penguin Handbook\">'</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} regardless of school.\n; \"Mainstream Buddhism\": a term used by some scholars for the early Buddhist schools.\n; \"Mantrayāna\": usually considered synonymous with \"Vajrayāna\".<ref name=\"Harvey, pages 153ff\">Harvey, pages 153ff</ref> The [[Tendai]] school in Japan has been described as influenced by Mantrayana.<ref name=\"Penguin Handbook\"/>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}\n;\"[[Newar Buddhism]]\": a non-monastic, caste based Buddhism with patrilineal descent and Sanskrit texts.\n; \"[[Nikaya Buddhism|Nikāya Buddhism]]\" or \"schools\": an alternative term for the early Buddhist schools.\n; \"Non-Mahāyāna\": an alternative term for the early Buddhist schools.\n; \"Northern Buddhism\": an alternative term used by some scholars<ref name=\"Penguin, Harvey\"/>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} for Tibetan Buddhism. Also, an older term still sometimes used to encompass both East Asian and Tibetan traditions. It has even been used to refer to East Asian Buddhism alone, without Tibetan Buddhism.\n; \"Secret Mantra\": an alternative rendering of Mantrayāna, a more literal translation of the term used by schools in Tibetan Buddhism when referring to themselves.<ref>Hopkins, Jeffrey (1985) ''The Ultimate Deity in Action Tantra and Jung's Warning against Identifying with the Deity'' Buddhist-Christian Studies, Vol. 5, (1985), pp. 159–172</ref>\n; \"Sectarian Buddhism\": an alternative name for the early Buddhist schools.\n; \"Southeast Asian Buddhism\": an alternative name used by some scholars<ref>R & J, P & K</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} for Theravāda.\n; \"Southern Buddhism\": an alternative name used by some scholars<ref name=\"Penguin, Harvey\"/>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} for Theravāda.\n; \"Śravakayāna\": an alternative term sometimes used for the early Buddhist schools.\n; \"Tantrayāna\" or \"Tantric Buddhism\": usually considered synonymous with \"Vajrayāna\".<ref name=\"Harvey, pages 153ff\"/> However, one scholar describes the tantra divisions of some editions of the [[Kangyur|Tibetan scriptures]] as including Śravakayāna, Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna texts<ref>Skilling, ''Mahasutras'', volume II, Parts I & II, 1997, Pali Text Society, Lancaster, page 78</ref> (see [[Buddhist texts]]).

It is the only surviving representative of the historical [[early Buddhist schools]].  The term \"Theravāda\" is also sometimes used to refer to all the early Buddhist schools.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Religion'', volume 2, Macmillan, New York, 1987, pages 440f; ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', sv Buddhism</ref>\n; \"[[Tibetan Buddhism]]\": usually understood as including the Buddhism of Tibet, Mongolia, Bhutan and parts of China, India and Russia, which follow the Tibetan tradition.\n; \"[[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]]\": a movement that developed out of Indian Mahāyāna, together with its later descendants.   There is some disagreement on exactly which traditions fall into this category.  Tibetan Buddhism is universally recognized as falling under this heading; many also include the Japanese [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] school. Some scholars<ref>Harvey</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} also apply the term to the Korean milgyo tradition, which is not a separate school. One scholar says, \"Despite the efforts of generations of Buddhist thinkers, it remains exceedingly difficult to identify precisely what it is that sets the Vajrayana apart.\"<ref>Lopez, ''Buddhism in Practice'', Princeton University Press, 1995, page 6</ref>\n\n== Early schools ==\n[[File:SectarianBuddhistschools.png|thumb|right|upright|Map of the major geographical centers of [[Early Buddhist schools|Sectarian Buddhist schools]] in India.
