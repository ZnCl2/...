W. ''Roots, Verb-forms and Primary Derivatives of the Sanskrit Language''</ref> cf. ''arha'' \"meriting, deserving\"; ''arhaṇa'' \"having a claim, being entitled\"; ''arhita'' (past participle) \"honoured, worshipped\".<ref>''Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary''</ref> The word is used in the ''Ṛgveda'' with this sense of \"deserving\".<ref>RV 1.4.47, 2.5.51</ref>\n\nA common folk etymology derives the word from ''ari'' (enemy) and ''hanta'' from the root √'''''han''''' (cf: Hunter) \"to strike, to kill\"; hence the translation \"foe-destroyer\". Professor Richard Gombrich has argued that the present participle is \"jarring\" and seems out of place when there is an adjective from the same root (''arha''). Since Jains used two Prakrit forms of the word ''arahanta'' and ''arihanta'', the folk etymology may well be the correct etymology. Gombrich argues that this stems from the same metaphor as the Jain title ''jina'' \"conqueror\", whence ''jaina'' \"related to the conqueror\", i.e. Jainism.<ref>Richard Gombrich, 2009, ''What the Buddha Thought'', Equinox: London, pp. 57–58.</ref>\n\n===Translations===\nThe term ''arhat'' is often rendered in English as ''arahat''.\n\nThe term ''arhat'' was transliterated into some East Asian languages phonetically, for example, the Chinese ''āluóhàn'' (Ch. 阿羅漢), often shortened to simply ''luóhàn'' (Ch. 羅漢).  This may appear in English as ''luohan'' or ''lohan''.  In Japanese the pronunciation of the same Chinese characters is ''rakan'' (Ja. 羅漢) or ''arakan'' (Ja. 阿羅漢).\n\nThe [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] term for ''arhat'' was translated by meaning from Sanskrit. This translation, ''dgra bcom pa'', means \"one who has destroyed the foes of afflictions\".<ref>Cozort, Daniel. ''Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School''. Snow Lion Publications. 1998. p. 259.</ref> Thus the Tibetan translators also understood the meaning of ''arhat'' to be ''ari-hanta''.\n\n==Attainments==\nA range of views on the attainment of arhats existed in the [[early Buddhist schools]].  The Sarvāstivāda, Kāśyapīya, Mahāsāṃghika, Ekavyāvahārika, Lokottaravāda, Bahuśrutīya, Prajñaptivāda and Caitika schools all regarded arhats as being imperfect in their attainments compared to [[buddhahood|buddhas]].<ref name=\"Sree Padma 2008. p. 44\"/><ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277\"/><ref name=\"Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 446\">Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. 2008. p. 446</ref>\n\nThe [[Dharmaguptaka]] sect believed that \"the Buddha and those of the [[Yana (Buddhism)|Two Vehicles]], although they have one and the same liberation, have followed different noble paths.\"<ref>《異部宗輪論述記》：謂佛雖在僧中所攝，然別施佛果大，非僧（果大）。於窣堵波興供養業獲廣大果。佛與二乘解脫雖一，而聖道異。無諸外道能得五通。阿羅漢身皆是無漏。餘義多同大眾部執。</ref>\n\nThe [[Mahīśāsaka]] and the [[Theravada]] regarded arhats and buddhas as being similar to one another. The 5th century Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] regarded arhats as having completed the path to enlightenment.{{refn|group=note|Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism: \"When the great ''Theravada'' commentator, [[Buddhaghosa]], wrote the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' delineating the nature of the gradual path to enlightenment, he placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of that path. The ''arahant'' stands as a transcendent figure in ''Theravada'', one who has followed to its end the way of ''Dharma'' set out by the Buddha.\"<ref>Charles Prebish and [[Damien Keown]] (2007), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', pp 36</ref>}} According to [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the [[Pāli Canon]] portrays the Buddha declaring himself to be an arahant.<ref name=\"BB\">Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''Arahants, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas''</ref>{{refn|group=note|Bhikkhu Bodhi: \"The Buddha is the first of the arahants, while those who reach the goal by following his path also become arahants. In the verse of homage to the Buddha, it is said: \"Iti pi so Bhagavā Arahaṃ... — The Blessed One is an arahant...\" Shortly after his enlightenment, while walking to Benares to meet the five monks, a wanderer stopped the Buddha and asked who he was. The Buddha replied: \"I am the arahant in the world, I am the supreme teacher\" (MN 26/I 171). So the Buddha first of all declares himself to be an arahant.\"<ref name=\"BB\" />}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''nirvāṇa'' is \"the ultimate goal\", and one who has attained nirvana has attained arahantship:{{refn|group=note|\"From the perspective of the Nikāyas, the ultimate goal – the goal in strict doctrinal terms – is nirvāṇa, and the goal in human terms is arahantship, the state of a person who has attained nirvāṇa in this present life.\"<ref name=\"BB\" />}} Bhikkhu Bodhi writes, \"The defining mark of an arahant is the attainment of nirvāṇa in this present life.\"<ref name=\"BB\" />\n\nThe Mahayana discerned a hierarchy of attainments, with ''samyaksambuddha''s at the top, [[mahāsattva]]s below that, [[pratyekabuddha]]s below that and arhats further below.<ref>Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. pp. 119-120</ref> \"But what was it that distinguished the ''bodhisattva'' from the ''sravaka'', and ultimately the ''buddha'' from the ''arhat''? The difference lay, more than anywhere else, in the altruistic orientation of the ''bodhisattva''.\"{{sfn|prebish|Keown|2004|page=88}}\n\n==Meaning of Arhat==\n===In the early Buddhist schools===\nIn pre-Buddhist India, the term arhat, denoting a saintly person in general, was closely associated with miraculous power and asceticism. The Buddhists drew a sharp distinction between their Arhat and Indian holy men in general, in Buddhism these miraculous powers were no longer central to arhat identity or to his mission.<ref>Richard Kieckhefer, George D. Bond. \"Sainthood: Its Manifestations in World Religions\" 1988. pp. 159-160</ref>\n\nA range of views on the relative perfection of arhats existed amongst the early Buddhist schools. In general, Mahāsāṃghikas such as the Ekavyāvahārikas, Lokottaravādins,<ref name=\"Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 446\"/> Bahuśrutīyins,<ref>Walser, Joseph. ''Nāgārjuna in Context: Mahāyāna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture''. 2005. p. 218</ref> Prajñaptivādins, and Caitikas<ref name=\"Sree Padma 2008. p. 44\"/> schools, advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas and the fallibility of arhats.<ref>Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. 2008. p. 48</ref> The Caitikas, for example, advocated the ideal of the bodhisattva (''bodhisattvayāna'') over that of the arhat (''[[śrāvakayāna]]''), and they viewed arhats as being fallible and still subject to ignorance.<ref name=\"Sree Padma 2008. p. 44\"/>\n\nAccording to [[A.K. Warder]], the Sarvāstivādins held the same position as the Mahāsāṃghika branch regarding arhats, considering them to be imperfect and fallible.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277\"/> In the Sarvāstivādin ''Nāgadatta Sūtra'', the demon [[Mara (demon)|Māra]] takes the form of Nāgadatta's father, and tries to convince Nāgadatta, who was a [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī,]] to work toward the lower stage of arhatship rather than striving to become a fully enlightened buddha (samyaksaṃbuddha).\n{{quote|Māra therefore took the disguise of Nāgadatta's father and said thus to Nāgadatta: \"Your thought is too serious. [[Buddhahood]] is too difficult to attain. It takes a hundred thousand nayutas of [[crore|koṭi]]s of [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]s to become a Buddha. Since few people attain Buddhahood in this world, why don't you attain Arhatship? For the experience of Arhatship is the same as that of [[nirvana|nirvāṇa]]; moreover, it is easy to attain Arhatship.<ref name=\"Kalupahana, David 2001. p. 109\">Kalupahana, David. ''Buddhist Thought and Ritual''. 2001. p. 109</ref>}}\nIn her reply, Nāgadatta rejects arhatship as a lower path, saying, \"A Buddha's wisdom is like empty space of the ten-quarters, which can enlighten innumerable people. But an Arhat's wisdom is inferior.\"<ref name=\"Kalupahana, David 2001. p. 109\"/>\n\nThe Kāśyapīya school also held the doctrine that arhats were fallible and imperfect, similar to the view of the Sarvāstivādins and the various Mahāsāṃghika sects.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277\"/> The Kāśyapīyins believed that arhats have not fully eliminated desires, that their \"perfection\" is incomplete, and that it is possible for them to relapse.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277\"/>\n\n===In Theravāda Buddhism===\nIn [[Theravada]] Buddhism, an arahant is a person who has eliminated all the unwholesome roots which underlie [[Samyojana|the fetters]] – who upon their death will not be reborn in any world, since the bonds (fetters) that bind a person to the [[samsara]] have been finally dissolved. In the [[Pali Canon]], the word ''[[tathagata]]'' is sometimes used as a synonym for arahant, though the former usually refers to the Buddha alone.{{refn|group=note|Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind''. Curzon Press 1995, p. 227: {{quote|Before focusing on key passages on the tathagata, it is first necessary to clarify which persons the word refers to. The Buddha often used it when talking of himself as an enlightened being, rather than as the individual Gotama. In general, \"tathagata\" is used specifically of the Buddha, the one who discovers and proclaims the path to nibbana (A.II.8–9, S.III.65-6), with the \"tathagata, Arahat, perfectly and completely enlighteneed one\" being contrasted with a \"disciple of the tathagata\" (D.II.142). Nevertheless, \"tathagata\" is sometimes used of any Arahat. S.V.327, for example, discusses the \"dwelling of a learner\" and that of a tathagata, and explains the second by describing the qualities of an Arahat. At M.I.139–140 and 486-7, moreover, there is a switching between talk of a \"tathagata\" and of \"a monk whose mind is freed thus\", as if they were simple equivalents. Tathagata literally means \"thus-gone\" or \"thus-come\", probably meaning one who is \"attained-to-truth\" or \"whose-nature-is-from-truth\".}}}}\n\nAfter attainment of Nibbana, the [[five aggregates]] (physical forms, feelings/sensations, perception, mental formations and consciousness) will continue to function, sustained by physical bodily vitality. This attainment is termed ''the nibbana element with a residue remaining''.  But once the Arahant pass-away and with the disintegration of the physical body, the five aggregates will cease to function, hence ending all traces of existence in the phenomenal world and thus total release from the misery of samsara. It would then be termed ''the nibbana element without residue remaining''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html|title=Transcendental Dependent Arising|accessdate=16 March 2009|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090330082958/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html| archivedate= 30 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Parinibbana occurs at the death of an Arahant.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism the Buddha himself is first identified as an arahant, as are his enlightened followers, because they are free from all defilements, without greed, [[hatred]], [[Avidya (Buddhism)|delusion]], [[Avidya (Buddhism)|ignorance]] and [[tanha|craving]]. Lacking \"assets\" which will lead to future birth, the arahant knows and sees the real here and now.

''Buddhist Images of Human Perfection''. 1982. p. 280</ref>\n\n{{quote|While in the ''Sutta Piṭaka'', ''arhattā'' was open to all, both in principle and in fact, there was a growing tendency among later Theravāda ''saṅghikas'' to restrict ''arhattā'' to those wearing the robe.

Anagamis will not be reborn into the human world after death, but into the heaven of the [[Pure Abodes]], where only anagamis live. There, they will attain full enlightenment.\n\nThe Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of the path to liberation.{{refn|group=note|Keown and Prebish (2007), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', p. 36: \"When the great ''Theravada'' commentator, [[Buddhaghosa]], wrote the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' delineating the nature of the gradual path to enlightenment, he placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of that path.

A hierarchy of general attainments is envisioned with the attainments of arhats and pratyekabuddhas being clearly separate and below that of samyaksambuddha or [[tathāgata]]s such as Gautama Buddha.<ref name=\"Williams, Paul 2004. p. 119\">Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. p. 119</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the goal of becoming a fully enlightened buddha, the path of a śrāvaka in being motivated by seeking personal liberation from saṃsāra is often portrayed as selfish and undesirable.<ref>Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. Sarup & Son. 2008. p. 192</ref> There are even some Mahāyāna texts that regard the aspiration to arhatship and personal liberation as an outside path.<ref>Sheng Yen. ''Orthodox Chinese Buddhism''.

If they fail to do so in the lifetime in which they reach the attainment, they will fall into a deep [[samadhi|samādhi]] of emptiness, thence to be roused and taught the bodhisattva path, presumably when ready. According to the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', any true arhat will eventually accept the Mahāyāna path.<ref>Sheng Yen. ''Orthodox Chinese Buddhism''. North Atlantic Books. 2007. p. 163.</ref>\n\nMahāyāna teachings often consider the śrāvaka path to be motivated by fear of saṃsāra, which renders them incapable of aspiring to buddhahood, and that they therefore lack the courage and wisdom of a bodhisattva.<ref name=\"Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120\">Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. p. 120</ref> Novice bodhisattvas are compared to śrāvakas and arhats at times. In the ''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}'', there is an account of sixty novice bodhisattvas who attain arhatship despite themselves and their efforts at the bodhisattva path because they lacked the abilities of [[prajnaparamita]] and [[skillful means]] to progress as bodhisattvas toward complete enlightenment (Skt. ''{{IAST|Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi}}''). This is because they are still viewed as having innate attachment and fear of saṃsāra. The ''[[Prajnaparamita#A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81 Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81|{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}]]'' compares these people to a giant bird without wings that cannot help but plummet to the earth from the top of [[Sumeru]].<ref name=\"Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120\"/>\n\nMahayan Buddhism has viewed the śrāvaka path culminating in arhatship as a lesser accomplishment than complete enlightenment, but still accords due respect to arhats for their respective achievements. Therefore, buddha-realms are depicted as populated by both śrāvakas and bodhisattvas.<ref name=\"Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120\"/> Far from being completely disregarded, the accomplishments of arhats are viewed as impressive, essentially because they have transcended the mundane world.<ref>Powers, John. ''A Concise Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism''. Snow Lion Publications. 2008. p. 36.</ref> [[Chinese Buddhism]] and other East Asian traditions have historically accepted this perspective, and specific groups of arhats are venerated as well, such as the [[Sixteen Arhats]], the [[Eighteen Arhats]], and the Five Hundred Arhats.<ref>Leidy, Denise. ''The Art of Buddhism: An Introduction to Its History and Meaning''. Shambhala. 2009. p. 196</ref> The first famous portraits of these arhats were painted by the Chinese monk [[Guanxiu]] ({{zh|c=貫休|p=''Guànxiū''}}) in 891 CE.

However, a distinctive difference is seen in the Mahāyāna doctrine pushing emotional and cognitive non-attachment to their logical consequences. Of this, Paul Williams writes that in Mahāyāna Buddhism, \"Nirvāṇa must be sought without being sought (for oneself), and practice must be done without being practiced.

W. ''Roots, Verb-forms and Primary Derivatives of the Sanskrit Language''</ref> cf. ''arha'' \"meriting, deserving\"; ''arhaṇa'' \"having a claim, being entitled\"; ''arhita'' (past participle) \"honoured, worshipped\".<ref>''Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary''</ref> The word is used in the ''Ṛgveda'' with this sense of \"deserving\".<ref>RV 1.4.47, 2.5.51</ref>\n\nA common folk etymology derives the word from ''ari'' (enemy) and ''hanta'' from the root √'''''han''''' (cf: Hunter) \"to strike, to kill\"; hence the translation \"foe-destroyer\". Professor Richard Gombrich has argued that the present participle is \"jarring\" and seems out of place when there is an adjective from the same root (''arha''). Since Jains used two Prakrit forms of the word ''arahanta'' and ''arihanta'', the folk etymology may well be the correct etymology. Gombrich argues that this stems from the same metaphor as the Jain title ''jina'' \"conqueror\", whence ''jaina'' \"related to the conqueror\", i.e. Jainism.<ref>Richard Gombrich, 2009, ''What the Buddha Thought'', Equinox: London, pp. 57–58.</ref>\n\n===Translations===\nThe term ''arhat'' is often rendered in English as ''arahat''.\n\nThe term ''arhat'' was transliterated into some East Asian languages phonetically, for example, the Chinese ''āluóhàn'' (Ch. 阿羅漢), often shortened to simply ''luóhàn'' (Ch. 羅漢).  This may appear in English as ''luohan'' or ''lohan''.  In Japanese the pronunciation of the same Chinese characters is ''rakan'' (Ja. 羅漢) or ''arakan'' (Ja. 阿羅漢).\n\nThe [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] term for ''arhat'' was translated by meaning from Sanskrit. This translation, ''dgra bcom pa'', means \"one who has destroyed the foes of afflictions\".<ref>Cozort, Daniel. ''Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School''. Snow Lion Publications. 1998. p. 259.</ref> Thus the Tibetan translators also understood the meaning of ''arhat'' to be ''ari-hanta''.\n\n==Attainments==\nA range of views on the attainment of arhats existed in the [[early Buddhist schools]].  The Sarvāstivāda, Kāśyapīya, Mahāsāṃghika, Ekavyāvahārika, Lokottaravāda, Bahuśrutīya, Prajñaptivāda and Caitika schools all regarded arhats as being imperfect in their attainments compared to [[buddhahood|buddhas]].<ref name=\"Sree Padma 2008. p. 44\"/><ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277\"/><ref name=\"Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 446\">Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. 2008. p. 446</ref>\n\nThe [[Dharmaguptaka]] sect believed that \"the Buddha and those of the [[Yana (Buddhism)|Two Vehicles]], although they have one and the same liberation, have followed different noble paths.\"<ref>《異部宗輪論述記》：謂佛雖在僧中所攝，然別施佛果大，非僧（果大）。於窣堵波興供養業獲廣大果。佛與二乘解脫雖一，而聖道異。無諸外道能得五通。阿羅漢身皆是無漏。餘義多同大眾部執。</ref>\n\nThe [[Mahīśāsaka]] and the [[Theravada]] regarded arhats and buddhas as being similar to one another. The 5th century Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] regarded arhats as having completed the path to enlightenment.{{refn|group=note|Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism: \"When the great ''Theravada'' commentator, [[Buddhaghosa]], wrote the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' delineating the nature of the gradual path to enlightenment, he placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of that path.

In the verse of homage to the Buddha, it is said: \"Iti pi so Bhagavā Arahaṃ... — The Blessed One is an arahant...\" Shortly after his enlightenment, while walking to Benares to meet the five monks, a wanderer stopped the Buddha and asked who he was. The Buddha replied: \"I am the arahant in the world, I am the supreme teacher\" (MN 26/I 171). So the Buddha first of all declares himself to be an arahant.\"<ref name=\"BB\" />}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''nirvāṇa'' is \"the ultimate goal\", and one who has attained nirvana has attained arahantship:{{refn|group=note|\"From the perspective of the Nikāyas, the ultimate goal – the goal in strict doctrinal terms – is nirvāṇa, and the goal in human terms is arahantship, the state of a person who has attained nirvāṇa in this present life.\"<ref name=\"BB\" />}} Bhikkhu Bodhi writes, \"The defining mark of an arahant is the attainment of nirvāṇa in this present life.\"<ref name=\"BB\" />\n\nThe Mahayana discerned a hierarchy of attainments, with ''samyaksambuddha''s at the top, [[mahāsattva]]s below that, [[pratyekabuddha]]s below that and arhats further below.<ref>Williams, Paul.

Routledge. 2004. pp. 119-120</ref> \"But what was it that distinguished the ''bodhisattva'' from the ''sravaka'', and ultimately the ''buddha'' from the ''arhat''? The difference lay, more than anywhere else, in the altruistic orientation of the ''bodhisattva''.\"{{sfn|prebish|Keown|2004|page=88}}\n\n==Meaning of Arhat==\n===In the early Buddhist schools===\nIn pre-Buddhist India, the term arhat, denoting a saintly person in general, was closely associated with miraculous power and asceticism. The Buddhists drew a sharp distinction between their Arhat and Indian holy men in general, in Buddhism these miraculous powers were no longer central to arhat identity or to his mission.<ref>Richard Kieckhefer, George D. Bond. \"Sainthood: Its Manifestations in World Religions\" 1988. pp. 159-160</ref>\n\nA range of views on the relative perfection of arhats existed amongst the early Buddhist schools. In general, Mahāsāṃghikas such as the Ekavyāvahārikas, Lokottaravādins,<ref name=\"Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 446\"/> Bahuśrutīyins,<ref>Walser, Joseph. ''Nāgārjuna in Context: Mahāyāna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture''. 2005. p. 218</ref> Prajñaptivādins, and Caitikas<ref name=\"Sree Padma 2008. p. 44\"/> schools, advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas and the fallibility of arhats.<ref>Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. 2008. p. 48</ref> The Caitikas, for example, advocated the ideal of the bodhisattva (''bodhisattvayāna'') over that of the arhat (''[[śrāvakayāna]]''), and they viewed arhats as being fallible and still subject to ignorance.<ref name=\"Sree Padma 2008. p. 44\"/>\n\nAccording to [[A.K. Warder]], the Sarvāstivādins held the same position as the Mahāsāṃghika branch regarding arhats, considering them to be imperfect and fallible.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277\"/> In the Sarvāstivādin ''Nāgadatta Sūtra'', the demon [[Mara (demon)|Māra]] takes the form of Nāgadatta's father, and tries to convince Nāgadatta, who was a [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī,]] to work toward the lower stage of arhatship rather than striving to become a fully enlightened buddha (samyaksaṃbuddha).\n{{quote|Māra therefore took the disguise of Nāgadatta's father and said thus to Nāgadatta: \"Your thought is too serious. [[Buddhahood]] is too difficult to attain. It takes a hundred thousand nayutas of [[crore|koṭi]]s of [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]s to become a Buddha. Since few people attain Buddhahood in this world, why don't you attain Arhatship? For the experience of Arhatship is the same as that of [[nirvana|nirvāṇa]]; moreover, it is easy to attain Arhatship.<ref name=\"Kalupahana, David 2001. p. 109\">Kalupahana, David. ''Buddhist Thought and Ritual''. 2001. p. 109</ref>}}\nIn her reply, Nāgadatta rejects arhatship as a lower path, saying, \"A Buddha's wisdom is like empty space of the ten-quarters, which can enlighten innumerable people. But an Arhat's wisdom is inferior.\"<ref name=\"Kalupahana, David 2001. p. 109\"/>\n\nThe Kāśyapīya school also held the doctrine that arhats were fallible and imperfect, similar to the view of the Sarvāstivādins and the various Mahāsāṃghika sects.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277\"/> The Kāśyapīyins believed that arhats have not fully eliminated desires, that their \"perfection\" is incomplete, and that it is possible for them to relapse.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277\"/>\n\n===In Theravāda Buddhism===\nIn [[Theravada]] Buddhism, an arahant is a person who has eliminated all the unwholesome roots which underlie [[Samyojana|the fetters]] – who upon their death will not be reborn in any world, since the bonds (fetters) that bind a person to the [[samsara]] have been finally dissolved. In the [[Pali Canon]], the word ''[[tathagata]]'' is sometimes used as a synonym for arahant, though the former usually refers to the Buddha alone.{{refn|group=note|Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind''. Curzon Press 1995, p. 227: {{quote|Before focusing on key passages on the tathagata, it is first necessary to clarify which persons the word refers to. The Buddha often used it when talking of himself as an enlightened being, rather than as the individual Gotama. In general, \"tathagata\" is used specifically of the Buddha, the one who discovers and proclaims the path to nibbana (A.II.8–9, S.III.65-6), with the \"tathagata, Arahat, perfectly and completely enlighteneed one\" being contrasted with a \"disciple of the tathagata\" (D.II.142). Nevertheless, \"tathagata\" is sometimes used of any Arahat. S.V.327, for example, discusses the \"dwelling of a learner\" and that of a tathagata, and explains the second by describing the qualities of an Arahat. At M.I.139–140 and 486-7, moreover, there is a switching between talk of a \"tathagata\" and of \"a monk whose mind is freed thus\", as if they were simple equivalents. Tathagata literally means \"thus-gone\" or \"thus-come\", probably meaning one who is \"attained-to-truth\" or \"whose-nature-is-from-truth\".}}}}\n\nAfter attainment of Nibbana, the [[five aggregates]] (physical forms, feelings/sensations, perception, mental formations and consciousness) will continue to function, sustained by physical bodily vitality. This attainment is termed ''the nibbana element with a residue remaining''.  But once the Arahant pass-away and with the disintegration of the physical body, the five aggregates will cease to function, hence ending all traces of existence in the phenomenal world and thus total release from the misery of samsara. It would then be termed ''the nibbana element without residue remaining''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html|title=Transcendental Dependent Arising|accessdate=16 March 2009|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090330082958/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html| archivedate= 30 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Parinibbana occurs at the death of an Arahant.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism the Buddha himself is first identified as an arahant, as are his enlightened followers, because they are free from all defilements, without greed, [[hatred]], [[Avidya (Buddhism)|delusion]], [[Avidya (Buddhism)|ignorance]] and [[tanha|craving]]. Lacking \"assets\" which will lead to future birth, the arahant knows and sees the real here and now.

''Buddhist Images of Human Perfection''. 1982. p. 280</ref>\n\n{{quote|While in the ''Sutta Piṭaka'', ''arhattā'' was open to all, both in principle and in fact, there was a growing tendency among later Theravāda ''saṅghikas'' to restrict ''arhattā'' to those wearing the robe.

Anagamis will not be reborn into the human world after death, but into the heaven of the [[Pure Abodes]], where only anagamis live. There, they will attain full enlightenment.\n\nThe Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of the path to liberation.{{refn|group=note|Keown and Prebish (2007), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', p. 36: \"When the great ''Theravada'' commentator, [[Buddhaghosa]], wrote the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' delineating the nature of the gradual path to enlightenment, he placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of that path.

''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. p. 119</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the goal of becoming a fully enlightened buddha, the path of a śrāvaka in being motivated by seeking personal liberation from saṃsāra is often portrayed as selfish and undesirable.<ref>Baruah, Bibhuti.

Sarup & Son. 2008. p. 192</ref> There are even some Mahāyāna texts that regard the aspiration to arhatship and personal liberation as an outside path.<ref>Sheng Yen. ''Orthodox Chinese Buddhism''.

If they fail to do so in the lifetime in which they reach the attainment, they will fall into a deep [[samadhi|samādhi]] of emptiness, thence to be roused and taught the bodhisattva path, presumably when ready. According to the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', any true arhat will eventually accept the Mahāyāna path.<ref>Sheng Yen. ''Orthodox Chinese Buddhism''. North Atlantic Books. 2007. p. 163.</ref>\n\nMahāyāna teachings often consider the śrāvaka path to be motivated by fear of saṃsāra, which renders them incapable of aspiring to buddhahood, and that they therefore lack the courage and wisdom of a bodhisattva.<ref name=\"Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120\">Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. p. 120</ref> Novice bodhisattvas are compared to śrāvakas and arhats at times. In the ''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}'', there is an account of sixty novice bodhisattvas who attain arhatship despite themselves and their efforts at the bodhisattva path because they lacked the abilities of [[prajnaparamita]] and [[skillful means]] to progress as bodhisattvas toward complete enlightenment (Skt. ''{{IAST|Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi}}''). This is because they are still viewed as having innate attachment and fear of saṃsāra. The ''[[Prajnaparamita#A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81 Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81|{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}]]'' compares these people to a giant bird without wings that cannot help but plummet to the earth from the top of [[Sumeru]].<ref name=\"Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120\"/>\n\nMahayan Buddhism has viewed the śrāvaka path culminating in arhatship as a lesser accomplishment than complete enlightenment, but still accords due respect to arhats for their respective achievements. Therefore, buddha-realms are depicted as populated by both śrāvakas and bodhisattvas.<ref name=\"Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120\"/> Far from being completely disregarded, the accomplishments of arhats are viewed as impressive, essentially because they have transcended the mundane world.<ref>Powers, John. ''A Concise Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism''.

''The Art of Buddhism: An Introduction to Its History and Meaning''. Shambhala. 2009. p. 196</ref> The first famous portraits of these arhats were painted by the Chinese monk [[Guanxiu]] ({{zh|c=貫休|p=''Guànxiū''}}) in 891 CE.

However, a distinctive difference is seen in the Mahāyāna doctrine pushing emotional and cognitive non-attachment to their logical consequences.
