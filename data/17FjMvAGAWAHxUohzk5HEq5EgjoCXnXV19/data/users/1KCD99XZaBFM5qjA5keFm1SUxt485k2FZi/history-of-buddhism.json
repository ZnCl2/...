Mahayana (red arrow), Theravada (green arrow), and Tantric-Vajrayana (blue arrow).]]\n{{Buddhism}}\nThe '''history of Buddhism''' spans from the 5th century BCE to the present. [[Buddhism]] arose in the eastern part of [[Ancient India]], in and around the ancient Kingdom of [[Magadha]] (now in [[Bihar]], [[India]]), and is based on the teachings of [[Siddhartha Gautama|Siddhārtha Gautama]]. This makes it one of the oldest religions practiced today. The religion evolved as it spread from the northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent through [[Central Asia|Central]], [[East Asia|East]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. At one time or another, it influenced most of the Asian continent. The history of Buddhism is also characterized by the development of numerous movements, schisms, and schools, among them the [[Theravada|Theravāda]], [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] traditions, with contrasting periods of expansion and retreat.\n\n==Life of the Buddha==\n[[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|thumb|250px|The [[Mahajanapadas]] were sixteen most powerful and vast kingdoms and republics around the lifetime of [[Gautama Buddha]]（563BC-483BC）, located mainly across the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plains]], there were also a number of smaller kingdoms stretching the length and breadth of [[Ancient India]].]]\n[[Siddhārtha Gautama]] was the historical founder of [[Buddhism]]. The early sources state he was born in the small [[Shakya]] (Pali: Sakka) Republic, which was part of the [[Kosala]] realm of [[Janapada|ancient India]], now in modern-day [[Nepal]].<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 14.</ref> He is thus also known as the ''Shakyamuni'' (literally: \"The sage of the Shakya clan\"). The republic was ruled by a council of household heads, and Gautama was born to one of these elites, so that he described himself as a [[Kshatriya]] when talking to Brahmins.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 14.</ref> The [[Early Buddhist Texts]] contain no continuous life of the Buddha, only later after 200 BCE were various \"biographies\" with much mythological embellishment written.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 14-15.</ref> All texts agree however that Gautama renounced the householder life and lived as a [[Śramaṇa|sramana]] [[Asceticism|ascetic]] for some time studying under various teachers, before attaining [[nirvana]] (extinguishment) and [[bodhi]] (awakening) through meditation. \n\nFor the remaining 45 years of his life, he traveled the [[Gangetic Plain]] of central [[India]] (the region of the [[Ganges River|Ganges/Ganga river]] and its tributaries), teaching his doctrine to a diverse range of people from different [[Caste system in India|castes]] and initiating monks into his order. The Buddha sent his disciples to spread the teaching across India. He also initiated an order of nuns.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 24.</ref> He urged his disciples to teach in the local language or dialects.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 25.</ref> He spent a lot of his time near the cities of [[Shravasti|Sāvatthī]], [[Rajgir|Rājagaha]] and [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vesālī]] (Skt. Śrāvastī, Rājagrha, Vāiśalī).<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 24.</ref> By the time of his death at 80, he had thousands of followers.\n\nThe years following the death of the Buddha saw the emergence of many movements during the next 400 years: first the schools of [[Nikaya Buddhism]], of which only [[Theravada]] remains today, and then the formation of [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]], pan-Buddhist sects based on the acceptance of new scriptures and the revision of older techniques.\n\nFollowers of Buddhism, called '''Buddhists''' in English, referred to themselves as ''Sakyan''-s or ''Sakyabhiksu'' in ancient India.<ref>''Beyond Enlightenment: Buddhism, Religion, Modernity'' by Richard Cohen. Routledge 1999. {{ISBN|0415544440}}. pg 33. \"Donors adopted Sakyamuni Buddha’s family name to assert their legitimacy as his heirs, both institutionally and ideologically. To take the name of Sakya was to define oneself by one’s affiliation with the buddha, somewhat like calling oneself a Buddhist today.</ref><ref>''Sakya or Buddhist Origins'' by Caroline Rhys Davids (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1931) pg 1. \"Put away the word “Buddhism” and think of your subject as “Sakya.” This will at once place you for your perspective at a true point.   You are now concerned to learn less about 'Buddha' and 'Buddhism,' and more about him whom India has ever known as Sakya-muni, and about his men who, as their records admit, were spoken of as the Sakya-sons, or men of the Sakyas.\"</ref> Buddhist scholar Donald S. Lopez asserts they also used the term ''Bauddha'',<ref>''Curators of the Buddha'' By Donald S. Lopez. University of Chicago Press. pg 7</ref> although scholar Richard Cohen asserts that that term was used only by outsiders to describe Buddhists.<ref>''Beyond Enlightenment: Buddhism, Religion, Modernity'' by Richard Cohen. Routledge 1999. {{ISBN|0415544440}}. pg 33. Bauddha is \"a secondary derivative of buddha, in which the vowel’s lengthening indicates connection or relation. Things that are bauddha pertain to the buddha, just as things Saiva relato to Siva and things Vaisnava belong to Visnu. . . baudda can be both adjectival and nominal; it can be used for doctrines spoken by the buddha, obejects enjoyed by him, texts attributed to him, as well as individuals, communities, and societies that offer him reverence or accept ideologies certified through his name. Strictly speaking, Sakya is preferable to bauddha since the latter is not attested at Ajanta. In fact, as a collective noun, bauddha is an outsider’s term. The bauddha did not call themselves this in India, though they did sometimes use the word adjectivally (e.g., as a possessive, the buddha’s).\"</ref>\n\n== Early Buddhism ==\n{{Further information|Early Buddhism}}\nAfter the death of the Buddha, the Buddhist [[sangha]] (monastic community) remained centered on the Ganges valley, spreading gradually from its ancient heartland. The canonical sources record various councils, where the monastic [[Sangha]] recited and organized the orally transmitted collections of the Buddha's teachings and settled certain disciplinary problems within the community. Modern scholarship has questioned the accuracy and historicity of these traditional accounts.<ref>Berkwitz, Stephen C. South Asian Buddhism: A Survey, Routledge, 2012, page 43.</ref> \n\nThe first Buddhist council is traditionally said to have been held just after Buddha's [[Parinirvana]], and presided over by [[Mahākāśyapa]], one of His most senior disciples, at Rājagṛha (today's [[Rajgir]]) with the support of king Ajāthaśatru. According to Charles Prebish, almost all scholars have questioned the historicity of this first council.<ref>Prebish, Charles S. Buddhism: A Modern Perspective, p. 23</ref>\n\nThe second Buddhist council is said to have caused the first schism of the sangha into the [[Sthavira nikāya|Sthavira]] (Elders) and [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamghika]] (Great Sangha). Most scholars agree that the schism was caused by disagreements over points of [[vinaya]] (monastic discipline).<ref>Harvey, Peter (2013). ''An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices (2nd ed.).'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. pg. 88-90.</ref> Over time, these two monastic fraternities would further divide into various [[Early Buddhist schools|Early Buddhist Schools]]. The Sthaviras gave birth to a large number of influential schools including the [[Sarvāstivāda]], the [[Pudgalavāda]] (also known as ''Vatsīputrīya''), the [[Dharmaguptaka]]s and the [[Vibhajyavāda]] ([[Theravada|Theravādins]] being descended from these). The [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamghikas]] meanwhile also developed their own schools and doctrines early on, which can seen in texts like the [[Mahavastu]], associated with the [[Lokottaravāda]], or ‘Transcendentalist’ school, who might be the same as the [[Ekavyāvahārika]]s or \"One-utterancers\".<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 98.</ref> This school has been seen as foreshadowing certain [[Mahayana]] ideas, especially due to their view that all of Gautama Buddha's acts were \"transcendental\" or \"supramundane\", even those performed before his Buddhahood.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 98.</ref>\n\nIn the third century BCE, some Buddhists began introducing new systematized teachings called [[Abhidharma]], based on previous lists or tables (''Matrka'') of main doctrinal topics.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 90.</ref> Unlike the [[Nikāya|Nikayas]], which were prose [[Sutta Pitaka|sutras]] or discourses, the Abhidharma literature consisted of systematic doctrinal exposition and often differed across the Buddhist schools who disagreed on points of doctrine.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 90.</ref> Abhidharma sought to analyze all experience into its ultimate constituents, phenomenal events or processes called ''dharmas''.\n\n==Mauryan empire (322–180 BCE)==\n{{Further information|Ashoka the Great|Maurya Empire}}\n{{See also|Edicts of Ashoka|Ashokavadana}}\n[[File:Maurya Dynasty in 265 BCE.jpg|thumb|The [[Maurya Empire]] under [[Ashoka|Emperor Aśoka]] was the world's first major Buddhist state.  It established free hospitals and free education and promoted human rights.]]\n[[File:6thPillarOfAshoka.JPG|thumb|Fragment of the 6th Pillar [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edict of Aśoka]] (238 BC), in [[Brāhmī script|Brāhmī]], sandstone. [[British Museum]].]]\n[[File:Sanchi Great Stupa Mauryan configuration.jpg|thumb|Approximate reconstitution of the Great Stupa with [[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashoka Pillar]], [[Sanchi]], India.]]\nDuring the reign of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] Emperor [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] (273&ndash;232 BCE), Buddhism gained royal support and began to spread more widely reaching most of the Indian subcontinent.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 100.</ref> After his invasion of Kalinga, [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] seems to have experienced remorse and began working to improve the lives of his subjects. [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] also built wells, rest-houses and hospitals for humans and animals, he also abolished torture, royal hunting trips and perhaps even the death penalty.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 101.</ref> [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] also supported non-Buddhist faiths like Jainism and Brahmanism.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 102.</ref> [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] propagated religion by building [[stupa]]s and pillars urging, among other things, respect of all animal life and enjoining people to follow the [[Dharma]]. He has been hailed by Buddhist sources as the model for the compassionate [[Chakravarti (Sanskrit term)|chakravartin]] (wheel turning monarch). <ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 100.</ref> \n\nAnother feature of Mauryan Buddhism was the worship and veneration of [[Stupa|stupas]], large mounds which contained relics ([[Pali]]: sarīra) of the Buddha or other saints within.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 103.</ref> It was believed that the practice of devotion to these relics and stupas could bring blessings.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 103.</ref> Perhaps the best preserved example of a Mauryan Buddhist site is the [[Great Stupa of Sanchi]] (dating from the 3rd century BCE).<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 103.</ref>   \n\nAccording to the plates and pillars left by Aśoka (the [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts of Aśoka]]), emissaries were sent to various countries in order to spread Buddhism, as far south as [[Sri Lanka]] and as far west as the Greek kingdoms, in particular the neighboring [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], and possibly even farther to the Mediterranean.\n\n[[Theravada|Theravadin]] sources state that [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] convened the third Buddhist council around 250 BC at Pataliputra (today's [[Patna, India|Patna]]) with the elder [[Moggaliputtatissa]].<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 102.</ref> The objective of the council was to purify the Saṅgha, particularly from non-Buddhist ascetics who had been attracted by the royal patronage. Following the council, Buddhist missionaries were dispatched throughout the known world.\n\n=== Proselytism in the Hellenistic world ===\nSome of the [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts of Aśoka]] describe the efforts made by him to propagate the Buddhist faith throughout the Hellenistic world, which at that time formed an uninterrupted continuum from the borders of India to Greece. The edicts indicate a clear understanding of the political organization in Hellenistic territories: the names and locations of the main Greek monarchs of the time are identified, and they are claimed as recipients of Buddhist [[proselytism]]: [[Antiochus II Theos]] of the [[Seleucid Kingdom]] (261&ndash;246 BCE), [[Ptolemy II of Egypt|Ptolemy II Philadelphos]] of Egypt (285&ndash;247 BCE), [[Antigonus Gonatas]] of Macedonia (276&ndash;239 BCE), [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] (288&ndash;258 BCE) in [[Cyrenaica]] (modern [[Libya]]), and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander II]] (272&ndash;255 BCE) in [[Epirus]] (modern Northwestern [[Greece]]). One of the edicts states:\n\n:\"The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred [[yojana]]s (5,400–9,600 km) away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola]]s, the [[Pandya]]s, and as far as [[Tamraparni]] ([[Sri Lanka]]).\" ([[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of Aśoka]], 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika).\n\nFurthermore, according to the [[Mahavamsa]] (XII) some of Aśoka's emissaries were Greek ([[Yona]]), particularly one named [[Dharmaraksita|Dhammarakkhita]]. Aśoka also issued edicts in the Greek language as well as in Aramaic. One of them, found in Kandahar, advocates the adoption of \"piety\" (using the Greek term ''[[eusebeia]]'' for [[Dharma]]) to the Greek community.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120201030234/http://www.afghanan.net/afghanistan/mauryans.htm ''History of Afghanistan'']</ref>\n\nIt is not clear how much these interactions may have been influential, but authors like [[Robert Linssen]] have commented that Buddhism may have influenced Western thought and religion at that time. Linssen points to the presence of Buddhist communities in the Hellenistic world around that period, in particular in [[Alexandria]] (mentioned by [[Clement of Alexandria]]), and to the pre-Christian monastic order of the [[Therapeutae]] (possibly a deformation of the Pāli word \"[[Theravada|Theravāda]]\"<ref>According to the linguist Zacharias P. Thundy</ref>), who may have \"almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism\"<ref>\"Zen living\", [[Robert Linssen]]</ref> and may even have been descendants of Aśoka's emissaries to the West.<ref>\"The Original Jesus\" (Element Books, Shaftesbury, 1995), Elmar R Gruber, Holger Kersten</ref> Philosophers like [[Hegesias of Cyrene]] and [[Pyrrho]] are sometimes thought to have been influenced by Buddhist teachings.<ref>\"The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene (nicknamed ''Peisithanatos'', \"The advocate of death\") was a contemporary of Magas and was probably influenced by the teachings of the Buddhist missionaries to Cyrene and Alexandria.

After assassinating King [[Brhadrata]] (last of the [[Mauryan]] rulers), military commander-in-chief [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] took the throne. Buddhist religious scriptures such as the [[Ashokavadana|Aśokāvadāna]] allege that Pushyamitra (an orthodox [[Brahmin]]) was hostile towards Buddhists and persecuted the Buddhist faith. Buddhists wrote that he \"destroyed hundreds of monasteries and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Monks\":<ref>[[Divyavadana|Divyāvadāna]], pp. 429&ndash;434</ref> 840,000 Buddhist [[stupa]]s which had been built by Aśoka were destroyed, and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk.<ref>Indian Historical Quarterly Vol. XXII, p. 81 ff cited in Hars.407</ref>{{better source|date=March 2018}}\n\nModern historians, however, dispute this view in the light of literary and archaeological evidence. They opine that following Aśoka's sponsorship of Buddhism, it is possible that Buddhist institutions fell on harder times under the Shungas, but no evidence of active persecution has been noted. [[Etienne Lamotte]] observes: \"To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof.\"<ref>[http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/books/acat/ch2.htm Elst, Koneraad ''Ashoka and Pushyamitra, iconoclasts?'']</ref> Another eminent historian, [[Romila Thapar]] points to archaeological evidence that \"suggests the contrary\" to the claim that \"Pushyamitra was a fanatical anti-Buddhist\" and that he \"never actually destroyed 840,000 stupas as claimed by Buddhist works, if any\". Thapar stresses that Buddhist accounts are probably hyperbolic renditions of Pushyamitra's attack of the Mauryas, and merely reflect the desperate frustration of the Buddhist religious figures in the face of the possibly irreversible decline in the importance of their religion under the Shungas.<ref>Aśoka and the Decline of the Mauryas by Romila Thapar, Oxford University Press, 1960 P200</ref>\n\nDuring the period, Buddhist monks deserted the [[Ganges]] valley, following either the northern road (''[[uttarapatha]]'') or the southern road (''dakṣinapatha'').<ref>\"Gandhara\", Francine Tissot, p128: \"The monks, expelled from the Ganges valley, maybe by sectarian disputes, followed the northern road (Uttarapatha) or the northern road (Daksinapatha), which conducted them to the Northwest for some, and to the Occidental ocean for the others, with multiple artistic creations marking their respective roads\"</ref> Conversely, Buddhist artistic creation stopped in the old [[Magadha]] area, to reposition itself either in the northwest area of [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] or in the southeast around [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]].

Although this change was probably effected without significant loss of integrity to the canon, this event was of particular significance since Sanskrit was the sacred language of [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] in India, and was also being used by other thinkers, regardless of their specific religious or philosophical allegiance, thus enabling a far wider audience to gain access to Buddhist ideas and practices.\n\nAfter the fall of the Kushans, small kingdoms ruled the Gandharan region, and later the [[Hephthalite|Hephthalite White Huns]] conquered the area (circa 440s–670).

There was no widespread repression of the Buddhist sangha, but the communist government has sought to control the sangha and use it as a tool to spread its ideology.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 397.</ref> In Cambodia however, the communist terror of the [[Khmer Rouge|Khmer rouge]] during 1975-9 caused much damage to the Buddhist sangha.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 397.</ref>\n\n=== East Asia ===\nThe [[Perry Expedition|opening of Japan in 1853]] by [[Robert Peary|Admiral Perry]] and the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868 led to the end of feudal Japan and rapid modernization.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 403.</ref> A new form of [[State Shinto]] arose as a strong competitor to Buddhism when it was adopted by the Japanese government. In 1872, the Japanese government decreed that Buddhist clerics could marry. These changes led to modernization efforts by [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]] which saw the setting up of publishing houses and the study of Western philosophy and scholarship.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 403.</ref> In the post war period, [[Japanese new religions]] arose, many of them influenced by Buddhism.\n\nChinese Buddhism meanwhile, suffered much destruction during the Christian-inspired [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping rebellion]] (1850-64), but saw a modest revival during the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican period]] (1912-49).<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 409.</ref> A key figure was [[Taixu]] (T’ai-hsü, 1899–1947), who is associated with the modernist [[Humanistic Buddhism]] trend of Chinese Buddhism. The Communist [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–76) led to the closing of all Buddhist monasteries and widespread destruction of Buddhist institutions. However, since 1977, there has been a general shift in the policy of the communist government, and Buddhist activity, both monastic and lay, has once again been renewed.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 409-10</ref>\n\n[[Korean Buddhism]] suffered a series of setbacks during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Japanese invasions]], occupation, and also during the [[Korean War|Korean war]]. [[North Korea]]'s harsh government nevertheless offers some limited support to the sangha, but it closely controls all activity. In [[South Korea]], Buddhism underwent a revival, with youth groups being influential and temples being rebuilt with government aid.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 412</ref><ref>Clark, Donald N. (2000).

The [[14th Dalai Lama]] fled the country in 1959.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 414.</ref> A [[Tibetan diaspora|Tibetan exile community]] was established in India, with its center at [[Dharamshala|Dharamsala]], which today contains many Buddhist monasteries. The 14th Dalai Lama has become one of the most popular Buddhist leaders in the world today. \n\nDuring the Red Guard period (1966-7), Chinese communists destroyed around 6,000 monasteries in Tibet along with their art and books, an attempt to wipe out the Tibetan Buddhist culture.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 414.</ref> After 1980, Chinese repression of Tibetan Buddhism has decreased and the situation has improved with the reprinting of the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan Canon]] and some artistic restoration.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 414.</ref> In the nearby countries of [[Bhutan]], and [[Nepal]], [[Tibetan Buddhism|Vajrayana Buddhism]] continues to flourish as a major religion.\n\nIn [[Mongolia]], which also has Tibetan Buddhism as its main religion, soviet dominance (between 1924-1990) saw much repression of Buddhism. However, Buddhism is now undergoing a revival in post communist Mongolia, with more ordained monks and nuns, and 284 monasteries since 2009.<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 417.</ref> More recent liberal attitudes towards religion has also benefited the Buddhists of [[Tuva]] and [[Buryatia]], as well as the Chinese region of [[Inner Mongolia]].<ref>Harvey, 2012, p. 417.</ref>\n\nAnother modern development was the founding of the [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk Khanate]] in the 17th century with [[Tibetan Buddhism]] as its main religion. During the course of the 18th century, they were absorbed by the [[Russian Empire]] as [[Kalmykia]], and remains a federal subject of Russia.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060202154501/http://www.nupi.no/cgi-win/Russland/etnisk_b.exe?Kalmykian ''NUPI - Centre for Russian Studies'']</ref>\n\n=== Western world ===\n{{Further information|Western Buddhism}}\n[[File:Lightmatter Hsi Lai Temple 4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Main Hall of [[Hsi Lai Temple|Hsi Lai]], a Chinese-American temple in [[Los Angeles County, California]].

Sir Edwin Arnold's book-length poem ''[[The Light of Asia]]'' (1879), a life of the Buddha, was a successful early publication on Buddhism that led to much interest among English speaking middle classes.<ref>Harvey, 2012, 420.</ref> The work of western [[Buddhist studies|Buddhist scholars]] like [[Hermann Oldenberg]] (1854–1920), [[Thomas Rhys Davids|T. W. Rhys Davids]] (1843– 1922) and [[Max Müller|F. Max Müller]] was also influential in introducing Buddhism to western audiences.<ref>Harvey, 2012, 422.</ref>\n\nThe late 19th century also saw the first-known modern western conversions to Buddhism, including leading Theosophists [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and [[Helena Blavatsky]] in 1880 in [[Sri Lanka]]. The Theosophical Society was very influential in popularizing Indian religions in the west. <ref>Harvey, 2012, 421.</ref> The 19th century also saw the first western monastics such as [[U Dhammaloka]], [[Charles Henry Allan Bennett|Ananda Metteyya]] and the German [[Nyanatiloka|Nyānatiloka Thera]] (1878–1956). \n\nAnother important element leading to the growth of Buddhism in the west was the large scale immigration of Chinese and Japanese to the United States and Canada in late 19th century.<ref>Harvey, 2012, 424.</ref> Refugees from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have also immigrated to west, beginning in 1975.<ref>Harvey, 2012, 426.</ref> Asian Buddhists such as [[D. T. Suzuki|DT Suzuki]], [[Hsuan Hua|Hsüan Hua]], [[Hakuun Yasutani]] and [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] were influential in teaching [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] in the West in the 20th century. [[Shunryū Suzuki|Shunryu Suzuki]] opened the [[Sōtō|Soto]] [[San Francisco Zen Center]] (1961) and the [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center|Tassajara Monastery]] (1967).<ref>Harvey, 2012, 432.</ref> \n\nThe [[Tibetan diaspora]] has also been active in promoting Tibetan Buddhism in the West. All of the four major Tibetan Buddhist schools have a presence and have attracted converts.<ref>Harvey, 2012, 437.</ref> Among its prominent exponents have been [[14th Dalai Lama|Lama Thubten Zopa]], [[Tarthang Tulku]] and [[Chögyam Trungpa]].<ref>Harvey, 2012, 437-38</ref> The number of its adherents is estimated to be between ten and twenty million.<ref>Adherents.com estimates twenty million for \"Lamaism (Vajrayana/Tibetan/Tantric).\" http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Buddhism {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803172321/http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html |date=2017-08-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe Theravada tradition has established various temples in the West, especially among immigrant communities in the USA. Theravada [[Vipassanā|vipassana]] meditation was also established in the West, through the founding of institutions like the [[Insight Meditation Society]] in 1975.<ref>[[Gil Fronsdal|Fronsdal, Gil]] (1998).
