This chapter's [[Sūtra|sutta]]s are alternately identified as AN 3:82 to 3:92.  Of these suttas, the two most widely translated into English are AN 3:88 and 3:89, respectively referred to as \"Sikkha (1)\" and \"Sikkha (2)\" by [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], and as \"Dutiyasikkhasuttam\" and \"Tatiyasikkhasuttam\" in the Sinhalese canon.  English translations of these latter two suttas can be found in: Nyanaponika & Bodhi (1999), pp. 69-71; Thanissaro (1998a); and, Thanissaro (1998b).\n\nAlso see, e.g., DN 16.4.3 (PTS D ii.123) (boldface added for emphasis):\n{| style=\"margin-left:20pt\"\n|-\n| \"'''Sīla{{IAST|ṃ}} samādhi paññā''' ca,<br />\nvimutti ca anuttarā;<br />\nAnubuddhā ime dhammā,<br />\ngotamena yasassinā.\n\nIti buddho abhiññāya,<br />\ndhammamakkhāsi bhikkhuna{{IAST|ṃ}};<br />\nDukkhassantakaro satthā,<br />\ncakkhumā parinibbuto\"ti.\n|}\n\nTranslated by [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html#chap4 Vajira & Story (1998)] (boldface added for emphasis) as:\n{| style=\"margin-left:20pt\"\n|-\n| \"'''Virtue, concentration, wisdom''', and emancipation unsurpassed —<br />\nThese are the principles realized by Gotama the renowned;<br />\nAnd, knowing them, he, the Buddha, to his monks has taught the Dhamma.<br />\nHe, the destroyer of suffering, the Master, the Seer, is at peace.\"\n|}\n</ref> as training in:\n* higher [[Śīla|virtue]] (''adhisīla-sikkhā'')\n* higher [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|mind]] (''adhicitta-sikkhā'')\n* higher [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] (''adhipaññā-sikkhā'')\n\n== In the Pali Canon ==\n\nAccording to [[Theravada]] [[Pali Canon|canonical texts]], pursuing this training leads to the abandonment of [[kilesa|lust, hatred, and delusion]].<ref>See [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.088.than.html AN 3:88] (Thanissaro, 1998a).</ref>  One who is fully accomplished in this training attains [[Nibbana]].<ref>See [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.089.than.html AN 3.89] (Thanissaro, 1998b).</ref>\n\nIn the [[Anguttara Nikaya]], training in \"higher virtue\" includes following the [[Patimokkha]], training in \"higher mind\" (sometimes simply referred to as \"concentration\") includes entering and dwelling in the four [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhanas]], and training in \"higher wisdom\" includes directly perceiving the [[Four Noble Truths]] or knowledge of destruction of the taints. <ref>AN 3.85, [https://suttacentral.net/en/an3.89 AN 3.89], [https://suttacentral.net/en/an3.90 AN 3.90]</ref>\n\nIn several [[Pali Canon|canonical]] discourses, a more \"gradual\" instruction (''[[anupubbikatha|anupubbikathā]]'') is provided to receptive lay people (see also, [[gradual training]]).  This latter instruction culminates in the teaching of the Four Noble Truths which in itself concludes with the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], the constituents of which can be mapped to this threefold training (see below).\n\n=== Similarity to threefold partition of the Noble Eightfold Path ===\nThe Buddha's threefold training is similar to the threefold grouping of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] articulated by [[Bhikkhuni]] Dhammadinna in Culavedalla Sutta (\"The Shorter Set of Questions-And-Answers Discourse,\" [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 44): virtue (''sīlakkhandha''), concentration (''samādhikkhandha''), wisdom (''paññākkhandha '').<ref>Thanissaro (1998c).</ref>  These three-part schemes simplify and organize the [[Eightfold Path]] as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
