He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother Turing said:<blockquote>I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me&nbsp;... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=61}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's [[atheism]] and [[materialism]].<ref>Paul Gray, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990624,00.html Alan Turing] Time Magazine's Most Important People of the Century, p.2</ref> Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing said: <blockquote>Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body&nbsp;... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body [can] hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=82–83}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===University and work on computability===\nAfter Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at [[King's College, Cambridge]],<ref name=whoswho/> where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a [[fellow]] of King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the [[central limit theorem]].<ref>See Section 3 of John Aldrich, \"England and Continental Probability in the Inter-War Years\", Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique, vol. 5/2 [http://www.jehps.net/decembre2009.html Decembre 2009] Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique</ref> Unknown to the committee, the theorem had already been proven, in 1922, by [[Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=88, 94}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, Turing published his paper \"[[On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem]]\" (1936).<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}</ref> In this paper, Turing reformulated [[Kurt Gödel]]'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as [[Turing machine]]s. The ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Turing proved that his \"universal computing machine\" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]]. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''decision problem'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is [[Decision problem|undecidable]]: It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt.\n\n[[File:20130808 Kings College Front Court Fountain Crop 03.jpg|thumb|right|[[King's College, Cambridge]], where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him.]]\nAlthough [[Turing's proof]] was published shortly after [[Alonzo Church]]'s equivalent proof using his [[lambda calculus]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Church|1936}}</ref> Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grime|first1=James|title=What Did Turing Do for Us?|url=https://nrich.maths.org/8050|website=[[NRICH]]|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|accessdate=28 February 2016|date=February 2012}}</ref> It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a [[universal Turing machine]]), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the [[Church–Turing thesis]], Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. [[John von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper.<ref>\"von Neumann&nbsp;... firmly emphasised to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing—insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others.\" Letter by [[Stanley Frankel]] to [[Brian Randell]], 1972, quoted in [[Jack Copeland]] (2004) ''The Essential Turing'', p.&nbsp;22.</ref> To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in [[theory of computation]].\n\nFrom September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at [[Princeton University]], in the second year as a [[Jane Eliza Procter Fellowship|Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow]].

The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]], became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.\n\nJack Good opined:\n\n{{quote|Turing's most important contribution, I ''think'', was of part of the design of the bombe, the cryptanalytic machine. He had the idea that you could use, in effect, a theorem in logic which sounds, to the untrained ear, rather absurd; namely that, from a contradiction, you can deduce ''everything.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155383/episodes|title=Heroes of World War II (TV Series 2004– )|publisher=IMDb}}</ref>}}\n[[File:Bombe-rebuild.jpg|thumbnail|right|A complete and working replica of a [[bombe]] at the National Codes Centre at Bletchley Park]]The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings), using a suitable ''[[crib (cryptanalysis)|crib]]'': a fragment of probable [[plaintext]]. For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 10<sup>19</sup> states, or 10<sup>22</sup> states for the four-rotor U-boat variant),<ref>Professor Jack Good in \"The Men Who Cracked Enigma\", 2003: with his caveat: \"if my memory is correct\".</ref> the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented [[Electromechanics|electromechanically]].\n\nThe bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter—this simply wasn't possible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oakley|2006|p=40/03B}}</ref>\n\nBy late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]] were frustrated. Building on the [[Biuro Szyfrów#Gift to allies|work of the Poles]], they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but they only had a few people and a few bombes, so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer, they had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month, but they were still on a knife-edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but they were getting nowhere. Finally, breaking all the rules, on 28 October they wrote directly to [[Winston Churchill]] spelling out their difficulties, with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=218}}</ref>\n\nAs [[Andrew Hodges]], biographer of Turing, later wrote, \"This letter had an electric effect.\"<ref name=\"Hodges 1983 221\">{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=221}}</ref> Churchill wrote a memo to [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|General Ismay]], which read: \"ACTION THIS DAY.

''Banburismus'' could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.\n\nTuring travelled to the United States in November 1942<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=242–245}}</ref> and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington; he also visited their [[United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory|Computing Machine Laboratory]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].\n\nTuring's reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:\n{{quote|text=The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order.

Turing then became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.\n\nAlexander wrote this about Turing's contribution:\n{{quote|There should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was the biggest factor in Hut 8's success. In the early days, he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut, but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe. It is always difficult to say that anyone is 'absolutely indispensable', but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8, it was Turing.

Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable [[secure voice]] communications machine codenamed ''Delilah''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=273}}</ref> It was intended for different applications, lacking capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions, and in any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war.

Among other things, he wanted to understand Fibonacci [[phyllotaxis]], the existence of [[Fibonacci numbers]] in plant structures.<ref>{{cite web|title=Turing's achievements: codebreaking, AI and the birth of computer science|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/18/turing-contributions?page=all|work=Wired |accessdate=12 February 2013|author= Clark, Liat|author2=Ian Steadman|date=18 June 2012}}</ref> He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a [[reaction-diffusion system]], could account for \"the main phenomena of morphogenesis\".<ref>{{cite news| first=Alan M. | last=Turing | authorlink=Alan Turing | title=The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] B | date=14 August 1952 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | volume=237 | number=641 | pages=37–72 | bibcode=1952RSPTB.237...37T }}</ref> He used systems of [[partial differential equations]] to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is [[autocatalytic]], and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand. Fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist [[Boris Pavlovich Belousov|Boris Belousov]] had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. For a modern view of living organisms and the second law, see [[Second law of thermodynamics#Living organisms]].

On 23 January Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his, and Turing reported the crime to the police.

An [[Inquests in England and Wales|inquest]] determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at [[Woking Crematorium]] on 12 June 1954.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=529}}</ref> Turing's ashes were scattered there, just as his father's had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer, [[David Leavitt]], have both suggested that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), his favourite fairy tale, both noting that (in Leavitt's words) he took \"an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=140}} and {{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=149, 489}}</ref>\n\nPhilosophy professor [[Jack Copeland]] has questioned various aspects of the coroner's historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death, this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for [[electroplating]] gold onto spoons, which uses potassium cyanide to [[Gold#Commercial chemistry|dissolve the gold]].  Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten.<ref name = \"Copeland\">{{Cite news | first = Roland | last = Pease | title = Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable' | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 23 June 2012 | accessdate =23 June 2012 | quote = ''We have&nbsp;... been recreating the narrative of Turing's life, and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.

She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of [[COBOL]], an early [[high-level programming language]] still in use today.\n\nHopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during [[World War II]], but she was rejected by the military because she was 34 years of age and too old to enlist. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team that was led by [[Howard H. Aiken]]. In 1949, she joined the [[Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation]] and was part of the development team that designed the [[UNIVAC I]] computer in 1944.  It was at Eckert–Mauchly that she began developing the compiler. She believed that computer code could be written in English by using a programming language that was based on English words. The compiler would convert that code into [[machine code]] that would be understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper finished her program [[Linker_(computing)|linker]] (originally called a compiler), which was written for the [[A-0 System]].<ref name=\"Spencer85\">{{cite book|title=Computers and Information Processing|publisher=C.E.

Hopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper's request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve.

In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the [[Remington Rand]] corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original [[compiler]] work was done.  The program was known as the A compiler and its first version was [[A-0 programming language|A-0]].<ref name=\"mcgee2004\" />{{rp|11}}\n\nIn 1952 she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler. She later said that \"Nobody believed that,\" and that she \"had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/hopper-wit.html|title=The Wit and Wisdom of Grace Hopper}}</ref> She goes on to say that her compiler \"translated mathematical notation into machine code. Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It’s much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say “Subtract income tax from pay” instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL is the major language used today in data processing.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/grace-murray-hopper/id1197529986?mt=11|title=Lynn Gilbert, Women of Wisdom of Grace Hopper}}</ref>“\n\nIn 1954 Hopper was named the company's first director of automatic programming, and her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including [[MATH-MATIC]] and [[FLOW-MATIC]].<ref name=Ogilvie />\n\n===COBOL===\n[[File: Grace Hopper and UNIVAC.jpg|thumb|Hopper at the [[UNIVAC I]] console, c. 1960]]\nIn the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages ([[CODASYL]]).

She visited most of Digital's engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks.\n\nShe often recounted that during her service she was frequently asked by admirals and generals why satellite communication would take so long.
