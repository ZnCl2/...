Distributions include the Linux kernel, supporting [[System software|utilities]] and [[library (computer science)|libraries]], many of which are provided by the [[GNU Project]], and usually a large amount of application software to fulfil the distribution's intended use. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system, such as [[X11]], [[Mir (software)|Mir]] or a [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]] implementation, and an accompanying [[desktop environment]] such as [[GNOME]] or [[KDE Plasma]]; some distributions may also include a less resource-intensive desktop, such as [[LXDE]] or [[Xfce]]. Distributions intended to run on servers may omit all graphical environments from the standard install, and instead include other software to set up and operate a [[solution stack]] such as [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]]. Because Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any intended use. Many Linux distributions use the word \"Linux\" in their name. The [[Free Software Foundation]] uses the name \"[[GNU]]/Linux\" to refer to the operating system family, as well as specific distributions, to emphasize that most Linux distributions are not just the Linux kernel, and that they have in common not only the kernel, but also numerous utilities and libraries, a large proportion of which are from the GNU project.

This is a program that loads the Linux kernel into the computer's [[main memory]], by being executed by the computer when it is turned on and after the [[firmware]] initialization is performed.\n* An [[init]] program, such as the traditional [[sysvinit]] and the newer [[systemd]], [[OpenRC]] and [[Upstart (software)|Upstart]]. This is the first [[Process (computing)|process]] launched by the Linux kernel, and is at the root of the process tree: in other terms, all processes are launched through init. It starts processes such as system services and login prompts (whether graphical or in terminal mode).\n* [[Library (computing)|Software libraries]], which contain code that can be used by running processes. On Linux systems using [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]]-format executable files, the [[dynamic linker]] that manages use of dynamic libraries is known as <tt>ld-linux.so</tt>. If the system is set up for the user to compile software themselves, [[header file]]s will also be included to describe the [[Application binary interface|interface]] of installed libraries. Besides the most commonly used software library on Linux systems, the [[GNU C Library]] (glibc), there are numerous other libraries, such as [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] and [[Mesa (computer graphics)|Mesa]].\n** [[C standard library]] is the library needed to run [[C (programming language)|C programs]] on a computer system, with the GNU C Library being the standard. For embedded systems, alternatives such as the [[EGLIBC]] (a glibc fork once used by Debian) and [[uClibc]] (which was designed for [[uClinux]]) have been developed, although both are no longer maintained. Android uses its own C library, [[Bionic (software)|Bionic]].\n* Basic Unix commands, with GNU coreutils being the standard implementation. Alternatives exist for embedded systems, such as the copyleft [[BusyBox]], and the BSD-licensed [[Toybox]].\n* [[Widget toolkit]]s are the libraries used to build [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) for software applications. Numerous widget toolkits are available, including [[GTK+]] and [[Clutter (software)|Clutter]] developed by the [[GNOME project]], [[Qt (software)|Qt]] developed by the [[Qt Project]] and led by [[Digia]], and [[Enlightenment Foundation Libraries]] (EFL) developed primarily by the [[Enlightenment (software)|Enlightenment]] team.\n* A [[package manager|package management system]], such as [[dpkg]] and [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]]. Alternatively packages can be compiled from binary or source [[Tar (computing)|tarballs]].\n* User interface programs such as command shells or windowing environments.\n\n=== User interface ===\nThe [[user interface]], also known as the [[shell (computing)|shell]], is either a [[command-line interface]] (CLI), a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), or through controls attached to the associated hardware, which is common for [[embedded systems]]. For desktop systems, the default mode is usually a graphical user interface, although the CLI is commonly available through [[terminal emulator]] windows or on a separate [[virtual console (PC)|virtual console]].\n\nCLI shells are text-based user interfaces, which use text for both input and output. The dominant shell used in Linux is the [[Bourne-Again Shell]] (bash), originally developed for the [[GNU project]]. Most low-level Linux components, including various parts of the [[Userland (computing)|userland]], use the CLI exclusively. The CLI is particularly suited for automation of repetitive or delayed tasks, and provides very simple [[inter-process communication]].\n\nOn desktop systems, the most popular user interfaces are the [[GUI shell]]s, packaged together with extensive [[desktop environment]]s, such as the [[KDE|K Desktop Environment (KDE)]], [[GNOME desktop|GNOME]], [[MATE (software)|MATE]], [[Cinnamon (desktop environment)|Cinnamon]], [[Unity (desktop environment)|Unity]], [[LXDE]], [[Elementary OS|Pantheon]] and [[Xfce]], though a variety of additional user interfaces exist. Most popular user interfaces are based on the [[X Window System]], often simply called \"X\". It provides [[network transparency]] and permits a graphical application running on one system to be displayed on another where a user may interact with the application; however, certain extensions of the X Window System are not capable of working over the network.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://lwn.net/Articles/553415/ |title = The Wayland Situation: Facts About X vs. Wayland (Phoronix) |date = June 8, 2013 |accessdate = October 11, 2013 |publisher = [[LWN.net]] |author = Jake Edge |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131022030529/http://lwn.net/Articles/553415/ |archivedate = October 22, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Several X display servers exist, with the reference implementation, [[X.Org Server]], being the most popular.\n\nSeveral types of [[window manager]]s exist for X11, including [[Tiling window manager|tiling]], [[Dynamic window manager|dynamic]], [[stacking window manager|stacking]] and [[compositing window manager|compositing]]. Window managers provide means to control the placement and appearance of individual application windows, and interact with the X Window System. Simpler [[X window manager]]s such as [[dwm]] or [[ratpoison]] provide a [[Minimalism (computing)|minimalist]] functionality, while more elaborate window managers such as [[FVWM]], [[Enlightenment (software)|Enlightenment]] or [[Window Maker]] provide more features such as a built-in [[taskbar]] and [[theme (computing)|themes]], but are still lightweight when compared to desktop environments. Desktop environments include window managers as part of their standard installations, such as [[Mutter (window manager)|Mutter]] (GNOME), [[KWin]] (KDE) or [[Xfwm]] (xfce), although users may choose to use a different window manager if preferred.\n\n[[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]] is a display server protocol intended as a replacement for the X11 protocol; {{As of|2014|lc=yes}}, it has not received wider adoption. Unlike X11, Wayland does not need an external window manager and compositing manager. Therefore, a Wayland compositor takes the role of the display server, window manager and compositing manager. Weston is the reference implementation of Wayland, while GNOME's Mutter and KDE's KWin are being ported to Wayland as standalone display servers. Enlightenment has already been successfully ported since version 19.\n\n=== Video input infrastructure ===\n{{Main|Video4Linux}}\n\nLinux currently has two modern kernel-userspace APIs for handling video input devices: [[Video4Linux|V4L2]] API for video streams and radio, and [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] API for digital TV reception.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://linuxtv.org/ | title = Linux TV: Television with Linux | accessdate = October 16, 2013 | publisher = linuxtv.org | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131106185814/http://linuxtv.org/ | archivedate = November 6, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDue to the complexity and diversity of different devices, and due to the large amount of formats and standards handled by those APIs, this infrastructure needs to evolve to better fit other devices.

The fact that the software licenses explicitly permit redistribution, however, provides a basis for larger scale projects that collect the software produced by stand-alone projects and make it available all at once in the form of a Linux distribution.\n\nMany Linux distributions, or \"distros\", manage a remote collection of system software and application software packages available for download and installation through a network connection. This allows users to adapt the operating system to their specific needs. Distributions are maintained by individuals, loose-knit teams, volunteer organizations, and commercial entities. A distribution is responsible for the default configuration of the installed Linux kernel, general system security, and more generally integration of the different software packages into a coherent whole. Distributions typically use a [[package manager]] such as [[Advanced Packaging Tool|apt]], [[Yellowdog Updater, Modified|yum]], [[zypper]], [[Pacman (package manager)|pacman]] or [[Portage (software)|portage]] to install, remove, and update all of a system's software from one central location.\n\n=== Community ===\n{{See also|Free software community|Linux User Group}}\n\nA distribution is largely driven by its developer and user communities. Some vendors develop and fund their distributions on a volunteer basis, [[Debian]] being a well-known example. Others maintain a community version of their commercial distributions, as [[Red Hat]] does with [[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora]], and [[SUSE]] does with [[openSUSE]].\n\nIn many cities and regions, local associations known as [[Linux User Group]]s (LUGs) seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free software. They hold meetings and provide free demonstrations, training, technical support, and operating system installation to new users. Many Internet communities also provide support to Linux users and developers. Most distributions and free software / open-source projects have [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] chatrooms or [[newsgroup]]s. [[Online forum]]s are another means for support, with notable examples being [[LinuxQuestions.org]] and the various distribution specific support and community forums, such as ones for [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], and [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]. Linux distributions host [[mailing list]]s; commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or development for a given list.\n\nThere are several technology websites with a Linux focus. Print magazines on Linux often bundle [[cover disk]]s that carry software or even complete Linux distributions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/dvd/ | title=Linux Format DVD contents | author=[[Linux Format]] | accessdate=January 17, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080808113845/http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/dvd/|archivedate=August 8, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linux-magazine.com/resources/current_issue | title=Current Issue | author=linux-magazine.com | accessdate=January 17, 2008 | authorlink=Linux Magazine | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110033853/http://www.linux-magazine.com/resources/current_issue | archivedate=January 10, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Linux distributions are generally available without charge, several large corporations sell, support, and contribute to the development of the components of the system and of [[free software]]. An analysis of the Linux kernel showed 75 percent of the code from December 2008 to January 2010 was developed by programmers working for corporations, leaving about 18 percent to volunteers and 7% unclassified.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://apcmag.com/linux-now-75-corporate.htm | title=75% of Linux code now written by paid developers | work=[[APC (magazine)|APC]] | accessdate=January 22, 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122015736/http://apcmag.com/linux-now-75-corporate.htm | archivedate=January 22, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Major corporations that provide contributions include [[Dell]], [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Sun Microsystems]] (now part of Oracle) and [[Nokia]]. A number of corporations, notably Red Hat, [[Canonical Ltd.|Canonical]] and [[SUSE]], have built a significant business around Linux distributions.\n\nThe [[free software licenses]], on which the various software packages of a distribution built on the Linux kernel are based, explicitly accommodate and encourage commercialization; the relationship between a Linux distribution as a whole and individual vendors may be seen as [[symbiosis|symbiotic]]. One common [[business model]] of commercial suppliers is charging for support, especially for business users. A number of companies also offer a specialized business version of their distribution, which adds proprietary support packages and tools to administer higher numbers of installations or to simplify administrative tasks.\n\nAnother business model is to give away the software in order to sell hardware. This used to be the norm in the computer industry, with operating systems such as [[CP/M]], [[Apple DOS]] and versions of [[Mac OS]] prior to 7.6 freely copyable (but not modifiable). As computer hardware standardized throughout the 1980s, it became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic, as the OS would run on any manufacturer's computer that shared the same architecture.\n\n=== Programming on Linux ===\nLinux distributions support dozens of [[programming language]]s. The original development tools used for building both Linux applications and operating system programs are found within the [[GNU toolchain]], which includes the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC) and the [[GNU Build System]]. Amongst others, GCC provides compilers for [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]] and [[Fortran]]. Many programming languages have a cross-platform reference implementation that supports Linux, for example [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]], [[Python programming language|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], Go, [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]. First released in 2003, the [[LLVM]] project provides an alternative cross-platform open-source compiler for many languages. [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] compilers for Linux include the [[Intel C++ Compiler]], [[Sun Studio (software)|Sun Studio]], and IBM XL [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] Compiler. [[BASIC]] in the form of [[Visual Basic]] is supported in such forms as [[Gambas]], [[FreeBASIC]], and [[XBasic]], and in terms of terminal programming or [[QuickBASIC]] or [[Turbo BASIC]] programming in the form of [[QB64]].\n\nA common feature of Unix-like systems, Linux includes traditional specific-purpose programming languages targeted at [[script (computing)|scripting]], text processing and system configuration and management in general. Linux distributions support [[shell scripts]], [[awk]], [[sed]] and [[make (software)|make]]. Many programs also have an embedded programming language to support configuring or programming themselves. For example, [[regular expressions]] are supported in programs like [[grep]] and [[locate (Unix)|locate]], the traditional Unix [[Mail Transfer Agent|MTA]] [[Sendmail]] contains its own [[Turing complete]] scripting system, and the advanced text editor [[GNU Emacs]] is built around a general purpose [[Emacs Lisp|Lisp]] interpreter.\n\nMost distributions also include support for [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]], [[Python programming language|Python]] and other [[dynamic programming language|dynamic languages]]. While not as common, Linux also supports [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (via [[Mono (software)|Mono]]), [[Vala (programming language)|Vala]], and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]. [[GNU Guile#Guile Scheme|Guile Scheme]] acts as an [[extension language]] targeting the [[GNU]] system utilities, seeking to make the conventionally small, [[static typing|static]], [[compiler|compiled]] [[C (programming language)|C]] programs of [[Unix philosophy|Unix design]] rapidly and dynamically extensible via an elegant, [[functional programming|functional]] high-level scripting system; many GNU programs can be compiled with optional Guile [[language binding|bindings]] to this end. A number of [[Java Virtual Machine]]s and development kits run on Linux, including the original Sun Microsystems JVM ([[HotSpot]]), and IBM's J2SE RE, as well as many open-source projects like [[Kaffe]] and [[JikesRVM]].\n\n[[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] are popular [[desktop environment]]s and provide a framework for developing applications. These projects are based on the [[GTK+]] and [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] [[widget toolkit]]s, respectively, which can also be used independently of the larger framework. Both support a wide variety of languages. There are a number of [[Integrated development environment]]s available including [[Anjuta]], [[Code::Blocks]], [[CodeLite]], [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[Geany]], [[ActiveState Komodo]], [[KDevelop]], [[Lazarus (software)|Lazarus]], [[MonoDevelop]], [[NetBeans]], and [[Qt Creator]], while the long-established editors [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]], [[GNU nano|nano]] and [[Emacs]] remain popular.<ref>{{cite web | first = Joe | last = Brockmeier | title = A survey of Linux Web development tools | url = http://programming.linux.com/programming/05/10/03/1828224.shtml?tid=63&tid=47 | accessdate = December 16, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019021449/http://programming.linux.com/programming/05/10/03/1828224.shtml?tid=63&tid=47 | archivedate = October 19, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Hardware support ==\n[[File:Linux kernel ubiquity.svg|thumb|right|500px|Linux is ubiquitously found on various types of hardware.]]\n{{See also|List of Linux-supported computer architectures}}\n\nThe Linux kernel is a widely [[porting|ported]] operating system kernel, available for devices ranging from mobile phones to supercomputers; it runs on a highly diverse range of [[computer architecture]]s, including the hand-held [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based [[iPAQ]] and the [[IBM]] [[mainframe computer|mainframes]] [[IBM System z9|System z9]] or [[IBM System z9|System z10]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.freeos.com/articles/4737/ | title = If I could re-write Linux | first = Prakash | last = Advani | date = February 8, 2004 | accessdate = January 23, 2007 | publisher = freeos.com | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070123143037/http://www.freeos.com/articles/4737/ | archivedate = January 23, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Specialized distributions and kernel forks exist for less mainstream architectures; for example, the [[ELKS]] kernel [[fork (software development)|fork]] can run on [[Intel 8086]] or [[Intel 80286]] [[16-bit]] microprocessors, while the [[µClinux]] kernel fork may run on systems without a [[memory management unit]].

A [[display server]] is another component, which for the longest time has been communicating in the X11 display server protocol with its clients; prominent software talking X11 includes the [[X.Org Server]] and [[Xlib]]. Frustration over the cumbersome X11 core protocol, and especially over its numerous extensions, has led to the creation of a new display server protocol, [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]].\n\nInstalling, updating and removing software in Linux is typically done through the use of package managers such as the [[Synaptic Package Manager]], [[PackageKit]], and [[Yellow dog Updater, Modified|Yum Extender]]. While most major Linux distributions have extensive repositories, often containing tens of thousands of packages, not all the software that can run on Linux is available from the official repositories. Alternatively, users can install packages from unofficial repositories, download pre-compiled packages directly from websites, or compile the source code by themselves. All these methods come with different degrees of difficulty; compiling the source code is in general considered a challenging process for new Linux users, but it is hardly needed in modern distributions and is not a method specific to Linux.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Samples of graphical desktop interfaces\" width=\"180px\" height=\"120\">\nFile:Ubuntu 15.10 with Firefox and Nautilus open.png|[[Unity (user interface)|Unity]]\nFile:Linux Mint 17 (Qiana) Cinnamon.png|[[Cinnamon (software)|Cinnamon]]\nFile:GNOME Shell.png|[[GNOME]]\nFile:E17 bw screenshot.png|[[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]]\nFile:Kubuntu 15.04.alpha1 with plasma5.png|[[KDE Plasma Desktop|KDE Plasma]]\nFile:Lubuntu 13.04 English.png|[[LXDE]]\nFile:Screenshot of LXQt 0.7.png|[[LXQt]]\nFile:Ubuntu MATE 16.04 screenshot.png|[[Mate desktop|Mate]]\nFile:Elementary OS 0.3.1.png|[[Pantheon (desktop environment)|Pantheon]]\nFile:Fluxbox.png|[[Fluxbox]]\nFile:Sugar-home-view-0.82.jpg|[[Sugar (desktop environment)|Sugar]]\nFile:Screenshot of Trinity 3.5.12.png|[[Trinity (desktop environment)|Trinity]]\nFile:XFCE-4.12-Desktop.png|[[Xfce]]\nFile:I3-gaps-wiki.png|[[i3 (window manager)|i3-gaps]]\nFile:Budgie Desktop.png|[[Budgie (desktop environment)|Budgie]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Netbooks ===\nLinux distributions have also become popular in the [[netbook]] market, with many devices such as the [[Asus Eee PC]] and [[Aspire One|Acer Aspire One]] shipping with customized Linux distributions installed.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/may/28/netbooks-sales | title=Are netbooks losing their shine? | accessdate=June 2, 2010 | location=London | date=May 28, 2009 | work=The Guardian | first=Jack | last=Schofield | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221110306/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/may/28/netbooks-sales | archivedate=December 21, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Google announced its [[Chrome&nbsp;OS]] as a minimal Linux-based operating system, using the [[Chrome browser]] as the main user interface.

There are two main methods for creating a specialized Linux distribution: building from scratch or from a general-purpose distribution as a base. The distributions often used for this purpose include [[Debian]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] (which is itself based on Debian), [[Arch Linux]], [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]], and [[Slackware]]. In contrast, Linux distributions built from scratch do not have general-purpose bases; instead, they focus on the [[JeOS]] philosophy by including only necessary components and avoiding [[System resource|resource]] overhead caused by components considered redundant in the distribution's use cases.\n\n==== Home theater PC ====\nA [[home theater PC]] (HTPC) is a PC that is mainly used as an entertainment system, especially a [[Home theater system]]. It is normally connected to a television, and often an additional audio system.\n\n[[OpenELEC]], a Linux distribution that incorporates the media center software [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]], is an OS tuned specifically for an HTPC. Having been built from the ground up adhering to the JeOS principle, the OS is very lightweight and very suitable for the confined usage range of an HTPC.\n\nThere are also special editions of Linux distributions that include the [[MythTV]] media center software, such as [[Mythbuntu]], a special edition of Ubuntu.\n\n==== Digital security ====\n[[Kali Linux]] is a Debian-based Linux distribution designed for [[digital forensics]] and [[penetration test]]ing. It comes preinstalled with several software applications for penetration testing and identifying [[Exploit (computer security)|security exploits]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://docs.kali.org/introduction/what-is-kali-linux|title = What is Kali Linux?|accessdate = June 13, 2014|website = Kali Linux|publisher = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140527164453/http://docs.kali.org/introduction/what-is-kali-linux|archivedate = May 27, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The Ubuntu derivative [[BackBox]] provides pre-installed security and network analysis tools for ethical hacking.\n\nThere are many Linux distributions created with privacy, secrecy, network anonymity and information security in mind, including [[Tails (operating system)|Tails]], [[Tin Hat Linux]] and [[Tinfoil Hat Linux]]. [[Lightweight Portable Security]] is a distribution based on Arch Linux and developed by the [[United States Department of Defense]]. [[Tor-ramdisk]] is a minimal distribution created solely to host the network anonymity software [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].\n\n==== System rescue ====\nLinux [[Live CD]] sessions have long been used as a tool for recovering data from a broken computer system and for repairing the system. Building upon that idea, several Linux distributions tailored for this purpose have emerged, most of which use [[GParted]] as a partition editor, with additional data recovery and system repair software:\n* [[Gparted live|GParted Live]]{{snd}} a Debian-based distribution developed by the GParted project.\n* [[Parted Magic]]{{snd}} a commercial Linux distribution.\n* [[SystemRescueCD]]{{snd}} a Gentoo-based distribution with support for editing Windows [[Windows Registry|registry]].\n\n==== In space ====\n[[SpaceX]] uses multiple redundant [[:Category:Avionics computers|flight computers]] in a [[fault-tolerant design]] in the [[Falcon&nbsp;9]] rocket. Each Merlin engine is controlled by three [[Voting logic|voting]] computers, with two physical processors per computer that constantly check each other's operation. Linux is not inherently fault-tolerant (no operating system is, as it is a function of the whole system including the hardware), but the flight computer software makes it so for its purpose.<ref name=aw20121118/> For flexibility, [[commercial off-the-shelf]] parts and system-wide \"radiation-tolerant\" design are used instead of [[radiation hardened]] parts.<ref name=aw20121118>{{cite news|last=Svitak |first=Amy |title=Dragon's \"Radiation-Tolerant\" Design |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog%3a04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&plckPostId=Blog%3a04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post%3aa8b87703-93f9-4cdf-885f-9429605e14df |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=November 18, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203204735/http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog%3A04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&plckPostId=Blog%3A04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post%3Aa8b87703-93f9-4cdf-885f-9429605e14df |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> {{As of|June 2015}}, SpaceX has made 19 launches of the Falcon&nbsp;9 since 2010, out of which 18 have successfully delivered their primary payloads to [[Earth orbit]], including some support missions for the [[International Space Station]].\n\nIn addition, Windows was used as an operating system on non-mission critical systems{{mdashb}}laptops used on board the space station, for example{{mdashb}}but it has been replaced with Linux; the first Linux-powered humanoid robot is also undergoing in-flight testing.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com/to-the-space-station-and-beyond-with-linux-7000014958/ |title=To the space station and beyond with Linux |author=Steven J.

They also include tools for administering and building school computer labs and computer-based classrooms, such as the [[Linux Terminal Server Project]] (LTSP).\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Instant WebKiosk]] and [[Webconverger]] are browser-based Linux distributions often used in web [[Interactive kiosk|kiosks]] and [[digital signage]]. [[Thinstation]] is a minimalist distribution designed for [[thin client]]s. [[Rocks Cluster Distribution]] is tailored for [[HPCC|high-performance computing clusters]].\n\nThere are general-purpose Linux distributions that target a specific audience, such as users of a specific language or geographical area. Such examples include [[Ubuntu Kylin]] for Chinese language users and [[BlankOn]] targeted at Indonesians. Profession-specific distributions include [[Ubuntu Studio]] for media creation and [[DNALinux]] for [[bioinformatics]]. There is also a Muslim-oriented distribution of the name [[Sabily]], as well as an Arabic-focused distribution called [[Ojuba Linux]] that consequently also provides some Islamic tools. Certain organizations use slightly specialized Linux distributions internally, including [[GendBuntu]] used by the French [[National Gendarmerie]], [[Goobuntu]] used internally by Google, and [[Astra Linux]] developed specifically for the Russian army.\n\n== Market share and uptake ==\n{{Main|Linux adoption}}\n{{See also|Usage share of operating systems}}\n\nMany quantitative studies of [[free software|free]]/open-source software focus on topics including market share and reliability, with numerous studies specifically examining Linux.<ref>{{cite web | first = David A | last = Wheeler | url = http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html | title = Why Open Source Software/Free Software (OSS/FS)?
