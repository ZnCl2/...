It is the default [[Microkernel#Microkernels|microkernel]] in the [[GNU Hurd]]. GNU Mach runs on [[IA-32]] machines. GNU Mach is maintained by developers on the GNU project. It is distributed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).\n\n==History==\nEarly versions of the Hurd were developed on top of [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]]'s Mach 3.0.<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/history/hurd-announce Initial announcement of the Hurd], mentioning Mach 3.0</ref>\n\nIn 1994, CMU stopped working on Mach, and the GNU Project switched to the [[University of Utah]]'s Mach 4. The kernel known as \"GNU Mach\" was derived from Mach 4 once Utah stopped development. The first ChangeLog entry by [[Thomas Bushnell]] (rather than by a Utah researcher) is from 16 December 1996.<ref>{{URL|https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/history/hurd-flash6}}</ref><ref>[http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/1999/08/msg00191.html \"Re: Which Mach is GNU Mach?\" e-mail from Roland McGrath to Pontus Lidman on the debian-hurd mailing list (25 Aug 1999)]</ref><ref>[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/gnumach.git/log/ A GNU Mach ChangeLog]</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Roland McGrath branched the OSKit-Mach branch from GNU Mach 1.2, intending to replace all the device drivers and some of the hardware support with code from OSKit. After the release of GNU Mach 1.3, this branch was intended to become the GNU Mach 2.0 main line; however, as of 2006, OSKit-Mach is not being developed.<ref>[http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/hurd/gnumach/%3Dannounce-oskit-mach-1.2.90?view=markup OSKit-Mach announcement]</ref><ref name=\"1.3-announce\">[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2002-05/msg00778.html GNU Mach 1.3 release announcement]</ref><ref>[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2006-10/msg00022.html \"Re: mach4 & gnumach/oskit...\" e-mail by Thomas Schwinge to bug-hurd mailing list (10 Oct 2006)]</ref>\n\nGNU Mach 1.4 was released on 27 September 2013, eleven years after 1.3.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.hurd.bugs/23683 |title=Happy 30th birthday, GNU!
