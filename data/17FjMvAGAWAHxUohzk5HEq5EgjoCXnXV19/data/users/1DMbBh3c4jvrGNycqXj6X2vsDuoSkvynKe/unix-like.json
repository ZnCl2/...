A Unix-like [[Application software|application]] is one that behaves like the corresponding [[List of Unix commands|Unix command]] or [[Unix shell|shell]]. There is no [[Technical standard|standard]] for defining the term, and some difference of opinion is possible as to the degree to which a given operating system or application is \"Unix-like\".\n\nThe term can include [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] operating systems inspired by [[Bell Labs]]' Unix or designed to emulate its features, commercial and proprietary work-alikes, and even versions based on the [[software license|licensed]] UNIX source code (which may be sufficiently \"Unix-like\" to pass certification and bear the \"UNIX\" trademark).\n\n== Definition ==\n[[The Open Group]] owns the [[UNIX]] [[trademark]] and administers the Single UNIX Specification, with the \"UNIX\" name being used as a [[certification mark]].  They do not approve of the construction \"Unix-like\", and consider it a misuse of their trademark.  Their guidelines require \"UNIX\" to be presented in uppercase or otherwise distinguished from the surrounding text, strongly encourage using it as a branding adjective for a generic word such as \"system\", and discourage its use in hyphenated phrases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/content/legal-trademark-guidelines|title=Legal: Trademark Guidelines|publisher=The Open Group|accessdate=November 4, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002190823/http://www.opengroup.org/content/legal-trademark-guidelines|archivedate=October 2, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nOther parties frequently treat \"Unix\" as a [[genericized trademark]]. Some add a [[wildcard character]] to the name to make an abbreviation like  \"Un*x\"<ref name=\"jargonfile_UNasteriskX\">{{cite web|title=UN*X|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/U/UN-asterisk-X.html|accessdate=January 22, 2009|author=[[Eric S.

These patterns do not literally match many system names, but are still generally recognized to refer to any UNIX descendant or work-alike system, even those with completely dissimilar names such as [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]/[[macOS]], [[illumos]]/[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] or [[FreeBSD]].\n\nIn 2007, Wayne R. Gray sued to dispute the status of UNIX as a trademark, but lost his case, and lost again on appeal, with the court upholding the trademark and its ownership.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Gray v.

Many [[proprietary software|proprietary]] versions, such as [[Idris (operating system)|Idris]] (1978), [[UNOS (operating system)|UNOS]] (1982), [[Coherent (operating system)|Coherent]] (1983), and [[UniFlex]] (1985), aimed to provide businesses with the functionality available to academic users of UNIX.\n\nWhen [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] allowed relatively inexpensive commercial binary sub-licensing of UNIX in 1979, a variety of proprietary systems were developed based on it, including [[IBM AIX|AIX]], [[HP-UX]], [[IRIX]], [[SunOS]], [[Tru64 UNIX|Tru64]], [[Ultrix]], and [[Xenix]]. These largely displaced the proprietary clones.  Growing incompatibility among these systems led to the creation of interoperability standards, including [[POSIX]] and the [[Single UNIX Specification]].\n\nVarious free, low-cost, and unrestricted substitutes for UNIX emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, including [[Berkeley Software Distribution|4.4BSD]], [[Linux]], and [[Minix]]. Some of these have in turn been the basis for commercial \"Unix-like\" systems, such as [[BSD/OS]] and [[macOS]]. Several versions of (Mac) OS X/macOS running on Intel-based Mac computers have been certified under the [[Single UNIX Specification]].<ref name=\"leopard_unix_cert\">{{cite web | url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3555.htm | title=Mac OS X Version 10.5 on Intel-based Macintosh computers | publisher=The Open Group | accessdate=December 4, 2014\n}}</ref><ref name=\"snow_leopard_unix_cert\">{{cite web | url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3581.htm | title=Mac OS X Version 10.6 on Intel-based Macintosh computers | publisher=The Open Group | accessdate=December 4, 2014\n}}</ref><ref name=\"mountain_lion_unix_cert\">{{cite web | url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3591.htm | title=Mac OS X Version 10.8 on Intel-based Macintosh computers<!-- Yes, the page in question really does say \"Mac OS X\"; don't \"fix\" this to say \"OS X\" --> | publisher=The Open Group| accessdate=December 4, 2014\n}}</ref><ref name=\"mavericks_unix_cert\">{{cite web | url = http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3602.htm | title=OS X Version 10.9 on Intel-based Macintosh computers | publisher=The Open Group | accessdate=December 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3607.htm | title=OS X version 10.10 Yosemite on Intel-based Mac computers | publisher=The Open Group| accessdate=October 23, 2015\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3612.htm | title=OS X version 10.11 El Capitan on Intel-based Mac computers | publisher=The Open Group| accessdate=October 23, 2015\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3627.htm | title=macOS version 10.12 Sierra on Intel-based Mac computers | publisher=The Open Group| accessdate=October 13, 2016\n}}</ref> The BSD variants are descendants of UNIX developed by the University of California at Berkeley with UNIX source code from Bell Labs. However, the BSD code base has evolved since then, replacing all of the AT&T code. Since the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] variants are not certified as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification, they are referred to as \"UNIX-like\" rather than \"UNIX\".\n\n== Categories ==\n[[Dennis Ritchie]], one of the original creators of Unix, expressed his opinion that Unix-like systems such as [[Linux]] are ''[[de facto]]'' Unix systems.<ref>[http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/July1999/article79.html Interview with Dennis M. Ritchie] Manuel Benet, ''LinuxFocus'', July 1999</ref> [[Eric S. Raymond]] and Rob Landley have suggested that there are three kinds of Unix-like systems:<ref>[http://catb.org/~esr/hackerlore/sco-vs-ibm.html#id305450 The meaning of 'Unix'] Eric Raymond and Rob Landley, ''OSI Position Paper on the SCO-vs.-IBM Complaint''</ref>\n\n;Genetic UNIX\n: Those systems with a historical connection to the [[AT&T]] codebase. Most (but not all) commercial UNIX systems fall into this category. So do the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] systems, which are descendants of work done at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some of these systems have no original AT&T code but can still trace their ancestry to AT&T designs.\n\n;Trademark or branded UNIX\n: These systems{{mdashb}}largely commercial in nature{{mdashb}}have been determined by the [[Open Group]] to meet the [[Single UNIX Specification]] and are allowed to carry the UNIX name. Most such systems are commercial derivatives of the [[System V]] code base in one form or another, although Apple [[macOS]] [[Mac OS X Leopard|10.5]] and later is a [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] variant that has been certified, and a few other systems (such as IBM [[z/OS]]) earned the trademark through a [[POSIX]] [[compatibility layer]] and are not otherwise inherently Unix systems.  Many [[ancient UNIX]] systems no longer meet this definition.\n\n;Functional UNIX\n: Broadly, any Unix-like system that behaves in a manner roughly consistent with the UNIX specification, including having a \"[[Shell (computing)|program]] which manages your login and [[command line interpreter|command line sessions]]\";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://structbio.vanderbilt.edu/comp/unix/part01.php |title=Introduction to UNIX - Part 1: Basic Concepts |accessdate=April 4, 2014}}</ref> more specifically, this can refer to systems such as [[Linux]] or [[Minix]] that behave similarly to a UNIX system but have no genetic or trademark connection to the AT&T code base. Most free/open-source implementations of the UNIX design, whether genetic UNIX or not, fall into the restricted definition of this third category due to the expense of obtaining Open Group certification, which costs thousands of dollars{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} for commercial closed source systems.\n: Around 2001, Linux was given the opportunity to get a certification including free help from the POSIX chair Andrew Josey for the symbolic price of one dollar.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} There have been some activities to make Linux POSIX-compliant, with Josey having prepared a list of differences between the POSIX standard and the [[Linux Standard Base]] specification,<ref>{{cite web|title=Conflicts between ISO/IEC 9945 (POSIX) and the Linux Standard Base|url=http://www.opengroup.org/personal/ajosey/tr20-08-2005.txt|author=Andrew Josey|publisher=The Open Group|date=August 20, 2005|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref> but in August 2005, this project was shut down because of missing interest at the LSB work group.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==Compatibility layers==\nSome non-Unix-like operating systems provide a Unix-like [[compatibility layer]], with variable degrees of Unix-like functionality.\n* IBM [[z/OS]]'s [[UNIX System Services]] is sufficiently complete to be certified as trademark UNIX.\n* [[Cygwin]] and [[MSYS]] both provide a [[GNU]] environment on top of the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows API|user API]], sufficient for most common [[open source]] software to be compiled and run.\n* The [[MKS Toolkit]] and [[UWIN]] are comprehensive interoperability tools which allow the porting of Unix programmes to Windows.\n* Windows NT type systems have a [[Posix]] [[environmental subsystem]]\n* [[Subsystem for Unix-based Applications]] (previously [[Interix]]) provides Unix-like functionality as a [[Windows NT]] [[Architecture of Windows NT|subsystem]] (discontinued).\n* [[Windows Subsystem for Linux]] provides a [[Linux]]-compatible kernel interface developed by Microsoft and containing no Linux code, with [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] user-mode [[Executable and Linkable Format|binaries]] running on top of it.<ref>[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about BASH Running in Ubuntu on Windows - MSDN]</ref>\n\nOther means of Windows-Unix interoperability include:\n* The above Windows packages can be used with various X servers for Windows\n* [[Hummingbird Connectivity]] provides several ways for Windows machines to connect to Unix and Linux machines, from terminal emulators to X clients and servers, and others\n* The Windows [[Resource Kit]]s for versions of Windows NT include a [[Bourne Shell]], some command-line tools, and a version of [[Perl]]\n* The [[Hamilton C Shell]] is a version of csh written specifically for Windows.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Information technology}}\n\n* [[Berkeley Software Distribution]]\n* [[Linux distribution]]\n* [[List of Linux distributions]]\n* [[List of Unix utilities]]\n* [[List of operating systems]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html Unix-like Definition], by The Linux Information Project (LINFO)\n* [http://www.levenez.com/unix/ UNIX history]{{snd}} a history time line graph of most UNIX and Unix-like systems by Éric Lévénez\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040622001238/http://www.grokline.net:80/ |date=June 22, 2004 |title=Grokline's UNIX Ownership History Project{{snd }} a project to map out the technical history of UNIX and Unix-like systems}}\n\n{{Unix-like}}\n{{Unix shells}}\n{{Unix commands}}\n{{Operating system}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Unix-Like}}\n[[Category:Unix]]\n[[Category:Unix variants| ]]",
