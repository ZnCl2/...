Depending on each nation's laws and judicial systems, the legality of and the permission required to engage in mass surveillance varies. It is often distinguished from [[targeted surveillance]].\n\nMass surveillance has often been cited as necessary to fight [[terrorism]], to prevent [[social unrest]], to protect [[national security]], to fight [[child pornography]] and [[child protection|protect children]] and to control the population. Conversely, mass surveillance has equally often been criticized for violating [[privacy]] rights, limiting [[Civil and political rights|civil and political rights and freedoms]], and being illegal under some legal or constitutional systems. Another criticism is that increasing mass surveillance could lead to the development of a [[#Surveillance state|surveillance state]] or an [[#Electronic police state|electronic police state]] where civil liberties are infringed or political dissent is undermined by [[COINTELPRO]]-like programs. Such a state could be referred to as a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]].\n\nIn 2013, the practice of mass surveillance by world<ref>\n{{citation\n|url=http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/u-s-prism-meet-chinas-golden-shield/\n|title=U.S. Prism, Meet China\\u2019s Golden Shield\n|last=TATLOW\n|first=DIDI KIRSTEN\n|date=2013-06-28\n|publisher=\n|quote= [...] a Beijing lawyer named Xie Yanyi filed a public information request with the police asking about China's own surveillance operations.

Balancing these factors, eight countries were rated as being 'endemic surveillance societies'. Of these eight, [[China]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Russia]] scored lowest, followed jointly by [[Singapore]] and the [[United Kingdom]], then jointly by [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]] and the [[United States]]. The best ranking was given to [[Greece]], which was judged to have 'adequate safeguards against abuse'.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.privacyinternational.org/reports/surveillance-monitor-2007-international-country-rankings |title=Surveillance Monitor 2007 - International country rankings |publisher=[[Privacy International]] |date=28 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nMany countries throughout the world have already been adding thousands of surveillance cameras to their urban, suburban and even rural areas.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=9662 |title=Police Surveillance: Go Snoop, Yourself |author=Tom Steinert-Threlkeld |publisher=ZDNet |date=13 August 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"yougov1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.yougov.co.uk/extranets/ygarchives/content/pdf/TEL060101024_3.pdf |title=YouGov / Daily Telegraph Survey Results |year=2006 |publisher=YouGov |accessdate=15 September 2013}}</ref> For example, in September 2007 the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) stated that we are \"in danger of tipping into a genuine surveillance society completely alien to American values\" with \"the potential for a dark future where our every move, our every transaction, our every communication is recorded, compiled, and stored away, ready to be examined and used against us by the authorities whenever they want.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/why-surveillance-society-clock |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |title= Why a Surveillance Society Clock? |date=4 September 2007 |accessdate=15 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2013 [[Reporters Without Borders]] published a ''Special report on Internet Surveillance''. The report included a list of \"State Enemies of the Internet\", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Five countries were placed on the initial list: [[Bahrain]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], and [[Vietnam]].<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013>[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ ''The Enemies of the Internet Special Edition : Surveillance''], Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main article|Mass surveillance in Australia}}\n\n===Bahrain===\n[[Bahrain]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of \"State Enemies of the Internet\", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. The level of Internet filtering and surveillance in Bahrain is one of the highest in the world. The royal family is represented in all areas of Internet management and has sophisticated tools at its disposal for spying on its subjects. The online activities of dissidents and news providers are closely monitored and the surveillance is increasing.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main article|Mass surveillance in Canada}}\n\n===China===\n{{Main article|Mass surveillance in China}}\n[[China]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of \"State Enemies of the Internet\", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. All Internet access in China is owned or controlled by the state or the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]. Many foreign journalists in China have said that they take for granted that their telephones are tapped and their email is monitored.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>\n\nThe tools put in place to filter and monitor the Internet are collectively known as the [[Great Firewall of China]]. Besides the usual routing regulations that allow access to an IP address or a particular domain name to be blocked, the Great Firewall makes large-scale use of [[Deep Packet Inspection]] (DPI) technology to monitor and block access based on keyword detection. The Great Firewall has the ability to dynamically block encrypted connections. One of the country’s main ISPs, [[China Unicom]], automatically cuts a connection as soon as it is used to transmit encrypted content.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>\n\nThe monitoring system developed by China is not confined to the Great Firewall, monitoring is also built into social networks, chat services and VoIP. Private companies are directly responsible to the Chinese authorities for surveillance of their networks to ensure banned messages are not circulated. The QQ application, owned by the firm Tencent, allows the authorities to monitor in detail exchanges between Internet users by seeking certain keywords and expressions. The author of each message can be identified by his or her user number. The QQ application is effectively a giant Trojan horse. And since March 2012, new legislation requires all new users of micro-blogging sites to register using their own name and telephone number.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>\n\n[[Skype]], one of the world’s most popular Internet telephone platforms, is closely monitored. Skype services in China are available through a local partner, the TOM media group. The Chinese-language version of Skype, known as [[TOM-Skype]], is slightly different from the downloadable versions in other countries. A report by [[OpenNet Initiative|OpenNet Initiative Asia]]<ref>[http://www.oni-asia.net/ ONI Asia], web site, OpenNet Initiative, retrieved 15 September 2013.</ref> says everyday conversations are captured on servers. Interception and storage of a conversation may be triggered by a sender’s or recipient’s name or by keywords that occur in the conversation.<ref>[http://www.nartv.org/mirror/breachingtrust.pdf \"Breaching Trust: An analysis of surveillance and security practices on China's TOM-Skype platform\"], Nart Villeneuve, Information Warfare Monitor and ONI Asia, 1 October 2008.</ref>\n\nOn 30 January, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that it had been the target of attacks by the Chinese government. The first breach took place on 13 September 2012 when the newspaper was preparing to publish an article about the fortune amassed by the family of outgoing Prime Minister [[Wen Jiabao]]. The newspaper said the purpose of attacks was to identify the sources that supplied the newspaper with information about corruption among the prime minister’s entourage. The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[CNN]]'' also said they had been the targets of cyber attacks from China. In February, [[Twitter]] disclosed that the accounts of some 250,000 subscribers had been the victims of attacks from China similar to those carried out on the ''New York Times''. Mandiant, the company engaged by the NYT to secure its network, identified the source of the attacks as a group of hackers it called Advanced Persistent Threat 1, a unit of the People’s Liberation Army operating from a 12-storey building in the suburbs of Shanghai that had hundreds, possibly thousands, of staff and the direct support of the Chinese government.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/>\n\n===East Germany===\n{{Main article|Mass surveillance in East Germany}}\nBefore the Digital Revolution, one of the world's biggest mass surveillance operations was carried out by the [[Stasi]], the [[secret police]] of the former [[East Germany]]. By the time the state collapsed in 1989, the Stasi had built up an estimated civilian network of 300,000 informants (approximately one in fifty of the population), who monitored even minute hints of political dissent among other citizens. Many [[West Germany|West Germans]] visiting friends and family in East Germany were also subject to Stasi spying, as well as many high-ranking West German politicians and persons in the public eye.\n\nMost East German citizens were well aware that their government was spying on them, which led to a culture of mistrust: touchy political issues were only discussed in the comfort of their own four walls and only with the closest of friends and family members, while widely maintaining a façade of unquestioning followership in public.\n\n===European Union===\nThe right to [[privacy]] is a highly developed area of law in Europe. The [[Data Protection Directive]] regulates the processing of personal data within the [[European Union]]. For comparison, the US has no data protection law that is comparable to this; instead, the US regulates data protection on a sectoral basis.<ref>See Julia M. Fromholz, The European Union Data Privacy Directive, 15 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 471, 472 (2000); Dean William Harvey & Amy White, The Impact of Computer Security Regulation on American Companies, 8 Tex.

Int’l L. 169 (2003).</ref>\n\nSince early 2012, the European Union has been working on a [[General Data Protection Regulation]] to replace the [[Data Protection Directive]] and harmonise data protection and privacy law. On 20 October 2013, a committee at the [[European Parliament]] backed the measure, which, if it is enacted, could require American companies to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data. The vote is part of efforts in Europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures|revelations about a far-reaching spying program]] by the [[U.S. National Security Agency]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/business/international/eu-panel-backs-plan-to-shield-online-data.html \"Rules Shielding Online Data From N.S.A. and Other Prying Eyes Advance in Europe\"], James Kanter and Mike Scott, ''New York Times'', 21 October 2013.

Concern has been expressed that governments may use this information to conduct mass surveillance on their populations. Commercial mass surveillance often makes use of [[copyright]] laws and \"[[Clickwrap|user agreements]]\" to obtain (typically uninformed) 'consent' to surveillance from consumers who use their software or other related materials. This allows gathering of information which would be technically illegal if performed by government agencies. This data is then often shared with government agencies - thereby - in practice - defeating the purpose of such privacy protections.\n\nOne of the most common forms of mass surveillance is carried out by commercial organizations. Many people are willing to join supermarket and grocery [[loyalty card]] programs, trading their personal information and surveillance of their shopping habits in exchange for a discount on their groceries, although base prices might be increased to encourage participation in the program. Since a significant proportion of purchases are carried out by credit or debit cards, which can also be easily tracked, it is questionable whether loyalty cards provide any significant additional privacy threat.\n\nThrough programs like [[Google]]'s [[AdSense]], [[OpenSocial]] and their increasing pool of so-called \"web gadgets\", \"social gadgets\" and other Google-hosted services many web sites on the Internet are effectively feeding user information about sites visited by the users, and now also their social connections, to Google. [[Facebook]] also keep this information, although its acquisition is limited to page views within Facebook. This data is valuable for authorities, advertisers and others interested in profiling users, trends and web site marketing performance. Google, Facebook and others are increasingly becoming more guarded about this data as their reach increases and the data becomes more all inclusive, making it more valuable.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/05/15/he-said-she-said-in-google-v-facebook/ |title=He Said, She Said In Google v.
