POSIX defines the [[application programming interface]] (API), along with command line [[Unix shell|shell]]s and utility interfaces, for software compatibility with variants of [[Unix]] and other operating systems.<ref name = \"FAQ\" /><ref name = \"IET\">{{cite web\n| title = POSIX\n| url = http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/posix/\n| work = Standards\n| publisher = IEEE}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nOriginally, the name \"POSIX\" referred to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, released in 1988. The family of POSIX standards is formally designated as '''IEEE 1003''' and the international standard name is [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 9945.\n\nThe standards emerged from a project that began circa 1985. [[Richard Stallman]] suggested the name ''POSIX'' to the IEEE instead of former ''IEEE-IX''. The committee found it more easily pronounceable and memorable, and thus adopted it.<ref name = \"FAQ\">{{cite web\n|date = 2 February 2006\n|title = POSIX 1003.1 FAQ Version 1.12\n|url = http://www.opengroup.org/austin/papers/posix_faq.html\n|accessdate =16 July 2006}}</ref><ref name = \"RMS\">{{cite web\n|year = 2011\n|title = The origin of the name POSIX.\n|url = http://stallman.org/articles/posix.html\n|accessdate = 28 September 2013}}</ref>{{better source|IEEEIX/POSIX source|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Overview==\nUnix was selected as the basis for a standard system interface partly because it was \"manufacturer-neutral\". However, several major versions of Unix existed—so there was a need to develop a common denominator system. The POSIX specifications for [[Unix-like]] operating systems originally consisted of a single document for the core programming interface, but eventually grew to 19 separate documents (POSIX.1, POSIX.2, etc.).<ref>{{Cite report|date= 2003-12-04 |title= PASC Status (including POSIX) |url= http://www.pasc.org/standing/sd11.html |publisher= [[IEEE Computer Society]] |accessdate= 2015-03-01 }}</ref>  The standardized user [[command-line interface|command line]] and [[command-line interface#Command-line interpreter|scripting interface]] were based on the [[UNIX System V]] shell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/xrat/V4_xcu_chap02.html|title=Shell Command Language - The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, 2013 Edition}}</ref> Many user-level programs, services, and utilities (including [[AWK|awk]], [[echo (command)|echo]], [[ed (text editor)|ed]]) were also standardized, along with required program-level services (including basic [[input/output|I/O]]: [[computer file|file]], [[computer terminal|terminal]], and [[computer network|network]]). POSIX also defines a standard [[thread (computing)|threading]] library API which is supported by most modern operating systems. In 2008, most parts of POSIX were combined into a single standard ''(IEEE Std 1003.1-2008'', also known as ''POSIX.1-2008).''\n\n{{As of | 2014 }}, POSIX documentation is divided in two parts:\n* POSIX.1, 2013 Edition: POSIX Base Definitions, System Interfaces, and Commands and Utilities (which include POSIX.1, extensions for POSIX.1, Real-time Services, Threads Interface, Real-time Extensions, Security Interface, Network File Access and Network Process-to-Process Communications, User Portability Extensions, Corrections and Extensions, Protection and Control Utilities and Batch System Utilities.
