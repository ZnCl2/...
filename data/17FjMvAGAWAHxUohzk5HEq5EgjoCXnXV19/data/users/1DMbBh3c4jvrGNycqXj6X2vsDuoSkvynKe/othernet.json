Due to trademark issues, the name of the company and service was changed in July 2018. The name '''[http://www.outernetglobal.com Outernet]''' is now owned by Outernet Global Ltd, a media sales, music and property venture backed by [[The Blackstone Group]]. Othernet sells a portable satellite data receiver that combines an amplifier, radio, and CPU in a single unit. The company's goal is to make news, information, and education accessible to everyone.\n\nOthernet's goal is to provide free access to content from the web through geostationary and [[low Earth orbit]] satellites, made available effectively to all parts of the world.  The project currently uses [[datacasting]] conventional [[Geosynchronous satellite|geostationary communications satellites]] in a [[satellite constellation]] network. [[Wi-Fi]] enabled devices would communicate with the satellite [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]s, which receive data broadcasts from satellites.<ref name=\"Discovery\">{{cite news|title='Othernet' Project Seeks Free Internet Access For Earth|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/gear-and-gadgets/outernet-project-seeks-free-internet-access-for-earth-140225.htm|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=[[Discovery News]]|date=25 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"RT\">{{cite news|title=Hundreds of tiny satellites could soon deliver free internet worldwide|url=http://rt.com/usa/outernet-cubesat-free-internet-153/|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]|date=23 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIt received its initial investment from the [[Media Development Investment Fund]], a [[United States]]-based impact investment fund and [[non-profit organization]] established in 1995 by [[Saša Vučinić]] and Stuart Auerbach.\n\n==History==\nOthernet turned on their first public satellite signal on August 11, 2014.<ref name=\"blog.outernet.is\">[http://blog.othernet.is/2014/08/press-release-outernet-test-signal-is.html Test Signal] (press release)</ref> Othernet transmitted 20 MB per day when it was using the [[L band]]. Othernet provided instructions for users to build their own receivers and encouraged people to do so, then to share their results with Othernet. Othernet's first signal was broadcast over [[Galaxy 19]] and [[Hot Bird]], covering North America, Europe, and parts of the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nOn October 1, 2014, Othernet released a major update accompanied by [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNx3vDSuzkY a video featuring burning books in an abandoned Detroit automotive factory]. The update included a redesign of the Othernet website and the release of Whiteboard, their content suggestion platform that allows anyone to suggest a URL for broadcast. Once a URL is submitted, other visitors may vote on it with the URLs receiving the most votes entering the Othernet broadcast carousel.<ref name=\"official\">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.fo/jbwNQ|title=Whiteboard v0.1a1|date=2014-10-14|website=archive.fo|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref> The Othernet broadcast is broken into three categories: the Queue, Sponsored Content, and the Core Archive.<ref>https://www.outernet.is/broadcast{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Content in the Queue is decided via votes on Whiteboard as well as requests via the Othernet Facebook page. Othernet plans to expand the avenues through which it is able to receive requests for content. Anyone can view what is being broadcast on Othernet at any time.<ref name=official/>\n\nAccording to MDIF, the initial content access includes international and local news, crop prices for farmers, [[Teachers Without Borders]], emergency communications such as disaster relief, applications and content such as [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], movies, music, games, and [[Wikipedia]] in its entirety.<ref name=MDIF>{{cite web|title=Information for the World from Outer Space|url=https://www.outernet.is/|publisher=Media Development Investment Fund|accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nRequests to [[NASA]] to use the [[International Space Station]] to test their technology were declined in June 2014 due to, as stated by a letter sent by the [[Center for the Advancement of Science in Space]] (CASIS) to the staff working for Othernet, both inaccuracies within the proposition, such as \"it is assumed that the NanoLab housing will be provided by the CASIS program outside the budget\", and costs ranging from $150,000 to $175,000.

They have stated that they plan to provide information about \"news, civic information, commodity prices, weather, construction plans for open source farm machinery\" and other types of information. They also have stated that they will be providing access to \"courseware,\" which includes textbooks, videos, and software. Othernet will be available also when access to regular Internet connection is down for any reason.<ref name=MDIF/>\n\n== Media coverage ==\n\nMedia coverage over the Othernet has ranged from excitement to skepticism.
