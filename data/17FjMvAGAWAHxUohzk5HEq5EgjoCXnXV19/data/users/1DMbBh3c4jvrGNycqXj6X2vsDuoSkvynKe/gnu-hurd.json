It has been under development since 1990 by the [[GNU Project]] of the [[Free Software Foundation]], designed as a replacement for the [[Unix]] kernel,<ref name=\"What Is the GNU Hurd\" /> and released as [[free software]] under the [[GNU General Public License]]. While the [[Linux kernel]] soon proved to be a more viable solution, development of GNU Hurd continued, albeit at a slow pace.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://thevarguy.com/open-source-application-software-companies/042015/30-years-hurd-lives-gnu-updates-open-source-|title=30 Years On, HURD Lives: GNU Updates Open Source Unix Kernel|last=Tozzi|first=Christopher|date=2015-04-20|website=thevarguy.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-17}}</ref>\n\nGNU Hurd consists of a set of protocols and [[server (computing)|server processes]] (or [[daemon (computer software)|daemons]], in [[Unix]] terminology) that run on the [[GNU Mach]] [[microkernel]].<ref name=\"What Is the GNU Hurd\"/> The Hurd aims to surpass the [[Unix]] kernel in functionality, security, and stability, while remaining largely compatible with it.

The logo is a graph where nodes represent the Hurd kernel's servers and directed edges are [[Inter-process communication|IPC]] messages.<ref name=\"Koen Vervloesem, 2010\"/>\n\n== Development history ==\n[[Richard Stallman]] founded the [[GNU Project]] in September 1983 with an aim to create a [[Free software|free]] [[GNU]] operating system.  Initially the components required for kernel development were written: [[Text editor|editors]], [[Unix shell|shell]], [[compiler]] and all the others.  By 1989, the [[GNU GPL]] came into being and the only major component missing was the kernel.<ref name=\"Richard Hillesley, 2010\">{{cite web |last=Hillesley |first=Richard |title=GNU HURD: Altered visions and lost promise | date=June 30, 2010 |url=http://www.h-online.com/open/features/GNU-HURD-Altered-visions-and-lost-promise-1030942.html |accessdate=October 1, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"linux-and-gnu\" />\n\nDevelopment on the Hurd began in 1990 after an abandoned kernel attempt in 1986, based on the research [[Trix (operating system)|TRIX]] operating system developed by Professor Steve Ward and his group at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT's]] [[Laboratory for Computer Science]] (LCS).<ref name=\"hurd-hist\" /> According to [[Thomas Bushnell]], the initial Hurd architect, their early plan was to adapt the [[4.4BSD]]-Lite kernel and, in hindsight, \"It is now perfectly obvious to me that this would have succeeded splendidly and the world would be a very different place today\".<ref name=\"hurd-and-bsdi\" /> In 1987 Richard Stallman proposed using the [[Mach (kernel)|Mach microkernel]] developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Work on this was delayed for three years due to uncertainty over whether CMU would release the Mach code under a suitable license.<ref name=\"hurd-hist\" />\n\nWith the release of the [[Linux kernel]] in 1991, the primary user of GNU's [[userland (computing)|userland]] components soon became operating systems based on the Linux kernel ([[Linux distribution]]s), prompting the coining of the term [[GNU/Linux naming controversy|''GNU/Linux'']].\n\nDevelopment of the Hurd has proceeded slowly. Despite an optimistic announcement by Stallman in 2002 predicting a release of GNU/Hurd later that year,<ref name=\"gnu-loose-linux\" /> the Hurd is still not considered suitable for production environments. Development in general has not met expectations, and there are still a significant number of bugs and missing features.<ref name=\"hurd-status\" /> This has resulted in a poorer product than many (including Stallman) had expected.<ref name=\"fsf-future-of-freedom\" /> In 2010, after twenty years under development, Stallman said that he was \"not very optimistic about the GNU Hurd. It makes some progress, but to be really superior it would require solving a lot of deep problems\", but added that \"finishing it is not crucial\" for the GNU system because a free kernel already existed ([[Linux]]), and completing Hurd would not address the main remaining problem for a free operating system: device support.<ref name=\"reddit-interview-stallman\" />\n\nThe [[Debian]] project, among others, have worked on the Hurd project to produce binary distributions of [[Debian GNU/Hurd|Hurd-based GNU operating systems]] for [[IBM PC compatible]] systems.\n\nAfter years of stagnation, development picked up again in 2015 and 2016, with four releases during these two years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://sdtimes.com/free-software-foundation-changes-priorities/|title=Free Software Foundation changes priorities - SD Times|date=2017-01-17|work=SD Times|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOn August 20, 2015, amid the [[Google Summer of Code]], it was announced that [[GNU Guix]] had been ported to GNU Hurd,<ref name=\"gsoc\">{{cite mailing list|url=https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2015-08/msg00379.html|title=[GSoC update] Porting Guix to GNU/Hurd|date=August 20, 2015|accessdate=August 20, 2015|first=Manolis|last=Ragkousis|publisher=guix-devel}}</ref> making it the first native package manager on the Hurd.<ref name=\"phoro\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=GNU-Hurd-Gets-Guix|title=GNU Guix Package Manager Ported To GNU Hurd|date=August 20, 2015|accessdate=August 20, 2015|publisher=[[Phoronix]]}}</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:OS-structure2.svg|thumb|600px|General structure of monolithic, microkernel and hybrid kernel-based operating systems, respectively.]]\n\nUnlike most [[Unix-like]] kernels, the Hurd uses a [[server–client architecture]], built on a [[microkernel]] that is responsible for providing the most basic [[kernel service]]s &ndash; coordinating access to the [[Computer hardware|hardware]]: the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] (through [[process management (computing)|process management]] and [[scheduling (computing)|scheduling]]), [[Random access memory|RAM]] (via [[memory management]]), and other various [[input/output]] devices (via [[I/O scheduling]]) for sound, graphics, mass storage, etc. In theory the microkernel design would allow for all device drivers to be built as servers working in [[user space]], but today most drivers of this kind are still contained in the [[GNU Mach]] [[kernel space]].<ref name=\"device-drivers-in-mach\" />\n\nAccording to Hurd developers, the main advantage of microkernel-based design is the ability to extend the system: developing a new module would not require in depth knowledge of the rest of the kernel, and a bug in one module would not crash the entire system. Hurd provides a concept of ''translators'', a framework of modules used to extend a file system functionality.<ref name=\"Doeppner2010\">{{cite book |last=Doeppner |first=Thomas W. |date=20 December 2010 |title=Operating Systems In Depth: Design and Programming |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-471-68723-8 |page=160 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xX5tfrAQQ8cC |accessdate=29 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFrom early on, the Hurd was developed to use [[GNU Mach]] as the microkernel. This was a technical decision made by [[Richard Stallman]], who thought it would speed up the work by saving a large part of it. He has admitted that he was wrong about that.<ref name=\"lt-defence-rh\" /> Other Unix-like systems working on the [[Mach kernel|Mach microkernel]] include [[OSF/1]], [[Lites]], and [[MkLinux]]. [[macOS]] and [[NeXTSTEP]] use [[hybrid kernel]]s based on Mach.\n\n=== Other microkernels ===\nFrom 2004 onward, various efforts were launched to port the Hurd to more modern microkernels. The [[L4 microkernel family|L4 microkernel]] was the original choice in 2004, but progress slowed to a halt. Nevertheless, during 2005, Hurd developer Neal Walfield finished the initial memory management framework for the L4/Hurd port, and Marcus Brinkmann ported essential parts of [[glibc]]; namely, getting the process startup code working, allowing programs to run, thus allowing the first user programs (trivial ones such as the [[hello world program]]) in C to run.\n\nSince 2005 Brinkmann and Walfield started researching Coyotos as a new kernel for HURD.<ref name=\"shapiro-comment\" /><ref name=\"l4-and-coyotos-mess\" /> In 2006, Brinkmann met with Jonathan Shapiro (a primary architect of the Coyotos Operating System) to aid in and discuss the use of the Coyotos kernel for GNU/Hurd. In further discussion HURD developers realised that Coyotos (as well as other similar kernels) are not suitable for HURD.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/history/port_to_another_microkernel.html | title = Porting the Hurd to another microkernel | access-date = 2017-05-06 | publisher = Free Software Foundation | website = GNU Hurd }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Hurd developers Neal Walfield and Marcus Brinkmann gave a critique of the Hurd architecture, known as \"the critique\",<ref name=\"critique-mach\" /> and a proposal for how a future system may be designed, known as \"the position paper\".<ref name=\"position-paper\" /> In 2008, Neal Walfield began working on the Viengoos microkernel as a modern native kernel for HURD. {{as of|2009}}, development on Viengoos is paused due to Walfield lacking time to work on it.<ref name=\"viengoos\" />\n\nIn the meantime, others have continued working on the Mach variant of Hurd.<ref name=\"what-happend-l4-coyotos\" />\n\n=== Unix extensions ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2007}}\n\nA number of traditional Unix concepts are replaced or extended in the Hurd.\n\nUnder Unix, every running program has an associated [[user id]], which normally corresponds to the user that started the [[process (computing)|process]]. This id largely dictates the actions permitted to the program. No outside process can change the user id of a running program. A Hurd process, on the other hand, runs under a ''set'' of user ids, which can contain multiple ids, one, or none. A sufficiently privileged process can add and remove ids to another process. For example, there is a password server that will hand out ids in return for a correct login password.\n\nRegarding the [[file system]], a suitable program can be designated as a ''translator'' for a single file or a whole directory hierarchy. Every access to the translated file, or files below a hierarchy in the second case, is in fact handled by the program. For example, a file translator may simply redirect read and write operations to another file, like a Unix [[symbolic link]]. The effect of Unix ''[[mount (computing)|mounting]]'' is achieved by setting up a filesystem translator (using the \"settrans\" command). Translators can also be used to provide services to the user. For example, the [[ftpfs]] translator allows a user to encapsulate remote FTP sites within a directory. Then, standard tools such as [[ls]], [[cp (Unix)|cp]], and [[rm (Unix)|rm]] can be used to manipulate files on the remote system. Even more powerful translators are ones such as [[UnionFS]], which allows a user to unify multiple directories into one; thus listing the unified directory reveals the contents of all the directories.\n\nThe Hurd requires a [[Multiboot Specification|multiboot]]-compliant [[booting|boot loader]], such as [[GNU GRUB|GRUB]].\n\n=== Architecture of the servers ===\nAccording to the Debian documentation, there are 24 servers (18 core servers and 6 file system servers) named as follows:<ref name=\"debian-hurd-doc\" />\n\n==== Core servers ====\n* '''auth''' ([[authentication server]]): Receives requests and passwords from programs and gives them an ID, which changes the privileges of the program.\n* '''crash''' ([[Crash (computing)|crash]] server): Handles all fatal errors.\n* '''exec''' (execution server): Translates an executable image (currently [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] and [[a.out]] are supported) to a runnable image in memory.\n* '''fifo''' ([[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] translator): Implements named pipes.\n* '''new-fifo''' (new FIFO server): An alternate server for named pipes.\n* '''firmlink''' (the firmlink translator): Implements firmlinks ‒ \"half-way between a [[symbolic link]] and a [[hard link]]\".<ref>{{cite web |date=1996-10-10 |title=GNU/Hurd - Documentation |publisher=Debian |url=http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-doc-server#firmlink |accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref>\n* '''fwd''' (forward server): Forwards requests to other servers, used by fifo and symlink servers.\n* '''hostmux''' (host multiplexer server)\n* '''ifsock''' (server for sockets interface): Helps with UNIX domain socket addresses.\n* '''init''' ([[init]] server): Basic system booting and configuration.\n* '''magic''' ([[Magic (programming)|magic]] server): Signals that a name lookup must be resolved internally by a process when the result involves the process's state.\n* '''null''' (null server): Implements [[/dev/null]] and /dev/zero.\n* '''pfinet''' (pfinet server): Implements the PF_INET protocol family.\n* '''pflocal''' (pflocal server): Implements [[UNIX domain sockets]].\n* '''proc''' (process server): Assigns [[Process identifier|PID]]s and manages process-level actions.\n* '''symlink''' ([[symbolic link]] translator): Implements symbolic links for filesystems that don't support them.\n* '''term''' (terminal server): A [[POSIX]] terminal.\n* '''usermux''' (user multiplexer server): Invokes user-specific translators.\n\n==== Filesystem servers ====\n;ext2fs\n:The [[ext2]] filesystem translator. It receives disk blocks from the microkernel and gives files and directories to the applications.\n;isofs\n:The translator for the [[ISO 9660]] filesystem. Translates blocks of a CD or DVD to files and directories for the applications.\n;nfs\n:See [[Network File System (protocol)|Network File System]].\n;ufs\n:Translator for the BSD filesystem of the same name, [[Unix File System|UFS]].\n;ftpfs\n: [[File transfer protocol]] filesystem translator.\n;storeio\n:The storage translator.\n\nThe servers collectively implement the [[POSIX]] [[Applications programming interface|API]], with each server implementing a part of the interface. For instance, the various filesystem servers each implement the filesystem calls. The storage server will work as a wrapping layer, similar to the block layer of Linux. The equivalent of [[Virtual file system|VFS]] of [[Linux]] is achieved by libdiskfs and libpager libraries.\n\n==GNU distributions running Hurd ==\n[[File:Gnu hurd debian 1.png|thumbnail|[[Debian GNU/Hurd]] with [[Xfce4]] and web browser [[Midori (web browser)|Midori]]]]\n\nHurd-based [[GNU]] distributions include:\n* [[Arch Hurd]] (apparently discontinued)\n* Bee GNU/Hurd (discontinued)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/distrib.html |title= GNU Hurd/ hurd/ running/ distrib |website=www.gnu.org |date=2015-05-03 |access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref>\n* [[Debian GNU/Hurd]]\n* [[Gentoo/Alt#Gentoo GNU Hurd|Gentoo GNU Hurd]] (discontinued)\n* GNU/Hurd Live CD<ref name=\"Live CD\">{{cite web |title=GNU Hurd/ hurd/ running/ live cd |website=www.gnu.org |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/live_cd.html |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2017-09-21}}</ref> (discontinued){{not in citation|date=September 2017}}\n* [[Guix System Distribution]] (under development)\n* [[NixOS]] - experiment<ref>{{cite web |date=2012-03-21 |title=Nix-based GNU/Hurd System |publisher=Gnu.org |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/nix.html |accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Free software}}\n\n* [[GNU Mach]]\n* [[GNU Linux-libre]] – a kernel and a GNU package\n* [[Kernel-based Virtual Machine]] (KVM)\n* [[Linux-libre]]\n* [[Minix 3]]\n* [[Multiboot Specification]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"What Is the GNU Hurd\">{{cite web |title=What Is the GNU Hurd? |work=[[GNU]] |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/what_is_the_gnu_hurd.html |accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"advantages\">{{cite web |title=advantages |work=[[GNU]] |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/advantages.html |accessdate=2011-12-07}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"hurd-name\">{{cite web |title=GNU Hurd: Origin of the Name |work=[[GNU]] |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/what_is_the_gnu_hurd/origin_of_the_name.html |accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"linux-and-gnu\">{{cite web |date=2010-01-26 |title=Linux and the GNU Project |work=[[GNU]] |url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html |accessdate=2010-03-04 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"hurd-hist\">{{cite web |title=The GNU Hurd History, 'How it Started' |work=[[GNU]] |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/history.html |accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"hurd-and-bsdi\">{{cite web |last=Salus |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter H.
