Tanenbaum]] and others at the [[Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam]]. The aim of the Amoeba project was to build a [[timesharing]] system that makes an entire network of computers appear to the user as a [[Single-system image|single machine]].  Development at the Vrije Universiteit was stopped: the source code of the latest version (5.3) were last modified on 30 July 1996.<ref name='ftp' />\n\nThe [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] was originally developed for this platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.python.org/doc/faq/general/#why-was-python-created-in-the-first-place |title=Why was Python created in the first place? |publisher=Python FAQ |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223222507/http://www.python.org/doc/faq/general/ |archivedate=23 February 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n\nThe goal of the Amoeba project was to construct an operating system for networks of computers that would present the network to the user as if it were a single machine. An Amoeba network consists of a number of [[workstation]]s connected to a \"pool\" of processors, and executing a program from a terminal causes it to run on any of the available processors, with the operating system providing [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]].<ref name=\"statusreport\"/> Unlike the contemporary [[Sprite (operating system)|Sprite]], Amoeba does not support [[process migration]].<ref>Fred Douglis, [[M. Frans Kaashoek]], Andrew S. Tanenbaum and [[John K. Ousterhout|John Ousterhout]] (1991).

Computing Systems '''4'''(4), pp. 353–384.</ref>\nThe workstations would typically function as networked [[computer terminal|terminals]] only. Aside from workstations and processors, additional machines operate as [[server (computing)|server]]s for files, directory services, [[TCP/IP]] communications etc.<ref name=\"statusreport\">[[Andrew S. Tanenbaum]], [[M. Frans Kaashoek]], Robbert van Renesse and Henri E. Bal (1991). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.35.6888 The Amoeba distributed operating system — a status report]. Computer Communications '''14'''.</ref>\n\nAmoeba is a [[microkernel]]-based operating system. It offers [[multithreading (software)|multithreaded]] programs and a [[remote procedure call]] (RPC) mechanism for communication between threads, potentially across the network; even kernel-threads use this RPC mechanism for communication. Each thread is assigned a 48-bit number called its \"port\", which serves as its unique, network-wide \"address\" for communication.<ref name=\"statusreport\"/>\n\nThe user interface and [[Application programming interface|APIs]] of Amoeba were modeled after [[Unix]] and compliance with the [[POSIX]] standard was partially implemented; some of the Unix emulation code consists of utilities ported over from Tanenbaum's other operating system, [[MINIX]]. Early versions used a \"homebrew\" window system, which the Amoeba authors considered \"faster ... in our view, cleaner ... smaller and much easier to understand\", but version 4.0 uses the [[X Window System]] (and allows [[X terminal]]s as terminals).<ref name=\"statusreport\"/>\n\nThe system uses [[Fast Local Internet Protocol|FLIP]] as a network protocol.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Distributed computing]]\n* [[Multikernel]]\n* [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cs.vu.nl/pub/amoeba/ Amoeba home page]\n* [http://fsd-amoeba.sourceforge.net FSD-Amoeba page at Sourceforge]\n\n[[Category:Microkernel-based operating systems]]\n[[Category:Distributed computing architecture]]\n[[Category:Distributed operating systems]]\n[[Category:Computer science in the Netherlands]] \n[[Category:Information technology in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Microkernels]]\n{{MicroKernel}}",
