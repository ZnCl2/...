Tanenbaum - Publications]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509132250/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications |date=May 9, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Doctoral students===\nTanenbaum has had a number of [[Ph.D.]] students who themselves have gone on to become widely known computer science researchers.\nThese include:\n* [[Henri Bal]], a professor at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] in [[Amsterdam]]\n* [[Frans Kaashoek]], a professor at [[MIT]]\n* Sape Mullender, a researcher at [[Bell Labs]]\n* Robbert van Renesse, a professor at [[Cornell University]]\n* Leendert van Doorn, a distinguished engineer at the [[Microsoft]] Corporation\n* [[Werner Vogels]], the Chief Technology Officer at [[Amazon.com]]<ref name=\"vogelsphd\"/>\n\n===Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging===\nIn the early 1990s, the Dutch government began setting up a number of thematically oriented research schools that spanned multiple universities. These schools were intended to bring professors and Ph.D. students from different Dutch (and later, foreign) universities together to help them cooperate and enhance their research.\n\nTanenbaum was one of the cofounders and first Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI). This school initially consisted of nearly 200 faculty members and Ph.D. students from the [[Vrije Universiteit]], [[University of Amsterdam]], [[Delft University of Technology]], and [[Leiden University]]. They were especially working on problems in advanced computer systems such as parallel computing and image analysis and processing.\n\nTanenbaum remained dean for 12 years, until 2005, when he was awarded an Academy Professorship by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]], at which time he became a full-time research professor. ASCI has since grown to include researchers from nearly a dozen universities in The Netherlands, Belgium, and France. ASCI offers Ph.D. level courses, has an annual conference, and runs various workshops every year.\n\n==Projects==\n\n===Amsterdam Compiler Kit===\nThe [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]] is a toolkit for producing portable compilers. It was started sometime before 1981 and Andrew Tanenbaum was the architect from the start until version 5.5.<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ Andrew S. Tanenbaum - Publications, Colloquia section]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509132250/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ |date=May 9, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===MINIX===\nIn 1987, Tanenbaum wrote a clone of [[UNIX]], called [[MINIX]] (MINi-unIX), for the [[IBM PC]]. It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked. Consequently, he wrote a book that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131429388 Amazon.com: Operating Systems Design and Implementation (3rd Edition) (Prentice Hall Software Series): Andrew S Tanenbaum, Albert S Woodhull: Books]</ref> The source code itself was available on a set of floppy disks. Within three months, a [[Usenet]] newsgroup, comp.os.minix, had sprung up with over 40,000 subscribers discussing and improving the system. One of these subscribers was a Finnish student named [[Linus Torvalds]] who began adding new features to MINIX and tailoring it to his own needs. On October 5, 1991, Torvalds announced his own ([[POSIX]] like) kernel, called [[Linux]], which originally used the MINIX file system, but it is not based on MINIX code.<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ Some notes on the \"Who wrote Linux\" Kerfuffle]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5sfayBi29?url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ |date=September 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough MINIX and Linux have diverged, MINIX continues to be developed, now as a production system as well as an educational one.<ref>[http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-04/openpdfs/herder.pdf USENIX April 06]</ref> The focus is on building a highly modular, reliable, and secure, operating system. The system is based on a [[microkernel]], with only 5000 lines of code running in kernel mode.<ref>[http://www.few.vu.nl/~ast/ Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Professor at the Vrije Universiteit]</ref> The rest of the operating system runs as a number of independent processes in user mode, including processes for the file system, process manager, and each device driver. The system continuously monitors each of these processes, and when a failure is detected is often capable of automatically replacing the failed process without a reboot, without disturbing running programs, and without the user even noticing. [[MINIX 3]], as the current version is called, is available under the [[BSD license]] for free.\n\n===Research projects===\nTanenbaum has also been involved in numerous other research projects in the areas of operating systems, distributed systems, and ubiquitous computing, often as supervisor of Ph.D. students or a [[postdoctoral researcher]]. These projects include:\n* [[Amoeba distributed operating system|Amoeba]]<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Tanenbaum | first1 = A.

He stated that he created the site as an American who \"knows first hand what the world thinks of America and it is not a pretty picture at the moment.

He correctly predicted all the winners in the Senate except for Minnesota, where he predicted a 1% win by [[Norm Coleman]] over [[Al Franken]]. After 7 months of legal battling and recounts, Franken won by 312 votes (0.01%).\n\nIn 2010, he correctly projected 35 out of 37 Senate races in the Midterm elections on the website. The exceptions were [[Colorado]] and [[Nevada]].\n\n==Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate==\nThe [[Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate]] was a famous debate between Tanenbaum and Linus Torvalds regarding kernel design on [[Usenet]] in 1992.<ref>[https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.os.minix/wlhw16QWltI%5B1-25-false%5D \"LINUX is obsolete\" Usenet Debate Text]</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]\n* Fellow of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]]\n* Member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1994)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/4853 |title=Andrew Tanenbaum |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref>\n* Eurosys Lifetime Achievement Award, 2015\n* Honorary doctorate from Petru Maior University, Targu Mures, Romania, 2011\n* Winner of the TAA [[William Holmes McGuffey#McGuffey Awards|McGuffey award]] for classic textbooks for Modern Operating Systems, 2010\n* Coauthor of the Best Paper Award at the LADC Conference, 2009\n* Winner of a 2.5 million euro [[European Research Council]] Advanced Grant, 2008\n* [[USENIX]] Flame Award 2008 <ref>[http://www.usenix.org/about/flame.html USENIX Flame Award]</ref> for his many contributions to systems design and to openness both in discussion and in source\n* Honorary doctorate from Polytechnic University of Bucharest, Romania\n* Coauthor of the Best Paper Award at the Real-Time and Network Systems Conf., 2008\n* Winner of the 2007 [[IEEE James H.

The award was given in the academic senate chamber, after which Tanenbaum gave a lecture on his vision of the future of the computer field. The degree was given in recognition of Tanenbaum's career work, which includes about 150 published papers, 18 books (which have been translated into over 20 languages), and the creation of a large body of open-source software, including the Amsterdam Compiler Kit, Amoeba, Globe, and MINIX.\n* On October 7, 2011, Universitatea Petru Maior din Târgu Mureș ([[Petru Maior University of Târgu Mureș]]) granted Tanenbaum the Doctor Honoris Causa (honorary doctorate) title for his remarkable work in the field of computer science and achievements in education. The academic community is hereby honoring his devotion to teaching and research with this award. At the ceremony, the Chancellor, the Rector, the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences and Letters, and others all spoke about Tanenbaum and his work. The pro-rector then read the 'laudatio,' summarizing Tanenbaum's achievements. These include his work developing MINIX (the predecessor to Linux), the RFID Guardian, his work on Globe, Amoeba, and other systems, and his many books on computer science, which have been translated in many languages, including Romanian, and which are used at Petru Maior University.\n\n==Keynote talks==\nTanenbaum has been keynote speaker at numerous conferences, most recently\n* [http://www.froscon.de/en/home FrOSCon 2015] Sankt Augustin, Germany, Aug. 22, 2015\n* [http://www.bsdcan.org BSDCan 2015] Ottawa, Canada, June 12, 2015\n* [http://www.haxpo.nl HAXPO 2015] Amsterdam May 28, 2015\n* [[Codemotion 2015]]  Rome Italy, March 28, 2015\n* [http://www.nwo.nl/nwohome.nsf/pages/NWOP_889BS7 SIREN 2010]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Veldhoven, The Netherlands, Nov. 2, 2010\n* [[FOSDEM]] Brussels, Belgium, Feb 7, 2010\n* [http://neteng.nudt.edu.cn/NSCNE09/cfp2.html NSCNE '09]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Changsha, China, Nov. 5, 2009\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090924085448/http://www.e-democracy2009.gr/ E-Democracy 2009 Conference] Athens, Greece, Sept. 25, 2009\n* [http://www.froscon.org Free and Open Source Conference] Sankt Augustin, Germany, August 23, 2008\n* XV [http://www.sinfo.ist.utl.pt/en/ Semana Informática] of the [[Instituto Superior Técnico]], Lisbon, Portugal, March 13, 2008\n* [[NLUUG]] [https://www.nluug.nl/events/nj07/en/programma/tanenbaum.html 25 year anniversary] conference, Amsterdam, November 7, 2007\n* [[linux.conf.au]] in Sydney, Australia, January 17, 2007\n* Academic IT Festival in Cracow, Poland, February 23, 2006 (2nd edition)\n* [http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp05/default.htm ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles], Brighton, England, October 24, 2005\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{commons category|Andrew S.

Tanenbaum - Publications]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509132250/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications |date=May 9, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Doctoral students===\nTanenbaum has had a number of [[Ph.D.]] students who themselves have gone on to become widely known computer science researchers.\nThese include:\n* [[Henri Bal]], a professor at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] in [[Amsterdam]]\n* [[Frans Kaashoek]], a professor at [[MIT]]\n* Sape Mullender, a researcher at [[Bell Labs]]\n* Robbert van Renesse, a professor at [[Cornell University]]\n* Leendert van Doorn, a distinguished engineer at the [[Microsoft]] Corporation\n* [[Werner Vogels]], the Chief Technology Officer at [[Amazon.com]]<ref name=\"vogelsphd\"/>\n\n===Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging===\nIn the early 1990s, the Dutch government began setting up a number of thematically oriented research schools that spanned multiple universities. These schools were intended to bring professors and Ph.D. students from different Dutch (and later, foreign) universities together to help them cooperate and enhance their research.\n\nTanenbaum was one of the cofounders and first Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI). This school initially consisted of nearly 200 faculty members and Ph.D. students from the [[Vrije Universiteit]], [[University of Amsterdam]], [[Delft University of Technology]], and [[Leiden University]]. They were especially working on problems in advanced computer systems such as parallel computing and image analysis and processing.\n\nTanenbaum remained dean for 12 years, until 2005, when he was awarded an Academy Professorship by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]], at which time he became a full-time research professor. ASCI has since grown to include researchers from nearly a dozen universities in The Netherlands, Belgium, and France. ASCI offers Ph.D. level courses, has an annual conference, and runs various workshops every year.\n\n==Projects==\n\n===Amsterdam Compiler Kit===\nThe [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]] is a toolkit for producing portable compilers. It was started sometime before 1981 and Andrew Tanenbaum was the architect from the start until version 5.5.<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ Andrew S. Tanenbaum - Publications, Colloquia section]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509132250/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ |date=May 9, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===MINIX===\nIn 1987, Tanenbaum wrote a clone of [[UNIX]], called [[MINIX]] (MINi-unIX), for the [[IBM PC]]. It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked. Consequently, he wrote a book that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131429388 Amazon.com: Operating Systems Design and Implementation (3rd Edition) (Prentice Hall Software Series): Andrew S Tanenbaum, Albert S Woodhull: Books]</ref> The source code itself was available on a set of floppy disks. Within three months, a [[Usenet]] newsgroup, comp.os.minix, had sprung up with over 40,000 subscribers discussing and improving the system. One of these subscribers was a Finnish student named [[Linus Torvalds]] who began adding new features to MINIX and tailoring it to his own needs. On October 5, 1991, Torvalds announced his own ([[POSIX]] like) kernel, called [[Linux]], which originally used the MINIX file system, but it is not based on MINIX code.<ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ Some notes on the \"Who wrote Linux\" Kerfuffle]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5sfayBi29?url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ |date=September 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough MINIX and Linux have diverged, MINIX continues to be developed, now as a production system as well as an educational one.<ref>[http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-04/openpdfs/herder.pdf USENIX April 06]</ref> The focus is on building a highly modular, reliable, and secure, operating system. The system is based on a [[microkernel]], with only 5000 lines of code running in kernel mode.<ref>[http://www.few.vu.nl/~ast/ Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Professor at the Vrije Universiteit]</ref> The rest of the operating system runs as a number of independent processes in user mode, including processes for the file system, process manager, and each device driver. The system continuously monitors each of these processes, and when a failure is detected is often capable of automatically replacing the failed process without a reboot, without disturbing running programs, and without the user even noticing. [[MINIX 3]], as the current version is called, is available under the [[BSD license]] for free.\n\n===Research projects===\nTanenbaum has also been involved in numerous other research projects in the areas of operating systems, distributed systems, and ubiquitous computing, often as supervisor of Ph.D. students or a [[postdoctoral researcher]]. These projects include:\n* [[Amoeba distributed operating system|Amoeba]]<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Tanenbaum | first1 = A.

He correctly predicted all the winners in the Senate except for Minnesota, where he predicted a 1% win by [[Norm Coleman]] over [[Al Franken]]. After 7 months of legal battling and recounts, Franken won by 312 votes (0.01%).\n\nIn 2010, he correctly projected 35 out of 37 Senate races in the Midterm elections on the website. The exceptions were [[Colorado]] and [[Nevada]].\n\n==Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate==\nThe [[Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate]] was a famous debate between Tanenbaum and Linus Torvalds regarding kernel design on [[Usenet]] in 1992.<ref>[https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.os.minix/wlhw16QWltI%5B1-25-false%5D \"LINUX is obsolete\" Usenet Debate Text]</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]\n* Fellow of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]]\n* Member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1994)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/4853 |title=Andrew Tanenbaum |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref>\n* Eurosys Lifetime Achievement Award, 2015\n* Honorary doctorate from Petru Maior University, Targu Mures, Romania, 2011\n* Winner of the TAA [[William Holmes McGuffey#McGuffey Awards|McGuffey award]] for classic textbooks for Modern Operating Systems, 2010\n* Coauthor of the Best Paper Award at the LADC Conference, 2009\n* Winner of a 2.5 million euro [[European Research Council]] Advanced Grant, 2008\n* [[USENIX]] Flame Award 2008 <ref>[http://www.usenix.org/about/flame.html USENIX Flame Award]</ref> for his many contributions to systems design and to openness both in discussion and in source\n* Honorary doctorate from Polytechnic University of Bucharest, Romania\n* Coauthor of the Best Paper Award at the Real-Time and Network Systems Conf., 2008\n* Winner of the 2007 [[IEEE James H.

The award was given in the academic senate chamber, after which Tanenbaum gave a lecture on his vision of the future of the computer field. The degree was given in recognition of Tanenbaum's career work, which includes about 150 published papers, 18 books (which have been translated into over 20 languages), and the creation of a large body of open-source software, including the Amsterdam Compiler Kit, Amoeba, Globe, and MINIX.\n* On October 7, 2011, Universitatea Petru Maior din Târgu Mureș ([[Petru Maior University of Târgu Mureș]]) granted Tanenbaum the Doctor Honoris Causa (honorary doctorate) title for his remarkable work in the field of computer science and achievements in education. The academic community is hereby honoring his devotion to teaching and research with this award. At the ceremony, the Chancellor, the Rector, the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences and Letters, and others all spoke about Tanenbaum and his work. The pro-rector then read the 'laudatio,' summarizing Tanenbaum's achievements. These include his work developing MINIX (the predecessor to Linux), the RFID Guardian, his work on Globe, Amoeba, and other systems, and his many books on computer science, which have been translated in many languages, including Romanian, and which are used at Petru Maior University.\n\n==Keynote talks==\nTanenbaum has been keynote speaker at numerous conferences, most recently\n* [http://www.froscon.de/en/home FrOSCon 2015] Sankt Augustin, Germany, Aug. 22, 2015\n* [http://www.bsdcan.org BSDCan 2015] Ottawa, Canada, June 12, 2015\n* [http://www.haxpo.nl HAXPO 2015] Amsterdam May 28, 2015\n* [[Codemotion 2015]]  Rome Italy, March 28, 2015\n* [http://www.nwo.nl/nwohome.nsf/pages/NWOP_889BS7 SIREN 2010]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Veldhoven, The Netherlands, Nov. 2, 2010\n* [[FOSDEM]] Brussels, Belgium, Feb 7, 2010\n* [http://neteng.nudt.edu.cn/NSCNE09/cfp2.html NSCNE '09]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Changsha, China, Nov. 5, 2009\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090924085448/http://www.e-democracy2009.gr/ E-Democracy 2009 Conference] Athens, Greece, Sept. 25, 2009\n* [http://www.froscon.org Free and Open Source Conference] Sankt Augustin, Germany, August 23, 2008\n* XV [http://www.sinfo.ist.utl.pt/en/ Semana Informática] of the [[Instituto Superior Técnico]], Lisbon, Portugal, March 13, 2008\n* [[NLUUG]] [https://www.nluug.nl/events/nj07/en/programma/tanenbaum.html 25 year anniversary] conference, Amsterdam, November 7, 2007\n* [[linux.conf.au]] in Sydney, Australia, January 17, 2007\n* Academic IT Festival in Cracow, Poland, February 23, 2006 (2nd edition)\n* [http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp05/default.htm ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles], Brighton, England, October 24, 2005\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{commons category|Andrew S.
