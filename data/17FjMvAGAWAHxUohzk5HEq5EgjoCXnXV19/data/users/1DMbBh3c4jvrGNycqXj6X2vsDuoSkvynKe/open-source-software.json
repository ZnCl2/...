The paper received significant attention in early 1998, and was one factor in motivating [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release their popular [[Netscape Communicator]] Internet suite as [[free software]]. This source code subsequently became the basis behind [[SeaMonkey]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] and [[KompoZer]].\n\nNetscape's act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s free software ideas and perceived benefits to the commercial software industry. They concluded that FSF's social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape, and looked for a way to rebrand the [[free software movement]] to emphasize the business potential of sharing and collaborating on software source code.<ref name=\"karlfogel\">{{cite web|url=http://producingoss.com/en/introduction.html#free-vs-open-source|quote=''But the problem went deeper than that. The word \"free\" carried with it an inescapable moral connotation: if freedom was an end in itself, it didn't matter whether free software also happened to be better, or more profitable for certain businesses in certain circumstances. Those were merely pleasant side effects of a motive that was, at its root, neither technical nor mercantile, but moral. Furthermore, the \"free as in freedom\" position forced a glaring inconsistency on corporations who wanted to support particular free programs in one aspect of their business, but continue marketing proprietary software in others.''|title=Producing Open Source Software - How to Run a Successful Free Software Project |author=[[Karl Fogel]] |publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2016|accessdate=2016-04-11}}</ref> The new term they chose was \"open source\", which was soon adopted by [[Bruce Perens]], publisher [[Tim O'Reilly]], [[Linus Torvalds]], and others.

With open-source software, generally anyone is allowed to create modifications of it, port it to new operating systems and [[instruction set architectures]], share it with others or, in some cases, market it. Scholars Casson and Ryan have pointed out several policy-based reasons for adoption of open source – in particular, the heightened value proposition from open source (when compared to most proprietary formats) in the following categories:\n* Security\n* Affordability\n* Transparency\n* Perpetuity\n* Interoperability\n* Flexibility\n* Localization—particularly in the context of local governments (who make software decisions). Casson and Ryan argue that \"governments have an inherent responsibility and fiduciary duty to taxpayers\" which includes the careful analysis of these factors when deciding to purchase proprietary software or implement an open-source option.<ref name=\"papers.ssrn.com\">{{cite web|ssrn=1656616 |title=Open Standards, Open Source Adoption in the Public Sector, and Their Relationship to Microsoft’s Market Dominance by Tony Casson, Patrick S.

With at least 20 years of evidence from case histories of closed software development versus open development already provided by the Internet developer community, the OSI presented the \"open source\" case to commercial businesses, like Netscape. The OSI hoped that the use of the label \"open source\", a term suggested by [[Christine Peterson]] of the [[Foresight Institute]] at the strategy session, would eliminate ambiguity, particularly for individuals who perceive \"free software\" as anti-commercial. They sought to bring a higher profile to the practical benefits of freely available source code, and they wanted to bring major software businesses and other high-tech industries into open source.

Some are home-grown, while others are modeled after mainstream [[FOSS]] licenses such as Berkeley Software Distribution (\"BSD\"), Apache, MIT-style (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), or GNU General Public License (\"GPL\"). In view of this, open-source practitioners are starting to use classification schemes in which [[FOSS]] licenses are grouped (typically based on the existence and obligations imposed by the [[copyleft]] provision; the strength of the copyleft provision).<ref>Andrew T.

Raymond likens the development of software by traditional methodologies to building a cathedral, \"carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation\".<ref name=\"ray2000\"/> He suggests that all software should be developed using the bazaar style, which he described as \"a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches.\"<ref name=\"ray2000\"/>\n\nIn the traditional model of development, which he called the ''cathedral'' model, development takes place in a centralized way. Roles are clearly defined. Roles include people dedicated to designing (the architects), people responsible for managing the project, and people responsible for implementation. Traditional software engineering follows the cathedral model.\n\nThe bazaar model, however, is different. In this model, roles are not clearly defined. Gregorio Robles<ref>{{cite book | last=Robles | first=Gregorio | year=2004 | chapter=A Software Engineering Approach to Libre Software | chapterurl=http://www.opensourcejahrbuch.de/2004/pdfs/III-3-Robles.pdf | format=PDF | title=Open Source Jahrbuch 2004 | editor=Robert A. Gehring, Bernd Lutterbeck | location=Berlin | publisher=[[Technical University of Berlin]] | url=http://www.opensourcejahrbuch.de | accessdate=2005-04-20 }}</ref> suggests that software developed using the bazaar model should exhibit the following patterns:\n\n; Users should be treated as co-developers: The users are treated like co-developers and so they should have access to the source code of the software. Furthermore, users are encouraged to submit additions to the software, code fixes for the software, [[bug report]]s, documentation etc. Having more co-developers increases the rate at which the software evolves. [[Linus's law]] states, \"Given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow.\" This means that if many users view the source code, they will eventually find all bugs and suggest how to fix them. Note that some users have advanced programming skills, and furthermore, each user's machine provides an additional testing environment. This new testing environment offers that ability to find and fix a new bug.\n; Early releases: The first version of the software should be released as early as possible so as to increase one's chances of finding co-developers early.\n; Frequent integration: Code changes should be integrated (merged into a shared code base) as often as possible so as to avoid the overhead of fixing a large number of bugs at the end of the project life cycle. Some open source projects have nightly builds where [[continuous integration|integration is done automatically]] on a daily basis.\n; Several versions: There should be at least two versions of the software. There should be a buggier version with more features and a more stable version with fewer features. The buggy version (also called the development version) is for users who want the immediate use of the latest features, and are willing to accept the risk of using code that is not yet thoroughly tested. The users can then act as co-developers, reporting bugs and providing bug fixes.\n; High modularization: The general structure of the software should be modular allowing for parallel development on independent components.\n; Dynamic decision making structure: There is a need for a decision making structure, whether formal or informal, that makes strategic decisions depending on changing user requirements and other factors. Compare with [[extreme programming]].\n\nData suggests, however, that OSS is not quite as democratic as the bazaar model suggests. An analysis of five billion bytes of free/open source code by 31,999 developers shows that 74% of the code was written by the most active 10% of authors. The average number of authors involved in a project was 5.1, with the median at 2.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ghosh |first=R.A. |author2=Robles, G. |author3=Glott, R. |title=Free/Libre and Open Source Software: Survey and Study Part V.|journal=Maastricht: International Institute of Infonomics.|year=2002}}</ref>\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages===\n\nOpen source software is usually easier to obtain than proprietary software, often resulting in increased use.

It is said to be more reliable since it typically has thousands of independent programmers testing and fixing bugs of the software. Open source is not dependent on the company or author that originally created it. Even if the company fails, the code continues to exist and be developed by its users. Also, it uses open standards accessible to everyone; thus, it does not have the problem of incompatible formats that exist in proprietary software.\n\nIt is flexible because modular systems allow programmers to build custom interfaces, or add new abilities to it and it is innovative since open source programs are the product of collaboration among a large number of different programmers. The mix of divergent perspectives, corporate objectives, and personal goals speeds up innovation.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Hal | last=Plotkin | title=What (and Why) you should know about open-source software | journal=Harvard Management Update |date=December 1998 | pages=8–9  }}</ref>\n\nMoreover, free software can be developed in accord with purely technical requirements. It does not require thinking about commercial pressure that often degrades the quality of the software. Commercial pressures make traditional software developers pay more attention to customers' requirements than to security requirements, since such features are somewhat invisible to the customer.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Christian | last=Payne | title=On the Security of Open Source Software | journal=Info Systems Journal |date=February 2002 | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=61–78 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2575.2002.00118.x}}</ref>\n\nIt is sometimes said that the open source development process may not be well defined and the stages in the development process, such as system testing and documentation may be ignored. However this is only true for small (mostly single programmer) projects. Larger, successful projects do define and enforce at least some rules as they need them to make the teamwork possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/docs/hacking.html |title=GNU Classpath Hacker's Guide: GNU Classpath Hacker's Guide |work=Gnu.org |date=2003-08-11 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://jgap.sourceforge.net/doc/codestyle.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121225112210/http://jgap.sourceforge.net/doc/codestyle.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-12-25 | title=Brief summary of coding style and practice used in JGAP | first=Klaus | last=Meffert | author2=Neil Rotstan | year=2007 | publisher=Java Genetic Algorithms Package | accessdate=2008-09-08 }}</ref> In the most complex projects these rules may be as strict as reviewing even minor change by two independent developers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t98834.html | title=Classpath hackers frustrated with slow OpenJDK process | date=2007-07-16 | first=Andy | last=Tripp | publisher=Javalobby }}</ref>\n\nNot all OSS initiatives have been successful, for example SourceXchange and [[Eazel]].<ref name=\"Sharma2002\"/> Software experts and researchers who are not convinced by open source's ability to produce quality systems identify the unclear process, the late defect discovery and the lack of any empirical evidence as the most important problems (collected data concerning productivity and quality).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite journal | first=Ioannis | last=Stamelos |author2=Lefteris Angelis |author3=Apostolos Oikonomou |author4=Georgios L.
