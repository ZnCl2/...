It is [[free and open source software]].\n\nMinix-vmd runs on [[IA-32]] and compatible [[microprocessor]] architectures. It was written by many of the same authors who develop MINIX, at the [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam|Vrije Universiteit]] (VU) in [[Amsterdam]]. The acronym reputedly stands for ''VU Minix Distribution''.\n\nAccording to its authors, Minix-vmd was created to meet specific needs they had, rather than to be a general purpose use OS like [[Linux]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.minix-vmd.org |title=Welcome to Minix-vmd.org|access-date=16 April 2017}}</ref> It also does not share the educational goals of MINIX.\n\nNevertheless, the OS may have been of interest to others for various purposes, due to its small resource use compared with other operating systems, and other factors. However, [[MINIX 3]] incorporated Minix-vmd's functions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n*[[MINIX]]\n*[[MINIX file system]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|www.minix-vmd.org}}\n* [http://minix1.woodhull.com/minixvmd.html Minix-vmd]\n\n{{Microkernel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Minix-Vmd}}\n<!-- Categories -->\n[[Category:Discontinued operating systems]]\n[[Category:Microkernels]]\n[[Category:MINIX]]\n[[Category:Unix variants]]\n\n{{software-stub}}",
