''University of Chicago Legal Forum.''</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nAlthough the term is most frequently used today with regard to identity and the Internet, the concept of pseudonymity has a long history.  In ancient literature it was common to write in the name of a famous person, not for concealment or with any intention of deceit; in the New Testament, the second letter of Peter is probably such. A more modern example is all of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', which were signed by Publius, a pseudonym representing the trio of [[James Madison]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], and [[John Jay]].  The papers were written partially in response to several [[Anti-Federalist Papers]], also written under pseudonyms.  As a result of this pseudonymity, historians know that the papers were written by Madison, Hamilton, and Jay, but have not been able to discern with complete accuracy which of the three authored a few of the papers.\n\nPseudonymity has become an important phenomenon on the [[Internet]] and other computer networks.  In computer networks, pseudonyms possess varying degrees of [[anonymity]],<ref>Froomkin, A. Michael (1995). [http://www.wm.edu/law/publications/jol/95_96/froomkin.html \"Anonymity and Its Enemies (Article 4)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525021152/http://www.wm.edu/law/publications/jol/95_96/froomkin.html |date=2008-05-25 }}\". ''Journal of Online Law.''</ref> ranging from highly linkable ''public pseudonyms'' (the link between the pseudonym and a human being is publicly known or easy to discover), potentially linkable ''non-public pseudonyms'' (the link is known to system operators but is not publicly disclosed), and ''unlinkable pseudonyms'' (the link is not known to system operators and cannot be determined).<ref>Pfitzmann, A., and M. Köhntopp (2000).  \"[http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.23.pdf Anonymity, Unobservability, and Pseudonymity: A Proposal for Terminology]\". In H. Federrath (ed.), ''Anonymity'' (Berlin: Springer-Verlag), pp. 1-9.</ref>  For example, true [[anonymous remailer]] enables Internet users to establish unlinkable pseudonyms; those that employ non-public pseudonyms (such as the now-defunct [[Penet remailer]]) are called [[pseudonymous remailer]]s.\n\nThe continuum of unlinkability can also be seen, in part, on [[Wikipedia]]. Some registered users make no attempt to disguise their real identities (for example, by placing their real name on their user page). The pseudonym of unregistered users is their [[IP address]], which can, in many cases, easily be linked to them. Other registered users prefer to remain anonymous, and do not disclose identifying information. However, Wikipedia's server logs may enable system administrators to determine the IP address, and perhaps the true name, of a registered user (see {{srlink|Wikipedia:Privacy Policy}} for a list of the conditions under which such a linkage would be attempted). It is possible, in theory, to create an unlinkable Wikipedia pseudonym by using an [[Open proxy]], a Web server that disguises the user's [[IP address]]. However,  most open proxy addresses are blocked indefinitely due to their frequent use by vandals (see {{srlink|Wikipedia:Blocking policy}}).  Additionally, Wikipedia's public record of a user's interest areas, writing style, and argumentative positions may still establish an identifiable pattern.<ref>Rao, J.R., and P. Rohatgi (2000).

Law enforcement personnel, fearing an avalanche of illegal behavior are equally unenthusiastic.<ref>Clarke, Roger (1998).

Their views are supported by laws in some nations (such as Canada) that guarantee citizens a right to speak using a pseudonym.[https://www.eff.org/legal/cases/2TheMart_case/20010420_eff_2themart_pr.html] This right does not, however, give citizens the right to demand publication of pseudonymous speech on equipment they do not own.\n\n==Pseudonymity and confidentiality==\n\nMost Web sites that offer pseudonymity retain information about users. <!-- They  should protect their users from unwanted disclosures of personal information; in other words, they should assure [[confidentiality]] (the information is available only to those authorized to have access). COMMENT:  it is not encyclopedic to talk about what web sites should or shouldn't do.  This could be reworded to discuss the benefits to assuring confidentiality (referenced of course), but I do not know enough about the issue to do it. --> These sites are often susceptible to unauthorized intrusions into their non-public database systems. For example, in 2000, a Welsh teenager obtained information about more than 26,000 credit card accounts, including that of Bill Gates.<ref>Reuters News Service (2000).

In a study of a Web dating service and a [[pseudonymous remailer]], [[University of Cambridge]] researchers discovered that the systems used by these Web sites to protect user data could be easily compromised, even if the pseudonymous channel is protected by strong [[encryption]]. Typically, the protected pseudonymous channel exists within a broader framework in which multiple vulnerabilities exist.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/3-540-45496-9_17 | last1 = Clayton | first1 = R. | last2 = Danezis | first2 = G. | last3 = Kuhn | first3 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Real World Patterns of Failure in Anonymity Systems | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rnc1/Patterns_of_Failure.pdf | journal = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume = 2137 | issue = | pages = 230–244 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | isbn = 978-3-540-42733-9 }}</ref> Pseudonym users should bear in mind that, given the current state of Web security engineering, their true names may be revealed at any time.\n\n==Pseudonymity and online reputations==\nPseudonymity is an important component of the [[reputation]] systems found in online auction services (such as [[eBay]]), discussion sites (such as [[Slashdot]]), and collaborative knowledge development sites (such as [[Wikipedia]]). A pseudonymous user who has acquired a favorable reputation gains the trust of other users.
