MINIX is now developed as [[open-source software]].\n\nMINIX was first released in 1987, with its complete source code made available to universities for study in courses and research.

It is available in a [[Live CD]] format that allows it to be used on a computer without installing it on the hard drive, and in versions compatible with hardware emulation/virtualization systems, including [[Bochs]], [[QEMU]], [[VMware Workstation]]/[[VMware Fusion|Fusion]], [[VirtualBox]] and [[Microsoft Virtual PC]].\n\nVersion 3.1.5 was released 5 November 2009. It contains [[X11]], [[emacs]], [[vi]], cc, [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]], [[perl]], [[Python (programming language)|python]], [[Almquist shell|ash]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[zsh]], [[ftp]], [[Secure Shell|ssh]], [[telnet]], [[Pine (e-mail client)|pine]], and over 400 other common [[Unix]] utility programs. With the addition of X11, this version marks the transition away from a text-only system. It can also withstand driver crashes. In many cases it can automatically restart drivers without affecting running processes. In this way, MINIX is self-healing and can be used in applications demanding high reliability. MINIX 3 also has support for [[virtual memory]] management, making it suitable for desktop OS use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/minix3/msg/86c914a0c13376fe|title=New to minix|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=August 2, 2011|first=Ulrich|last=Schmidt}}</ref> Desktop applications such as [[Firefox]] and [[OpenOffice.org]] are not yet available for MINIX 3 however.\n\nAs of version 3.2.0, the [[User space|userland]] was mostly replaced by that of [[NetBSD]] and support from [[pkgsrc]] became possible, increasing the available software applications that MINIX can use.

This was disapproved of by Tanenbaum in the [[Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate]]. Tanenbaum explained again his rationale for using a microkernel in May 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/reliable-os|title=Tanenbaum-Torvalds Debate: Part II|date=May 12, 2006|accessdate=August 2, 2011 | first = Andrew S. | last = Tanenbaum | authorlink1 = Andrew S.

Its licensing fee was very small ($69) compared to those of other operating systems.  Although Tanenbaum wished for MINIX to be as accessible as possible to [[student]]s, his publisher was not prepared to offer material (such as the source code) that could be copied freely, so a restrictive license requiring a nominal fee (included in the price of Tanenbaum's book) was applied as a compromise.  This prevented the use of MINIX as the basis for a freely distributed software system.\n\nWhen [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] Unix-like operating systems such as [[Linux]] and [[386BSD]] became available in the early 1990s, many [[Volunteering|volunteer]] [[software developer]]s abandoned MINIX in favor of these. In April 2000, MINIX became free/open source software under a [[permissive free software license]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minix3.org/license.html|title=The Minix licence}}</ref> but by this time other operating systems had surpassed its capabilities, and it remained primarily an operating system for students and [[hobbyist]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free software}}\n*[[MINIX file system]]\n*[[Minix-vmd]]\n*[[MINIX 3]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q187906|commons=Category:MINIX|b=Minix 3|n=no|s=no|wikt=no|voy=no|v=no|q=no|wm=no|m=no}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.MINIX3.org/}}\n*{{Dmoz|Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Unix/MINIX}}\n*[https://www.webcitation.org/5sfayBi29?url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ History of MINIX from Andrew Tanenbaum]\n*{{YouTube|bx3KuE7UjGA|MINIX 3: a Modular, Self-Healing POSIX-compatible Operating System}}\n\n{{Unix-like}}\n{{FOSS}}\n{{Microkernel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Minix}}\n[[Category:1987 software]]\n[[Category:ARM operating systems]]\n[[Category:Computer science in the Netherlands]] \n[[Category:Dutch inventions]]\n[[Category:Educational operating systems]]\n[[Category:Free software operating systems]]\n[[Category:Information technology in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Lightweight Unix-like systems]]\n[[Category:Microkernel-based operating systems]]\n[[Category:Microkernels]]\n[[Category:MINIX]]\n[[Category:Operating system distributions bootable from read-only media]]\n[[Category:Unix variants]]",
