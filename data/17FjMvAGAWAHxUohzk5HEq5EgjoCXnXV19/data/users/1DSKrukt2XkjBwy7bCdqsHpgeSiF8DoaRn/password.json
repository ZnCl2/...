If the permissible characters are constrained to be numeric, the corresponding secret is sometimes called a [[personal identification number]] (PIN).\n\nDespite its name, a password need not be an actual word; indeed a non-word (in the dictionary sense) may be harder to guess, which is a desirable property of passwords. A memorized secret consisting of a sequence of words or other text separated by spaces is sometimes called a [[passphrase]]. A passphrase is similar to a password in usage but the former is generally longer for added security.<ref>{{cite web |title=Passphrase |url=https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Passphrase |publisher=Computer Security Resource Center (NIST) |accessdate=17 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPasswords have been used since ancient times. Sentries would challenge those wishing to enter an area to supply a password or ''watchword'', and would only allow a person or group to pass if they knew the password. [[Polybius]] describes the system for the distribution of watchwords in the [[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]] as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The way in which they secure the passing round of the watchword for the night is as follows: from the tenth [[maniple (military unit)|maniple]] of each class of infantry and cavalry, the maniple which is encamped at the lower end of the street, a man is chosen who is relieved from guard duty, and he attends every day at sunset at the tent of the [[tribune]], and receiving from him the watchword—that is a wooden tablet with the word inscribed on it – takes his leave, and on returning to his quarters passes on the watchword and tablet before witnesses to the commander of the next maniple, who in turn passes it to the one next him. All do the same until it reaches the first maniples, those encamped near the tents of the tribunes. These latter are obliged to deliver the tablet to the tribunes before dark. So that if all those issued are returned, the tribune knows that the watchword has been given to all the maniples, and has passed through all on its way back to him. If any one of them is missing, he makes inquiry at once, as he knows by the marks from what quarter the tablet has not returned, and whoever is responsible for the stoppage meets with the punishment he merits.<ref>[http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_polybius6.htm Polybius on the Roman Military] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207011711/http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_polybius6.htm |date=2008-02-07 }}.

The challenge and response were changed every three days. American paratroopers also famously used a device known as a \"cricket\" on [[D-Day]] in place of a password system as a temporarily unique method of identification; one metallic click given by the device in lieu of a password was to be met by two clicks in reply.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Bando|title=101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles in World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBSBtgAACAAJ|accessdate=20 May 2012|year=2007|publisher=Mbi Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-7603-2984-9|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602083437/http://books.google.com/books?id=cBSBtgAACAAJ|archivedate=2 June 2013|df=}}</ref>\n\nPasswords have been used with computers since the earliest days of computing.

The overall system must be designed for sound security, with protection against [[computer virus]]es, [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s and the like. Physical security issues are also a concern, from deterring [[shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]] to more sophisticated physical threats such as video cameras and keyboard sniffers.  Passwords should be chosen so that they are hard for an attacker to guess and hard for an attacker to discover using any of the available automatic attack schemes.  See [[password strength]] and [[computer security]] for more information.\n\nNowadays, it is a common practice for computer systems to hide passwords as they are typed. The purpose of this measure is to prevent bystanders from reading the password; however, some argue that this practice may lead to mistakes and stress, encouraging users to choose weak passwords. As an alternative, users should have the option to show or hide passwords as they type them.<ref>[http://www.lyquix.com/blog/92-do-we-need-to-hide-passwords Lyquix Blog: Do We Need to Hide Passwords?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425114556/http://www.lyquix.com/blog/92-do-we-need-to-hide-passwords |date=2012-04-25 }}.

Some systems impose a time-out of several seconds after a small number (e.g., three) of failed password entry attempts. In the absence of other vulnerabilities, such systems can be effectively secure with relatively simple passwords, if they have been well chosen and are not easily guessed.<ref>Stuart Brown {{cite web |url=http://www.modernlifeisrubbish.co.uk/top-10-most-common-passwords.asp |title=Top ten passwords used in the United Kingdom |accessdate=2007-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108094949/http://www.modernlifeisrubbish.co.uk/top-10-most-common-passwords.asp |archivedate=November 8, 2006 |df= }}.

If an attacker gets access to the file of hashed passwords guessing can be done offline, rapidly testing candidate passwords against the true password's hash value. In the example of a web-server, an online attacker can guess only at the rate at which the server will respond, while an off-line attacker (who gains access to the file) can guess at a rate limited only by the hardware on which the attack is running.\n\nPasswords that are used to generate cryptographic keys (e.g., for [[disk encryption]] or [[Wi-Fi]] security) can also be subjected to high rate guessing. Lists of common passwords are widely available and can make password attacks very efficient. (See [[Password cracking]].) Security in such situations depends on using passwords or passphrases of adequate complexity, making such an attack computationally infeasible for the attacker. Some systems, such as [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] and [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|Wi-Fi WPA]], apply a computation-intensive hash to the password to slow such attacks. See [[key stretching]].\n\n===Limits on the number of password guesses===\n\nAn alternative to limiting the rate at which an attacker can make guesses on a password is to limit the total number of guesses that can be made.  The password can be disabled, requiring a reset, after a\nsmall number of consecutive bad guesses (say 5); and the user may be required to change the password after a larger cumulative number of bad guesses (say 30), to prevent an attacker from making an arbitrarily large number of bad guesses by interspersing them between good guesses made by the legitimate password owner.<ref>{{cite patent |country=US |number=8046827 |status=patent}}</ref>  Attackers may conversely use knowledge of this mitigation to implement a [[denial-of-service attack|denial of service attack]] against the user by intentionally locking the user out of their own device; this denial of service may open other avenues for the attacker to manipulate the situation to their advantage via social engineering.\n\n===Form of stored passwords===\nSome computer systems store user passwords as [[plaintext]], against which to compare user log on attempts. If an attacker gains access to such an internal password store, all passwords—and so all user accounts—will be compromised. If some users employ the same password for accounts on different systems, those will be compromised as well.\n\nMore secure systems store each password in a cryptographically protected form, so access to the actual password will still be difficult for a snooper who gains internal access to the system, while validation of user access attempts remains possible. The most secure don't store passwords at all, but a one-way derivation, such as a [[polynomial]], [[Modulo operation|modulus]], or an advanced [[Cryptographic hash function|hash function]].<ref name=\"SS1\">{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title= PINs and Passwords, Part 2 | url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/08/pins-and-passwords-part-2.html |work=Passwords| publisher=SleuthSayers| location=Orlando| date=2013-08-11}}</ref>\n[[Roger Needham]] invented the now common approach of storing only a \"hashed\" form of the plaintext password.<ref>Wilkes, M.

If the password is carried as electrical signals on unsecured physical wiring between the user access point and the central system controlling the password database, it is subject to snooping by [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]] methods. If it is carried as packeted data over the Internet, anyone able to watch the [[packet (information technology)|packets]] containing the logon information can snoop with a very low probability of detection.\n\nEmail is sometimes used to distribute passwords but this is generally an insecure method. Since most email is sent as [[plaintext]], a message containing a password is readable without effort during transport by any eavesdropper.  Further, the message will be stored as [[plaintext]] on at least two computers: the sender's and the recipient's. If it passes through intermediate systems during its travels, it will probably be stored on there as well, at least for some time, and may be copied to [[backup]], [[cache (computing)|cache]] or history files on any of these systems.\n\nUsing client-side encryption will only protect transmission from the mail handling system server to the client machine. Previous or subsequent relays of the email will not be protected and the email will probably be stored on multiple computers, certainly on the originating and receiving computers, most often in clear text.\n\n====Transmission through encrypted channels====\n\nThe risk of interception of passwords sent over the Internet can be reduced by, among other approaches, using [[cryptography|cryptographic]] protection. The most widely used is the [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS, previously called [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]]) feature built into most current Internet [[Web browser|browsers]]. Most browsers alert the user of a TLS/SSL protected exchange with a server by displaying a closed lock icon, or some other sign, when TLS is in use. There are several other techniques in use; see [[cryptography]].\n\n====Hash-based challenge-response methods====\n\nUnfortunately, there is a conflict between stored hashed-passwords and hash-based [[challenge-response authentication]]; the latter requires a client to prove to a server that they know what the [[shared secret]] (i.e., password) is, and to do this, the server must be able to obtain the shared secret from its stored form. On many systems (including [[Unix]]-type systems) doing remote authentication, the shared secret usually becomes the hashed form and has the serious limitation of exposing passwords to offline guessing attacks. In addition, when the hash is used as a shared secret, an attacker does not need the original password to authenticate remotely; they only need the hash.\n\n====Zero-knowledge password proofs====\n\nRather than transmitting a password, or transmitting the hash of the password, [[password-authenticated key agreement]] systems can perform a [[zero-knowledge password proof]], which proves knowledge of the password without exposing it.\n\nMoving a step further, augmented systems for [[password-authenticated key agreement]] (e.g., [[Authentication and key agreement via Memorable Passwords|AMP]], [[SPEKE|B-SPEKE]], [[PAK-Z]], [[Secure remote password protocol|SRP-6]]) avoid both the conflict and limitation of hash-based methods. An augmented system allows a client to prove knowledge of the password to a server, where the server knows only a (not exactly) hashed password, and where the unhashed password is required to gain access.\n\n===Procedures for changing passwords===\n\nUsually, a system must provide a way to change a password, either because a user believes the current password has been (or might have been) compromised, or as a precautionary measure. If a new password is passed to the system in unencrypted form, security can be lost (e.g., via wiretapping) before the new password can even be installed in the password database and if the new password is given to a compromised employee, little is gained. Some web sites include the user-selected password in an unencrypted confirmation e-mail message, with the obvious increased vulnerability.\n\n[[Identity management]] systems are increasingly used to automate issuance of replacements for lost passwords, a feature called [[self service password reset]]. The user's identity is verified by asking questions and comparing the answers to ones previously stored (i.e., when the account was opened).\n\nSome password reset questions ask for personal information that could be found on social media, such as mother's maiden name.  As a result, some security experts recommend either making up one's own questions or giving false answers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techlicious.com/tip/why-you-should-lie-when-setting-up-password-security-questions/ |title=Why You Should Lie When Setting Up Password Security Questions |publisher=Techlicious |date=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023045034/http://www.techlicious.com/tip/why-you-should-lie-when-setting-up-password-security-questions/ |archivedate=2013-10-23 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Password longevity===\n\n\"Password aging\" is a feature of some operating systems which forces users to change passwords frequently (e.g., quarterly, monthly or even more often). Such policies usually provoke user protest and foot-dragging at best and hostility at worst. There is often an increase in the people who note down the password and leave it where it can easily be found, as well as helpdesk calls to reset a forgotten password. Users may use simpler passwords or develop variation patterns on a consistent theme to keep their passwords memorable.<ref name=\"Joseph-Steinberg-Forbes\" /> Because of these issues, there is some debate as to whether password aging is effective.<ref name=WEB>\n{{cite web\n |url         = https://www.cesg.gov.uk/articles/problems-forcing-regular-password-expiry\n |title       = The problems with forcing regular password expiry\n |date        = 15 April 2016\n |work        = IA Matters\n |publisher   = CESG: the Information Security Arm of GCHQ\n |accessdate  = 5 Aug 2016\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160817223701/https://www.cesg.gov.uk/articles/problems-forcing-regular-password-expiry\n |archivedate = 17 August 2016\n |df          =\n}}\n</ref> Changing a password will not prevent abuse in most cases, since the abuse would often be immediately noticeable.

We are simply fooling the database that stores passwords into thinking the user did something good.\"<ref name=fort/>\n\n==Password cracking==\n{{Main|Password cracking}}\n\nAttempting to crack passwords by trying as many possibilities as time and money permit is a [[brute force attack]]. A related method, rather more efficient in most cases, is a [[dictionary attack]]. In a dictionary attack, all words in one or more dictionaries are tested. Lists of common passwords are also typically tested.\n\n[[Password strength]] is the likelihood that a password cannot be guessed or discovered, and varies with the attack algorithm used. Cryptologists and computer scientists often refer to the strength or 'hardness' in terms of [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].<ref name=\"SS1\" />\n\nPasswords easily discovered are termed ''weak'' or ''vulnerable''; passwords very difficult or impossible to discover are considered ''strong''. There are several programs available for password attack (or even auditing and recovery by systems personnel) such as [[L0phtCrack]], [[John the Ripper]], and [[Cain (software)|Cain]]; some of which use password design vulnerabilities (as found in the Microsoft LANManager system) to increase efficiency. These programs are sometimes used by system administrators to detect weak passwords proposed by users.\n\nStudies of production computer systems have consistently shown that a large fraction of all user-chosen passwords are readily guessed automatically. For example, Columbia University found 22% of user passwords could be recovered with little effort.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~crf/howto/password-howto.html |title=Password |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423015011/http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~crf/howto/password-howto.html |archivedate=April 23, 2007 |df= }}. cs.columbia.edu</ref> According to [[Bruce Schneier]], examining data from a 2006 [[phishing]] attack, 55% of [[MySpace]] passwords would be crackable in 8 hours using a commercially available Password Recovery Toolkit capable of testing 200,000 passwords per second in 2006.<ref>[http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/realworld_passw.html Schneier, Real-World Passwords] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923065435/http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/realworld_passw.html |date=2008-09-23 }}.

Their analysis shows that most schemes do better than passwords on security, some schemes do better and some worse with respect to usability, while ''every'' scheme does worse than passwords on deployability. The authors conclude with the following observation: “Marginal gains are often not sufficient to reach the activation energy necessary to overcome significant transition costs, which may provide the best explanation of why we are likely to live considerably longer before seeing the funeral procession for passwords arrive at the cemetery.”\n\n==Website password systems==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nPasswords are used on websites to authenticate users and are usually maintained on the Web server, meaning the browser on a remote system sends a password to the server (by HTTP POST), the server checks the password and sends back the relevant content (or an access denied message). This process eliminates the possibility of local reverse engineering as the code used to authenticate the password does not reside on the local machine.\n\nTransmission of the password, via the browser, in plaintext means it can be intercepted along its journey to the server. Many web authentication systems use SSL to establish an encrypted session between the browser and the server, and is usually the underlying meaning of claims to have a \"secure Web site\". This is done automatically by the browser and increases integrity of the session, assuming neither end has been compromised and that the [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]] implementations used are high quality ones.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Access code (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Authentication]]\n* [[CAPTCHA]]\n* [[Cognitive science]]\n* [[Diceware]]\n* [[Kerberos (protocol)]]\n* [[Keyfile]]\n* [[Passphrase]]\n* [[Password cracking]]\n* [[Password fatigue]]\n* [[Password length parameter]]\n* [[Password manager]]\n* [[Password notification e-mail]]\n* [[Password policy]]\n* [[Password psychology]]\n* [[Password strength]]\n* [[Password synchronization]]\n* [[Password-authenticated key agreement]]\n* [[Pre-shared key]]\n* [[Random password generator]]\n* [[Rainbow table]]\n* [[Self-service password reset]]\n* [[Usability of web authentication systems]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.acsac.org/2005/abstracts/89.html Graphical Passwords: A Survey]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120407064143/http://dazzlepod.com/site_media/txt/passwords.txt Large list of commonly used passwords]\n* [http://www.passwordresearch.com/stats/statindex.html Large collection of statistics about passwords]\n* [http://www.jablon.org/passwordlinks.html Research Papers on Password-based Cryptography]\n* [http://folk.uio.no/josang/passwords-conference/ The international passwords conference]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110218140320/http://www.emiic.net/docs/PasswordGuide.pdf Procedural Advice for Organisations and Administrators] (PDF)\n* [http://www.cscan.org/ Centre for Security, Communications and Network Research], University of Plymouth (PDF)\n* [https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html 2017 draft update to NIST password standards] for the U.S. federal government\n* [https://onpassword.one Memorable and secure password generator]\n\n[[Category:Password authentication]]\n[[Category:Identity documents]]\n[[Category:Security]]",
