It lost a point because there has not been a recent independent [[code audit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|title=Secure Messaging Scorecard. Which apps and tools actually keep your messages safe?|date=2014-11-04}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2015, RetroShare repository was migrated from [[SourceForge]] to [[GitHub]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://retroshare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/history/|title=History - RetroShare Docs|last=Community|first=RetroShare|website=retroshare.readthedocs.io|language=en|access-date=2018-01-28}}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\nRetroShare is an instant messaging and file sharing network that uses a [[distributed hash table]] for address discovery. Users can communicate indirectly through mutual friends and request direct connections<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/173455/|title=How to Disappear Completely: A Survey of Private Peer-to-Peer Networks|last=M|first=Rogers,|last2=S|first2=Bhatti,|date=2007|website=discovery.ucl.ac.uk|access-date=2018-01-28}}</ref>.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Authentication and connectivity===\nAfter initial installation, the user generates a pair of ([[GNU Privacy Guard|GPG]]) [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] with RetroShare. After authentication and exchanging an asymmetric key, [[OpenSSL]] is used to establish a connection, and for [[end-to-end encryption]]. Friends of friends cannot connect by default, but they can see each other, if the users allow it. [[IPv6]] support was merged<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/RetroShare/RetroShare/pull/1191|title=IPv6 support by G10h4ck · Pull Request #1191 · RetroShare/RetroShare|website=GitHub}}</ref> into the master branch and will be released in the next version.\n\n===File sharing===\nIt is possible to share folders between friends. File transfer is carried on using a multi-hop swarming system (inspired by the \"Turtle Hopping\" feature from the [[Turtle F2F]] project, but implemented differently). In essence, data is only exchanged between friends, although it is possible that the ultimate source and destination of a given transfer are multiple friends apart. A search function performing anonymous multi-[[Hop (telecommunications)|hop]] search is another source of finding files in the network.\n\nFiles are represented by their [[SHA-1]] [[Hash function|hash]] value, and [[HTTP]]-compliant file and links may be exported, copied, and pasted into/out of RetroShare to publish their virtual location into the RetroShare network.\n\n===Communication===\nThe services that RetroShare offers for communication are:\n\n* a private [[Online chat|chat]]\n* a private mailing system allow secure communication between known friends and distant friends\n* public and private multi-user chat lobbies\n* a [[Internet forum|forum]] system allowing both anonymous and authenticated forums which distributes posts from friends to friends\n* a channel system offers the possibility to auto-download files posted in a given channel to every subscribed peer, similar to [[RSS]] feeds\n* a posted links system, where links to important information can be shared\n*[[Voice over IP|VoIP]] calls\n* [[Videoconferencing|Video calls]] (since version 0.6.0)\n* [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] and [[I2P]] networks support, for further [[Anonymity on the Internet|anonymisation]] (since version 0.6.0).\n\n===User interface===\nThe core of the RetroShare software is based on an offline library, to which two executables are plugged:\n* a [[command-line interface]] executable which offers nearly no control, but it is useful to run \"headless\" on a [[Server (computing)|server]]\n* a [[graphical user interface]] written in [[Qt_(software)|Qt]] is the one most users use. In addition to functions quite common to other file sharing software, such as a search tab and visualization of transfers, RetroShare gives users the potential to manage their network by collecting optional information about neighboring friends and visualizing it as a trust matrix or as a dynamic network graph. The appearance can be changed by choosing one of several available style sheets.\n\n===Anonymity===\nThe [[friend-to-friend]] structure of the RetroShare network makes it difficult to intrude and hardly possible to monitor from an external point of view.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The degree of anonymity may be improved further by deactivating the [[Distributed hash table|DHT]] and IP/[[Certificate (cryptography)|certificate]] exchange services, making the RetroShare network a real dark net.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://torrentfreak.com/anonymous-decentralized-and-uncensored-file-sharing-is-booming-120302/|title=Anonymous, Decentralized and Uncensored File-Sharing is Booming - TorrentFreak|date=2012-03-03|work=TorrentFreak|access-date=2018-01-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFriends of friends may not connect directly with each other; however, a user may enable the anonymous sharing of files with friends of friends. Search, access, and both upload and download of these files are made by \"routing\" through a series of friends. This means that communication between the source of data (the up-loader) and the destination of the data (the down-loader) is indirect through mutual friends. Although the intermediary friends cannot determine the original source or ultimate destination, they can see their very next links in the communication chain (their friends). Since the data stream is encrypted, only original source and ultimate destination are able to see what data is transferred.\n\n== Caveats ==\nIs important to remember that while RetroShare’s encryption makes it virtually impossible for an [[ISP]] or another external observer to know what one is downloading or uploading, this limitation does not apply to members of the user's RetroShare circle of trust; adding the wrong people to it is a potential risk.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dougvitale.wordpress.com/2013/07/29/increase-online-privacy-with-retroshare/|title=Increase online privacy with RetroShare|date=2013-07-29|work=Doug Vitale Tech Blog|access-date=2018-01-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, a German Court granted an injunction against a user of RetroShare for sharing copyrighted music files. RetroShare derives its security from the fact that all transfers should go through “trusted friends” whom users add. In this case, the defendant added the anti-piracy monitoring company as a friend, which allowed him to be “caught.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://torrentfreak.com/anonymous-file-sharing-ruled-illegal-by-german-court-121123/|title=\"Anonymous\" File-Sharing Darknet Ruled Illegal by German Court - TorrentFreak|date=2012-11-23|work=TorrentFreak|access-date=2018-01-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n* [[Comparison of file-sharing applications]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official|https://retroshare.cc}}\n\n{{File sharing}}\n{{Cryptographic software}}\n[[Category:2006 software]]\n[[Category:Anonymous file sharing networks]]\n[[Category:Cross-platform free software]]\n[[Category:Cryptographic software]]\n[[Category:Free file sharing software]]\n[[Category:Free file transfer software]]\n[[Category:Free instant messaging clients]]\n[[Category:Free Internet forum software]]\n[[Category:Free software programmed in C++]]\n[[Category:Instant messaging clients that use Qt]]\n[[Category:Internet privacy software]]\n[[Category:MacOS instant messaging clients]]\n[[Category:Peer-to-peer file sharing]]\n[[Category:Secure communication]]\n[[Category:Unix instant messaging clients]]\n[[Category:Windows instant messaging clients]]\n[[Category:Peer-to-peer software]]",
