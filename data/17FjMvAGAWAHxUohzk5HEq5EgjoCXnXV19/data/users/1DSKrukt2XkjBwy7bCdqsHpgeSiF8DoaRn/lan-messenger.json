            "text": "A '''LAN Messenger''' is a [[instant messaging]] program for computers designed for use within a single [[local area network]] (LAN).\n\nMany LAN Messengers offer basics functionality for sending private messages, [[file transfer]], [[chatroom]]s and graphical [[smiley]]s. The advantage of using a simple LAN messenger over a normal instant messenger is that no active Internet connection or [[Server (computing)|central server]] is required, and only people inside the [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] will have access to the system.\n\n== History ==\nA precursor of LAN Messengers is the [[Unix]] [[Talk (software)|talk]] command, and similar facilities on earlier systems,<ref>http://osdir.com/ml/culture.internet.history/2002-12/msg00026.html Origin of 'talk' command</ref> which enabled multiple users on one host system to directly talk with each other. \n\n[[NetWare|Novell NetWare]] featured a trivial person-to-person chat program for DOS, which used the [IPX/SPX] protocol suite. NetWare for Windows also included broadcast and targeted messages similar to WinPopup and the Windows Messenger service.\n\nOn [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Windows Messenger service#WinPopup|WinPopup]] was a small utility included with Windows 3.11. WinPopup uses [[Server Message Block|SMB]]/[[NetBIOS]] protocol and was intended to receive and send short text messages.\n\nWindows NT/2000/XP improves upon this with [[Windows Messenger service]], a Windows service compatible to WinPopup.<ref>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/137143 WinPopup Utility Not Supported In Windows NT</ref> On systems where this service is running, the received messages \"pop up\" as simple message boxes.  Any software compatible with WinPopup, like the console utility [[Windows Messenger service#Net Send|NET SEND]], can send such messages. However, due to security concerns,<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;330904 \"Messenger Service window that contains an Internet advertisement appears\"], microsoft.com</ref> by default, the messenger service is off in Windows XP SP2 and blocked by Windows XP's [[firewall (networking)|firewall]].\n\nOn Apple's {{nowrap|[[Mac OS X]]}}-based computers, the [[iChat]] program has allowed LAN messaging over the [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]] protocol since 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lists.apple.com/archives/rendezvous-dev/2005/Apr/msg00001.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123608/http://lists.apple.com/archives/rendezvous-dev/2005/Apr/msg00001.html |archivedate=2007-03-19 |df= }} Rendezvous is changing to...</ref> The multi-protocol messenger [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]] has support for the Bonjour protocol,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=516210 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817230402/http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=516210 |archivedate=2009-08-17 |df= }} Pidgin 2.0.2 Release Notes and Changelog</ref> including on Windows.<ref>[http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Protocol%20Specific%20Questions#CanIuseWindowsPidginforBonjour \"Can I use Windows Pidgin for Bonjour?\"], FAQ, pidgin.im</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubuntubuzz.com/2011/11/use-pidgin-for-chatting-and.html|title=Use Pidgin for Chatting And Transferring Files on Local Network Without Internet Connection|author=Mahmudin Ashar|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of instant messaging protocols]]\n* [[Comparison of instant messaging clients]]\n* [[Comparison of LAN messengers]]\n* [[Friend-to-friend]]\n* [[Internet Relay Chat#Technical information|IRC on LANs]]\n* [[Talker]]\n* [[Windows Messenger service]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Instant messaging}}\n{{Computer-mediated communication}}\n\n[[Category:Internet culture]]\n[[Category:Online chat]]\n[[Category:LAN messengers| ]]\n\n{{network-software-stub}}",
