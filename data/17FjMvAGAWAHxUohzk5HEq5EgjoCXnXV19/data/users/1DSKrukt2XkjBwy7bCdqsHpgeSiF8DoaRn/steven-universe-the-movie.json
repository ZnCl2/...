The film is directed, co-written, produced and executive produced by Sugar and fellow longtime crew members Kat Morris and Joe Johnston, and stars [[Zach Callison]], [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]], [[Michaela Dietz]], [[Deedee Magno Hall]], and [[Sarah Stiles]], alongside an ensemble cast reprising their roles from the television series. ''Steven Universe: The Movie'' takes place two years after the events of the season 5 finale \"[[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|Change Your Mind]]\", and follows the Crystal Gems as they attempt to save all organic life on Earth from a deranged Gem with a history with Steven's mother.\n\nThe film was announced at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2018, and a short teaser trailer was later released on Cartoon Network's [[YouTube]] channel. At San Diego Comic-Con 2019, a trailer for the film was released, along with the announcement of a documentary based on the film's creation to be released along with the DVD. The film premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] on September 2, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter an introduction from the Diamonds (\"The Tale of Steven\"), [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]] (now 16 years old) greets the citizens of the Gem Homeworld. The Diamonds want him to stay to fulfill his mother Pink Diamond's role as leader (\"Let Us Adore You\"), but he refuses. Back on Earth, Steven sees Connie off to space camp. Steven, [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]], [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]], and [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]] celebrate their newfound \"Happily Ever After\". Almost immediately afterwards, a giant drill lands on the hillside of Beach City and Spinel, a deranged and cartoonish Gem, appears, announcing her intent to kill Steven and the rest of the Earth (\"Other Friends\"). Using a scythe-like weapon, she \"poofs\" Pearl, Garnet, and Amethyst back into their gem forms; her attacks also weaken Steven's Gem powers, though his body is unharmed. Steven manages to poof Spinel with the scythe.\n\nSteven calls his father, Greg, for help. The Gems regenerate their bodies (including Ruby and Sapphire separately), but their memories have been erased; Pearl assumes that she is Greg's servant (\"system/BOOT.pearl_final(3).Info\"). With her memories gone, Spinel is a goofy and happy-go-lucky Gem whose role is to entertain her companion. Steven and Spinel take Ruby and Sapphire to seek advice from Peridot, Lapis Lazuli, and Bismuth; they encourage Steven not to give up (\"Who We Are\"). Bismuth identifies Spinel's scythe as a \"Rejuvenator\", a device that can reset the mind of a Gem back to when it was first created. Spinel compares the situation to a puzzle, suggesting that they find the Gems' \"missing pieces\" to restore their memories, inspiring Steven to try to reenact Ruby and Sapphire's first fusion. Spinel's antics cause scaffolding to collapse, almost crushing Ruby; when Sapphire shoves her to safety, the pair fuse into Garnet (\"Isn't It Love?\"), but she still has no memory of her life.\n\nAfter Steven recovers Amethyst's memory by reenacting experiences the two had together (\"No Matter What\"), Peridot discovers that the drill is injecting a toxic chemical that will kill all organic life on Earth. In order to revive Pearl's memory, the group takes her to a ''Sadie Killer and the Suspects'' concert, in the hope their music will bring back her memories of rebellion (\"Disobedient\"), but Pearl says that as long as Greg exists she will obey him. Steven uses what little energy he has left to fuse with Greg (\"Independent Together\"), which enables Pearl to recover her memory. She tells Steven that Spinel was once Pink Diamond's playmate; Spinel is suddenly overcome with sadness and flees.\n\nAfter sending for Connie, Steven finds Spinel crying at his house. She takes Steven to a desolate garden in space and reveals her backstory: she was Pink Diamond's playmate until the other Diamonds gave Pink her own colony. Pink told Spinel to wait for her, and left her alone in the garden for 6,000 years until she learned of Pink Diamond's fate (\"Drift Away\"). Steven tells her that he will never abandon her and that he will make up for his mother's mistakes (\"Found\").\n\nBack in Beach City, Spinel turns off the drill, but when Steven begins shifting his attention back to everyone else, she accuses Steven of just using her and then abandoning her or planning to wipe her memory again. She turns the drill back on and attacks Steven. As he tries to explain the truth to her, Garnet recovers her memory. Steven sends the others out to rescue the humans of Beach City while he confronts Spinel (\"True Kinda Love\"). Steven finally realizes why his Gem powers have not yet returned: his desire for an unchanging \"happily ever after\" has left him resistant to the very notion of growth and change, which he needs to re-experience. Embracing this fact, he regains his powers and battles Spinel, trying to convince her that she can change as well (\"Change\"). Their fight destroys the drill, and Spinel relents after realizing how much she hates what she has become.\n\nThe Diamonds suddenly arrive and state their intention to live on the Earth with Steven. He introduces Spinel to them and they take an immediate liking to her and her goofy personality (\"Let Us Adore You (Reprise)\"). The Diamonds accept her in place of Steven and she happily goes with them, now with people who will love her unconditionally. Steven and his friends gather to rebuild Beach City, thanks in part to Steven's healing powers undoing the poison's damage. Steven, Connie, Pearl, Garnet, Amethyst and Greg perform a Broadway-style \"Finale\".\n\n== Cast ==\n\n{{main article|List of Steven Universe characters}}\n\nThe film features the main and recurring characters of the series,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://collider.com/steven-universe-movie-poster/ |title=First Poster for 'Steven Universe The Movie' Reveals the Looming Threat |last=Trumbore |first=Dave |date=July 9, 2019 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |access-date=July 20, 2019 |language=en-US}}</ref> and introduces the new characters Spinel and Steg.\n* [[Zach Callison]]&nbsp;as&nbsp;[[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]], a Gem-human hybrid member of the Crystal Gems and formerly The Great Diamond Authority.\n* [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]&nbsp;as&nbsp;[[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]], a fusion who is the ''de facto'' leader of the Crystal Gems.\n** [[Charlyne Yi]]&nbsp;as Ruby, one of Garnet's components, a hotheaded soldier Gem and spouse of Sapphire.\n** [[Erica Luttrell]]&nbsp;as Sapphire, one of Garnet's components, a cool and collected precognitive Gem and spouse of Ruby.\n* [[Michaela Dietz]]&nbsp;as&nbsp;[[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]], one of the Crystal Gems.\n* [[Deedee Magno Hall]]&nbsp;as&nbsp;[[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]], one of the original members of the Crystal Gems.\n* [[Sarah Stiles]] as Spinel, the main antagonist of the movie.\n* [[Tom Scharpling]]&nbsp;as Greg Universe, the father of Steven Universe.\n* [[Grace Rolek]]&nbsp;as Connie Maheswaran, Steven's best friend.\n* [[Matthew Moy]]&nbsp;as Lars Barriga, a friend of Steven Universe.\n* [[Kate Micucci]]&nbsp;as Sadie Miller, a friend of Steven Universe.\n* [[Shelby Rabara]]&nbsp;as Peridot, a member of the Crystal Gems who was formerly aligned with Homeworld.\n* [[Jennifer Paz]]&nbsp;as Lapis Lazuli, a member of the Crystal Gems who was formerly aligned with Homeworld.\n* [[Uzo Aduba]]&nbsp;as Bismuth, one of the original members of the Crystal Gems.\n* [[Patti LuPone]]&nbsp;as Yellow Diamond, a member of The Great Diamond Authority.\n* [[Lisa Hannigan]]&nbsp;as Blue Diamond, a member of The Great Diamond Authority.\n* [[Christine Ebersole]]&nbsp;as White Diamond, a member of The Great Diamond Authority. \n* [[Toks Olagundoye]]&nbsp;as Nanefua Pizza, the mayor of Beach City.\n* [[Aimee Mann]]&nbsp;as Opal, a fusion of Pearl and Amethyst.\n* [[Ted Leo]]&nbsp;as Steg, a fusion of Steven and Greg.\n\n==Production==\nThe film is a [[Musical film|musical]], with songs written by the series creator [[Rebecca Sugar]] featuring musical collaborations with [[Aivi & Surasshu|Aivi & Surasshu]], [[Chance the Rapper]], [[Gallant (singer)|Gallant]], [[James Fauntleroy]], [[Macie Stewart]], [[Mike Krol]], Grant Henry ([[Stemage]]), Jeff Liu, Jeff Ball, and Julian \"Zorsy\" Sanchez, as well as [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]], [[Ted Leo]], and [[Aimee Mann]], who have voice roles.<ref name=\"movietrailer\"/> The film is executive produced by Rebecca Sugar.<ref name=\"deadline\">{{Cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2019/06/steven-universe-the-movie-chance-the-rapper-patti-lupone-cartoon-network-1202631825/ |title='Steven Universe The Movie' Adds Chance The Rapper, Patti LuPone And More To Musical |last=Haring |first=Bruce |date=June 13, 2019 |work=Deadline |access-date=June 13, 2019}}</ref> The co-executive producers are Chance the Rapper, Kat Morris, Joe Johnston, Alonso Ramirez Ramos and [[Ian Jones-Quartey]].<ref name=\"deadline\"/> The film was directed by Rebecca Sugar, Kat Morris, and Joe Johnston.
