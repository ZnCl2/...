The [[Free Software Foundation]], an organization that advocates the free software model, suggests that to understand the concept, one should \"think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer\". (See {{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html | publisher = GNU.org | title = The Free Software Definition | accessdate =4 February 2010 }}) Free software focuses on the fundamental freedoms it gives to users, whereas open source software focuses on the perceived strengths of its peer-to-peer development model.{{sfn|Feller|2005|pages=101–106, 110–111}} FOSS is a term that can be used without particular bias towards either political approach.}} That is, anyone is [[free software license|freely licensed]] to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the [[source code]] is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html|title=What is free software?

FOSS (free and open-source software) allows the user to inspect the source code and provides a high level of control of the software's functions compared to [[proprietary software]]. The term \"free software\" does not refer to the monetary cost of the software at all, but rather whether the license maintains the software user's civil liberties (\"free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”).<ref name=\":1\" /> There are a number of related terms and abbreviations for free and open-source software (FOSS or F/OSS), or free/libre and open-source software (FLOSS or F/LOSS—FLOSS is the FSF-preferred term).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html|title=FLOSS and FOSS|last=Stallman|first=Richard|date=|website=The GNU Project -- GNU.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref> \n\nAlthough there is almost a complete overlap between [[Free software|free-software]] licenses and [[Open-source software|open-source-software]] licenses, there is a strong philosophical disagreement between the advocates of these two positions. The terminology of FOSS or \"Free and Open-source software\" was created to be a neutral on these philosophical disagreements between the FSF and OSI and have a single unified term that could refer to both concepts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html|title=FLOSS and FOSS|last=Stallman|first=Richard|date=|website=www.gnu.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref>\n\nAs the Free Software Foundation (FSF) explains the philosophical difference between [[free software]] and [[open-source software]]: \"The two terms describe almost the same category of software, but they stand for views based on fundamentally different values. Open-source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement.  For the free-software movement, free software is an ethical imperative, essential respect for the users' freedom.  By contrast, the philosophy of open-source considers issues in terms of how to make software “better”—in a practical sense only.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html|title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software|last=Stallman|first=Richard|date=18 November 2016|website=The GNU Project -- GNU.org|access-date=15 September 2018}}</ref> In parallel to this the [[Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) considers many free-software licenses to also be open source.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://opensource.org/faq#free-software|title=Frequently Answered Questions {{!}} Open Source Initiative|website=opensource.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref> These include the latest versions of the FSF's three main licenses: the GPL, the [[Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL), and the [[GNU Affero General Public License]] (AGPL).<ref>{{cite web|title=Licenses by Name|url=http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical|work=Open Source License|publisher=Open Source Initiative|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref> \n\n===Free software===\n\nRichard Stallman's [[Free Software Definition]], adopted by the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF), defines [[free software]] as a matter of liberty not price,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html |title=GNU.org |date=20 September 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref> and it upholds the Four Essential Freedoms.

A growing and evolving software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturer's bundled software products; rather than funding software development from hardware revenue, these new companies were selling software directly. Leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers who were able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of software bundled with hardware product costs. In ''United States vs. [[IBM]]'', filed January 17, 1969, the government charged that bundled software was anticompetitive.{{sfn|Fisher|McKie|Mancke|1983}} While some software was still being provided without monetary cost and license restriction, there was a growing amount of software that was only at a monetary cost with restricted licensing. In the 1970s and early 1980s, some parts of the [[software industry]] began using technical measures (such as distributing only [[Executable|binary copies]] of [[computer programs]]) to prevent [[computer users]] from being able to use [[reverse engineering]] techniques to study and customize software they had paid for. In 1980, the copyright law was extended to computer programs in the [[United States]]<ref>[http://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/PL96-517.pdf Computer Software 1980 Copyright Act, Pub. L.

An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March 1985 titled the ''[[GNU Manifesto]]''. The manifesto included significant explanation of the GNU philosophy, ''[[Free Software Definition]]'' and \"[[copyleft]]\" ideas. The FSF takes the position that the fundamental issue [[Free software]] addresses is an ethical one—to ensure software users can exercise what it calls \"[[Free software#Definition and the Four Freedoms|The Four Essential Freedoms]]\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe [[Linux kernel]], created by [[Linus Torvalds]], was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991. Initially, Linux was not released under either a Free software or an Open-source software license. However, with version 0.12 in February 1992, he [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] the project under the [[GNU General Public License]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12 | title=Release notes for Linux kernel 0.12 | publisher=Kernel.org }}</ref>\n\n[[FreeBSD]] and [[NetBSD]] (both derived from [[386BSD]]) were released as Free software when the [[USL v. BSDi]] lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993. [[OpenBSD]] [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from NetBSD in 1995. Also in 1995, The [[Apache HTTP Server]], commonly referred to as Apache, was released under the [[Apache License|Apache License 1.0]].\n\nIn 1997, [[Eric S. Raymond|Eric Raymond]] published [[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]], a reflective analysis of the hacker community and Free software principles. The paper received significant attention in early 1998, and was one factor in motivating [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release their popular [[Netscape Communicator]] Internet suite as [[Free software]]. This code is today better known as [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]].\n\nNetscape's act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring the FSF's Free software ideas and perceived benefits to the commercial software industry. They concluded that FSF's social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape, and looked for a way to rebrand the Free software movement to emphasize the business potential of sharing and collaborating on software source code. The new name they chose was \"Open-source\", and quickly [[Bruce Perens]], publisher [[Tim O'Reilly]], [[Linus Torvalds]], and others signed on to the rebranding. The [[Open Source Initiative]] was founded in February 1998 to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize open-source principles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opensource.org/history |title=History of the OSI | publisher=Opensource.org}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Open Source Initiative sought to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize the principles it adhered to, commercial software vendors found themselves increasingly threatened by the concept of freely distributed software and universal access to an application's [[source code]]. A [[Microsoft]] executive publicly stated in 2001 that \"Open-source is an intellectual property destroyer. I can't imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business.\"{{sfn|Charny|2001}} This view perfectly summarizes the initial response to FOSS by some software corporations.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} For many years FOSS played a niche role outside of the mainstream of private software development.  However the success of FOSS Operating Systems such as Linux, BSD and the companies based on FOSS such as [[Red Hat]], has changed the software industry's attitude and there has been a dramatic shift in the corporate philosophy concerning the development of Free and Open-source software (FOSS).{{sfn|Miller|Voas|Costello|2010|pages=14–16}}\n\n==Usage==\n{{See also|Linux adoption|Free software#Adoption|Open-source software#Adoption}}\n\n===FOSS benefits over proprietary software===\n<!--to include: https://books.google.com/books?id=C0Z30r8qdpcC-->\n\n====Personal control, customizability and freedom====\n{{See also|Vendor lock-in}}\nUsers of FOSS benefit from the [[Free software#Definition and the Four Freedoms|Four Essential Freedoms]] to make unrestricted use of, and to study, copy, modify, and redistribute such software with or without modification.
