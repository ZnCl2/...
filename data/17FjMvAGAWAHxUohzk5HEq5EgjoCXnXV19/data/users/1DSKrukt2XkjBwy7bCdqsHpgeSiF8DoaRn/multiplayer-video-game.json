Multiplayer games usually require players to share the resources of a single game system or use [[Mobile network|networking technology]] to play together over a greater distance; players may compete against one or more human contestants, work [[cooperative gameplay|cooperatively]] with a human partner to achieve a common goal, [[Gamemaster|supervise]] other players' activity, [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]]. Multiplayer games allow players interaction with other individuals in partnership, competition or rivalry, providing them with social communication absent from single-player games.\n\nDuring its early history, video games were often [[Single-player video game|single-player]]-only activities, putting the player against pre-programmed challenges or [[Non-player character|AI-controlled opponents]], which lack the flexibility of human thought.\n\n==Asynchronous multiplayer==\nAsynchronous multiplayer is a form of multiplayer gameplay where players do not have to be playing at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/126424/Opinion_Synchronous_or_Asynchronous_Gameplay.php|title=Opinion: Synchronous or Asynchronous Gameplay|last=Kelly|first=Tadhg|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Non-networked===\nSome of the earliest video games were two-player games, including early [[sports game]]s (such as 1958's ''[[Tennis For Two]]''  and 1972's ''[[Pong]]''), early [[shooter game]]s such as ''[[Spacewar!]]'' (1962)<ref name=\"NGen19\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Getting Connected |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=19|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=July 1996|page=20|quote=There have been multiplayer electronic games since the dawn of computing. ''Space War!'', the first real videogame, programmed by Steve Russell on the PDP-1, was an exclusive two-player game. So was Nolan Bushnell's pioneering coin-op ''Pong''.}}</ref> and early [[racing video game]]s such as ''[[EVR Race|Astro Race]]'' (1973).<ref>{{KLOV game|6949|Astro Race}}</ref> The first examples of multiplayer real-time games were developed on the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO system]] about 1973. Multi-user games developed on this system included 1973's [[Empire (PLATO)|Empire]] and 1974's [[Spasim]]; the latter was an early [[first-person shooter]]. Other early video games included turn-based multiplayer modes, popular in [[tabletop arcade machine]]s. In such games, play is alternated at some point (often after the loss of a [[Life (gaming)|life]]). All players' scores are often displayed onscreen so players can see their relative standing.\n\n[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]] (1985) and [[Quartet (video game)|Quartet]] (1986) introduced co-operative 4-player gaming to the arcades. The games had broader consoles to allow for four sets of controls.\n\n===Networked===\nThe first large-scale serial sessions using a single computer{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} were STAR (based on ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''), OCEAN (a battle using ships, submarines and helicopters, with players divided between two combating cities) and 1975's CAVE (based on [[Dungeons and Dragons]]), created by Christopher Caldwell (with art work and suggestions by Roger Long and assembly coding by Robert Kenney) on the [[University of New Hampshire]]'s [[DECsystem-10]]90. The university's computer system had hundreds of terminals, connected (via serial lines) through cluster [[PDP-11]]s for student, teacher and staff access. The games had a program running on each terminal (for each player), sharing a segment of [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]] (known as the \"high segment\" in the OS TOPS-10). The games became popular, and the university often banned them because of their [[Server hog|RAM use]]. STAR was based on 1974's single-user, turn-oriented [[BASIC]] program STAR, written by Michael O'Shaughnessy at UNH.\n\nKen Wasserman and [[Tim Stryker]] in a 1980 ''[[BYTE]]'' article identified three factors which make networked computer games appealing:{{r|byte198012}}\n\n# Multiple humans competing with each other instead of a computer\n# [[Incomplete information]] resulting in suspense and risk-taking\n# Real-time play requiring quick reaction\n\nWasserman and Stryker described how to network two [[Commodore PET]] computers with a cable, which included a [[type-in program|type-in]], two-player [[Hangman (game)|Hangman]] and described the authors' more-sophisticated ''Flash Attack''.<ref name=byte198012>{{cite news | url= https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1980-12/1980_12_BYTE_05-12_Adventure#page/n25/mode/2up | title= Multimachine Games | work= BYTE | date= December 1980 | accessdate= 18 October 2013 |author1= Wasserman, Ken |author2= Stryker, Tim | pages= 24}}</ref> [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] distributed another multi-user version of ''Star Trek'', [[Decwar]], without real-time screen updating; it was widely distributed{{by whom|date=January 2017}} to universities with DECsystem-10s. In 1981 Cliff Zimmerman wrote an homage to ''Star Trek'' in [[MACRO-10]] for DECsystem-10s and [[DECsystem-20|-20]]s using VT100-series graphics. \"VTtrek\" pitted four [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] players against four [[Klingon]]s in a three-dimensional universe.\n\n''[[History of Microsoft Flight Simulator|Flight Simulator II]]'', released in 1986 for the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga, allowed two players to connect via modem or serial cable and fly together in a shared environment.\n\n''[[MIDI Maze]]'', an early first-person shooter released in 1987 for the [[Atari ST]], featured network multiplay through a [[MIDI]] interface before [[Ethernet]] and [[Internet]] play became common. It is considered{{by whom|date=January 2017}} the first multiplayer 3D shooter on a mainstream system, and the first network multiplayer action-game (with support for up to 16 players). There followed [[Porting|ports]] to a number of platforms (including [[Game Boy]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]) in 1991 under the title ''Faceball 2000'', making it one of the first handheld, multi-platform first-person shooters and an early console example of the genre.<ref>Parish, Jeremy, [http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3133741 The Essential 50: Faceball 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040820221008/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3133741 |date=2004-08-20 }}, ''1UP,'' Accessed April 24, 2009</ref>\n\nNetworked multiplayer gaming modes are known as \"netplay\". The first popular video-game title with a [[Local area network|Local Area Network]](LAN) version, 1991's [[Spectre (video game)|Spectre]] for the Apple Macintosh, featured [[AppleTalk]] support for up to eight players. Spectre's popularity was partially attributed{{by whom|date=January 2017}} to the display of a player's name above their cybertank. There followed  1993's [[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]], whose first network version allowed four simultaneous players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/932958/Doom|title=Doom - electronic game|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nNetworked multiplayer LAN games eliminate common Internet problems such as [[lag (online gaming)|lag]] and anonymity, and are the focus of [[LAN party|LAN parties]]. [[Play-by-mail game|Play-by-email]] multiplayer games use email to communicate between computers. Other turn-based variations not requiring players to be online simultaneously are [[Play-by-post gaming]] and [[Play-by-Internet]]. Some online games are \"[[massively multiplayer]]\", with a large number of players participating simultaneously. Two massively-multiplayer genres are [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] (such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' or ''[[EverQuest]]'') and [[Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game|MMORTS]].\n\nSome networked multiplayer games, including [[MUD]]s and massively multiplayer online games(MMOG) such as [[RuneScape]], omit a single-player mode. First-person shooters have become popular multiplayer games; ''[[Battlefield 1942]]'' and ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' have little (or no) single-player gameplay. Developer and gaming site [[OMGPOP]]'s library includes multiplayer [[Browser game#Plug-in|Flash games]] for the casual player. The world's largest MMOG is South Korea's [[Lineage game|''Lineage'']], with 19&nbsp;million registered players (primarily in Asia).<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http://ca.ign.com/articles/2008/10/29/ncsofts-lineage-ii-expansion-dramatically-speeds-up-character-progression \n|title= NCsoft's Lineage II Expansion Dramatically Speeds Up Character Progression - IGN \n|publisher= Ca.ign.com |date= |accessdate= 2013-08-28\n}}\n</ref>\nThe largest Western MMOG in 2008 was ''World of Warcraft'', with over 10&nbsp;million registered players worldwide. This category of games requires multiple machines to connect via the Internet; before the Internet became popular, MUDs were played on time-sharing computer systems and games like ''Doom'' were played on a LAN.\n\nGamers refer to [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] using the term \"[[Ping (networking utility)|ping]]\", after a utility which measures round-trip network communication delays (by the use of [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] packets). A player on a [[digital subscriber line|DSL]] connection with a 50-[[Millisecond|ms]] ping can react faster than a modem user with a 350-ms average latency. Other problems include [[packet loss]] and choke, which can prevent a player from \"registering\" their actions with a server. In first-person shooters, this problem appears when bullets hit the enemy without damage. The player's connection is not the only factor; some servers are slower than others.\n\nBeginning with the [[Sega NetLink]] in 1996, [[Game.com]] in 1997 and [[Dreamcast]] in 2000, game consoles support network gaming over LANs and the Internet. Many [[mobile phone]]s and [[handheld console]]s also offer wireless gaming with [[Bluetooth]] (or similar) technology. By the early 2010s online gaming had become a mainstay of console platforms such as [[Xbox]] and [[PlayStation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Single-system==\nIn modern [[console game|console]], [[arcade game|arcade]] and [[personal computer game]]s, \"multiplayer\" implies play with several controllers plugged into one game system. Home-console games often use [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]], so each player has an individual view of the action (important in first-person shooters and in [[racing video game]]s); most arcade games, and some console games (since ''Pong''), do not. Nearly all multiplayer modes on [[beat 'em up]] games have a single-system option, but racing games have started to abandon split screen in favor of a multiple-system, multiplayer mode. Turn-based games such as chess also lend themselves to single system single screen and even to a single controller.\n\nThe term \"local co-op\" refers to local multiplayer games played in a cooperative manner on the same system; these may use split-screen or some other display method.\n\n[[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|Hotseat games]] are typically turn-based games with only one controller or input set - such as a single keyboard/mouse on the system. Players rotate using the input device to perform their turn such that each is taking a turn on the \"hotseat\".\n\n==Asymmetrical gameplay==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}} <!-- There are a list of references at WP:Articles_for_deletion/Aysmmetric_Video_Game -->\nAn asymmetric video game is a type of multiplayer video game in which players may play on in an unbalanced way. In \"soft asymmetry\" games the players have the same basic mechanics such as movement and death, yet all have different roles. In \"strong asymmetry\" games typically have one team that are practically the same or in soft asymmetric roles while the other team features players that play in a drastically different way.\n\n==Online cheating==\n{{main|Cheating in online games}}\nOnline cheating (in gaming) usually refers to modifying the game experience to give one player an advantage over others.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cheating|title=Cheating|dictionary=Dictionary.com|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/commentary/games/2007/04/gamesfrontiers_0423|title=What Type of Game Cheater Are You?|last=Thompson|first=Clive|date=December 19, 2012|accessdate=2009-09-15|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3149/how_to_hurt_the_hackers_the_scoop_.php|title=How To Hurt The Hackers|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}</ref> This is also known as \"hacking\" or \"glitching\". Cheating in video games is often done via a third party program which modifies the game's code at runtime to give one or more players an advantage. In other situations, it is frequently done by changing the games files to change the game's mechanics.<ref>Carter, M. & Gibbs, M.
