At its October 2012 launch as [[Vox Media]]'s third property, ''Polygon'' sought to distinguish itself from competitors by focusing on the stories of the people behind the games instead of the games themselves. They also produced [[Long-form journalism|long-form]] magazine-style feature articles, invested in video content, and chose to let their review scores be updated as the game changed.\n\nThe site was built over the course of ten months, and its 16-person founding staff included the editors-in-chief of the gaming sites ''[[Joystiq]]'', ''[[Kotaku]]'' and ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''. Its design was built to [[HTML5]] [[responsive web design|responsive]] standards with a pink color scheme, and its advertisements focused on direct sponsorship of specific kinds of content. Vox Media produced a [[documentary]] series on the founding of the site.\n\n==History==\nThe gaming blog ''Polygon'' was launched on October 24, 2012, as [[Vox Media]]'s third property. The site grew from technology blog ''[[The Verge]]'', which was launched a year earlier as an outgrowth of sports blog network ''[[SB Nation]]'' before Vox Media was formed. Vox Media's [[chief executive officer]], [[Jim Bankoff]], approached ''[[Joystiq]]'' editor-in-chief Christopher Grant in early 2011 about starting a video game website.<ref name=\"Forbes: Inside Story\" />{{efn|Vox's Bankoff was a former AOL executive and ''Joystiq'' was an AOL-owned video game blog.<ref name=\"Forbes: Inside Story\" />}} Bankoff considered video games to be a logical [[vertical market]] for Vox, whose sites attracted an 18- to 49-year-old demographic.<ref name=\"All Things Digital: Begin\" /> He also saw games to be an expanding market in consideration of [[mobile games|mobile]] and [[social network game]] categories.<ref name=\"All Things Digital: Begin\" /> ''[[Forbes]]'' described Bankoff's offer as a \"serious commitment to online journalism\" in an age of [[content farms]] and disappearing print publications, but Grant did not trust the offer and declined.<ref name=\"Forbes: Inside Story\" /> Upon seeing the effort that Vox Media put into ''The Verge'', their Chorus [[content management system]], and the quality of their content and sponsorships, Grant changed his mind and returned to pitch Bankoff. Grant wanted the new site to compete with top gaming websites ''[[GameSpot]]'' and ''[[IGN]]'', but still be able to run longform \"magazine-style journalism\" that could be of historic interest.<ref name=\"Forbes: Inside Story\" />{{efn|Longform web journalism was uncommon at the time.<ref name=\"Mashable: 2012\" />}} As part of the site's attempt to \"redefine games journalism\", Vox Media made a 13-part documentary series of the site's creation (\"Press Reset\") that tracked the site's creation from start to launch.<ref name=\"All Things Digital: Begin\" />\n\n''Forbes'' described ''Polygon''{{'s}} original 16-person staff as \"star-studded\" for including the editors-in-chief from three competing video game blogs.<ref name=\"Forbes: Inside Story\" /> Grant left ''Joystiq'' in January 2012 and brought the editors-in-chief of ''[[Kotaku]]'' and ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'', [[Brian Crecente]] and Russ Pitts.<ref name=\"Forbes: Inside Story\" /> Other staff included ''Joystiq'' managing editor [[Justin McElroy]] as well as weekend editor [[Griffin McElroy]],<ref name=\"Polygon: Departure\" /> and staff from [[UGO]], ''IGN'', [[MTV]], VideoGamer.com,<ref name=\"All Things Digital: Begin\" /><ref name=\"VG247: group\" /> and ''[[1UP.com]]''.<ref name=\"VG247: becomes\" /> Ben Kuchera joined the site after ''[[The Penny Arcade Report]]'' closed in November 2013.<ref name=\"GamePolitics: Kuchera\" /> The ''Polygon'' team [[telecommuting|works remotely]] from places including Philadelphia, West Virginia, San Francisco, Sydney, London, and Austin, while Vox Media is headquartered in New York City and Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"Inc.: NBCUniversal\" /><ref name=\"Poynter\" /> The site was developed over the course of ten months, where the staff chose the site's name and set standards for their reporting<ref name=\"Forbes: Inside Story\" /> and review score scale.<ref name=\"Mashable: 2012\" /> ''Polygon'' staff published on ''The Verge'' as \"''Vox Games''\" beginning in February 2012<ref name=\"All Things Digital: Arena\" /> and ending with their October launch.<ref name=\"All Things Digital: Begin\" /> The site's name was announced at a [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX East]] panel in April.<ref name=\"VG247: becomes\" /> It refers to a [[polygon]]â€”\"the basic visual building block of video games\".<ref name=\"Poynter\" />\n\nAfter raising money in a second round of funding in late 2013, Vox Media announced that they would be investing further in the site's video product, such that the site's experience would feel \"as much like TV programming as magazine publishing\".<ref name=\"MCV: raises 40m\" /> ''Polygon'' announced that it would run fewer features in June 2014, with the departure of features editor Russ Pitts, their video director, and video designer.<ref name=\"MCV: three staff\" /> ''Polygon'' hired Susana Polo, founder of ''[[The Mary Sue]]'', in 2015, which marked a transition in the site's scope to add pop culture and entertainment alongside their video game coverage.<ref name=\"GamesIndustry: Mary Sue\" /> ''[[GamesIndustry]]'' added that the hire marked a changing cultural sensibility in game and tech media towards the acceptance of progressive, feminist principles in the wake of [[Gamergate controversy|Gamergate]].<ref name=\"GamesIndustry: Mary Sue\" />\n\nVox Media later created several sites dedicated to specific video games with editorial staff from ''Polygon'' and ''SB Nation'': ''The Rift Herald'' (for ''[[League of Legends]]'' [[esports]]) in March 2016,<ref name=\"GamesIndustry: LoL\" /> and ''The Flying Courier'' (for ''[[Dota 2]]'') and ''Heroes Never Die'' (for ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'') in June 2017.<ref name=\"Polygon: esports\" /><!-- replace with third party source, when possible --> Brian Crecente left ''Polygon'' for ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} gaming website ''Glixel'' in July 2017,<ref name=\"GamesIndustry: Crecente\" /> and Chris Plante replaced him as Executive Editor.<ref name=\"GamesIndustry: Plante\" /> ''Polygon'' video producer Nick Robinson left<!--\"parting ways\", not exactly \"fired\"...--> ''Polygon'' in August 2017, following allegations of inappropriate online sexual advances.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Robinson\" /> Video producers Brian David Gilbert and Jenna Stoeber were hired soon after.

These Recommended titles subsequently will serve as the basis of selection of \"Polygon Essentials\", games that the site feels everyone should play.<ref name=\"Review scores\" />\n\n''Polygon''{{'s}} emphasis on video production expanded in late 2013,<ref name=\"MCV: raises 40m\" /> and waned in mid-2014 with the loss of video staff and the editorial decision to run fewer feature articles.<ref name=\"MCV: three staff\" /> By 2015, the site began to shift from games-only coverage to pop culture coverage, similar to the scope of rival sites ''IGN'' and ''Kotaku''.<ref name=\"GamesIndustry: Mary Sue\" /> ''Polygon''{{'s}} ''Minimap'' podcast was named among iTunes's best of 2015,<ref name=\"Vox Marketing: 2015 podcasts\" /> and ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' praised the site's ''Car Boys'' web series.<ref name=\"NYMag: Car Boys\" />\n\nThe website's flagship podcast, called ''The Polygon Show'', launched in 2017 and discusses gaming and culture.<ref name=\"Adweek: The Polygon Show\" /> It was named one of the \"10 gaming podcasts every gaming nerd should know\" by ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' in 2018.<ref name=\"The Daily Dot: podcasts\" /> In May 2018, ''Polygon'' launched the YouTube series \"Brand Slam\", in which brand mascots battle against one another.<ref name=\"AdAge: Brand Slam\" />\n\n==Design==\nThe site uses a pink color palette<ref name=\"All Things Digital: Begin\" /> and emulates the magazine-style layout of ''The Verge''.<ref name=\"VG247: dedicated\" /> The site was programmed to use [[HTML5]] standards with a [[responsive web design|responsive design]] that adapts to the screen dimensions of laptops, tablets, and smartphones.<ref name=\"Forbes: Inside Story\" /> This is partially to remove need for a separate mobile version.<ref name=\"VG247: dedicated\" /> Their longform journalism was optimized for reading on tablets.<ref name=\"Mashable: 2012\" />\n\n==Business==\nThe site uses a \"direct content sponsorship\" model of online advertising used by ''SB Nation'' and ''The Verge''.<ref name=\"Forbes: Inside Story\" /> For example, a video series sponsorship pairs brands with specific editorial content. ''Forbes'' wrote that Vox Media's avoidance of content farm and news aggregator tactics, and interest shown in building communities is desirable to \"magazine-quality advertisers\".<ref name=\"Forbes: Inside Story\" /> The site pitched its longform journalism to advertisers as an indicator of high-quality content.<ref name=\"Mashable: 2012\" /> The site's founding sponsors included [[Geico]], [[Sony]], and [[Unilever]].<ref name=\"Forbes: Inside Story\" />\n\nAs of June 2014, ''Polygon'' ranks fourth among games sites by [[Comscore]] web traffic data: behind ''IGN'', ''GameSpot'', and
