[[Passwords]] or [[digital signatures]] can be used for [[authentication]].\n\nUnlike other kinds of [[private P2P]], users in a friend-to-friend network cannot find out who else is participating beyond their own circle of friends, so F2F networks can grow in size without compromising their users' anonymity. [[Retroshare]], [[WASTE]], [[GNUnet]], [[Freenet]] and [[OneSwarm]] are examples of software that can be used to build F2F networks, though RetroShare is the only one of these configured for friend-to-friend operation by default.\n\nMany F2F networks support indirect [[Anonymity|anonymous]] or [[pseudonym]]ous communication between users who do not know or trust one another. For example, a [[node (networking)|node]] in a friend-to-friend [[overlay network|overlay]] can automatically forward a file (or a request for a file) anonymously between two friends, without telling either of them the other's name or [[IP address]]. These friends can in turn automatically forward the same file (or request) to their own friends, and so on.\n\n[[Dan Bricklin]] coined the term \"friend-to-friend network\" in 2000.<ref>D. Bricklin.
