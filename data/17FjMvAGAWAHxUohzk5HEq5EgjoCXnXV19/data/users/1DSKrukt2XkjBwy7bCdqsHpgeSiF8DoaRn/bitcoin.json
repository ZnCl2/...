Since transactions can have multiple outputs, users can send bitcoins to multiple recipients in one transaction. As in a cash transaction, the sum of inputs (coins used to pay) can exceed the intended sum of payments. In such a case, an additional output is used, returning the change back to the payer.<ref name=\"EconOfBTC\" /> Any input ''satoshis'' not accounted for in the transaction outputs become the transaction fee.<ref name=\"EconOfBTC\" />\n\n====Transaction fees====\nThough transaction fees are optional, miners can choose which transactions to process and prioritize those that pay higher fees.<ref name=\"EconOfBTC\" /> Miners may choose transactions based on the fee paid relative to their storage size, not the absolute amount of money paid as a fee. These fees are generally measured in ''satoshis per byte (sat/b)''.

Creating a bitcoin address requires nothing more than picking a random valid private key and computing the corresponding bitcoin address. This computation can be done in a split second. But the reverse, computing the private key of a given bitcoin address, is mathematically unfeasible. Users can tell others or make public a bitcoin address without compromising its corresponding private key. Moreover, the number of valid private keys is so vast that it is extremely unlikely someone will compute a key-pair that is already in use and has funds. The vast number of valid private keys makes it unfeasible that brute force could be used to compromise a private key. To be able to spend their bitcoins, the owner must know the corresponding [[private key]] and [[digital signature|digitally sign]] the transaction. The network verifies the signature using the [[public key]]; the private key is never revealed.<ref name=\"Antonopoulos2014\" />{{rp|ch. 5}}\n\nIf the private key is lost, the [[bitcoin network]] will not recognize any other evidence of ownership;<ref name=\"JEP\"/> the coins are then unusable, and effectively lost.
