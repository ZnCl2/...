P2P [[file sharing]] allows users to access media files such as books, music, movies, and games using a P2P software program that searches for other connected computers on a P2P network to locate the desired content.<ref name=\"Carmack\">{{cite web|last=Carmack |first=Carman|url= http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bittorrent1.htm|title=How Bit Torrent Works|work=computer.howstuffworks.com/|date=2005-03-26}}</ref> The nodes (peers) of such networks are end-user computers and distribution servers (not required).\n\nPeer-to-peer file sharing technology has evolved through several design stages from the early networks like [[Napster]], which popularized the technology, to the later models like the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] protocol. Microsoft uses it for Update distribution (Windows 10) and online playing games (e.g. the [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|mmorpg]] [[Skyforge]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/3dmzhz/heads_up_if_youre_installing_skyforge_the/|title=Heads up if you're installing Skyforge - The downloader is a P2P client and by default starts with Windows. • /r/MMORPG|website=reddit|access-date=2016-03-03}}</ref>) use it as their content distribution network for downloading large amounts of data without incurring the dramatic costs for bandwidth inherent when providing just a single source.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the widespread adoption and facilitation of peer-to-peer file sharing. These included increasing Internet bandwidth, the widespread digitization of physical media, and the increasing capabilities of residential personal computers. Users are able to transfer one or more files from one computer to another across the Internet through various [[file transfer]] systems and other file-sharing networks.<ref name=\"Carmack\" />\n\n==History==\nPeer-to-peer file sharing became popular with the introduction of [[Napster]], a file sharing application and a set of central servers that linked people who had files with those who requested files. The central index server indexed the users and their shared content. When someone searched for a file, the server searched all available copies of that file and presented them to the user. The files would be transferred directly between the two private computers. A limitation was that only music files could be shared.<ref name=\"Tyson\">{{cite web|last=Tyson|first= Jeff|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/napster2.htm|title=How the Old Napster Worked|work=howstuffworks.com|date= 2000-10-30}}</ref> Because this process occurred on a central server, however, Napster was held liable for copyright infringement and shut down in July 2001. It later reopened as a pay service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v11n1/douglas111.html|title= Copyright and Peer-To-Peer Music File Sharing: The Napster Case and the Argument Against Legislative Reform|date= March 2004|work=murdoch.edu.au}}</ref>\n\nAfter Napster was shut down, the most popular peer-to-peer services were [[Gnutella]] and [[Kazaa]]. These services also allowed users to download files other than music, such as movies and games.<ref name=\"Tyson\" />\n\n===Technology evolution ===\n[[Napster]] and [[eDonkey2000]], which both used a central server-based model, may be classified as the first generation of P2P systems.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gong|first1=Yiming|title=Identifying P2P users using traffic analysis|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/identifying-p2p-users-using-traffic-analysis|publisher=Symantec|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref> These systems relied on the operation of the respective central servers, and thus were susceptible to centralized shutdown. The second generation of P2P file sharing encompasses networks like [[Kazaa]], [[Gnutella]] and [[Gnutella2]], which are able to operate without any central servers, eliminated the central vulnerability by connecting users remotely to each other.<ref>{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Stephanie|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/kazaa3.htm|title=How Kazaa Works|work=computer.howstuffworks.com|date=2005-02-10}}</ref>\n\nThe third generation of filesharing networks are the so-called [[darknet]]s, including networks like [[Freenet]], which provide user anonymity in addition to the independence from central servers.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/262681429|title=Peer-to-peer systems and applications|others=Steinmetz, Ralf., Wehrle, Klaus, 1972-|isbn=9783540320470|location=Berlin|oclc=262681429}}</ref>\n\nThe [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] protocol represents a special case. In principle, it is a filesharing protocol of the first generation, relying on central servers called ''trackers'' to coordinate users. However, it does not form a network in the traditional sense. Instead new, separate networks of coordinating users are created for every set of files, called a ''torrent''. Newer extensions of the protocol removes the need of centralized trackers, allow the usage of a decentralized server-independent network for source identification purposes, referred to as the [[Mainline DHT]]. This allows BitTorrent to encompass certain aspects of a filesharing network of the second generation as well. Users create an index file containing the metadata of the files they want to share, and upload the index files to websites where they are shared with others.\n\nPeer-to-peer file sharing is also efficient in terms of cost.<ref name=\"Babaoglu 2012\">{{cite web|last=Babaoglu|first=Ozalp|title=Introduction to Peer-to-Peer Systems|url=http://www.cs.unibo.it/babaoglu/courses/cas/slides/p2p.pdf|work=Complex Systems|publisher=Universitá di Bologna|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2012}}</ref><ref>http://ijcsits.org/papers/vol3no22013/1vol3no2.pdf</ref> The system administration overhead is smaller because the user is the provider and usually the provider is the administrator as well. Hence each network can be monitored by the users themselves. At the same time, large servers sometimes require more storage and this increases the cost since the storage has to be rented or bought exclusively for a server. However, usually peer-to-peer file sharing does not require a [[dedicated server]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Winkelman|first=Dr. Roy|title=Software|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/network/chap6/chap6.htm|publisher=Florida Center for Instructional Technology College of Education, University of South Florida|accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Economic impact ==\n{{Main article|File sharing#Economic impact|l1=Effects of file sharing}}\nThere is still ongoing discussion about the economic impact of P2P file sharing.

There are different elements that contribute to the formation, development and the stability of these communities, which include interests, user attributes, cost reduction, user motivation and the dimension of the community.\n\n=== Interest attributes ===\nPeer communities are formed on the basis of common interests. For Khambatti, Ryu and Dasgupta common interests can be labelled as attributes \"which are used to determine the peer communities in which a particular peer can participate\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Structuring Peer-to-Peer Networks Using Interest-Based Communities|last = Khambatti|first = Mujtaba|date = 7 September 2003|journal = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume = 2944|pages = 48|doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-24629-9_5|last2 = Ryu|first2 = Kyung Dong|last3 = Partha|first3 = Dasgupta|isbn = 978-3-540-20968-3}}</ref> There are two ways in which these attributes can be classified: explicit and implicit attributes.\n\nImplicit values means that peers provide information about themselves to a specific community, for example they may express their interest in a subject or their taste in music. With explicit values, users do not directly express information about themselves, albeit, it is still possible to find information about that specific user by uncovering his or her past queries and research carried out in a P2P network. \nKhambatti, Ryu and Dasgupta  divide these interests further into three classes: personal, claimed and group attributes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA full set of attributes (common interests) of a specific peer is defined as personal attributes, and is a collection of information a peer has about him or herself. Peers may decide not to disclose information about themselves to maintain their privacy and online security. It is for this reason that the authors specify that \"a subset of...attributes is explicitly claimed public by a peer\", and they define such attributes as \"claimed attributes\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The third category of interests is group attributes, defined as \"location or affiliation oriented\" and are needed to form a...basis for communities\", an example being the \"domain name of an internet connection\" which acts as an online location and group identifier for certain users.\n\n=== Cost reduction ===\nCost reduction influences the sharing component of P2P communities. Users who share do so to attempt \"to reduce...costs\" as made clear by Cunningham, Alexander and Adilov.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|url = http://opus.ipfw.edu/econ_facpubs/23/|title = Peer-to-peer file sharing communities|last = Cunningham|first = Brendan|date = 28 October 2003|journal = Information Economics and Policy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 16 December 2015|last2 = Alexander|first2 = Peter|last3 = Adilov|first3 = Nodir}}</ref> In their work Peer-to-peer file sharing communities, they explain that \"the act of sharing is costly since any download from a sharer implies that the sharer is sacrificing bandwidth\".<ref name=\":1\" /> As sharing represents the basis of P2P communities, such as Napster, and without it \"the network collapses\", users share despite its costs in order to attempt to lower their own costs, particularly those associated with searching, and with the congestion of internet servers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== User motivation and size of community ===\nUser motivation and the size of the P2P community contribute to its sustainability and activity. In her work Motivating Participation in Peer to Peer Communities, Vassileva studies these two aspects through an experiment carried out in the University of Saskatchewan (Canada), where a P2P application (COMUTELLA) was created and distributed among students. In her view, motivation is \"a crucial factor\" in encouraging users to participate in an online P2P community, particularly because the \"lack of a critical mass of active users\" in the form of a community will not allow for a P2P sharing to function properly.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = Motivating Participation in Peer to Peer Communities|last = Vassileva|first = Julita|date = January 2002|journal = Engineering Societies in the Agents World III|volume = 2577|pages = 141–155|doi = 10.1007/3-540-39173-8_11|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn = 978-3-540-14009-2}}</ref>\n\nUsefulness is a valued aspect by users when joining a P2P community. The specific P2P system must be perceived as \"useful\" by the user and must be able to fulfil his or her needs and pursue his or her interests. Consequently, the \"size of the community of users defines the level of usefulness\" and \"the value of the system determines the number of users\".<ref name=\":2\" /> This two way process is defined by Vassileva as a feedback loop, and has allowed for the birth of file-sharing systems like Napster and KaZaA. However, in her research Vassileva has also found that \"incentives are needed for the users in the beginning\", particularly for motivating and getting users into the habit of staying online.<ref name=\":2\" /> This can be done, for example, by providing the system with a wide amount of resources or by having an experienced user provide assistance to a less experienced one.\n\n=== User classification ===\nUsers participating in P2P systems can be classified in different ways. According to Vassileva, users can be classified depending on their participation in the P2P system. There are five types of users to be found: users who create services, users who allow services, users who facilitate search, users who allow communication, users who are uncooperative and free ride.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn the first instance, the user creates new resources or services and offers them to the community. In the second, the user provides the community with disk space \"to store files for downloads\" or with \"computing resources\" to facilitate a service provided by another users.<ref name=\":2\" /> In the third, the user provides a list of relationships to help other users find specific files or services. In the fourth, the user participates actively in the \"protocol of the network\", contributing to keeping the network together.

The legal issues in file sharing involve violating the laws of [[copyrighted]] material. Most discussions about the legality of file sharing are implied to be about solely copyright material. Many countries have [[fair use]] exceptions that permit limited use of copyrighted material without acquiring permission from the rights holders. Such documents include commentary, news reporting, research and scholarship. Copyright laws are territorial- they do not extend beyond the territory of a specific state unless that state is a party to an international agreement. Most countries today are parties to at least one such agreement.\n\nIn the area of privacy, recent court rulings seem to indicate that there can be no [[expectation of privacy]] in data exposed over peer-to-peer file-sharing networks.  In a 39-page ruling released November 8, 2013, US District Court Judge [[Christina Reiss]] denied the motion to suppress evidence gathered by authorities without a search warrant through an automated peer-to-peer search tool.<ref>ComputerWorld.[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243970/Don_t_expect_data_on_P2P_networks_to_be_private_judge_rules] \" Don't expect data on P2P networks to be private, judge rules\".</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Internet}}\n* [[Anonymous P2P]]\n* [[Comparison of file-sharing applications]]\n* [[Disk sharing]]\n* [[File sharing in Canada]]\n* [[File sharing in Japan]]\n* [[File sharing timeline]] (peer to peer and not)\n* [[Friend-to-friend]] or F2F\n* [[List of P2P protocols]]\n* [[Open Music Model]]\n* [[Privacy in file sharing networks]]\n* [[Private P2P]]\n* [[Public domain]]\n* [[Torrent poisoning]]\n* [[Trade group efforts against file sharing]]\n* [[Warez]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://airccse.org/ijp2p/papers/3512ijp2p01.pdf Structured Hierarchical P2P Protocol]\n\n{{File sharing protocols}}\n{{intellectual property activism}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Peer-To-Peer File Sharing}}\n[[Category:Peer-to-peer file sharing| ]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n[[Category:Intellectual property law]]\n\n[[de:Filesharing]]",
