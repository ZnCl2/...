It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the [[iPhone]], [[iPad]], and [[iPod Touch]]. It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after [[Android (operating system)|Android]].\n\nOriginally unveiled in 2007 for the [[iPhone]], iOS has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the [[iPod Touch]] (September 2007) and the [[iPad]] (January 2010). {{As of|2018|3|df=US}}, Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] contains more than 2.1 million iOS applications, 1 million of which are native for iPads.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lifewire.com/how-many-apps-in-app-store-2000252|title=Charting The Explosive Growth of the App Store|work=Lifewire|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}</ref> These [[mobile app]]s have collectively been downloaded more than 130&nbsp;billion times.\n\nThe iOS [[user interface]] is based upon [[direct manipulation interface|direct manipulation]], using [[multi-touch]] gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as ''swipe'', ''tap'', ''pinch'', and ''reverse pinch'', all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal [[accelerometer]]s are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the [[undo]] command) or rotating it in [[3D modeling|three dimensions]] (one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode). Apple has been significantly praised for incorporating thorough [[accessibility]] functions into iOS, enabling users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use its products.\n\nMajor versions of iOS are released annually. The current version, [[iOS 12]], was released on September 17, 2018. It is available for all iOS devices with [[64-bit computing|64-bit processors]]; the [[iPhone 5S]] and later iPhone models, the [[iPad (2017)]], the [[iPad Air]] and later iPad Air models, all [[iPad Pro]] models, the [[iPad Mini 2]] and later iPad Mini models, and the [[iPod Touch (6th generation)|sixth-generation iPod Touch]]. On all recent iOS devices, iOS regularly checks on the availability of an update, and if one is available, will prompt the user to permit its automatic installation.\n\nComing in the fall of 2019, [[iOS 13]] will be released to the public, introducing user interface tweaks and a dark mode, along with features such as a redesigned Reminders app, a swipe keyboard, and an enhanced Photos app. iOS 13 does not support devices with less than 2GB of RAM, including the [[iPhone 5s]], [[iPod Touch (6th generation)]], and the [[iPhone 6|iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus]], which still make up over 10% of all iOS devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/5354499/apples-ios-13-update-old-phones-iphone-6s/|title=Apple’s iOS 13 update won’t be released to phones older than iPhone 6s - National {{!}} Globalnews.ca|date=2019-06-05|website=globalnews.ca|language=en|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref> [[iOS 13]] is exclusively for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod touch]] as the [[iPad]] variant is now called [[iPadOS]].

Jobs favored the former approach but pitted the [[Macintosh]] and [[iPod]] teams, led by [[Scott Forstall]] and [[Tony Fadell]], respectively, against each other in an internal competition, with Forstall winning by creating the iPhone OS. The decision enabled the success of the iPhone as a platform for third-party developers: using a well-known desktop operating system as its basis allowed the many third-party Mac developers to write software for the iPhone with minimal retraining. Forstall was also responsible for creating a [[software development kit]] for programmers to build iPhone apps, as well as an [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] within [[iTunes]].<ref>{{cite web |first1=Adam |last1=Satariano |first2=Peter |last2=Burrows |first3=Brad |last3=Stone |title=Scott Forstall, the Sorcerer's Apprentice at Apple |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-10-12/scott-forstall-the-sorcerers-apprentice-at-apple |website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407032342/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-10-12/scott-forstall-the-sorcerers-apprentice-at-apple |archivedate=April 7, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Arnold |last=Kim |title=Scott Forstall's Personality, Origins of iOS, and Lost iPhone 4 Prototype |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/13/scott-forstalls-personality-origins-of-ios-and-lost-iphone-4-prototype/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=October 12, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402081118/https://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/13/scott-forstalls-personality-origins-of-ios-and-lost-iphone-4-prototype/ |archivedate=April 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe operating system was unveiled with the iPhone at the [[Macworld Conference & Expo]] on January 9, 2007, and released in June of that year.<ref>{{cite web |first=Owen |last=Thomas |title=Apple: Hello, iPhone |url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/01/09/technology/apple_jobs/ |website=CNN Money |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=April 1, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402081508/http://money.cnn.com/2007/01/09/technology/apple_jobs/ |archivedate=April 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Lisa |last=Eadicicco |title=Watch Steve Jobs Unveil the First iPhone 10 Years Ago Today |url=http://time.com/4628515/steve-jobs-iphone-launch-keynote-2007/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=January 9, 2017 |accessdate=April 1, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402080922/http://time.com/4628515/steve-jobs-iphone-launch-keynote-2007/ |archivedate=April 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Mathew |last=Honan |title=Apple unveils iPhone |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1054769/smartphones/iphone.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=April 1, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126161949/http://www.macworld.com/article/1054769/smartphones/iphone.html |archivedate=January 26, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> At the time of its unveiling in January, Steve Jobs claimed: \"iPhone runs OS X\" and runs \"desktop class applications\",<ref>{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Block |authorlink=Ryan Block |title=Live from Macworld 2007: Steve Jobs keynote |url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-steve-jobs-keynote/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=April 1, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324084725/https://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-steve-jobs-keynote/ |archivedate=March 24, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Mic |last=Wright |title=The original iPhone announcement annotated: Steve Jobs’ genius meets Genius |url=https://thenextweb.com/apple/2015/09/09/genius-annotated-with-genius/ |website=The Next Web |date=September 9, 2015 |accessdate=April 1, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401232647/https://thenextweb.com/apple/2015/09/09/genius-annotated-with-genius/ |archivedate=April 1, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> but at the time of the iPhone's release, the operating system was renamed \"iPhone OS\".<ref>{{cite web |title=iOS: A visual history |url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/13/2612736/ios-history-iphone-ipad |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 16, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412015548/http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/13/2612736/ios-history-iphone-ipad |archivedate=April 12, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Initially, third-party native applications were not supported.

In iOS 5, Apple introduced [[Notification Center]], which allows users to view a history of notifications. The user can tap a notification to open its corresponding app, or clear it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/au/iphone/features/notification-center.html |title=iPhone 4S – Always know what's up in Notification Center |publisher=Apple Inc. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214123941/http://www.apple.com/au/iphone/features/notification-center.html |archive-date=February 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Notifications are now delivered in banners that appear briefly at the top of the screen. If a user taps a received notification, the application that sent the notification will be opened. Users can also choose to view notifications in modal alert windows by adjusting the application's notification settings. Introduced with iOS 8, widgets are now accessible through the Notification Center, defined by 3rd parties.\n\nWhen an app sends a notification while closed, a red badge appears on its icon. This badge tells the user, at a glance, how many notifications that app has sent. Opening the app clears the badge.\n\n=== Accessibility ===\niOS offers various accessibility features to help users with vision and hearing disabilities. One major feature, [[VoiceOver]], provides a voice reading information on the screen, including contextual buttons, icons, links and other [[user interface]] elements, and allows the user to navigate the operating system through gestures. Any apps with default controls and developed with a UIKit [[Software framework|framework]] gets VoiceOver functionality built in.<ref>{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Tanasychuk |title=How to use VoiceOver on iPhone and iPad |url=http://www.imore.com/how-use-voiceover-iphone-and-ipad |website=[[iMore]] |date=September 15, 2016 |accessdate=March 31, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220131037/http://www.imore.com/how-use-voiceover-iphone-and-ipad |archivedate=December 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> One example includes holding up the iPhone to take a photo, with VoiceOver describing the photo scenery.<ref>{{cite web |first=Shara |last=Tibken |title=Seeing eye phone: Giving independence to the blind |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-iphone-voiceover-technology-for-the-blind/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=March 25, 2016 |accessdate=March 31, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401060628/https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-iphone-voiceover-technology-for-the-blind/ |archivedate=April 1, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As part of a \"Made for iPhone\" program, introduced with the release of [[iOS 7]] in 2013, Apple has developed technology to use [[Bluetooth]] and a special technology protocol to let compatible third-party equipment connect with iPhones and iPads for streaming audio directly to a user's ears.

This feature prefers to update the user's most frequently used apps and prefers to use WiFi networks over a cellular network, without markedly reducing the device's battery life.\n\n==== Switching applications ====\nIn iOS 4.0 to iOS 6.x, double-clicking the home button activates the application switcher. A scrollable dock-like interface appears from the bottom, moving the contents of the screen up. Choosing an icon switches to an application. To the far left are icons which function as music controls, a rotation lock, and on iOS 4.2 and above, a volume controller.\n\nWith the introduction of iOS 7, double clicking the home button also activates the application switcher. However, unlike previous versions it displays screenshots of open applications on top of the icon and horizontal scrolling allows for browsing through previous apps, and it is possible to close applications by dragging them up, similar to how [[WebOS]] handled multiple cards.<ref name=\"Jon Rubinstein: OS X and iOS 7 borrow features from webOS\">{{cite web|title=Jon Rubinstein: OS X and iOS 7 borrow features from webOS|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2013/06/12/jon-rubinstein-os-x-and-ios-7-borrow-features-from-webos/|accessdate=September 23, 2013|author=Yoni Heisler|date=June 12, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928040445/http://www.tuaw.com/2013/06/12/jon-rubinstein-os-x-and-ios-7-borrow-features-from-webos/|archivedate=September 28, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWith the introduction of iOS 9, the application switcher received a significant visual change; whilst still retaining the card metaphor introduced in iOS 7, the application icon is smaller, and appears above the screenshot (which is now larger, due to the removal of \"Recent and Favorite Contacts\"), and each application \"card\" overlaps the other, forming a [[rolodex]] effect as the user scrolls. Now, instead of the home screen appearing at the leftmost of the application switcher, it appears rightmost.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Prabhu|first1=Gautam|title=iOS 9 vs. iOS 8: A look at the UI changes in iOS 9|url=http://www.iphonehacks.com/2015/06/ios-9-vs-ios-8-a-look-at-the-ui-changes-in-ios-9.html|website=iPhone Hacks|accessdate=September 20, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107041632/http://www.iphonehacks.com/2015/06/ios-9-vs-ios-8-a-look-at-the-ui-changes-in-ios-9.html|archivedate=November 7, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In [[iOS 11]], the application switcher receives a major redesign.

Particularly at issue is the ability for Apple to remotely disable or delete apps at will.\n\nSome in the tech community have expressed concern that the locked-down iOS represents a growing trend in Apple's approach to computing, particularly Apple's shift away from machines that hobbyists can \"tinker with\" and note the potential for such restrictions to stifle software innovation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://apple.slashdot.org/story/10/01/31/1657233/Apples-Trend-Away-From-Tinkering |title= Apple's Trend Away From Tinkering |publisher= Slashdot |date= January 31, 2010 |accessdate= June 9, 2010 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100208164828/http://apple.slashdot.org/story/10/01/31/1657233/Apples-Trend-Away-From-Tinkering |archivedate= February 8, 2010 |df= mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite video\n |url         = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDrJd7GkkNA\n |title       = Campus Party Brasil 2011 – Geek Pride e Wozniak\n |people      = [[Steve Wozniak]] (Interviewee)\n |date        = January 22, 2011\n |publisher   = Fragoso, Victor\n |accessdate  = March 7, 2011\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110512222742/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDrJd7GkkNA\n |archivedate = May 12, 2011\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\nFormer [[Facebook]] developer [[Joe Hewitt (programmer)|Joe Hewitt]] protested against Apple's control over its hardware as a \"horrible precedent\" but praised iOS's [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxing]] of apps.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cultofmac.com/pundits-on-the-ipads-closed-system-its-doom-for-pcs-no-its-great/28440 |title= Pundits On The iPad's Closed System: It's Doom For PCs, No It's Great |author= Leander Kahney |date= January 30, 2010 |accessdate= June 9, 2010 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100515124959/http://www.cultofmac.com/pundits-on-the-ipads-closed-system-its-doom-for-pcs-no-its-great/28440 |archivedate= May 15, 2010 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Kernel ==\nThe iOS kernel is the [[XNU]] kernel of [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]. The original iPhone OS (1.0) up to iPhone OS 3.1.3 used Darwin 9.0.0d1. iOS 4 was based on Darwin 10. iOS 5 was based on Darwin 11. iOS 6 was based on Darwin 13. iOS 7 and iOS 8 are based on Darwin 14. iOS 9 is based on Darwin 15. iOS 10 is based on Darwin 16. iOS 11 is based on Darwin 17. iOS 12 is based on Darwin 18.<ref>Available in iOS 5 to iOS 7 via General > About > Diagnostics & Usage > Diagnostics & Usage Data >(date and time).panic.plist, after a kernel crash <br /> Available in iOS 8 to iOS 10 via Privacy > Diagnostics & Usage > Diagnostics & Usage Data > JetsamEvent-(date and time).ips, when low in memory <br /> Available in iOS 11 and 12 via Privacy > Analytics > Analytics Data > JetsamEvent-(date and time).ips, when low in memory</ref>\n\n== Security ==\niOS utilizes many security features in both hardware and software. Below are summaries of the most prominent features.\n\n=== Secure Boot ===\nBefore fully booting into iOS, there is low-level code that runs from the Boot [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. Its task is to verify that the Low-Level [[Booting|Bootloader]] is signed by the Apple [[Root certificate|Root]] [[Certificate authority|CA]] public [[Key (cryptography)|key]] before running it. This process is to ensure that no malicious or otherwise unauthorized software can be run on an iOS device. After the Low-Level Bootloader finishes its tasks, it runs the higher level bootloader, known as [[iBoot]]. If all goes well, iBoot will then proceed to load the iOS kernel as well as the rest of the operating system.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf|title=iOS Security Guide|last=Apple Inc.|first=|date=May 2016|website=Apple.com|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227071343/http://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf|archivedate=February 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Secure Enclave ===\nThe Secure Enclave is a [[coprocessor]] found in iOS devices that contain [[Touch ID]] or [[Face ID]]. It has its own secure boot process to ensure that it is completely secure. A hardware [[Random number generation|random number generator]] is also included as a part of this coprocessor. Each device's Secure Enclave has a unique ID that is given to it when it is made and cannot be changed. This identifier is used to create a temporary key that [[Encryption|encrypts]] the [[Random-access memory|memory]] in this portion of the system. The Secure Enclave also contains an anti-replay counter to prevent [[Brute-force attack|brute force attacks]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Passcode ===\niOS devices can have a passcode that is used to unlock the device, make changes to system settings, and encrypt the device's contents. Until recently, these were typically four numerical digits long. However, since unlocking the devices with a fingerprint by using Touch ID has become more widespread, six-digit passcodes are now the default on iOS with the option to switch back to four or use an alphanumeric passcode.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Touch ID ===\n{{Main|Touch ID}}\nTouch ID is a fingerprint scanner that is embedded in the home button and can be used to unlock the device, make purchases, and log into applications among other functions. When used, Touch ID only temporarily stores the fingerprint data in encrypted memory in the Secure Enclave, as described above. There is no way for the device's [[Central processing unit|main processor]] or any other part of the system to access the raw fingerprint data that is obtained from the Touch ID sensor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Address Space Layout Randomization ===\n{{Main|Address Space Layout Randomization}}\nAddress Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a low-level technique of preventing [[memory corruption]] attacks such as [[buffer overflow]]s. It involves placing data in randomly selected locations in memory in order to make it harder to predict ways to corrupt the system and create exploits. ASLR makes app bugs more likely to crash the app than to silently overwrite memory, regardless of whether the behavior is accidental or malicious.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/ASLR|title=ASLR – The iPhone Wiki|website=Theiphonewiki.com|access-date=December 6, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223020839/https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/ASLR|archivedate=December 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-Executable Memory ===\niOS utilizes the [[ARM architecture|ARM architecture's]] Execute Never (XN) feature. This allows some portions of the memory to be marked as non-executable, working alongside ASLR to prevent buffer overflow attacks including [[return-to-libc attack]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Encryption ===\nAs mentioned above, one use of encryption in iOS is in the memory of the Secure Enclave. When a passcode is utilized on an iOS device, the contents of the device are encrypted. This is done by using a hardware [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] 256 implementation that is very efficient because it is placed directly between the [[Flash memory|flash storage]] and RAM.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\niOS, in combination with its specific hardware, uses [[crypto-shredding]] when erasing all content and settings by [[wiktionary:en:obliterate|obliterating]] all the keys in '[[wiktionary:en:efface|effaceable]] storage'. This renders all user data on the device cryptographically inaccessible.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://uit.stanford.edu/security/data-sanitization |title=Crypto-shredding using effaceable storage in iOS on stanford.edu |access-date=September 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911114417/https://uit.stanford.edu/security/data-sanitization |archive-date=September 11, 2018 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Keychain ===\nThe iOS keychain is a [[database]] of login information that can be shared across apps written by the same person or organization.<ref name=\":0\" /> This service is often used for storing passwords for web applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/keychainServConcepts/iPhoneTasks/iPhoneTasks.html|title=iOS Keychain Services Tasks|website=developer.apple.com|access-date=December 6, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220123800/https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/keychainServConcepts/iPhoneTasks/iPhoneTasks.html|archivedate=December 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== App Security ===\nThird-party applications such as those distributed through the App Store must be code signed with an Apple-issued [[Public key certificate|certificate]]. In principle, this continues the [[chain of trust]] all the way from the Secure Boot process as mentioned above to the actions of the applications installed on the device by users. Applications are also [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxed]], meaning that they can only modify the data within their individual [[home directory]] unless explicitly given permission to do otherwise. For example, they cannot access data that is owned by other user-installed applications on the device. There is a very extensive set of privacy controls contained within iOS with options to control apps' ability to access a wide variety of permissions such as the camera, contacts, background app refresh, cellular data, and access to other data and services. Most of the code in iOS, including third-party applications, runs as the \"mobile\" user which does not have [[Superuser|root privileges]]. This ensures that system files and other iOS system resources remain hidden and inaccessible to user-installed applications.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== App Store bypasses ====\n\nCompanies can apply to Apple for enterprise developer certificates. These can be used to sign apps such that iOS will install them directly (sometimes called \"sideloading\"), without the app needing to be distributed via the App Store.<ref name=\"tc-edc-explain\"/> The terms under which they are granted make clear that they are only to be used for companies who wish to distribute apps directly to their employees.<ref name=\"tc-edc-explain\"/>\n\nCirca January–February 2019, it emerged that a number of software developers were misusing enterprise developer certificates to distribute software directly to non-employees, thereby bypassing the App Store. Facebook was found to be abusing an Apple enterprise developer certificate to distribute an application to underage users that would give Facebook access to all private data on their devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/|title=Facebook pays teens to install VPN that spies on them|website=Social.techcrunch.com|accessdate=February 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/01/30/apple-has-revoked-facebooks-enterprise-developer-certificates-after-sideload-violations|title=Apple has revoked Facebook's enterprise developer certificates after sideload violations [u]|first1=Malcolm Owen|last1=Wednesday|first2=|last2=January 30|first3=|last3=2019|first4=08:12 am|last4=PT|website=AppleInsider|accessdate=February 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18203551/apple-facebook-blocked-internal-ios-apps|title=Apple blocks Facebook from running its internal iOS apps|first=Tom|last=Warren|date=January 30, 2019|website=The Verge|accessdate=February 20, 2019}}</ref> Google was abusing an Apple enterprise developer certificate to distribute an app to adults to collect data from their devices, including unencrypted data belonging to third parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/googles-also-peddling-a-data-collector-through-apples-back-door/|title=Google will stop peddling a data collector through Apple’s back door|website=Social.techcrunch.com|accessdate=February 20, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"tc-edc-explain\">{{cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/02/01/facebook-google-scandal/|title=Everything you need to know about Facebook, Google’s app scandal|website=Social.techcrunch.com|accessdate=February 20, 2019}}</ref> TutuApp, Panda Helper, AppValley, and TweakBox were abusing enterprise developer certificates to distribute apps that offered [[pirated software]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/loophole-allows-pirated-apps-be-installed-apple-iphones-n971491|title=Loophole allows pirated apps to be installed on Apple iPhones|website=NBC News|accessdate=February 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Network Security ===\niOS supports [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] with both low- and high-level [[Application programming interface|APIs]] for developers. By default, the App Transport Security framework requires that servers use at least TLS 1.2. However, developers are free to override this framework and utilize their own methods of communicating over networks. When Wi-Fi is enabled, iOS uses a randomized [[MAC address]] so that devices cannot be tracked by anyone [[Network sniffers|sniffing]] wireless traffic.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Two-Factor Authentication ===\n{{Main|Multi-factor authentication}}\nTwo-factor authentication is an option in iOS to ensure that even if an unauthorized person knows an [[Apple ID]] and password combination, they cannot gain access to the account. It works by requiring not only the Apple ID and password, but also a verification code that is sent to a device that is already known to be trusted.<ref name=\":0\" /> If an unauthorized user attempts to sign in using another user's Apple ID, the owner of the Apple ID receives a notification that allows them to deny access to the unrecognized device.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915|title=Two-factor authentication for Apple ID|newspaper=Apple Support|language=en-US|access-date=December 6, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220123803/https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915|archivedate=December 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Devices ==\n{{Main|List of iOS devices}}\n{{Timeline of iOS devices}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Apple}}\n* [[Comparison of mobile operating systems]]\n* [[iOS version history]]\n* [[iPhone]]\n* [[List of iOS devices]]\n*[[IPadOS]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n| first1 = Aaron\n| last1 = Hillegass\n| first2 = Jon\n| last2 = Conway\n| date = March 22, 2012\n| title = iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide\n| publisher = [[Pearson Education|Pearson]]\n| edition = 3rd\n| page = 590\n| isbn = 978-0-321-82152-2\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| first1 = Kirby\n| last1 = Turner\n| date = December 19, 2011\n| title = Learning iPad Programming: A Hands-on Guide to Building iPad Apps with iOS 5\n| publisher = [[Pearson Education|Pearson]]\n| edition = 1st\n| page = 816\n| isbn = 978-0-321-75040-2\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| first1 = Dave\n| last1 = Mark\n| first2 = Jeff\n| last2 = LaMarche\n| date = July 21, 2009\n| title = Beginning iPhone 3 Development: Exploring the iPhone SDK\n| publisher = [[Apress]]\n| edition = 1st\n| page = 584\n| isbn = 1-4302-2459-2\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| first1 = Dave\n| last1 = Mark\n| first2 = Jeff\n| last2 = LaMarche\n| date = December 29, 2009\n| title = More iPhone 3 Development: Tackling iPhone SDK 3\n| publisher = [[Apress]]\n| edition = 1st\n| page = 552\n| isbn = 1-4302-2505-X\n}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|iOS (Apple Inc.)}}\n* {{Official website|www.apple.com/ios}}\n* {{Official website|developer.apple.com/ios}} Dev Center at [[Apple Developer Connection]]\n* [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/ iOS Reference Library] – on the Apple Developer Connection website\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{iPod}}\n{{Apple Inc. operating systems}}\n{{Darwin derivations}}\n{{Unix-like}}\n{{Operating system}}\n{{Mobile operating systems}}\n{{Apple Inc.}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:IOS| ]]\n[[Category:Apple Inc. operating systems]]\n[[Category:Mach (kernel)]]\n[[Category:Mobile operating systems]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 2007]]\n[[Category:Smartphones]]\n[[Category:Tablet operating systems]]",
