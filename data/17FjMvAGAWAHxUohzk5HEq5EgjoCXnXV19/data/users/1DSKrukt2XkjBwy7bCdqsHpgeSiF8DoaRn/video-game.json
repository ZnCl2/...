Since the 1980s, video games have become an increasingly important part of the [[entertainment industry]], and whether [[video games as an art form|they are also a form of art]] is a matter of dispute.\n\nThe electronic systems used to play video games are called [[computing platform|platforms]]. Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others. Specialized platforms such as [[arcade game]]s, which present the game in a large, typically [[currency detector|coin-operated]] chassis, were common in the 1980s in [[amusement arcade|video arcades]], but declined in popularity as other, more affordable platforms became available. These include dedicated devices such as [[video game console]]s, as well as general-purpose computers like a [[laptop]], [[Desktop computer|desktop]] or [[mobile device|handheld computing devices]].\n\nThe [[input device]] used for games, the [[game controller]], varies across platforms. Common controllers include [[gamepad]]s, [[joystick]]s, [[mouse (computing)|mouse devices]], [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], the [[touchscreen]]s of [[mobile device]]s, or even a person's body, using a [[Kinect]] sensor. Players view the game on a [[display device]] such as a [[television]] or [[computer monitor]] or sometimes on [[virtual reality]] [[head-mounted display]] goggles. There are often game [[sound effect]]s, music and voice actor lines which come from [[loudspeaker]]s or [[headphones]]. Some games in the 2000s include [[haptic technology|haptic]], vibration-creating effects, [[force feedback]] [[peripheral]]s and [[virtual reality]] headsets.\n\nIn the 2010s, the commercial importance of the [[video game industry]] is increasing. The emerging Asian markets and [[mobile game]]s on [[smartphone]]s in particular are driving the growth of the industry. As of 2018, video games generated sales of US$134.9 billion annually worldwide,<ref>{{cite web |title=Newzoo Key Numbers |url=https://newzoo.com/key-numbers/ |website=Newzoo |accessdate=20 May 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509014637/https://newzoo.com/key-numbers/ |archivedate=9 May 2019}}</ref> and were the third-largest segment in the U.S. entertainment market, behind broadcast and cable TV.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of video games}}\n{{See also|Early history of video games}}\n[[File:Tennis_For_Two_on_a_DuMont_Lab_Oscilloscope_Type_304-A.jpg|thumb|''Tennis for Two'', an early [[analog computer]] game that used an [[oscilloscope]] for a display]]\n[[File:Tennis for Two - Modern recreation.jpg|thumb|A modern recreation of a controller for ''Tennis for Two''|alt=A replica of a Tennis for Two controller.]]\nEarly games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats.

Usually consoles only run games developed for it, or games from other platform made by the same company, but never games developed by its direct competitor, even if the same game is available on different platforms. It often comes with a specific [[game controller]]. Major console platforms include [[Xbox]], [[PlayStation]], and [[Nintendo]].\n\n====Handheld====\n[[File:Game-Boy-FL.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Game Boy|Nintendo Game Boy]] was the first successful handheld console, selling over 100 million systems.|alt=A white Nintendo Game Boy.]]\nA \"[[Handheld game console|handheld]]\" gaming device is a small, self-contained electronic device that is portable and can be held in a user's hands. It features the console, a small screen, speakers and buttons, [[joystick]] or other [[game controller]]s in a single unit. Like consoles, handhelds are dedicated platforms, and share almost the same characteristics. Handheld hardware usually is less powerful than PC or console hardware. Some handheld games from the late 1970s and early 1980s could only play one game. In the 1990s and 2000s, a number of handheld games used cartridges, which enabled them to be used to play many different games.\n\n====Arcade====\n[[File:Light gun survival horror arcade game.jpg|thumb|right|A police-themed arcade game in which players use a [[light gun]]]]\n\"[[Arcade game]]\" generally refers to a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special, large coin-operated [[arcade cabinet|cabinet]] which has one built-in console, controllers (joystick, buttons, etc.), a [[CRT screen]], and audio amplifier and speakers. Arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images relating to the theme of the game. While most arcade games are housed in a vertical cabinet, which the user typically stands in front of to play, some arcade games use a tabletop approach, in which the display screen is housed in a table-style cabinet with a see-through table top. With table-top games, the users typically sit to play. In the 1990s and 2000s, some arcade games offered players a choice of multiple games. In the 1980s, [[video arcade]]s were businesses in which game players could use a number of arcade video games. In the 2010s, there are far fewer video arcades, but some movie theaters and family entertainment centers still have them.\n\n====Web browser====\nThe [[web browser]] has also established itself as platform in its own right in the 2000s, while providing a [[cross-platform]] environment for video games designed to be played on a wide spectrum of platforms. In turn, this has generated new terms to qualify classes of web browser-based games. These games may be identified based on the website that they appear, such as with \"[[Miniclip]]\" games. Others are named based on the programming platform used to develop them, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] games.\n\n====Mobile====\nWith the advent of standard operating systems for mobile devices such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and devices with greater hardware performance, [[mobile gaming]] has become a significant platform. These games may utilize unique features of mobile devices that are not necessary present on other platforms, such as [[GPS|global positing information]] and camera devices to support [[augmented reality]] gameplay. Mobile games also led into the development of [[microtransactions]] as a valid revenue model for casual games.\n\n====Virtual reality====\n[[Virtual reality]] (VR) games generally require players to use a special [[Head-mounted display|head-mounted unit]] that provides [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic screens]] and motion tracking to immerse a player within virtual environment that responds to their head movements. Some VR systems include control units for the player's hands as to provide a direct way to interact with the virtual world.

Ever advancing technology and production values related to video game development have fostered more lifelike and complex games which have in turn introduced or enhanced genre possibilities (e.g., virtual pets), pushed the boundaries of existing video gaming or in some cases add new possibilities in play (such as that seen with games specifically designed for devices like Sony's [[PlayStation Eye|EyeToy]]). Some genres represent combinations of others, such as [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, or, more commonly, MMORPGs. It is also common to see higher level genre terms that are collective in nature across all other genres such as with action, music/rhythm or horror-themed video games.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Classifications===\n\n====Casual games====\n{{Main|Casual game}}\n\nCasual games derive their name from their ease of accessibility, simple to understand gameplay and quick to grasp rule sets. Additionally, casual games frequently support the ability to jump in and out of play on demand. Casual games as a format existed long before the term was coined and include video games such as Solitaire or Minesweeper which can commonly be found pre-installed with many versions of the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system. Examples of [[Video game genre|genres]] within this category are [[match three]], [[hidden object]], [[Time Management (video game genre)|time management]], [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]] or many of the [[tower defense]] style games. Casual games are generally available through [[app store]]s and online retailers such as [[PopCap Games|PopCap]], [[Zylom]] and [[GameHouse]] or provided for free play through [[web portal]]s such as [[Newgrounds]]. While casual games are most commonly played on personal computers, phones or tablets, they can also be found on many of the on-line console system download services (e.g., the [[PlayStation Network]], [[WiiWare]] or [[Xbox Live]]).\n\n====Serious games====\n{{Main|Serious game}}\n\nSerious games are games that are designed primarily to convey information or a learning experience to the player. Some serious games may even fail to qualify as a video game in the traditional sense of the term. Educational software does not typically fall under this category (e.g., [[touch typing]] tutors, language learning programs, etc.) and the primary distinction would appear to be based on the game's primary goal as well as target age demographics. As with the other categories, this description is more of a guideline than a rule. Serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre, although some such as [[exergaming|exercise games]], [[educational game]]s, or propaganda games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter. These games are typically designed to be played by professionals as part of a specific job or for skill set improvement. They can also be created to convey social-political awareness on a specific subject.\n[[File:AFA Beech in Flight Simulator.jpg|thumb|A screenshot from ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'' showing a [[Beechcraft 1900]]D]]\n\nOne of the longest-running serious games franchises is ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'', first published in 1982 under that name.

This form of media allows for a broader audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information that otherwise may not have reached such people. An example of tactical media in video games would be [[newsgame]]s.

Some other games do not have any particular targeted audience in mind and intended to simply educate or inform whoever views or plays the game.\n\n===Controllers===\n{{Main|Game controller}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Super-NES-Controller.jpg|thumb|right|A North American [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] game controller from the early 1990s]]\nVideo game can use several types of input devices to translate human actions to a game, the most common game controllers are keyboard and mouse for \"[[personal computer game|PC games]], consoles usually come with specific [[gamepad]]s, handheld consoles have built in buttons. Other game controllers are commonly used for specific games like [[racing wheel]]s, [[light gun]]s or [[dance pad]]s. [[Digital camera]]s can also be used as game controllers capturing movements of the body of the player.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, more can be added onto the controller to give the player a more immersive experience when playing different games. There are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier. Along with the presets, a player can sometimes custom map the buttons to better accommodate their play style. On keyboard and mouse, different actions in the game are already preset to keys on the keyboard. Most games allow the player to change that so that the actions are mapped to different keys that are more to their liking. The companies that design the controllers are trying to make the controller visually appealing and also feel comfortable in the hands of the consumer.\n\nAn example of a technology that was incorporated into the controller was the [[Tablet computer|touchscreen]]. It allows the player to be able to interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is [[Motion controller|motion sensor]] where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the player moves around in front of it, and the actions are repeated by a game character.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Game development}}\n{{See also|Video game industry practices}}\n[[File:Virtual-camera-system.png|thumb|Developers use various tools to create video games. Here an editor is fine-tuning the [[virtual camera system]].]]\n\nVideo game development and authorship, much like any other form of entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field. [[Video game developer]]s, as employees within this industry are commonly referred, primarily include [[game programmer|programmers]] and [[graphic design]]ers. Over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one might see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program, including [[sound design]]ers, musicians, and other technicians; as well as skills that are specific to video games, such as the [[game designer]]. All of these are managed by [[game producer|producers]].\n\nIn the early days of the industry, it was more common for a single person to manage all of the roles needed to create a video game. As platforms have become more complex and powerful in the type of material they can present, larger teams have been needed to generate all of the art, programming, cinematography, and more. This is not to say that the age of the \"one-man shop\" is gone, as this is still sometimes found in the casual gaming and handheld markets,<ref name=\"numberofdevs\">{{cite web | title =The Edge of Reason? | publisher =eurogamer.net | url =http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-edge-of-reason | accessdate =16 November 2009 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091119022451/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-edge-of-reason | archivedate =19 November 2009 | df =dmy-all | date =3 August 2009 }}</ref> where smaller games are prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited [[RAM]] or lack of dedicated 3D graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform (e.g., some [[PDAs]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nWith the growth of the size of development teams in the industry, the problem of cost has increased. Development studios need to be able to pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent, while publishers are constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment. Typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450.<ref>[http://www.nowgamer.com/news/513/assassins-creed-ii-triples-size-of-dev-team \"Assassin's Creed II dev team triples in size\"], Christopher Reynolds, 18 May 2009, NOW Gamer. {{webarchive |url=https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515200949/http://www.nowgamer.com/assassins-creed-ii-dev-team-triples-in-size/ |date=15 May 2016 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and the release of unfinished products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731|title=The Messy, True Story Behind The Making Of Destiny|last=Schreier|first=Jason|newspaper=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=15 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115203558/http://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731|archivedate=15 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Downloadable content===\n{{Main|Downloadable content}}\n\nA phenomenon of additional game content at a later date, often for additional funds, began with digital video game distribution known as downloadable content (DLC). Developers can use [[digital distribution]] to issue new storylines after the main game is released, such as [[Rockstar Games]] with ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' (''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned|The Lost and Damned]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony|The Ballad of Gay Tony]]''), or Bethesda with ''[[Fallout 3]]'' and [[Fallout 3 downloadable content|its expansions]].

Smaller packages of DLC are also common, ranging from better in-game weapons (''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'', ''[[Just Cause 2]]''), character outfits (''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'', ''[[Minecraft]]''), or new songs to perform (''[[SingStar]]'', ''[[Rock Band]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero]]'').\n\n====Expansion packs====\n{{Main|Expansion pack}}\nA variation of downloadable content is expansion packs. Unlike DLC, expansion packs add a whole section to the game that either already exists in the game's code or is developed after the game is released. Expansions add new maps, missions, weapons, and other things that weren't previously accessible in the original game. An example of an expansion is [[Bungie]]'s ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'', which had the ''[[Destiny: Rise of Iron|Rise of Iron]]'' expansion. The expansion added new weapons, new maps, and higher levels, and remade old missions.\n\nExpansions are added to the base game to help prolong the life of the game itself until the company is able to produce a sequel or a new game altogether. Developers may plan out their game's life and already have the code for the expansion in the game, but inaccessible by players, who later unlock these expansions, sometimes for free and sometimes at an extra cost. Some developers make games and add expansions later, so that they could see what additions the players would like to have. There are also expansions that are set apart from the original game and are considered a stand-alone game, such as [[Ubisoft]]'s expansion ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]] Freedom's Cry'', which features a different character than the original game.\n\n===Modifications===\n{{Main|Mod (computer gaming)}}\n\nMany games produced for the PC are designed such that technically oriented consumers can modify the game. These [[mod (computer gaming)|mods]] can add an extra dimension of replayability and interest. Developers such as [[id Software]], [[Valve Corporation]], [[Crytek]], [[Bethesda Softworks|Bethesda]], [[Epic Games]] and [[Blizzard Entertainment]] ship their games with some of the development tools used to make the game, along with documentation to assist mod developers. The Internet provides an inexpensive medium to promote and distribute mods, and they may be a factor in the commercial success of some games.<ref name=\"lombardi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000484956 |title=Hollywood Reporter interviewing Doug Lombardi, Quote: \"Mods absolutely helped us drive huge sales to 'Half-Life'\" |accessdate=10 August 2009 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506004712/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000484956 |archivedate=6 May 2008 }}.</ref> This allows for the kind of success seen by popular mods such as the ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' mod ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]''.\n\n===Cheating===\n{{Main|Cheating (video games)}}\n\nCheating in computer games may involve [[cheat codes]] and hidden spots implemented by the game developers,<ref name=\"WashPost\">{{cite news| title = In Game World, Cheaters Proudly Prosper| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082701059.html| work = Washington Post| author = Vargas, Jose Antonio| date = 28 August 2006| accessdate = 24 October 2007| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110820080450/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082701059.html| archivedate = 20 August 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"KonamiCode\">{{cite web| url = http://www.1up.com/features/cracking-code-konami-code| title = Cracking the Code: The Konami Code| website = [[1UP.com]]| author = 1UP Staff| accessdate = 24 October 2007| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110522201923/http://www.1up.com/features/cracking-code-konami-code| archivedate = 22 May 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref> modification of game code by third parties,<ref name=\"AboutCheatCodes\">{{cite web| title = Video Game Cheats and Codes – What Are Cheat Codes?| url = http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/faqglossary/a/WhatAreCheats.htm| publisher = [[About.com]]| author = Rybka, Jason| accessdate = 24 October 2007| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015083207/http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/faqglossary/a/WhatAreCheats.htm| archivedate = 15 October 2007| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Why Use Cheats and Codes for Console and PC Games?| url = http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/basicgamingtipstricks/a/whyusecheats.htm| publisher = About.com| author = Rybka, Jason| accessdate = 24 October 2007| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017101254/http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/basicgamingtipstricks/a/whyusecheats.htm| archivedate = 17 October 2007| df = dmy-all}}</ref> or players exploiting a software glitch.

The two most visible schools in this emerging field are [[ludology]] and [[narratology]]. Narrativists approach video games in the context of what [[Janet Murray]] calls \"Cyberdrama\". That is to say, their major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium, one that arises out of [[interactive fiction]]. Murray puts video games in the context of the [[Holodeck]], a fictional piece of technology from ''[[Star Trek]]'', arguing for the video game as a medium in which the player is allowed to become another person, and to act out in another world.{{sfn|Murray|1998}} This image of video games received early widespread popular support, and forms the basis of films such as ''[[Tron]]'', ''[[eXistenZ]]'' and ''[[The Last Starfighter]]''.\n\nLudologists break sharply and radically from this idea. They argue that a video game is first and foremost a game, which must be understood in terms of its rules, interface, and the concept of play that it deploys. [[Espen J. Aarseth]] argues that, although games certainly have plots, characters, and aspects of traditional narratives, these aspects are incidental to gameplay. For example, Aarseth is critical of the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', saying that \"the dimensions of [[Lara Croft]]'s body, already analyzed to death by [[film theory|film theorists]], are irrelevant to me as a player, because a different-looking body would not make me play differently... When I play, I don't even see her body, but see through it and past it.\"<ref>{{cite web| last = Aarseth| first = Espen J.| authorlink = Espen J.

The term \"emergent narrative\" has been used to describe how, in a simulated environment, storyline can be created simply by \"what happens to the player.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/502/502409p1.html |title=IGN: GDC 2004: Warren Spector Talks Games Narrative |publisher=Xbox.ign.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411094042/http://xbox.ign.com/articles/502/502409p1.html |archivedate=11 April 2009  }}</ref> However, emergent behavior is not limited to sophisticated games. In general, any place where event-driven instructions occur for [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] in a game, emergent behavior will exist. For instance, take a racing game in which cars are programmed to avoid crashing, and they encounter an obstacle in the track: the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the cars behind them to slow and/or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front of them and the obstacle. The programmer never wrote code to specifically create a traffic jam, yet one now exists in the game.\n\n==Emulation==\n{{Main|Video game console emulator}}\n[[File:StarFox64 Emulated with Project64.png|thumb|right|[[Project64]], a [[Nintendo 64]] emulator, running ''[[Star Fox 64]]''  on a [[Windows 8]] platform]]\n\nAn emulator is a program that replicates the behavior of a [[video game console]], allowing games to run on a different platform from the original hardware. Emulators exist for [[personal computer|PCs]], [[smartphone]]s and [[video game console|consoles]] other than the original. Emulators are generally used to play old games, [[ROM hacking|hack existing games]], [[Fan translation of video games|translate unreleased games in a specific region]], or add enhanced features to games like improved graphics, speed up or down, bypass regional lockouts, or online multiplayer support.\n\nSome manufacturers have released official emulators for their own consoles. For example, [[Nintendo|Nintendo's]] [[Virtual Console]] allows users to play games for old Nintendo consoles on the [[Wii]], [[Wii U]], and [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]].

For casual online puzzle-style and simple mobile cell phone games, the gender divide is more or less equal between men and women. More recently there has been a growing segment of female players engaged with the aggressive style of games historically considered to fall within traditionally male genres (e.g., [[first-person shooter]]s).

As computer and video games have increased in popularity over time, they have had a significant influence on popular culture. Video game culture has also evolved over time hand in hand with [[internet culture]] as well as the increasing popularity of [[mobile game]]s. Many people who play video games identify as [[gamer]]s, which can mean anything from someone who enjoys games to someone who is passionate about it. As video games become more social with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] and [[Online game|online capability]], gamers find themselves in growing [[social network]]s. Gaming can both be entertainment as well as competition, as a new trend known as [[Esports|electronic sports]] is becoming more widely accepted. In the 2010s, video games and discussions of video game trends and topics can be seen in [[social media]], politics, television, film and music.\n\n===Multiplayer===\n{{Main|Multiplayer video game}}\n\n[[Multiplayer video games]] are those that can be played either competitively, sometimes in [[Electronic Sports]], or cooperatively by using either multiple input devices, or by [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseating]]. ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', arguably the first video game, was a two player game, as was its successor ''[[Pong]]''. The first commercially available game console, the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], had two controller inputs. Since then, most consoles have been shipped with two or four controller inputs. Some have had the ability to expand to four, eight or as many as 12 inputs with additional adapters, such as the [[Multitap]]. Multiplayer [[arcade game]]s typically feature play for two to four players, sometimes tilting the monitor on its back for a top-down viewing experience allowing players to sit opposite one another.\n\nMany early computer games for non-PC descendant based platforms featured multiplayer support. Personal computer systems from [[Atari]] and [[Commodore International|Commodore]] both regularly featured at least two game ports. PC-based computer games started with a lower availability of multiplayer options because of technical limitations. PCs typically had either one or no game ports at all. Network games for these early personal computers were generally limited to only text based adventures or [[MUD]]s that were played remotely on a dedicated server. This was due both to the slow speed of modems (300-1200-bit/s), and the prohibitive cost involved with putting a computer online in such a way where multiple visitors could make use of it. However, with the advent of widespread [[local area network]]ing technologies and Internet based online capabilities, the number of players in modern games can be 32 or higher, sometimes featuring integrated text and/or voice chat. [[Massively multiplayer online game]] (MMOs) can offer extremely high numbers of simultaneous players; ''[[Eve Online]]'' set a record with 65,303 players on a single server in 2013.<ref name=\"MassivelyEVEPCU\">{{cite web |url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2013/05/06/eve-online-smashes-pcu-record-during-anniversary-celebrations/ |title=EVE Online smashes PCU record during anniversary celebrations |publisher=massively.joystiq.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128020244/http://massively.joystiq.com/2013/05/06/eve-online-smashes-pcu-record-during-anniversary-celebrations/ |archivedate=28 January 2015  |access-date=1 January 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Behavioral effects==\n{{Main|Video game behavioral effects}}\n\nIt has been shown that action video game players have better [[hand–eye coordination]] and [[Motor coordination|visuo-motor skills]], such as their resistance to [[distraction]], their sensitivity to information in the [[peripheral vision]] and their ability to count briefly presented objects, than nonplayers.<ref>\n{{cite journal| authorlink = Shawn Green (game designer)| title = Action video game modifies visual selective attention| journal = Nature| volume = 423| pages = 534–37| year = 2003| id = Green & Bavelier| doi = 10.1038/nature01647| author = Green, C.

To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, as well as how to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUDs]]. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/16/050516crbo_books |title=Brain Candy |journal=The New Yorker |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509225914/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/16/050516crbo_books |archivedate=9 May 2009  |date=9 May 2005 }}</ref> Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.<ref>{{cite web | author = Daphne Bavelier| year = 2003 | url = http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/daphne/GreenandBavelier.pdf | title = Action video game modifies visual selective attention | publisher = Nature/University of Rochester | accessdate = 29 April 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060329174957/http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/daphne/GreenandBavelier.pdf |archivedate = 29 March 2006|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nLearning principles found in video games have been identified as possible techniques with which to reform the U.S. education system.<ref>{{cite book| last = Gee | first = James Paul | title = What Video Games Have to Teach us About Literacy and Learning | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-1-4039-6169-3 }}</ref> It has been noticed that gamers adopt an attitude while playing that is of such high concentration, they do not realize they are learning, and that if the same attitude could be adopted at school, education would enjoy significant benefits.<ref>{{cite news | author = James Paul Gee | year = 2007 | url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/view.html | title = Wired 11.05: View | publisher = Codenet, Inc. | accessdate = 4 December 2007 | display-authors = etal | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517033243/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/view.html | archivedate = 17 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Students are found to be \"learning by doing\" while playing video games while fostering creative thinking.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Video games | journal = CQ Researcher | volume = 16 | pages = 937–60 | year = 2006 | id = cqresrre2006111000 | author = Glazer, S.}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] has deployed machines such as the [[PackBot]] and [[UAV]] vehicles, which make use of a game-style [[Game controller|hand controller]] to make it more familiar for young people.<ref>{{cite web | year=2007 | url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/iRobot_Receives_New_Military_Orders_14_PackBot_Robots_999.html | title=iRobot Receives New Military Orders 14 PackBot Robots | accessdate=25 July 2007 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215315/http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/iRobot_Receives_New_Military_Orders_14_PackBot_Robots_999.html | archivedate=26 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> According to research discussed at the 2008 Convention of the American Psychological Association, certain types of video games can improve the gamers' [[dexterity]] as well as their ability to do problem solving.

The rating \"A/O\", for \"Adults Only\", indicates games with massive violence or nudity. There are no laws that prohibit children from purchasing \"M\" rated games in the United States.

The players that compete in these tournaments are given a rank depending on their skill level in the game that they choose to play in and face other players that play that game. The players that also compete are mostly called professional players for the fact that they have played the game they are competing in for many, long hours. Those players have been able to come up with different strategies for facing different characters. The professional players are able to pick a character to their liking and be able to master how to use that character very effectively. With [[Strategy games (computer games)|strategy games]], players tend to know how to get resources quick and are able to make quick decisions about where their troops are to be deployed and what kind of troops to create.\n\n===Copyright of video games===\n{{Main|Copyright and video games}}\nCreators will nearly always copyright their games. Laws that define copyright, and the rights that are conveyed over a video game vary from country to country. Usually a [[fair use]] copyright clause allows consumers some ancillary rights, such as for a player of the game to stream a game online. This is a vague area in copyright law, as these laws predate the advent of video games. This means that rightsholders often must define what they will allow a consumer to do with the video game.\n\n==Museums==\n[[File:Consoles-computerspielemuseum.jpg|thumb|Gaming consoles at the
