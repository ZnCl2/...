It is the sequel to the 2011 game ''[[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings]]''. Played in an [[open world]] with a [[third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]], players control protagonist [[Geralt of Rivia]], a monster hunter known as a witcher, who is looking for his missing adopted daughter on the run from the [[Wild Hunt]]: an otherworldly force determined to capture and use her powers. Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with [[non-player character]]s, and complete main-story and side [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]] to acquire [[experience points]] and gold, which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment. Its central story has several endings, determined by the player's choices at certain points in the game.\n\nDevelopment began in 2011 and lasted for three and a half years. Voice recording took over two and a half years. The writing was infused with realistic aspects like moral ambiguity in a deliberate attempt to avoid simplification, impart authenticity, and reflect Sapkowski's novels. Central and Northern Europe was the basis of the game's world. [[REDengine 3]] enabled the developer to create a complex story without compromising the game's [[open world]]. The music was composed by [[Marcin Przybyłowicz]] and performed by the [[Brandenburg State Orchestra]].\n\n''The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'' was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] in May 2015, with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version slated for 2019. The game received critical acclaim, with praise for its gameplay, narrative, world design, combat, and visuals, although it received minor criticism due to technical issues. It received numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards, and has been cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. It was also a commercial success, shipping over twenty million copies by June 2019. Two expansions, ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Hearts of Stone|Hearts of Stone]]'' and ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Blood and Wine|Blood and Wine]]'', were also released to critical acclaim. A Game of the Year edition, with the base game, expansions and all [[downloadable content]], was released in August 2016.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Witcher3Gameplay.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of Geralt using the Igni sign against a fiend]]\n''The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'' is an [[action role-playing game]] with a [[third-person perspective]]. Players control [[Geralt of Rivia]], a monster hunter known as a Witcher.<ref name=\"rivia\" /> Geralt walks, runs, rolls and dodges, and (for the first time in the series) jumps, climbs and swims.<ref name=\"Geralt can walk\" /><ref name=\"Witcher3gameplay\"/> He has a variety of weapons, including bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one silver).<ref name=\"VGGuide\" /> The steel sword is used primarily to kill humans while the silver sword is more effective against creatures and monsters.<ref name=\"cite video game\" /> Players can draw out, switch and sheathe their swords at will. There are two modes of melee attack; light attacks are fast but weak, and heavy attacks are slow and strong.<ref name=\"sheathe\" /> Players can block and counter enemy attacks with their swords.<ref name=\"VGGuide\" /> Swords have limited endurance and require regular repair.<ref name=\"GRevTips\" /> In addition to physical attacks, Geralt has five magical signs at his disposal: Aard, Axii, Igni, Yrden and Quen.<ref name=\"51gn5\" /> Aard prompts Geralt to unleash a telekinetic blast, Axii confuses enemies, Igni burns them, Yrden slows them down and Quen offers players a temporary, protective shield.<ref name=\"signs\" /> The signs use stamina, and cannot be used indefinitely.<ref name=\"mutations\" /> Players can use [[mutagens]] to increase Geralt's magic power. They lose [[health (gaming)|health]] when they are attacked by enemies, although wearing armour can help reduce health loss. Health can be restored with [[meditation]] or consumables, such as food and potions.<ref name=\"VGGuide\" /> Players occasionally control Ciri, Geralt's adoptive daughter who can [[teleportation|teleport]] short distances.<ref name=\"teleport\" /> The game has responsive, advanced [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) and dynamic environments. The day-night cycle influences some monsters (and their powers), as a werewolf becomes powerful during the night of a full moon.<ref name=\"AI\" /> Players can learn about their enemies and prepare for combat by reading the in-game [[bestiary]].<ref name=\"kotakutips\" /> When they kill an enemy, they can loot its corpse for valuables.<ref name=\"kotakutips\" /> Geralt's witcher sense enables players to find objects of interest, including items that can be collected or scavenged.<ref name=\"prima\" /> Items are stored in the inventory, which can be expanded by purchasing upgrades.<ref name=\"kotakutips\" /> Players can sell items to vendors<ref name=\"prima2\" /> or use them to craft potions and bombs.<ref name=\"and bombs\" /><ref name=\"4nd 80m85\" /> They can visit [[blacksmith]]s to craft new weapons and armour with what they have gathered.<ref name=\"blacksmiths\" /> The price of an item and the cost of crafting it depend on a region's local economy.<ref name=\"Witcher3gameplay\" />\n\nThe game focuses on narrative, and has a [[Dialog tree|dialogue wheel]] which allows players to choose how to respond to [[non-player character]]s. Geralt must make decisions which change the state of the world and lead to 36 possible endings, affecting the lives of in-game characters.<ref name=\"thirtysix\" /> He can have a romantic relationship with some of the game's female characters by completing certain quests.<ref name=\"prima3\" /> In addition to the main quests, books offer more information on the game's world.<ref name=\"kotakutips\" /> Players can begin [[side quest]]s after visiting a town's noticeboard.<ref name=\"kotakutips\" /> These side missions include Witcher Contracts (elaborate missions requiring players to hunt monsters)<ref name=\"track\" /> and Treasure Hunt quests, which reward players with top-tier weapons or armour.<ref name=\"kotakutips\" /> Players earn [[experience point]]s by completing missions.<ref name=\"Witcher3gameplay\" /> When a player earns enough experience, Geralt's [[level (video gaming)|level]] increases and the player receives ability points.<ref name=\"points\" /> These points may be used on four [[skill tree]]s: combat, signs, alchemy and general. Combat upgrades enhance Geralt's attacks and unlock new fighting techniques; signs upgrades enable him to use magic more efficiently, and alchemy upgrades improve crafting abilities. General upgrades have a variety of functions, from raising Geralt's vitality to increasing crossbow damage.<ref name=\"mutations\" /> The game's [[open world]] is divided into several regions. Geralt can explore each region on foot or by transportation, such as a boat. Roach, his horse, may be summoned at will.<ref name=\"at will\" /> Players can kill enemies with their sword while riding Roach,<ref name=\"roach\" /> but an enemy presence may frighten the horse and unseat Geralt.<ref name=\"kotakutips\" /> Points of interest may be found on the map, and players receive experience points after completing mini-missions in these regions.<ref name=\"GSpotstory\" /> Players can discover Places of Power for additional ability points.<ref name=\"PoP\" /> Other activities include [[horse racing]], [[boxing]] and [[card playing]];<ref name=\"horse playing\" /><ref name=\"dice\" /> the card-playing [[Game mechanics|mechanic]] was later expanded into a [[Gwent: The Witcher Card Game|standalone game]].<ref name=\"gw3nt\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting===\nThe game is set in the Continent, a fantasy world surrounded by parallel dimensions and extra-dimensional worlds. Humans, elves, dwarves, monsters and other creatures co-exist on the Continent, but non-humans are often persecuted for their differences. The Continent is caught up in a war between the empire of Nilfgaard<ref name=\"Characters\" />—led by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis ([[Charles Dance]]),<ref name=\"CastDance\" /> who invaded the Northern Kingdoms<ref name=\"Characters\" />—and Redania, ruled by King Radovid V.<ref name=\"CharacterKotaku\" /> Several locations appear, including the free city of Novigrad,<ref name=\"Novigrad\" /> the Redanian city of Oxenfurt, the [[no man's land]] of Velen, the city of Vizima (former capital of the recently-conquered Temeria), the Skellige islands (home to several [[Norse-Gaels]] Viking clans) and the witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen.<ref name=\"CharacterKotaku\" /><ref name=\"Ramsey-May2016\" />\n\nThe main character is the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia ([[Doug Cockle]]),<ref name=\"CharVoice\" /> a monster hunter trained since childhood in combat, tracking, alchemy and magic, and made stronger, faster and resistant to toxins by mutagens. He is aided by his lover, the powerful sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg ([[Denise Gough]]),<ref name=\"CharVoice\" /> his former love interest Triss Merigold (Jaimi Barbakoff),<ref name=\"CharVoice\" /> the bard Dandelion ([[John Schwab]]), the dwarf warrior Zoltan Chivay ([[Alexander Morton]]),<ref name=\"CastCredits\" /><ref name=\"Characters\" /> and Geralt's Witcher mentor Vesemir (William Roberts).<ref name=\"CastCredits\" /><ref name=\"CharacterKotaku\" /> Geralt is spurred into action by the reappearance of his and Yennefer's adopted daughter, Ciri ([[Jo Wyatt]]).<ref name=\"CastCredits\" /> Ciri is a Source, born with innate (and potentially vast) magical abilities; after the apparent death of her parents, she was trained as a witcher while Yennefer taught her magic. She is unaware that the Emperor is her biological father; he sired her under an assumed name while he was subject to a curse.<ref name=\"Characters\" /> Ciri disappeared years before to escape the [[Wild Hunt]], a group of spectral warriors led by the King of the Wild Hunt: the elf Eredin, from a parallel dimension.<ref name=\"CharacterKotaku\" />\n\n===Plot===\n\n{{see also|The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Hearts of Stone|The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Blood and Wine|l1=Hearts of Stone|l2=Blood and Wine}}\n\n<!--under 700 words, please do not expand plot any further per plot guidelines-->\nGeralt rejoins his long-lost lover, Yennefer, in the town of White Orchard. Yennefer tells him that Emperor Emhyr has summoned him to the city of Vizima. Emhyr tasks Geralt with finding Ciri, who has recently been seen in several places. Ciri is a Child of the Elder Blood, the daughter of the emperor and the last heir to an ancient elfish bloodline with the power to manipulate space and time. Geralt first hears that Ciri was in Velen at Crow's Perch, the Bloody Baron's fort.<ref name=\"CharacterBaron\"/> The baron refuses to help, but Geralt's acquaintance, the sorceress Keira Metz, tells him that an elfish [[Wizard (character class)|mage]] was looking for Ciri. Keira directs Geralt to the Crones of Crookback Bog: malicious, ancient spirits living near Velen. The Crones say that they captured Ciri for the Wild Hunt before she escaped and have enslaved Anna, the baron's missing wife. Geralt returns to the baron, who tells him that Ciri went to Novigrad.\n\nHe discovers that the Church of the Eternal Fire, a militant religious organization, is purging mages in Novigrad. Meeting his former lover, Triss Merigold, Geralt learns that Ciri had contacted his friend Dandelion. Geralt navigates Novigrad's criminal underworld to rescue Dandelion, and learns that Ciri teleported to the Skellige archipelago. In Novigrad, Geralt may help Triss to free fugitive mages. He sails to Skellige and rejoins Yennefer, who has been investigating a magical explosion linked to Ciri. They track Ciri to the island of Lofoten, which has been attacked by the Wild Hunt. Geralt and Yennefer realise that Uma, a deformed, cursed creature at Crow's Perch, was present after Ciri's escape. Before leaving Skellige, Geralt can help determine who will rule Skellige after the king's death. Yennefer severs the magical bond between her and Geralt, giving him the option of affirming his love for her or ending their relationship.\n\nThey bring Uma to the witcher school of Kaer Morhen, where Yennefer removes his curse and transforms him into Avallac'h. He reveals that he teleported Ciri to the Isle of Mists to save her from the Lofoten attack. Geralt travels to the island and finds Ciri in a deathlike state, until she is awakened by Avallac'h's magic. She says that Eredin's (the King of the Wild Hunt) homeworld is being destroyed by the White Frost, and he wants Ciri's power to conquer the Continent. Ciri and Geralt teleport to Kaer Morhen, pursued by the Wild Hunt. After a brief reunion with Yennefer, Triss and Vesemir (their witcher mentor), the Hunt attacks. Vesemir is killed protecting Ciri; her distress unleashes her Elder power, and Eredin and the Hunt retreat. Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, Ciri, and their allies conduct a funeral for Vesemir. Ciri and Geralt travel to Novigrad and help Triss and Yennefer reform the Lodge of Sorceresses to aid their fight.\n\nThey learn about the Sunstone, a relic which can lure Eredin out and bind him to a location. On the Skelligan island of Undvik, Avallac'h uses the Sunstone to draw out the Hunt and their fleet. Geralt, Ciri, their allies and the Nilfgaardian fleet battle the Hunt, and Geralt defeats Eredin in combat. As the White Frost descends on Skellige, Ciri insists that she must confront it with her Elder Blood before it consumes all life on every world. She enters a portal and defeats the White Frost, ending the threat. The game ending varies, depending on previous choices. If Ciri is alive, Geralt can retire with Yennefer or Triss or remain a lone witcher. If Geralt helps Nilfgaard win the war and brings Ciri to meet the emperor, she will become empress; if Ciri does not meet the emperor, Geralt fakes her death and she becomes a witcher. If Ciri dies fighting the White Frost, Geralt hunts down her stolen medallion as a keepsake; surrounded by monsters when he finds it, his fate is unknown.\n<!--under 700 words, please do not expand plot any further per plot guidelines-->\n\n==Development==\nAlthough the game was planned to begin production in 2008, [[CD Projekt Red]]'s preoccupation with ''[[Rise of the White Wolf]]'' pushed it back to 2011.<ref name=\"5000bugs\" /> The company developed ''The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'' with a self-funded budget of [[US$]]81 million{{efn|Reports conflict on the exact figure. The total was estimated at $67–81 million, with $12.2–32.4 million for production and an additional $25–35 million for marketing.<ref name=\"Their-2015\" /><ref name=\"Williams-2015\" /><ref name=\"Chalk-2015\" />}} over three-and-a-half years. The project began with 150 employees, eventually growing to over 250 in-house staff. Fifteen hundred people were involved in the production globally. While the game is based on Sapkowski's novels, his involvement with the game was limited to the creation of its in-game map.<ref name=\"gryonline\" /> It was [[Video game localization|localised]] in 15 languages, with a total of 500 voice actors.<ref name=\"dev\" /><ref name=\"240 and a half\" /><ref name=\"eurcost\" /> The game was scripted concurrently in Polish and English to alleviate difficulty in localisation.<ref name=\"scandinavia\" /> According to Side (the company which handled voice casting and recording), the 450,000-word script had 950 speaking roles. The voices were recorded from late 2012 to early 2015.<ref name=\"Stein-2015\" /> CD Projekt Red wanted the game to be free of any [[digital rights management]] (DRM) due to the developer's unsuccessful control of [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] with its predecessor, ''The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings'', whose DRM also made it run slowly.<ref name=\"drm\" />\n\n''The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'' was created with the [[REDengine#REDengine 3|REDengine 3]], CD Projekt Red's proprietary game engine designed for [[Nonlinear gameplay#Role-playing games|nonlinear role-playing video games]] set in [[open world]] environments,<ref name=\"redengine1\" /> aided by the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] consoles and prepared for use in October 2014. The first play-through indicated to the developers that the open world, despite its content and generation around the quests, seemed empty. As a solution, they added [[points of interest]]. The game had 5,000 [[Glitch|bugs]] that December, which (with a launch date of February 2015) necessitated its postponement.<ref name=\"5000bugs\" /><ref name=\"by hand\" /> Like the previous two ''Witcher'' games, players are given a complex story with multiple choices and [[Types of fiction with multiple endings#Video games|consequences]]. Unlike other game engines, REDengine 3 permits a complex storyline without sacrificing [[virtual world]] design.<ref name=\"redengine2\" /> The [[user interface]] was made more intuitive with [[Tile-based video game|grid-based]] solutions. The camera system was improved to use [[long shot]]s for battles with multiple enemies and [[close-up]]s for more-intimate confrontations.<ref name=\"the grid\" /> More animations were used for combat sequences than in ''The Witcher 2'', with each lasting less than one second for quick succession.<ref name=\"animations\" /> Game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and senior game designer Damien Monnier cited ''[[Dark Souls]]'' and ''[[Demon's Souls]]'' as influences on ''Wild Hunt''{{'s}} combat system,<ref name=\"50u15\" /><ref name=\"3xpr355\" /> and level designer Miles Tost and senior environment artist Jonas Mattsson cited ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series and ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' as influencing the game's level designs and environments.<ref name=\"design\" />\n\nMonths before its release date, the game's economy, crafting, and inventory systems were incomplete and apparently unable to meet the deadline. Senior gameplay designer Matthew Steinke thought of a remedy and drew up a [[system context diagram]]. To allocate prices, Steinke wrote a formula based on rate of damage, defence, or healing. [[Polynomial least squares]] were used to determine its efficacy, and it was found to eliminate bugs from the system and reduce [[Loading screen|loading times]].<ref name=\"reactor\" /> Each character was given a unique personality to contrast the [[Quest (video gaming)#Delivery quests|fetch-quest]] system typically used in video games. It was decided early that the writing would be witty, with [[metaphor]]s and implied meanings. Dialogue was limited to 15 lines, with occasional exceptions, to retain content originality. Player options were written as morally ambiguous, reflecting [[real life]] and [[Andrzej Sapkowski]]'s original [[The Witcher|''Witcher'' series]]. Alcoholism, abuse and sexuality, depicted as normal parts of the [[medieval]] world, were incorporated into the story for authenticity.<ref name=\"5000bugs\" /><ref name=\"by hand\" /><ref name=\"scandinavia\" /> Areas of the open world were based on Poland, [[Amsterdam]], and [[Scandinavia]].<ref name=\"scandinavia\" /> Objects were modelled by hand.<ref name=\"by hand\" />\n\nStorylines such as Yennefer imprisoning Geralt on an island and Geralt's covert recruitment to the Wild Hunt were discarded to make the game smaller and avoid splitting it into two parts. The [[card game]] Gwent was preceded by other mini-game proposals, including a [[drinking game]], [[knife throwing]], and [[ice skating]].<ref name=\"5000bugs\" /> A re-enactment of the [[Battle of Grunwald]] was recorded for the sounds of battle, marching, [[blacksmith]]ing, and the firing of arrows. Recording the knights' voices for [[Audio editing software|post-processing]], the speakers wore helmets for an authentic sound. [[Marcin Przybyłowicz]] was the game's music director and composer, with additional music contributed by Polish folk band [[Percival (band)|Percival]]. According to Przybyłowicz, working with Percival was a challenge; he expected an academic approach before learning that most of the group were not formally trained, and much of the music was improvised. [[Multi-instrumentalist]] Robert Jaworski of the folk band Żywiołak recorded [[lute]], Renaissance [[fiddle]], bowed [[gusle]], and [[hurdy-gurdy]] sections. The score was performed in [[Frankfurt an der Oder]] by the Brandenburg State Orchestra, conducted by [[Bernd Ruf]].<ref name=\"Makuch-2016\" />\n\n==Release==\n\n''The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'' was announced on 4 February 2013 in ''[[Game Informer]]'', with a 2014 release for PC and \"all high-end platforms available\";<ref name=\"gi\" /> the latter were clarified as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.<ref name=\"ps4xone\" /><ref name=\"Langshaw-2013\" /> The game's release date was later delayed from the third quarter of 2014 to February 2015.<ref name=\"standard of quality\" /> After missing its planned release date of 24 February,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"McWhertor-2014\" /> CD Projekt Red confirmed in April that the game was [[released to manufacturing]].<ref name=\"rtm\" /> ''The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'' was released worldwide on 19 May 2015.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> It was distributed to retailers by [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] in North America and [[Bandai Namco]] in [[Western Europe]], Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=\"new australia\" /><ref name=\"namco\" /> In addition to the standard edition, players can also purchase the Collector's Edition, which includes the base game and items such as an artbook, a statue of Geralt fighting against a griffin, and a Witcher medallion.<ref name=\"KotakuCollector\"/> Polish Prime Minister [[Ewa Kopacz]] and President [[Bronisław Komorowski]] visited CD Projekt Red to celebrate the launch.<ref name=\"5000bugs\" /> At [[E3 2019]], a [[Nintendo Switch]] version was confirmed for later that year.<ref name=\"Makuch-Jun2019\" /> It is being developed in cooperation with [[Saber Interactive]].<ref name=\"Metro-Jun2019\" />\n\nCD Projekt Red co-founder Marcin Iwiński listed three pillars that he considered integral to marketing: game quality, a \"gamer-centric [[value proposition]]\", and communication with fans. To achieve the second, ''The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'' was marketed as \"''[[Skyrim]]'' in a ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' sauce\".<ref name=\"Leone-2016\" /> The third explained in detail the visual downgrade from earlier promotional footage to the finished product, which Iwiński thought effective.<ref name=\"Leone-2016\" /> The logo was re-designed to make it less obvious that ''The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'' was a sequel; the number three suggested a claw mark or mask to an audience unfamiliar with the series, while fans would recognise it as the mark of the Wild Hunt.<ref name=\"Crawley-2015\" />\n\n===Downloadable content===\nThe developer studied ''Witcher'' forums and websites such as [[Reddit]] to predict what players generally desired from [[downloadable content]] (DLC). A collection of 16 free DLC was released, as announced before release by the developers. They included cosmetic and additional gameplay content and the [[New Game Plus]] mode.<ref name=\"drm\" /><ref name=\"dlc\" /> CD Projekt Red announced two [[expansion pack]]s: ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Hearts of Stone|Hearts of Stone]]'' and ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Blood and Wine|Blood and Wine]]''. ''Hearts of Stone'' was released on 13 October 2015,<ref name=\"expansion_announcement\" /> and ''Blood and Wine'' on 31 May 2016.<ref name=\"blood and wine\" /> ''Hearts of Stone'' follows Geralt as he contacts a mysterious entity known as the Man of Glass and an immortal man, Olgierd von Everec. The expansion was critically acclaimed, rated a 9/10 by [[IGN]] and [[GameSpot]].<ref name=\"1gn\" /><ref name=\"heartspot\" /> The second expansion pack, ''Blood and Wine'', follows Geralt as he travels to Toussaint (a Nilfgaardian [[duchy]] untouched by war) to track down a mysterious beast which is terrorizing the region. It was also critically acclaimed, winning the Best RPG category at [[The Game Awards 2016]].<ref name=\"bloodstonerpg\" /> A Game of the Year edition, with the base game, both expansions and all DLC, was released on 30 August 2016.<ref name=\"goty\" />\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 93/100<ref name=\"MCPC\" /><br />(PS4) 92/100<ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><br />(XONE) 91/100<ref name=\"MCXONE\" />\n| Destruct = 8/10<ref name=\"Destruct\" />\n| GI = 9.75/10<ref name=\"GI\" />\n| GameRev = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"GameRev\" />\n| GSpot = 10/10<ref name=\"GSpot\" />\n| GRadar = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"GRadar\" />\n| GT = 9.8/10<ref name=\"GT\" />\n| IGN = 9.3/10<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n| PCGUS = 92/100<ref name=\"PCGUS\" />\n| Poly = 8/10<ref name=\"Poly\" />\n| VG = 9/10<ref name=\"VG\" />\n}}\n''The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'' received universal acclaim, according to review aggregator [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MCPC\" /><ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><ref name=\"MCXONE\" /> Critics agreed that it was an ambitious action role-playing game which was grand in scale,<ref name=\"IGN\"/><ref name=\"Poly\"/><ref name=\"Destruct\" /> but marred by technical difficulties<ref name=\"VG\" /><ref name=\"GRadar\" /> and a lack of innovation.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> GameSpot and [[Eurogamer]] gave the game their highest rating.<ref name=\"GSpot\" /><ref name=\"EuroG\" /> ''The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'' has been considered one of the [[greatest video games of all time]].<ref name=\"Arnold-2017\" /><ref name=\"PCGamer-2016\" /><ref name=\"IGN-RPG\" /><ref name=\"Edge-Aug2017\" /><ref name=\"HardcoreGaming101-Dec2015\" /><ref name=\"Polygon-Nov2017\" /><ref name=\"GameInformer-Apr2018\" /><ref name=\"IGN-Top100\" /> The game world received widespread praise from critics. Kimberly Wallace of ''Game Informer'' called it \"immersive\", and was impressed by its attention to detail.<ref name=\"GI\" /> [[Destructoid]]'s Chris Carter praised its size, which he found enormous and would take players hours to explore.<ref name=\"Destruct\" /> Jonathon Leack, writing for [[Game Revolution]], praised the game's effective use of its large world. Leack wrote that every region had quests and activities for players to try, although he thought that much was filler which extended its length.<ref name=\"GameRev\" /> Tom Senior of [[GamesRadar]] praised the open world's variety, describing it as an \"exciting realization of the Ronin fantasy\".<ref name=\"GRadar\" /> [[GameTrailers]]' Daniel Bloodworth praised the game for encouraging exploration; many quests would only become available to players after they met non-playable characters in different parts of the world.<ref name=\"GT\" /> Vince Ingenito of IGN and Shaun Prescott of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' were impressed by the game's scenery and its day-night cycle,<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> with Ingenito saying that it highlighted the game world's authenticity.<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n\nIts narrative also received critical acclaim. Carter praised the game's cast of characters, which he called unique and interesting. He considered the narrative more involving, with players witnessing key events and making consequential choices.<ref name=\"Destruct\" /> Wallace praised the game's dialogue and its side-quests; each was similar to a short story, and player decisions in the quests would influence the state of the world. She liked the game's main quest, which added more character to Geralt, and said that the romance options were a significant improvement over its predecessors. However, she was disappointed with the quality of the game's endings.<ref name=\"GI\" /> Kevin Van Ord of GameSpot echoed Wallace, noting that ''The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt''{{'}}s story had more characterisation for Geralt than the previous games. He welcomed the change, since it gave players emotional connections to the in-game characters.<ref name=\"GSpot\" /> Senior enjoyed the game's side-quests, calling them \"a compilation of dark fantasy short stories\" which overshadowed the main quests.<ref name=\"GRadar\" /> Ingenito was disappointed with the game's main story, saying that there was too much padding and too many dull quests.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> ''PC Gamer''{{'}}s Shaun Prescott agreed, saying that the narrative would have felt rote if the side content was not engaging.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> Van Ord, Wallace and Brett Phipps of VideoGamer.com praised the voice acting,<ref name=\"VG\" /><ref name=\"GSpot\" /> with Wallace calling it the series' best.<ref name=\"GI\" /> Arthur Gies from [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] criticized that some of the female characters are overly sexualized and that there are no [[Person of color|people of colour]] in the main game.<ref name=\"Poly\"/>\n\nThe game's combat had a generally-positive reception. Bloodworth found Geralt more mobile and agile with the new climbing and swimming mechanic.<ref name=\"GT\" /> Carter said that it was significantly streamlined and its predecessors' strategic elements removed, but appreciated its action.<ref name=\"Destruct\" /> Wallace wrote that with a simplified alchemy system, a decent [[user interface]] and diverse difficulty settings the combat was more accessible, although she disliked the disruptive weapon-degradation system and unrefined crossbow shooting mechanic.<ref name=\"GI\" /> Leack thought the system lacked complexity and criticised its lack of polish, caused by the unreliable lock-on system, camera issues and excessively-long combat animation.<ref name=\"GameRev\" /> Senior noted that some gameplay mechanics, such as rolling and dodging, were inconsistent and made the system feel unfair.<ref name=\"GRadar\" /> Ingenito praised the combat, describing its fluidity as a significant improvement over its predecessors.<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n\nOther gameplay aspects received mixed reviews.
