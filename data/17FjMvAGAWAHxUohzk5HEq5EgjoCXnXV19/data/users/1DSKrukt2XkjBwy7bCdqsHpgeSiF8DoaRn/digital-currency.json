It exhibits properties similar to physical currencies, but can allow for instantaneous transactions and borderless transfer-of-ownership. Examples include [[Virtual currency|virtual currencies]] and [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] and [[central bank]] issued money accounted for in a computer database (including [[digital base money]]). Like traditional [[money]], these currencies may be used to buy physical [[goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]], but may also be restricted to certain communities such as for use inside an online game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital currencies are impacting video games with... |url=https://www.offgamers.com/blog/digital-currencies-are-impacting-video-games-with-new-exciting-possibilities/|publisher=Offgamers|accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nDigital currency is a money balance recorded electronically on a [[stored-value card]] or other devices.

Bitcoin and its alternatives are based on cryptographic algorithms, so these kinds of virtual currencies are also called cryptocurrencies.\n\n===Digital versus traditional currency===\nMost of the traditional [[money supply]] is [[Demand deposit|bank money]] held on computers.

The interface is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India and works by instantly transferring funds between two bank accounts on a mobile platform.\nUPI is built over Immediate Payment Service(IMPS) for transferring funds. Being a digital payment system it is available 24*7 and across public holidays. Unlike traditional mobile wallets, which takes a specified amount of money from user and stores it in its own accounts, UPI withdraws and deposits funds directly from the bank account whenever a transaction is requested. It uses Virtual Payment Address (a unique ID provided by the bank), Account Number with IFS Code, Mobile Number with MMID (Mobile Money Identifier), Aadhaar Number, or a one-time use Virtual ID. An UPI-PIN (UPI Personal Identification number that one creates on the UPI app of the bank) is required to confirm each payment.\n\n'''Russia'''\n\nGovernment-controlled [[Sberbank of Russia]] owns [[Yandex.Money]] – electronic payment service and digital currency of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrii Degeler |url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/12/19/yandex-sells-its-electronic-payment-system-to-russias-largest-bank-sberbank/ |title=Yandex Sells 75% Of Yandex.Money To Sberbank For $60M |website=Thenextweb.com |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}</ref>\n\n'''South Korea'''\n\n[[South Korea]] plans national digital currency using a Blockchain.<ref name=\"bravenewcoin.com\">{{cite web|url=http://bravenewcoin.com/news/south-korea-plans-national-digital-currency-using-a-blockchain/ |title=South Korea plans national digital currency using a Blockchain |publisher=Brave New Coin |date=2016-10-26 |accessdate=2017-01-05}}</ref> The chairman of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC), Yim Jong-yong, announced that his department will \"Lay the systemic groundwork for the spread of digital currency.\"<ref name=\"bravenewcoin.com\"/> South Korea has already announced plans to discontinue coins by the year 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/01/south-korea-to-kill-the-coin-in-path-towards-cashless-society.html|title=Currencies|first=|last=CNBC|website=CNBC|accessdate=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227232020/http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/01/south-korea-to-kill-the-coin-in-path-towards-cashless-society.html|archive-date=27 February 2017|dead-url=yes}}</ref>\n\n'''Sweden'''\n\n[[Sweden]] is in the process of replacing all of its physical banknotes, and most of its coins by mid-2017. However, the new banknotes and coins of the [[Swedish krona]] will probably be circulating at about half the 2007 peak of 12,494 kronor per capita. The [[Riksbank]] is planning to begin discussions of an electronic currency issued by the central bank to which \"is not to replace cash, but to act as complement to it\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riksbank.se/en/Press-and-published/Speeches/2016/Skingsley-Should-the-Riksbank-issue-e-krona/|title=Skingsley: Should the Riksbank issue e-krona?|first=|last=Riksbanken|website=www.riksbank.se|accessdate=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221093204/http://www.riksbank.se/en/Press-and-published/Speeches/2016/Skingsley-Should-the-Riksbank-issue-e-krona/|archive-date=21 December 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Deputy Governor [[Cecilia Skingsley]] states that cash will continue to spiral out of use in Sweden, and while it is currently fairly easy to get cash in Sweden, it is often very difficult to deposit it into bank accounts, especially in rural areas. No decision has been currently made about the decision to create \"e-krona\".  In her speech, Skingsley states: \"The first question is whether e-krona should be booked in accounts or whether the ekrona should be some form of a digitally transferable unit that does not need an underlying account structure, roughly like cash.\" Skingsley also states: \"Another important question is whether the Riksbank should issue e-krona directly to the general public or go via the banks, as we do now with banknotes and coins.\" Other questions will be addressed like interest rates, should they be positive, negative, or zero?\n\n'''Switzerland'''\n\nIn 2016, a [[city government]] first accepted digital currency in payment of city fees.  [[Zug, Switzerland]], added bitcoin as a means of paying small amounts, up to {{CHF|200}}, in a test and an attempt to advance Zug as a region that is advancing future technologies.  In order to reduce risk, Zug immediately converts any bitcoin received into the Swiss currency.<ref name=dwf20160701>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/alpine-crypto-valley-pays-with-bitcoins/a-19371082? |last=Uhlig/jse |first=Christian |title=Alpine 'Crypto Valley' pays with Bitcoins |work=DW Finance |date=1 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160920160330/http://www.dw.com/en/alpine-crypto-valley-pays-with-bitcoins/a-19371082? |archivedate=20 September 2016 |accessdate=20 September 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>[[Swiss Federal Railways]], government-owned railway company of Switzerland, sells bitcoins at its ticket machines.<ref name=\"sbb.ch\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sbb.ch/en/station-services/services/further-services/bitcoin.html |title=SBB: Make quick and easy purchases with Bitcoin |website=Sbb.ch |date= |accessdate=2017-01-05}}</ref><ref name=\"sbb.ch\"/>\n\n'''UK'''\n\nThe Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK government advised his Prime Minister and Parliament to consider using a blockchain-based digital currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35344843 |title=Government urged to use Bitcoin-style digital ledgers|website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-05}}</ref>\n\nThe chief economist of [[Bank of England]], the central bank of the United Kingdom, proposed abolition of paper currency.

It is nearly impossible to reverse a transaction, justified or not. It is very similar to cash. Advantages of this system include it being cheaper to operate, and transactions are instantaneous. Western Union, [[KlickEx]] and [[Bitcoin]] are examples of this type of currency.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@wikoff.shawn/the-expert-shawn-wikoff-talks-about-electronic-money-d01964dd669c|title=The expert Shawn Wikoff talks about Electronic money|last=Wikoff|first=Shawn|date=2016-09-13|website=Medium|access-date=2018-01-28}}</ref>\n\nSoft electronic currencies are the opposite of hard electronic currencies. Payments can be reversed. Usually, when a payment is reversed there is a \"clearing time.\" This can take 72 hours or more. Examples of soft currencies are [[PayPal]] and any type of [[credit card]]. A hard currency can be \"softened\" with a third party service.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\nMany existing digital currencies have not yet seen widespread usage, and may not be easily used or exchanged.
