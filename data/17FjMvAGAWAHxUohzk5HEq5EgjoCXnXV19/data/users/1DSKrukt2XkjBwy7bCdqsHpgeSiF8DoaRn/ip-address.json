Deering|author2=R. Hinden|publisher=[[IETF]]|date=July 2017}}</ref> [[IPv6 deployment]] has been ongoing since the mid-2000s.\n\nIP addresses are usually written and displayed in [[human-readable]] notations, such as {{IPaddr|172.16.254.1}} in IPv4, and {{IPaddr|2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1}} in IPv6. The size of the routing prefix of the address is designated in [[CIDR notation]] by suffixing the address with the number of significant bits, e.g., {{IPaddr|192.168.1.15|24}}, which is equivalent to the historically used subnet mask {{IPaddr|255.255.255.0}}.\n\nThe IP address space is managed globally by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA), and by five [[Regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs) responsible in their designated territories for assignment to end users and [[local Internet registry|local Internet registries]], such as [[Internet service providers]]. IPv4 addresses have been distributed by IANA to the RIRs in blocks of approximately 16.8&nbsp;million addresses each. Each ISP or private network administrator assigns an IP address to each device connected to its network. Such assignments may be on a ''static'' (fixed or permanent) or ''dynamic'' basis, depending on its software and practices.\n\n==Function==\nAn IP address serves two principal functions. It [[Identification (information)|identifies]] the host, or more specifically its network interface, and it provides the location of the host in the network, and thus the capability of establishing a path to that host. Its role has been characterized as follows: \"A name indicates what we seek. An address indicates where it is. A route indicates how to get there.\"<ref name=rfc791/>\nThe [[Header (computing)|header]] of each [[Network packet|IP packet]] contains the IP address of the sending host, and that of the destination host.\n\n==IP versions==\nTwo [[Internet Protocol#Version history|versions of the Internet Protocol]] are in common use in the Internet today. The original version of the Internet Protocol that was first deployed in 1983 in the [[ARPANET]], the predecessor of the Internet, is [[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4).\n\nThe rapid [[IPv4 address exhaustion|exhaustion of IPv4 address space]] available for assignment to [[Internet service providers]] and end user organizations by the early 1990s, prompted the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) to explore new technologies to expand the addressing capability in the Internet. The result was a redesign of the Internet Protocol which became eventually known as [[IPv6|Internet Protocol Version 6]] (IPv6) in 1995.<ref name=rfc1883/><ref name=rfc2460/><ref name=rfc8200/>\nIPv6 technology was in various testing stages until the mid-2000s, when commercial production deployment commenced.\n\nToday, these two versions of the Internet Protocol are in simultaneous use. Among other technical changes, each version defines the format of addresses differently.  Because of the historical prevalence of IPv4, the generic term ''IP address'' typically still refers to the addresses defined by IPv4. The gap in version sequence between IPv4 and IPv6 resulted from the assignment of version 5 to the experimental [[Internet Stream Protocol]] in 1979, which however was never referred to as IPv5.\n\n==Subnetworks==\nIP networks may be divided into [[subnetwork]]s in both [[IPv4 subnetting reference|IPv4]] and [[IPv6 subnetting reference|IPv6]]. For this purpose, an IP address is recognized as consisting of two parts: the ''network prefix'' in the high-order bits and the remaining bits called the ''rest field'', ''host identifier'', or ''interface identifier'' (IPv6), used for host numbering within a network.<ref name=rfc760 /> The [[subnet mask]] or CIDR notation determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts.\n\nThe term ''subnet mask'' is only used within IPv4. Both IP versions however use the CIDR concept and notation. In this, the IP address is followed by a slash and the number (in decimal) of bits used for the network part, also called the ''routing prefix''. For example, an IPv4 address and its subnet mask may be {{IPaddr|192.0.2.1}} and {{IPaddr|255.255.255.0}}, respectively. The CIDR notation for the same IP address and subnet is {{IPaddr|192.0.2.1|24}}, because the first 24 bits of the IP address indicate the network and subnet.\n\n==IPv4 addresses==\n{{Main|IPv4#Addressing}}\n[[Image:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of an IPv4 address from [[dot-decimal notation]] to its binary value.]]\nAn IPv4 address has a size of 32 bits, which limits the [[address space]] to {{gaps|4|294|967|296}} (2<sup>32</sup>) addresses. Of this number, some addresses are reserved for special purposes such as [[private network]]s (~18 million addresses) and [[multicast address]]ing (~270 million addresses).\n\nIPv4 addresses are usually represented in [[dot-decimal notation]], consisting of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, e.g., {{IPaddr|172.16.254.1}}.  Each part represents a group of 8 bits (an [[Octet (computing)|octet]]) of the address. In some cases of technical writing,{{specify|date=May 2018}} IPv4 addresses may be presented in various [[hexadecimal]], [[octal]], or [[binary numeral system|binary]] representations.\n\n===Subnetting history===\nIn the early stages of development of the Internet Protocol, the network number was always the highest order octet (most significant eight bits). Because this method allowed for only 256 networks, it soon proved inadequate as additional networks developed that were independent of the existing networks already designated by a network number. In 1981, the addressing specification was revised with the introduction of [[classful network]] architecture.<ref name=rfc791/>\n\nClassful network design allowed for a larger number of individual network assignments and fine-grained [[subnetwork]] design. The first three bits of the most significant octet of an IP address were defined as the ''class'' of the address. Three classes (''A'', ''B'', and ''C'') were defined for universal [[unicast]] addressing. Depending on the class derived, the network identification was based on octet boundary segments of the entire address. Each class used successively additional octets in the network identifier, thus reducing the possible number of hosts in the higher order classes (''B'' and ''C''). The following table gives an overview of this now obsolete system.\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THIS TABLE BECAUSE YOU THINK IT IS WRONG. It has been checked by knowledgeable editors for correctness within the intended purpose in this article.

The class system of the address space was replaced with [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) in 1993. CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) to allow allocation and routing based on arbitrary-length prefixes. Today, remnants of classful network concepts function only in a limited scope as the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components (e.g. netmask), and in the technical jargon used in network administrators' discussions.\n\n===Private addresses===\nEarly network design, when global end-to-end connectivity was envisioned for communications with all Internet hosts, intended that IP addresses be globally unique. However, it was found that this was not always necessary as [[private network]]s developed and public address space needed to be conserved.\n\nComputers not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only with each other via TCP/IP, need not have globally unique IP addresses. Today, such private networks are widely used and typically connect to the Internet with [[network address translation]] (NAT), when needed.\n\nThree non-overlapping ranges of IPv4 addresses for private networks are reserved.<ref name=rfc1918>{{Cite IETF|rfc=1918|bcp=5|title=Address Allocation for Private Internets|author1=Y. Rekhter|author2=B. Moskowitz|author3=D. Karrenberg|author4=G. J. de Groot|author5=E. Lear|date=February 1996|publisher=Network Working Group}} Updated by {{IETF RFC|6761}}.</ref> These addresses are not routed on the Internet and thus their use need not be coordinated with an IP address registry. Any user may use any of the reserved blocks. Typically, a network administrator will divide a block into [[subnetwork|subnets]]; for example, many [[residential gateway|home routers]] automatically use a default address range of {{IPaddr|192.168.0.0}} through {{IPaddr|192.168.0.255}} ({{IPaddr|192.168.0.0|24}}).\n{{trim|{{#section:IPv4|IPv4-private-networks}}}}\n\n==IPv6 addresses==\n{{Main|IPv6 address}}\n[[Image:Ipv6 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of an IPv6 address from [[hexadecimal]] representation to its binary value.]]\n\nIn IPv6, the address size was increased from 32 bits in IPv4 to 128 bits, thus providing up to 2<sup>128</sup> (approximately {{val|3.403|e=38}}) addresses. This is deemed sufficient for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe intent of the new design was not to provide just a sufficient quantity of addresses, but also redesign routing in the Internet by allowing more efficient aggregation of subnetwork routing prefixes. This resulted in slower growth of [[routing table]]s in routers. The smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 2<sup>64</sup> hosts, which is the square of the size of the entire IPv4 Internet. At these levels, actual address utilization ratios will be small on any IPv6 network segment. The new design also provides the opportunity to separate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment, i.e. the local administration of the segment's available space, from the addressing prefix used to route traffic to and from external networks. IPv6 has facilities that automatically change the routing prefix of entire networks, should the global connectivity or the routing policy change, without requiring internal redesign or manual renumbering.\n\nThe large number of IPv6 addresses allows large blocks to be assigned for specific purposes and, where appropriate, to be aggregated for efficient routing. With a large address space, there is no need to have complex address conservation methods as used in CIDR.\n\nAll modern desktop and enterprise server operating systems include native support for the IPv6 protocol, but it is not yet widely deployed in other devices, such as residential networking routers, [[voice over IP]] (VoIP) and multimedia equipment, and some [[networking hardware]].\n\n===Private addresses===\nJust as IPv4 reserves addresses for private networks, blocks of addresses are set aside in IPv6. In IPv6, these are referred to as [[unique local address]]es (ULAs). The routing prefix {{IPaddr|fc00::|7}} is reserved for this block,<ref name=rfc4193>{{Cite IETF|rfc=4193|title=Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses|author1=R. Hinden|author2=B. Haberman|date=October 2005|publisher=Network Working Group}}</ref> which is divided into two {{IPaddr||8}} blocks with different implied policies. The addresses include a 40-bit [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]] number that minimizes the risk of address collisions if sites merge or packets are misrouted.\n\nEarly practices used a different block for this purpose ({{IPaddr|fec0::}}), dubbed site-local addresses.<ref name=rfc3513>{{Cite IETF|rfc=3513|title=Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture|author1=R. Hinden |authorlink2=Steve Deering|author2=S. Deering|date=April 2003|publisher=Network Working Group}} Obsoleted by {{IETF RFC|4291}}.</ref> However, the definition of what constituted a ''site'' remained unclear and the poorly defined addressing policy created ambiguities for routing. This address type was abandoned and must not be used in new systems.<ref name=rfc3879>{{Cite IETF|rfc=3879|title=Deprecating Site Local Addresses|author1=C. Huitema |author2=B. Carpenter|date=September 2004|publisher=Network Working Group}}</ref>\n\nAddresses starting with {{IPaddr|fe80::}}, called [[link-local address]]es, are assigned to interfaces for communication on the attached link. The addresses are automatically generated by the operating system for each network interface. This provides instant and automatic communication between all IPv6 host on a link. This feature is used in the lower layers of IPv6 network administration, such as for the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]].\n\nPrivate and link-local address prefixes may not be routed on the public Internet.\n\n==IP address assignment {{anchor|Dynamic IP|Static IP}}== <!-- redirect target from [[Dynamic IP]] and [[Static IP]] -->\nIP addresses are assigned to a host either dynamically as they join the network, or persistently by configuration of the host hardware or software. Persistent configuration is also known as using a '''static IP address'''. In contrast, when a computer's IP address is assigned each time it restarts, this is known as using a '''dynamic IP address'''.\n\nDynamic IP addresses are assigned by network using [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP). DHCP is the most frequently used technology for assigning addresses. It avoids the administrative burden of assigning specific static addresses to each device on a network. It also allows devices to share the limited address space on a network if only some of them are online at a particular time. Typically, dynamic IP configuration is enabled by default in modern desktop operating systems. \n\nThe address assigned with DHCP is associated with a ''lease'' and usually has an expiration period. If the lease is not renewed by the host before expiry, the address may be assigned to another device. Some DHCP implementations attempt to reassign the same IP address to a host (based on its MAC address) each time it joins the network. A network administrator may configure DHCP by allocating specific IP addresses based on MAC address.\n\nDHCP is not the only technology used to assign IP addresses dynamically. [[Bootstrap Protocol]] is a similar protocol and predecessor to DHCP. Dialup and some broadband networks use dynamic address features of the [[Point-to-Point Protocol]]. \n\nComputers and equipment used for the network infrastructure, such as routers and mail servers, are typically configured with static addressing.\n\nIn the absence or failure of static or dynamic address configurations, an operating system may assign a [[link-local address]] to a host using stateless address autoconfiguration.\n\n===Sticky dynamic IP address {{anchor|Sticky dynamic IP address}}===\n<!-- redirect target from [[Sticky dynamic IP address]] and [[Sticky IP]] -->\nA ''sticky dynamic IP address'' is an informal term used by cable and DSL Internet access subscribers to describe a dynamically assigned IP address which seldom changes. The addresses are usually assigned with DHCP. Since the modems are usually powered on for extended periods of time, the address leases are usually set to long periods and simply renewed. If a modem is turned off and powered up again before the next expiration of the address lease, it often receives the same IP address.\n\n===Address autoconfiguration=== \nAddress block {{IPaddr|169.254.0.0|16}} is defined for the special use in link-local addressing for IPv4 networks.<ref name=rfc6890>{{Cite IETF|rfc=6890|bcp=153|title=Special-Purpose IP Address Registries|author1=M. Cotton|author2=L. Vegoda|author3=R. Bonica|author4=B. Haberman|date=April 2013|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]}} Updated by {{IETF RFC|8190}}.</ref> In IPv6, every interface, whether using static or dynamic address assignments, also receives a link-local address automatically in the block {{IPaddr|fe80::|10}}.<ref name=rfc6890 /> These addresses are only valid on the link, such as a local network segment or point-to-point connection, to which a host is connected. These addresses are not routable and, like private addresses, cannot be the source or destination of packets traversing the Internet.\n\nWhen the link-local IPv4 address block was reserved, no standards existed for mechanisms of address autoconfiguration. Filling the void, [[Microsoft]] developed a protocol called [[Automatic Private IP Addressing]] (APIPA), whose first public implementation appeared in [[Windows 98]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc958957(v%3dtechnet.10)|title=DHCP and Automatic Private IP Addressing|website=docs.microsoft.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref> APIPA has been deployed on millions of machines and became a [[de facto standard]] in the industry.

A second assignment of an address generally stops the IP functionality of one or both of the devices.  Many modern [[operating system]]s notify the administrator of IP address conflicts.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379838(v=ws.10).aspx\n |title       = Event ID 4198 — TCP/IP Network Interface Configuration\n |accessdate  = 2 June 2013\n |date        = 7 January 2009\n |publisher   = [[Microsoft]]\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131224215139/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379838(v=ws.10).aspx\n |archivedate = 24 December 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} \"Updated: January 7, 2009\"</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379922(v=ws.10).aspx\n |title       = Event ID 4199 — TCP/IP Network Interface Configuration\n |accessdate  = 2 June 2013\n |date        = 7 January 2009\n |publisher   = [[Microsoft]]\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131222151743/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379922(v=ws.10).aspx\n |archivedate = 22 December 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} \"Updated: 7 January 2009\"</ref> When IP addresses are assigned by multiple people and systems with differing methods, any of them may be at fault.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://compnetworking.about.com/od/workingwithipaddresses/f/ip_conflict.htm\n |title       = IP Address Conflicts – What Is an IP Address Conflict?\n |author      = Mitchell, Bradley\n |authorlink  = \n |accessdate  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = \n |publisher   = [[About.com]]\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140413194343/http://compnetworking.about.com/od/workingwithipaddresses/f/ip_conflict.htm\n |archivedate = 13 April 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/ip-address-already-in-use/\n |title       = How to Fix an IP Address Conflict\n |author      = Kishore, Aseem\n |authorlink  = \n |accessdate  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = 4 August 2009\n |publisher   = Online Tech Tips Online-tech-tips.com\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130825040120/http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/ip-address-already-in-use/\n |archivedate = 25 August 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/get-help-with-there-is-an-ip-address-conflict-message\n |title       = Get help with &quot;There is an IP address conflict&quot; message\n |author      = \n |authorlink  = \n |accessdate  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = 22 November 2013\n |publisher   = [[Microsoft]]\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130926071157/http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/get-help-with-there-is-an-ip-address-conflict-message\n |archivedate = 26 September 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q133490\n |title       = Fix duplicate IP address conflicts on a DHCP network\n |author      = \n |authorlink  = \n |accessdate  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = \n |publisher   = [[Microsoft]]\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20141228223206/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q133490\n |archivedate = 28 December 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} Article ID: 133490 – Last Review: 15 October 2013 – Revision: 5.0</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/2007/IP_Address_Conflicts.asp\n |title       = Understanding And Resolving IP Address Conflicts - Webopedia.com\n |author      = Moran, Joseph\n |authorlink  = \n |accessdate  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = 1 September 2010\n |publisher   = Webopedia.com\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131002155215/http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/2007/IP_Address_Conflicts.asp\n |archivedate = 2 October 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> If one of the devices involved in the conflict is the [[default gateway]] access beyond the LAN for all devices on the LAN may be impaired.\n\n==Routing==\nIP addresses are classified into several classes of operational characteristics: unicast, multicast, anycast and broadcast addressing.\n\n===Unicast addressing===\nThe most common concept of an IP address is in [[unicast]] addressing, available in both IPv4 and IPv6. It normally refers to a single sender or a single receiver, and can be used for both sending and receiving. Usually, a unicast address is associated with a single device or host, but a device or host may have more than one unicast address. Sending the same data to multiple unicast addresses requires the sender to send all the data many times over, once for each recipient.\n\n===Broadcast addressing===\n[[Broadcasting (computing)|Broadcasting]] is an addressing technique available in IPv4 to address data to all possible destinations on a network in one transmission operation as an ''all-hosts broadcast''. All receivers capture the network packet. The address {{IPaddr|255.255.255.255}} is used for network broadcast. In addition, a more limited directed broadcast uses the all-ones host address with the network prefix. For example, the destination address used for directed broadcast to devices on the network {{IPaddr|192.0.2.0|24}} is {{IPaddr|192.0.2.255}}.\n\nIPv6 does not implement broadcast addressing, and replaces it with multicast to the specially defined all-nodes multicast address.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n===Multicast addressing===\nA [[multicast address]] is associated with a group of interested receivers. In IPv4, addresses {{IPaddr|224.0.0.0}} through {{IPaddr|239.255.255.255}} (the former [[Classful network|Class D]] addresses) are designated as multicast addresses.<ref name=rfc5771>{{Cite IETF|rfc=5771|bcp=51|title=IANA Guidelines for IPv4 Multicast Address Assignments|author1=M. Cotton|author2=L. Vegoda|author3=D. Meyer|date=March 2010|publisher=[[IETF]]|issn=2070-1721}}</ref> IPv6 uses the address block with the prefix {{IPaddr|ff00::|8}} for multicast applications. In either case, the sender sends a single datagram from its unicast address to the multicast group address and the intermediary routers take care of making copies and sending them to all receivers that have joined the corresponding multicast group.\n\n===Anycast addressing===\nLike broadcast and multicast, [[anycast]] is a one-to-many routing topology. However, the data stream is not transmitted to all receivers, just the one which the router decides is logically closest in the network. Anycast address is an inherent feature of only IPv6.  In IPv4, anycast addressing implementations typically operate using the shortest-path metric of [[Border Gateway Protocol|BGP routing]] and do not take into account congestion or other attributes of the path. Anycast methods are useful for global load balancing and are commonly used in distributed [[Domain name system|DNS]] systems.\n\n==Geolocation==\nA host may use [[geolocation software]] to deduce the [[geolocation]] of its communicating peer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipinfo.io/|title=IP Information|accessdate=2013-04-11|date=2013-04-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704024032/http://ipinfo.io/|archivedate=4 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/netacuity-edge-offers-hyper-local-ip-targeting|title=NetAcuity Edge Offers Hyper-local IP targeting|accessdate=2011-12-10|date=2009-07-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205000152/http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/netacuity-edge-offers-hyper-local-ip-targeting|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=={{visible anchor|Public address}}==\nA public IP address, in common parlance, is a globally routable unicast IP address, meaning that the address is not an address reserved for use in [[private network]]s, such as those reserved by {{IETF RFC|1918}}, or the various IPv6 address formats of local scope or site-local scope, for example for link-local addressing. Public IP addresses may be used for communication between hosts on the global Internet.\n\n==Firewalling==\nFor security and privacy considerations, network administrators often desire to restrict public Internet traffic within their private networks. The source and destination IP addresses contained in the headers of each IP packet are a convenient means to discriminate traffic by [[IP address blocking]] or by selectively tailoring responses to external requests to internal servers. This is achieved with [[Firewall (computer)|firewall]] software running on the network's gateway router.  A database of IP addresses of permissible traffic may be maintained in [[blacklist (computing)|blacklists]] or [[whitelist]]s.\n\n==Address translation==\nMultiple client devices can appear to {{anchor|shared_IP}}share an IP address, either because they are part of a [[shared hosting]] [[web server]] environment or because an IPv4 [[network address translator]] (NAT) or [[proxy server]] acts as an [[intermediary]] agent on behalf of the client, in which case the real originating IP address might be masked from the server receiving a request. A common practice is to have a NAT mask a large number of devices in a [[private network]]. Only the \"outside\" interface(s) of the NAT needs to have an Internet-routable address.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last        = Comer\n |first       = Douglas\n |title       = Internetworking with TCP/IP:Principles, Protocols, and Architectures – 4th ed.\n |publisher   = Prentice Hall\n |year        = 2000\n |location    = Upper Saddle River, NJ\n |url         = http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/netbooks.html\n |isbn        = 978-0-13-018380-4\n |page        = 394\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100413232359/http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/netbooks.html\n |archivedate = 13 April 2010\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nCommonly, the NAT device maps TCP or UDP [[port number]]s on the side of the larger, public network to individual private addresses on the masqueraded network.\n\nIn residential networks, NAT functions are usually implemented in a [[residential gateway]]. In this scenario, the computers connected to the router have private IP addresses and the router has a public address on its external interface to communicate on the Internet. The internal computers appear to share one public IP address.\n\n==Diagnostic tools==\nComputer operating systems provide various diagnostic tools to examine network interfaces and address configuration. [[Microsoft Windows]] provides the [[command-line interface]] tools [[ipconfig]] and [[netsh]] and users of [[Unix-like]] systems may use [[ifconfig]], [[netstat]], [[route (command)|route]], lanstat, [[fstat (Unix)|fstat]], and [[iproute2]] utilities to accomplish the task.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]]\n* [[Hostname]]\n* [[IP address spoofing]]\n* [[IP aliasing]]\n* [[IP multicast]]\n* [[List of assigned /8 IPv4 address blocks]]\n* [[MAC address]]\n* [[Regional Internet registry]]\n* [[Reverse DNS lookup]]\n* [[Virtual IP address]]\n* [[WHOIS]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--\nBefore you add a new external link here, please make sure it complies with [[WP:EL]].
