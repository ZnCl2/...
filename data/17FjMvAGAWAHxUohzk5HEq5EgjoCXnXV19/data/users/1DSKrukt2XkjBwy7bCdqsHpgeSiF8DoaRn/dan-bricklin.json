In 1977 he returned to education, and was awarded a [[Master of Business Administration]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1979.<ref name=\"EI\"/>\n\nWhile a student at Harvard Business School, Bricklin co-developed VisiCalc in 1979, making it the first electronic spreadsheet readily available for home and office use. It ran on an [[Apple II]] computer, and was considered a fourth generation software program. VisiCalc is widely credited for fueling the rapid growth of the personal computer industry. Instead of doing financial projections with manually calculated spreadsheets, and having to recalculate with every single cell in the sheet, VisiCalc allowed the user to change any cell, and have the entire sheet automatically recalculated. This could turn 20 hours of work into 15 minutes and allowed for more creativity.<ref name=\"EI\"/><ref name=\"Inventors\">[http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa010199.htm The First Spreadsheet - VisiCalc].

Bricklin could not patent VisiCalc, since software programs were not eligible for patent protection at the time.\n\nBricklin was chairman of Software Arts until 1985, the year that Software Arts was acquired by [[Lotus Development Corporation|Lotus]].<ref name=TK2.NYT/> He left and founded Software Garden.\n\n===Software Garden===\nDan Bricklin founded Software Garden, a small consulting firm and developer of software applications, in 1985. The company's focus was to produce and market “Dan Bricklin's Demo Program”.
