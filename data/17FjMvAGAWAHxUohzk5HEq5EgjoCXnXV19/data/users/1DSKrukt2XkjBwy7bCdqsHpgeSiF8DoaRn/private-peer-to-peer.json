This can be achieved by using a central server such as a [[Direct Connect (file sharing)#Hubs|Direct Connect hub]] to authenticate clients. Alternatively, users can exchange [[password]]s or [[key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] with friends to form a decentralized network. Private peer-to-peer systems can be divided into [[friend-to-friend]] (F2F) and group-based systems. Friend-to-friend systems only allow connections between users who know one another, but may also provide automatic anonymous forwarding. Group-based systems allow any user to connect to any other, and thus they cannot grow in size without compromising their users' privacy. Some software, such as [[WASTE]], can be configured to create either group-based or F2F networks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barroso|first=Ana|last2=Hollick|first2=Matthias|date=2015|title=Performance evaluation of delay-tolerant wireless friend-to-friend networks for undetectable communication|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/lcn.2015.7366356|journal=2015 IEEE 40th Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)|publisher=IEEE|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1109/lcn.2015.7366356|isbn=9781467367707|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Software list==\n*[[Direct Connect (file sharing)|Direct Connect]] - file sharing and chat using private hubs\n*[[GigaTribe]] - a private community-oriented file-sharing program\n*[[Retroshare]] - a private F2F system based on PGP, implementing [[Turtle F2F]] file sharing.\n\nThe following software titles have been discontinued.\n*Infinit - file sharing app with local encryption based on research made at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Towards a worldwide storage infrastructure|author=Julien Quintard|date=12 June 2012|url=http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/243442|accessdate=18 January 2015 }}</ref>\n*[[Madster]] (formerly Aimster) - early P2P software that used a buddy list to restrict sharing\n*[[Microsoft Office Groove|Groove]] - a corporate [[groupware]] software based on P2P technology\n*[[n2n]] - a peer-to-peer [[VPN]] software\n*[[Turtle F2F]] - instant messaging and file sharing with private connections only\n*[[WASTE]] - private P2P software suitable for groups of 10 to 50 users\n\n==See also==\n*[[Friend-to-friend]]\n*[[Darknet]]\n*[[LAN messenger]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.101.921 How to disappear completely: A survey of private peer-to-peer networks.] SPACE 2007 workshop, July 2007. \n*[http://www.furorteutonicus.eu/2012/02/25/comparison-of-p2p-file-sharing-tools-for-lan-parties/ Comparison of P2P file sharing tools for LAN parties.]\n\n{{File sharing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Private Peer-To-Peer}}\n[[Category:File sharing]]\n[[Category:Peer-to-peer]]",
