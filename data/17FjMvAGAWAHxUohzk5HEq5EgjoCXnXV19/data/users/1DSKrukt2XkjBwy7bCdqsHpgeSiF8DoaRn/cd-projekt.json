({{IPA-pl|ˌt͡sɛˈdɛ ˈprɔjɛkt|lang}}) is a Polish [[video game developer]], [[video game publisher|publisher]] and distributor based in [[Warsaw]], founded in May 1994 by Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński. Iwiński and Kiciński were video game retailers before they founded the company, which initially acted as a distributor of foreign video games for the domestic market. The department responsible for developing original games, '''CD Projekt Red''', best known for ''[[The Witcher (video game series)|The Witcher]]'' series, was formed in 2002. In 2008, CD Projekt launched the digital distribution service [[GOG.com]] (originally as Good Old Games).\n\nThe company began by translating major Western video-game releases into Polish, collaborating with [[Interplay Entertainment]] for two ''[[Baldur's Gate]]'' games. CD Projekt was working on the PC version of ''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance]]'' when Interplay experienced financial difficulties. The game was cancelled and the company decided to reuse the code for their own video game. It became ''[[The Witcher (video game)|The Witcher]]'', a video game based on the works of [[Andrzej Sapkowski]].\n\nAfter the release of ''The Witcher'', CD Projekt worked on a console port called ''The Witcher: White Wolf''; but [[development hell|development issues]] and increasing costs almost led the company to the brink of bankruptcy. CD Projekt later released ''[[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings]]'' in 2011 and ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]'' in 2015, with the latter winning various [[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year awards]]. The company's upcoming project is ''[[Cyberpunk 2077]]'', an open-world role-playing game based on the ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' tabletop game system, for which it opened a new division in [[Wrocław]].\n\nA video game distribution service, [[GOG.com]] was established by CD Projekt to help players find old games. Its mission is to offer games free of [[digital rights management]] (DRM) to players and its service was expanded to cover new [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA]] and independent games. The company opposes DRM in video games, and hopes that free [[downloadable content]] becomes an industry standard. CD Projekt considers maintaining their independence one of their most important strategies. By September 2017, it was the largest publicly traded video game company in Poland, worth about {{USD}}2.3 billion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wawro|first1=Alex|title=CD Projekt Red now worth over $2 billion|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/305196/CD_Projekt_Red_now_worth_over_2_billion.php|website=Gamasutra|accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref> It joined [[WIG20]], an index of the 20 largest companies on the [[Warsaw Stock Exchange]], in March 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gpw-index-changes-idUSKCN1GD5WR|title=Games developer CD Projekt to replace IT firm Asseco in Warsaw's...|date=1 March 2018|publisher=|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n==={{anchor|Prior to founding}}Founding===\n[[File:Marcin Iwiński.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Man in a T-shirt giving a talk|CD Projekt co-founder Marcin Iwiński in 2011]]\n\nCD Projekt was founded in May 1994 by Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński.<ref name=\"CD Projekt\">{{cite web|url=http://cdprojekt.com/company.asp?id=g_history|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120125534/http://cd/|title=» History|archivedate=20 November 2010|accessdate=6 January 2018|website=CD Projekt|deadurl=yes}}</ref> According to Iwiński, although he enjoyed playing video games as a child they were scarce in Poland (which was in the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Iron Curtain|sphere of influence]] at the time).

Iwiński and Kiciński founded CD Projekt in the [[calendar year|second quarter]] of 1994. With only $2,000, they used a friend's flat as a rent-free office.<ref name=\"PolyDev\"/><ref name=\"EuroGDev\"/>\n\n===Localization===\nWhen CD Projekt was founded, their biggest challenge was overcoming video game [[Copyright infringement|piracy]]. The company was one of the first in Poland to [[Internationalization and localization|localize]] games; according to Iwiński, most of their products were sold to \"mom-and-pop shops\". CD Projekt began partial localization for developers such as Seven Stars and Leryx-LongSoft in 1996, and full-scale localization a year later.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book|title=Video Games Around the World|page=416|author=Mark J. P. Wolf|ISBN=0262527162|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|date=15 May 2015}}</ref> According to Iwiński, one of their first successful localization titles was for ''[[Ace Ventura (video game)|Ace Ventura]]''; whereas previous localizations had only sold copies in the hundreds, ''Ace Ventura'' sold in the thousands, establishing the success of their localization approach.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/306897/Hear_how_CD_Projekt_Red_built_its_business_on_the_back_of_Ace_Ventura.php | title = Hear how CD Projekt Red built its business on the back of Ace Ventura | first = Alex | last = Wawro | date =  2 October 2017 | accessdate = 2 October 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> With their methods affirmed, CD Projekt approached [[BioWare]] and [[Interplay Entertainment]] for the Polish localization of ''[[Baldur's Gate]]''. They expected the title to become popular in Poland, and felt that no retailer would be able to translate the text from English to Polish. To increase the title's popularity in Poland, CD Projekt added items to the game's packaging and hired well-known Polish actors to voice its characters. Their first attempt was successful, with 18,000 units shipped on the game's release day (higher than the average shipments of other games at the time).<ref name=\"PolyDev\"/><ref name=\"EuroGDev\"/>\n\nThe company continued to work with Interplay after the release of ''Baldur's Gate'', collaborating on a PC [[Porting|port]] for the sequel ''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance]]''. To develop the port, CD Projekt hired Sebastian Zieliński (who had developed ''[[Mortyr 2093-1944]]'') and Adam Badowski. Six months after development began, Interplay experienced financial problems and cancelled the PC version. CD Projekt continued to localize other games after ''Dark Alliance'''s cancellation, and received Business Gazelle awards in 2003 and 2004.<ref name=\"cdp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gry-online.pl/polski-wydawca.asp?ID=288|title=CDP.pl / CD Projekt|work=Gry-Online|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n===CD Projekt Red===\n[[File:CD Projekt Red logo.svg|thumb|left|240px|alt=The words \"CD Projekt Red\" appear right of a red-and-black bird|CD Projekt Red's logo since May 2014]]\n\nEnthusiasm for game distribution ebbed, and CD Projekt's founders wondered if the company should continue as a distributor or a game developer after ''Dark Alliance''{{'}}s cancellation. With the game cancelled and its code owned by CD Projekt, the company planned to use them to develop their first original game.<ref name=\"PolyDev\"/><ref name=\"EuroGDev\"/> They intended to develop a game series based on Andrzej Sapkowski's ''[[Wiedźmin]]'' books (which were popular in Poland) and the author accepted the company's development proposal. The franchise rights had been sold to a Polish [[mobile game]] studio, but the studio had not worked on anything related to the franchise and CD Projekt acquired the rights to the ''Wiedźmin'' franchise. According to Iwiński, he and Kiciński had no idea how to develop a video game at that time.<ref name=\"EuroGDev\"/>\n\n{{quotebox|quote=CD Projekt Red created a demo in a year. \"It was a piece of crap,\" chuckles Adam Badowski. \"We tried to convince Marcin and Michal not to go on the first business trip with the demo, but they decided...\" to show it to a dozen publishers all around Europe on the most expensive and powerful laptop money could buy, Iwinski fills in. After two weeks of meetings we get two emails saying, in a very nice British way, \"It's not so good\". So pretty much: \"Boys, go home\". We were shattered. We were like, \"Oh my god we suck\".|source= — CD Projekt co-founder Marcin Iwiński, on publisher rejection of  the ''Witcher'' demo<ref name=\"EuroGDev\"/>|width=31%}}\nTo develop the game, the company formed a video-game development studio (CD Projekt Red Sp. z o.o., headed by Sebastian Zieliński) in [[Łódź]] on 2002. The studio made a demonstration game, which Adam Badowski called \"a piece of crap\" in retrospect. The demo was a role-playing game with a [[top-down perspective]], similar to ''Dark Alliance'' and ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'', and used the [[game engine]] which powered ''Mortyr''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-witcher-was-almost-a-diablo-clone-1706288641|title=The Witcher Was Almost A Diablo Clone|first=Patrick|last=Klepek|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=22 May 2015|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref> Iwiński and Kiciński pitched the demo to a number of publishers, without success. The Łódź office closed and the staff, except for Zieliński, moved to the Warsaw headquarters.<ref name=\"EuroGDev\"/>\n\nZieliński left the company, and Kiciński headed the project. Although the game's development continued, the demo was abandoned. According to CD Projekt, the development team had different ideas for the game and lacked overall direction; as a result, it was returned to the drawing board in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/26/the-witcher-was-nearly-a-diablo-inspired-top-down-arpg|title=The Witcher Was Nearly A Diablo Inspired Top-down ARPG|first=Vikki|last=Blake|work=[[IGN]]|date=26 May 2015|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/news/the-witcher-originally-developed-as-a-pointandclick-rpg-32945|title=The Witcher Originally Developed as a Point-and-Click RPG|first=Anthony|last=LaBella|work=[[Game Revolution]]|date=22 May 2015|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref> The team, unfamiliar with video-game development, spent nearly two years organising production.<ref name=\"Dev\"/> They received assistance from [[BioWare]], who helped promote the game at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo]] by offering CD Projekt space in their booth next to ''[[Jade Empire]]''.

The original 15-person development team expanded to about 100, at a cost of 20 million [[Polish złoty|złoty]]. According to Iwiński, content was removed from the game for budgetary reasons but the characters' personalities were retained; however, there was difficulty in translating the game's Polish text into English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/03/26/interview-cd-projekt-on-the-witcher/|title=RPS Interview: CD Projekt on The Witcher|first=Alec|last=Meer|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=26 March 2008|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref> [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] agreed to publish the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/02/05/atari-to-publish-the-witcher/|title=Atari to publish The Witcher|first=James|last=Ransom-Wiley |date=5 February 2007|accessdate=21 October 2015|work=[[Joystiq]]}}</ref> After five years of development,<ref name=\"Dev\"/> the game brought ''Wiedźmin'' to an international audience, and so the company came up with an English name: ''[[The Witcher (video game)|The Witcher]]''.
