The software was released in November 2012 under the [[MIT License|MIT license]].<ref name=\"busweek\">{{cite news|title=Bitmessage's NSA-Proof E-Mail|author=Max Raskin| newspaper=Business Week |date=2013-06-27 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-27/bitmessages-nsa-proof-e-mail}}</ref>\n\nBitmessage gained a reputation for being out of reach of warrantless wiretapping conducted by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) due to the decentralized nature of the protocol, and its encryption being difficult to crack. As a result, downloads of the Bitmessage program increased fivefold during June 2013 after news broke of classified email surveillance activities conducted by the NSA.<ref name=\"busweek\" />\n\nBitmessage has also been mentioned as an experimental alternative to email by ''[[Popular Science]]''<ref name=\"popsci\">{{cite news|title=What Are Your Options Now For Secure Email?|author=Dan Nosowitz| newspaper=Popular Science|date=2013-08-09|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-08/what-are-your-options-secure-email}}</ref> and [[CNET]].<ref name=\"cnet\">{{cite news|title=Gmail: You weren't really expecting privacy, were you?|author=Molly Wood|newspaper=CNet|date=2013-08-13|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31322_3-57598424-256/gmail-you-werent-really-expecting-privacy-were-you}}</ref>\n\nSome [[ransomware]] programs instruct affected users to use Bitmessage to communicate with the attackers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/chimera-ransomware-tries-turn-malware-victims-cybercriminals-2211638|title=Chimera Ransomware Tries To Turn Malware Victims Into Cybercriminals|date=2015-12-04|publisher=[[International Business Times]]}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://bitmessage.org/bitmessage.pdf Bitmessage: A Peer‐to‐Peer Message Authentication and Delivery System] (Jonathan Warren) - Bitmessage white paper\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official|https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page}}\n\n{{Cryptographic software}}\n\n[[Category:Cryptographic software]]\n[[Category:Free software programmed in Python]]\n[[Category:Email authentication]]\n[[Category:Internet privacy software]]\n[[Category:Open standards]]\n[[Category:Peer-to-peer software]]\n[[Category:Software using the MIT license]]\n[[Category:Tor hidden services]]",
