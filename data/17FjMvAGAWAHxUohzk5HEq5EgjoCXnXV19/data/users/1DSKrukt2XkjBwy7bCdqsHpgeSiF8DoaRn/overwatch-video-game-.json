Described as a \"[[hero shooter]],\" ''Overwatch'' assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a [[Characters of Overwatch|roster of over 30 characters]], known as \"heroes,\" each with a unique style of play that is divided into three general roles that fit their purpose. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory poses, as they play the game. The game was initially launched with casual play, with a competitive ranked mode, various 'arcade' game modes, and a player-customizable server browser subsequently included following its release. Additionally, Blizzard has added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, all free of charge, with the only additional cost to players being optional [[loot box]]es to earn cosmetic items.\n\n''Overwatch'' is Blizzard's fourth major franchise and came about following the 2014 cancellation of the ambitious [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''[[Titan (Blizzard Entertainment project)|Titan]]''. A portion of the ''Titan'' team came up with the concept of ''Overwatch'', based on the success of team-based first-person shooters like ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' and the popularity of [[multiplayer online battle arena]] games, creating a hero-based shooter that emphasized teamwork. Some elements of ''Overwatch'' borrow assets and concepts from the canceled ''Titan'' project. After establishing the narrative of an optimistic near-future Earth setting after a global crisis, the developers aimed to create a diverse cast of heroes that spanned genders and ethnicities as part of this setting. Significant time is spent adjusting the [[Balance (game design)|balance]] of the characters, making sure that new players would still be able to have fun while skilled players would present each other with a challenge.\n\n''Overwatch'' was unveiled at [[BlizzCon]] 2014 and was in a [[closed beta]] from late 2015 through early 2016. An open beta before release drew in nearly 10 million players. The release of the game was promoted with short animated videos to introduce the narrative and characters. ''Overwatch'' received universal acclaim from critics, who praised the game for its accessibility, diverse appeal of its hero characters, bright cartoonish art style, and enjoyable gameplay. Blizzard reported over {{USD|1 billion}} in revenue during the first year of its release and had more than 40 million players after two years. ''Overwatch'' is considered one of the [[greatest video games of all time]], receiving numerous [[game of the year]] awards and other accolades. The game is also a popular [[esport]], with Blizzard funding and producing the global [[Overwatch League]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{main|Gameplay of Overwatch|l1=Gameplay of ''Overwatch''}}\n[[File:Overwatch screenshot.png|thumb|right|A screenshot from ''Overwatch'' while in-match.

The game features several different game modes, principally designed around squad-based combat with two opposing teams of six players each. Players select one of over two dozen pre-made hero characters from one of three class types: Damage heroes that deal most of the damage to attack or defend control points, Tank heroes that can absorb a large amount of damage, and Support heroes that provide healing or other buffs for their teammates.{{efn|The game originally had four character classes prior to a June 2018 update, which combined the \"offense\" and \"defense\" classes into a single \"damage\" class.<ref name=\"gamespot patch1.25\">{{cite web| url =  https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-update-makes-for-friendlier-post-matches/1100-6460040/ | title =Overwatch Update Makes For Friendlier Post-Matches | first = Steve | last =Watts | date  = June 26, 2018 | accessdate = June 26, 2018 | work = [[Gamespot]] }}</ref>}} Each hero has a unique skill kit, defining their intrinsic attributes like [[health points]] and running speed, their primary attacks, several active and passive skills, and an ultimate ability that can only be used after it has been charged through dealing damage to enemies and healing allies. Players can change their hero during the course of a match, as a goal of ''Overwatch''{{'s}} design was to encourage dynamic team compositions that adapt to the situation. The game's genre has been described by some journalists as a \"[[hero shooter]],\" due to its design around specific heroes and classes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wood |first1=Austin |title=What the strange evolution of the hero shooter tells us about the genre's future |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/what-the-strange-evolution-of-the-hero-shooter-tells-us-about-the-genres-future/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wawro |first1=Alex |title=Hero Shooters: Charting the (re)birth of a genre |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/271933/Hero_Shooters_Charting_the_rebirth_of_a_genre.php |website=Gamasutra |accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe game features game modes for casual play, competitive ranked play, and for supporting [[esports]] competitions including Blizzard's [[Overwatch League]]. These modes generally are centered around sequentially securing control of points on the map, or escorting a payload between points on the map, with one team attacking while the other defends. Other modes set aside for casual matches include solo and team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and unique modes run during various [[Overwatch seasonal events|seasonal events]]. Regardless of winning or losing a match, players gain experience towards a player level, and on gaining a new level, receive [[loot box]]es that contain cosmetic items that they can use to customize the appearance of the hero characters but otherwise does not affect gameplay.

Humans developed robots with [[artificial intelligence]] called \"Omnics,\" which were put to use to achieve economic equality, and began to be treated as people in their own right. The Omnic Crisis began when the worldwide automated \"omnium\" facilities that produced them, started producing a series of lethal, hostile robots, that [[AI takeover|attacked humankind]]. The [[United Nations]] quickly formed Overwatch, an international task force to combat this threat and restore order.\n\nTwo veteran soldiers were put in charge of Overwatch: Gabriel Reyes and Jack Morrison. Though Overwatch successfully quelled the robotic uprising and brought many talented individuals to the forefront, a rift ended up developing between Reyes and Morrison, and Morrison became the leader of Overwatch while Reyes took charge of Blackwatch, Overwatch's covert operations division. Overwatch maintained peace across the world for several decades in what was called the \"Overwatch Generation\" as the team gained more members, but the rift between Morrison and Reyes intensified. Several allegations of wrongdoing and failures were leveled at Overwatch, leading to a public outcry against the organization and in-fighting between its members, prompting the UN to investigate the situation. During this, an explosion destroyed Overwatch's headquarters in [[Switzerland]], purportedly killing Morrison and Reyes among others. The UN passed the Petras Act, which dismantled Overwatch and forbade any Overwatch-type activity.\n\n''Overwatch'' is set six years after the Petras Act; without Overwatch, corporations have started to take over, fighting and [[terrorism]] have broken out in parts of the globe, and there are signs of a second Omnic Crisis occurring in Russia. A former member of Overwatch, the intelligent gorilla Winston, decides to begin reforming Overwatch to protect the peace once again despite the Petras Act, with the team members recruiting old friends and gaining new allies in their fight.<ref name=\"lore - overwatch returns\">{{cite web |last=Shaw |first=Olympia |url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/blog/20130523 |title=Overwatch is Back: Uncertainty and Hope After UN Confirms Vigilante Activity |work=PlayOverwatch |date=May 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718003509/https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/blog/20130523 |archivedate=July 18, 2016 |df=}}</ref> Thus it is also revealed that Reyes and Morrison were not killed in the explosion, that, in fact, was the result of a battle between them: Morrison became a masked vigilante known as \"[[Characters of Overwatch#Soldier: 76|Soldier: 76]]\", who is trying to uncover the reasons why Overwatch was shut down; while Reyes joined the criminal organization Talon and became \"[[Characters of Overwatch#Reaper|Reaper]]\", a terrorist disguised as [[Death (personification)|Death]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Jeff Kaplan.jpg|thumb|Lead director Jeff Kaplan.]]\n{{main|Development of Overwatch}}\n''Overwatch'' came about in the aftermath of Blizzard's decision to cancel the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''[[Titan (Blizzard Entertainment project)|Titan]]'' in 2013, a project that had been in development for about seven years. While most others assigned to the project were transferred to other departments within Blizzard, a small team of about 40 people, led by director [[Jeffrey Kaplan (game designer)|Jeff Kaplan]], were tasked to come up with a new concept for a game in a few months. After some brainstorming, they came onto the idea of a hero team-based shooter, building upon the success of games like ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' and [[multiplayer online battle arena]]s. They started with assets developed for ''Titan'' to demonstrate the proof-of-concept and were greenlit to build out the full game, the first new [[intellectual property]] that Blizzard had developed since ''[[StarCraft]]''.<ref name=\"eurogamer kaplan ama\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-03-14-blizzards-jeff-kaplan-traces-line-from-project-titan-to-overwatch |title=Blizzard's Jeff Kaplan traces line from Project Titan to Overwatch |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |date=March 14, 2017 |accessdate=March 14, 2017 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315001401/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-03-14-blizzards-jeff-kaplan-traces-line-from-project-titan-to-overwatch |archivedate=March 15, 2017 |df=}}</ref><ref name=\"polygon-titanoverwatch\">{{cite web |title=Overwatch includes pieces of Blizzard's canceled MMO Titan |url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/11/7/7175677/overwatch-titan-maps |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |first=Dave |last=Tach |accessdate=November 7, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108003547/http://www.polygon.com/2014/11/7/7175677/overwatch-titan-maps |archivedate=November 8, 2014 |df=}}</ref>\n\nThe intra-company experience of ''Titan''{{'s}} cancellation served to help drive the narrative and setting.

It was believed this came from the nature of the game that requires teamwork, and when teammates see players unwilling to switch to different heroes to balance the team or otherwise play for individual gains, this would cause the teammates to become angry and lash out at the player, become [[griefer]]s and throw the match, or other harmful behavior that would spread over time, particularly in the game's competitive mode. Players are able to report malicious users with in-game tools, and Blizzard can ban players for egregious actions, but they do not attempt to segregate out bad actors from the larger pool (a method used by other developers in multiplayer games), instead keeping an inclusive community for all non-banned players, which is believed to contribute to the growing toxicity.
