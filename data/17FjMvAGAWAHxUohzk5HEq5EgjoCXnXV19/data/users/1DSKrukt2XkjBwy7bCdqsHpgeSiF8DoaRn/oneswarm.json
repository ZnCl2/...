Although [[backward compatible]] with traditional [[BitTorrent client]]s, OneSwarm also includes new features designed to protect user privacy when sharing data among friends through creating a [[Distributed computing|distributed]] [[darknet]], so-called [[friend-to-friend]] sharing.\n\nOneSwarm is based on the Azureus ([[Vuze]]) [[BitTorrent client]].<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Friend-to-friend data sharing with OneSwarm\n |url         = http://oneswarm.cs.washington.edu/f2f_tr.pdf\n |format      = PDF\n |accessdate  = 2009-04-06\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090306130157/http://oneswarm.cs.washington.edu/f2f_tr.pdf\n |archivedate = 2009-03-06\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nOneswarm is still very much in [[Beta testing]], but its development started as far back as 2007 as a branch of the [[Vuze|Azureus]] codebase.\n\nFeature development and debugging has been slow in spite of its [[open-source software|open-source]] nature, but by 2010 the [[codebase]] was stable enough to support a nearly constant swarm of 200,000+ users.\n\nA separate ''Friends server'' codebase was developed in early 2009 to allow users to keep track of each other. So far very few ''Friends servers'' have been deployed by those involved with the technology.\n\n== Features ==\nFeatures of OneSwarm beyond the privacy aspects of the product: file search, sharing permissions, web UI with streaming, real-time transcoding, and remote access.\n\nTo provide privacy, OneSwarm uses source-address rewriting with [[multi-path routing]] and [[multi-source]] downloading.\n\n===Interface===\n\nOneSwarm's [[graphical user interface]] supports real-time transcoding of several video and audio formats. It is [[web-based]] and can perform in-browser playback, thus making it easier for casual users to adapt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oneswarm.org/about.html|title=OneSwarm - About|website=www.oneswarm.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Friend-to-friend]]\n* [[Retroshare]] \n* [[Anonymous P2P]]\n\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|www.oneswarm.org}}\n* [https://arstechnica.com/software/news/2009/02/oneswarm-friend-to-friend-p2p-likely-to-irk-big-content-isps.ars OneSwarm friend-to-friend P2P likely to irk Big Content, ISPs], ars technica (2009)\n* [http://www.betanews.com/article/OneSwarm-network-improves-filesharing-control-anonymity/1235464379/ OneSwarm network improves file-sharing control, anonymity], beta news (2009)\n* {{fr}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110920025251/http://www.darkswarm.fr/ French OneSwarm community : Darkswarm]\n* {{fr}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20130710152312/https://forum.oneswarm-fr.net/ French OneSwarm community : F2F-Fr]\n\n{{BitTorrent}}\n{{File sharing}}\n\n[[Category:Free BitTorrent clients]]\n[[Category:Free software programmed in Java (programming language)]]\n[[Category:Java platform software]]\n[[Category:BitTorrent clients for Linux]]\n[[Category:MacOS file sharing software]]\n[[Category:Windows file sharing software]]\n[[Category:Anonymous file sharing networks]]\n\n\n{{network-software-stub}}",
