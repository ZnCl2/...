The sample was divided into genuine necrophiles, who had a persistent attraction to corpses, and pseudo-necrophiles, who acted out of opportunity, sadism, or transient interest.  Of the total, 92% were male and 8% were female. 57% of the genuine necrophiles had occupational access to corpses, with morgue attendant, hospital orderly, and cemetery employee being the most common jobs. The researchers theorized that either of the following situations could be antecedents to necrophilia:<ref name=\"rosman\" />\n#The necrophile develops poor [[self-esteem]], perhaps due in part to a significant loss;\n#:(a) They are very fearful of rejection by others and they desire a sexual partner who is incapable of rejecting them; and/or\n#:(b) They are fearful of the dead, and transform their fear—by means of [[reaction formation]]—into a desire.\n#They develop an exciting fantasy of sex with a corpse, sometimes after exposure to a corpse.\n\nThe authors reported that, of their sample of genuine necrophiles:<ref name=\"rosman\" />\n*68% were motivated by a desire for an unresisting and unrejecting partner;\n*21% by a want for reunion with a lost partner;\n*15% by sexual attraction to dead people;\n*15% by a desire for comfort or to overcome feelings of isolation; and\n*12% by a desire to remedy low self-esteem by expressing power over a corpse.\n\nIQ data was limited, but not abnormally low. About half of the sample had a personality disorder, and 11% of true necrophiles were psychotic.

The act of necrophilia lasted for about 75 minutes, in which time, according to Moeliker, the living drake took two short breaks before resuming with copulating behavior.

The legal asset protected by such Article is not the corpse's objective honor, but the feeling of good memories, respect and veneration that living people keep about the deceased person: these persons are considered passive subjects of the corpse's violation.\n\n===India===\nSection 297 of the Indian Penal Code entitled \"Trespassing on burial places, etc.\", states as follows:<ref name=\"ipc\">{{cite web|url=http://mynation.net/ipc.htm#_Toc496765169 |title=The Indian Penal Code (IPC): Dowry Law Misuse (IPC 448) By Indian Women |publisher=Mynation.net |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Whoever, with the intention of wounding the feelings of any person, or of insulting the religion of any person, or with the knowledge that the feelings of any person are likely to be wounded, or that the religion of any person is likely to be insulted thereby,\ncommits any trespass in any place of worship or on any place of sculpture, or any place set apart from the performance of funeral rites or as a depository for the remains of the dead, or offers any indignity to any human corpse, or causes disturbance to any persons assembled for the performance of funeral ceremonies, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.</blockquote>\n\nAlthough sex with a corpse is not explicitly mentioned, a person who has sex with a corpse may be convicted under the above section.
