The central concern here being, these results can unduly play a prominent role in a person's online presence almost indefinitely if not removed.<ref name=Arthur/>\n\n==Conception and proposal==\nEurope's data protection legislation are intended to secure potentially damaging, private information about individuals. The notion of \"the right to be forgotten\" is derived from numerous preexisting European ideas. There is a longstanding belief in the United Kingdom, specifically under the [[Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974|Rehabilitation of Offenders Act]], that after a certain period of time, many criminal convictions are \"spent\", meaning that information regarding said person should not be regarded when obtaining insurance or seeking employment. Similarly, France values this right - le droit à l'oubli (the right to be forgotten).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/14/explainer-right-to-be-forgotten-the-newest-cultural-shibboleth|title=Explaining the 'right to be forgotten' – the newest cultural shibboleth|author=Charles Arthur|work=the Guardian}}</ref> It was officially recognized in French Law in 2010.<ref>{{Citation |year=2010 |title=Charte sur la publicité ciblée et la protection des internautes |trans-title=Code of Good Practice on Targeted Advertising and the Protection of Internet Users |publisher=Secrétariat d'Etat chargé de la Prospective et du Développement de l'économie numérique |url=http://www.huntonfiles.com/files/webupload/PrivacyLaw_Charte_publicite.pdf |format=PDF |language=FR}}</ref> Views on the right to be forgotten differ greatly between America and EU countries. In America, transparency, the right of free speech according to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and the right to know have typically been favored over the obliteration of truthfully published information regarding individuals and corporations. The term \"right to be forgotten\" is a relatively new idea, though on May 13, 2014, the European Court of Justice legally solidified that the \"right to be forgotten\" is a human right when they ruled against Google in the ''[[Google v González|Costeja]]'' case.\n\nIn 1995, the [[European Union]] adopted the [[Data Protection Directive|European Data Protection Directive]] (Directive 95/46/EC) to regulate the processing of personal data.<ref>Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.

However, Google purposely opted out of being classified as a \"media\" company and so is not protected. Judges in the European Union ruled that because the international corporation, Google, is a collector and processor of data it should be classified as a \"data controller\" under the meaning of the EU data protection directive. These \"data controllers\" are required under EU law to remove data that is \"inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant\", making this directive of global importance.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Current legal frameworks==\nThe right to be forgotten \"reflects the claim of an individual to have certain data deleted so that third persons can no longer trace them.\"<ref name=\"weber\">Weber, Rolf H. \"The right to be forgotten.\" More than a Pandora's Box 2 (2011)</ref>{{rp|121}} It has been defined as \"the right to silence on past events in life that are no longer occurring.\"<ref>Pino, G.

There is no global framework to allow individuals control over their online image. However, Professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, an expert from Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, said that Google can not escape compliance with the law of France implementing the decision of the European Court of Justice in 2014 on the right to be forgotten.

Researchers and authors behind Oblivion say that \"it is essential to develop techniques that at least partly automate this process and are scalable to internet size.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Oblivion helps the humans that operate the forms at Google ensure that ill-intending users cannot \"blacklist links to internet sources that do not affect them.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, tests have proven that Oblivion handles requests at a rate of 278 per second.<ref name=\":3\" /> The software allows Google, the government, and the user to work together to get content removed quickly and for just cause. In order to ensure that the program works quickly, is secure for its users and is impervious to fake take-down requests, Oblivion uses a three-part system.\n\nIn the first part, Oblivion requires a user to submit identification about themselves – not limited to \"name, age, and nationality.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Oblivion then enables a user to automatically find and tag his or her disseminated personal information using natural language processing and image recognition techniques and file a request in a privacy-preserving manner. Oblivion will scan the article for attributes that match information that has been submitted by the user. Second, Oblivion provides indexing systems with an automated and provable eligibility mechanism, asserting that the author of a request is indeed affected by an online resource. The author of a request is then issued an \"ownership token\"<ref name=\":3\" /> that confirms the articles they submitted for evaluation include sensitive personal information. The automated eligibility proof ensures censorship-resistance so that only legitimately affected individuals can request the removal of corresponding links from search results. In the third and last phase, this \"ownership token\" is submitted to Google, accompanied by the user's concerns as to what information should be deleted.<ref name=\":3\" /> Google's staff is then allowed to decide for themselves if they want to delete this information or not - but thanks to Oblivion, they know that the information in question is valid.\n\nResearchers with Oblivion, however, have noted that it comes with some limitations. The software is lacking a human element, therefore it cannot decide on its own \"whether or not a piece of information is public interest and should therefore not be removed from Google search results.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Researchers have conducted comprehensive evaluations, showing that Oblivion is suitable for large-scale deployment once it is fine-tuned.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Freedom of speech|Human rights|Internet}}\n* [[Accountability]]\n* [[Article 29 Working Party]]\n* [[Fundamental rights]]\n* ''[[Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja González]]''\n* [[Information privacy]]\n* [[International human rights law]]\n* [[Internet privacy]]\n* ''[[Martin v.
