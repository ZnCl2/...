Additionally, there is the Caribbean coast in the center and the [[Orinoco Delta|Orinoco River Delta]] in the east.\n\nThe territory now known as Venezuela was [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonized by Spain]] in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to [[First Republic of Venezuela|declare independence]] which was not securely established until 1821, when Venezuela was a department of the federal republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. It gained full independence as a separate country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional ''[[caudillo]]s'' (military strongmen) until the mid-20th century. Since 1958, the country has had a series of democratic governments. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to several political crises, including the deadly [[Caracazo]] riots of 1989, [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts|two attempted coups in 1992]], and the impeachment of President [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] for embezzlement of public funds in 1993. A collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 1998|1998 election]] of former coup-involved career officer [[Hugo Chávez]] and the launch of the [[Bolivarian Revolution]].  The revolution began with a [[1999 Constituent Assembly of Venezuela|1999 Constituent Assembly]], where a new Constitution of Venezuela was written. This new constitution officially changed the name of the country to ''República Bolivariana de Venezuela'' (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela).\n\nVenezuela is a [[federation|federal]] [[presidential republic]] consisting of [[States of Venezuela|23 states]], the [[Venezuelan Capital District|Capital District]] (covering [[Caracas]]), and [[Federal Dependencies of Venezuela|federal dependencies]] (covering Venezuela's offshore islands).

It has a total area of {{convert|916445|km2|abbr=on}} and a land area of {{convert|882050|km2|abbr=on}}, making Venezuela the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|33rd largest country in the world]]. The territory it controls lies between latitudes [[equator|0°]] and [[13th parallel north|13°N]] and longitudes [[59th meridian west|59°]] and [[74th meridian west|74°W]].\n\nShaped roughly like a triangle, the country has a {{convert|2800|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} coastline in the north, which includes numerous islands in the Caribbean and the northeast borders the northern Atlantic Ocean. Most observers describe Venezuela in terms of four fairly well-defined [[topography|topographical]] regions: the [[Maracaibo Basin|Maracaibo lowlands]] in the northwest, the northern mountains extending in a broad east-west arc from the Colombian border along the northern Caribbean coast, the wide plains in central Venezuela, and the [[Guiana Highlands]] in the southeast.\n\nThe northern mountains are the extreme northeastern extensions of South America's Andes mountain range. [[Pico Bolívar]], the nation's highest point at {{convert|4979|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, lies in this region. To the south, the dissected [[Guayana Region|Guiana Highlands]] contain the northern fringes of the Amazon Basin and [[Angel Falls]], the world's highest waterfall, as well as ''[[tepui]]s'', large table-like mountains. The country's center is characterized by the ''llanos'', which are extensive plains that stretch from the Colombian border in the far west to the Orinoco River [[river delta|delta]] in the east. The Orinoco, with its rich [[alluvium|alluvial soils]], binds the largest and most important [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|river system]] of the country; it originates in one of the largest [[drainage basin|watersheds]] in Latin America. The [[Caroní River (Venezuela)|Caroní]] and the [[Apure River|Apure]] are other major rivers.\n\nVenezuela borders Colombia to the west, Guyana to the east, and Brazil to the south. Caribbean islands such as Trinidad and Tobago, [[Grenada]], [[Curaçao]], [[Aruba]], and the [[Leeward Antilles]] lie near the Venezuelan coast. Venezuela has territorial disputes with Guyana, formerly United Kingdom, largely concerning the [[Guayana Esequiba|Essequibo area]] and with Colombia concerning the [[Gulf of Venezuela]]. In 1895, after years of diplomatic attempts to solve the border dispute, the dispute over the Essequibo River border flared up. It was submitted to a \"neutral\" commission (composed of British, American, and Russian representatives and without a direct Venezuelan representative), which in 1899 decided mostly against Venezuela's claim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/venezuela1895.htm |title=Venezuela Boundary Dispute, 1895–1899}}</ref>\n\nVenezuela's most significant natural resources are [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]], [[iron ore]], [[gold]], and other minerals.

These periods are referred to as hot-humid and cold-dry seasons.

Economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis which resulted in hundreds dead in the Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and impeachment of President Carlos Andrés Pérez for corruption in 1993. A collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, who had led the first of the 1992 coup attempts, and the launch of a \"Bolivarian Revolution\", beginning with a 1999 Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution of Venezuela.\n\nThe opposition's attempts to unseat Chávez included the 2002 Venezuelan ''coup d'état'' attempt, the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–2003, and the Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004, all of which failed. Chávez was re-elected in December 2006, but suffered a significant defeat in 2007 with the narrow rejection of the [[Venezuelan constitutional referendum, 2007]], which had offered two packages of constitutional reforms aimed at deepening the Bolivarian Revolution.\n\nTwo major blocs of [[List of political parties in Venezuela|political parties]] are in Venezuela: the incumbent leftist bloc United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), its major allies [[Fatherland for All]] (PPT) and the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV), and the opposition bloc grouped into the electoral coalition [[Mesa de la Unidad Democrática]]. This includes [[A New Era]] (UNT) together with allied parties [[Project Venezuela]], [[Justice First]], [[Movement for Socialism (Venezuela)|Movement for Socialism]] (MAS) and others. Hugo Chávez, the central figure of the Venezuelan political landscape since his election to the Presidency in 1998 as a political outsider, died in office in early 2013, and was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro (initially as interim President, before narrowly winning the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 2013]]).\n\n[[File:PalacioLegislativo2 fixed.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[National Assembly of Venezuela]] [[Palacio Federal Legislativo|building]]]]\nThe Venezuelan president is elected by a vote, with direct and [[universal suffrage]], and is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. The term of office is six years, and (as of 15 February 2009) a president may be re-elected an unlimited number of times. The president appoints the vice president and decides the size and composition of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and makes appointments to it with the involvement of the legislature. The president can ask the legislature to reconsider portions of laws he finds objectionable, but a simple parliamentary majority can override these objections.\n\nThe president may ask the National Assembly to pass an [[Enabling act#In Venezuela|enabling act]] granting the ability to [[rule by decree]] in specified policy areas; this requires a two-thirds majority in the Assembly. Since 1959, six Venezuelan presidents have been granted such powers.\n\nThe [[unicameral]] Venezuelan [[parliament]] is the ''Asamblea Nacional'' (\"National Assembly\"). The number of members is variable – each state and the Capital district elect three representatives plus the result of dividing the state population by 1.1% of the total population of the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ley Orgánica de Procesos Electorales|url=http://www.cne.gov.ve/web/normativa_electoral/ley_organica_procesos_electorales/titulo2.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929053531/http://www.cne.gov.ve/web/normativa_electoral/ley_organica_procesos_electorales/titulo2.php|archivedate=29 September 2010|publisher=Consejo Nacional Electoral|accessdate=4 April 2011|language=es}}</ref> Three seats are reserved for representatives of Venezuela's indigenous peoples.

The first two cultures were in turn differentiated according to the tribes. Acculturation and assimilation, typical of a cultural syncretism, caused an arrival at the current Venezuelan culture, similar in many respects to the rest of Latin America, although the natural environment means that there are important differences.\n\nThe indigenous influence is limited to a few words of vocabulary and gastronomy and many place names. The African influence in the same way, in addition to musical instruments like the drum. The Spanish influence was predominant (due to the colonization process and the socioeconomic structure it created) and in particular came from the regions of Andalusia and Extremadura, the places of origin of most settlers in the Caribbean during the colonial era. An example of this includes buildings, music, the Catholic religion, and language.\n\nSpanish influences are evident in bullfights and certain features of gastronomy. Venezuela was also enriched by other streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially from France. In the latest stage in the major cities and regions oil of U.S. origin and manifestations of the new immigration of Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, increasing the already complex cultural mosaic.
