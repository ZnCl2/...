Various legal systems and government agencies use different [[Anti-terrorism legislation|definitions of terrorism in their national legislation]]. Moreover, the [[international community]] has been slow to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding definition of this crime. These difficulties arise from the fact that the term \"terrorism\" is politically and emotionally charged.<ref name=\"Hoffman-1998-p32\">Hoffman (1998), p. 32, See review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html Inside Terrorism].</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://icct.nl/publication/radicalisation-de-radicalisation-counter-radicalisation-a-conceptual-discussion-and-literature-review/  | title=Radicalisation, De-Radicalisation, Counter-Radicalisation: A Conceptual Discussion and Literature Review | date=27 March 2013 | publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism – The Hague (ICCT) | access-date=6 September 2016}}</ref> In this regard, Angus Martyn, briefing the Australian parliament, stated,\n<blockquote>The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism.

Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus. In the first edition of his magisterial survey, 'Political Terrorism: A Research Guide,' Alex Schmid devoted more than a hundred pages to examining more than a hundred different definitions of terrorism in an effort to discover a broadly acceptable, reasonably comprehensive explication of the word. Four years and a second edition later, Schmid was no closer to the goal of his quest, conceding in the first sentence of the revised volume that the \"search for an adequate definition is still on\". Walter Laqueur despaired of defining terrorism in both editions of his monumental work on the subject, maintaining that it is neither possible to do so nor worthwhile to make the attempt.<ref>Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside Terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 34.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHoffman believes it is possible to identify some key characteristics of terrorism. He proposes that:\n[[File:Iraq-terrorist attack on buses.jpg|thumb|The [[Baghdad]] bus station was the scene of a triple [[17 August 2005 Baghdad bombings|car bombing in August 2005]] that killed 43 people.]]\n{{quote|By distinguishing terrorists from other types of criminals and terrorism from other forms of crime, we come to appreciate that terrorism is:\n* ineluctably political in aims and motives;\n* violent – or, equally important, threatens violence;\n* designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target;\n* conducted either by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure (whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia) or by individuals or a small collection of individuals directly influenced, motivated, or inspired by the ideological aims or example of some existent terrorist movement and/or its leaders;\nand\n* perpetrated by a subnational group or nonstate entity.<ref>Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside Terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 40.</ref>}}\n\nA definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the [[George C.

It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore. 'What is called terrorism,' Brian Jenkins has written, 'thus seems to depend on one's point of view. Use of the term implies a moral judgment; and if one party can successfully attach the label ''terrorist'' to its opponent, then it has indirectly persuaded others to adopt its moral viewpoint.' Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization ''terrorist'' becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned. If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism. If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism.<ref name=tws11jant5r4>{{cite news\n |author=Bruce Hoffman\n |authorlink=Bruce Hoffman\n |title=Inside Terrorism\n |quote=Google cached copy\n |publisher=Columbia University Press\n |isbn=0-231-11468-0\n |page=32\n |year=1998\n |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html\n |access-date=2010-01-11\n |deadurl=bot: unknown\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416230530/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html\n |archivedate=16 April 2009\n }}</ref><ref name=tws11jant5r555>{{cite news\n|author= Bruce Hoffman |authorlink= Bruce Hoffman\n|title= Inside Terrorism\n|newspaper= The New York Times\n|year= 1998\n|url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html\n|access-date= 2010-01-11\n}}</ref><ref name=tws11jangbbjj>{{cite news\n|author= Raymond Bonner\n|title= Getting Attention: A scholar's historical and political survey of terrorism finds that it works\n|quote= ''Inside Terrorism'' falls into the category of 'must read,' at least for anyone who wants to understand how we can respond to international acts of terror.\n|newspaper= The New York Times: Books\n|date= 1 November 1998\n|url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/01/reviews/981101.01bonnert.html\n|access-date= 2010-01-11\n}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Reagan sitting with people from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region in February 1983.jpg|thumb|President Reagan meeting with [[Afghan Mujahideen]] leaders in the Oval Office in 1983]]\nThe pejorative connotations of the word can be summed up in the [[aphorism]], \"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\".<ref name=tws11janbcvc /> This is exemplified when a group using [[irregular military]] methods is an ally of a [[Sovereign state|state]] against a mutual enemy, but later falls out with the state and starts to use those methods against its former ally.

This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism. Professor of [[Political Science]] Michael Stohl cites the examples that include the German [[The Blitz|bombing of London]], the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]], the British and American [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|firebombing of Dresden]], and the U.S. [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] during [[World War II]]. He argues that \"the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents.\" He also cites the [[first strike]] option as an example of the \"terror of coercive diplomacy\" as a form of this, which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using [[nuclear weapon]]s in \"crisis management\" and he argues that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II. In this analysis, state terrorism exhibited as a form of [[foreign policy]] was shaped by the presence and use of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], and the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this behavior by the state .<ref name=\"tws11jangbhh\">{{cite news\n|author= Michael Stohl\n|title= The Superpowers and International Terror\n|publisher= International Studies Association, Atlanta\n|date= 1 April 1984\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|author= Michael Stohl\n|title= Terrible beyond Endurance?

The type of conflict varies widely; historical examples include:\n* [[Secession]] of a territory to form a new sovereign state or become part of a different state\n* Dominance of territory or resources by various [[ethnic groups]]\n* Imposition of a particular form of government\n* Economic deprivation of a population\n* Opposition to a domestic government or occupying army\n* Religious fanaticism\n\n== Responses ==\n[[File:1080 Poisoning Scare At New World in Wellington.jpeg|thumb|180px|Sign notifying shoppers of increased surveillance due to a perceived increased risk of terrorism|left]]\nResponses to terrorism are broad in scope. They can include re-alignments of the [[political spectrum]] and reassessments of [[value system|fundamental values]].\n\nSpecific types of responses include:\n* [[Anti-terrorism legislation|Targeted laws, criminal procedures, deportations, and enhanced police powers]]\n* [[Target hardening]], such as locking doors or adding traffic barriers\n* Preemptive or reactive military action\n* Increased intelligence and surveillance activities\n* Preemptive humanitarian activities\n* More permissive interrogation and detention policies\n\nThe term \"[[counter-terrorism]]\" has a narrower connotation, implying that it is directed at terrorist actors.\n\n=== Response in the United States ===\n{{See also|War on Terror}}\n[[File:Backscatter large.jpg|thumb|[[Backscatter X-ray|X-ray backscatter technology]] ([[Advanced Imaging Technology|AIT]]) machine used by the [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] to screen passengers.

Republicans, typically follow what is known as the Bush Doctrine, advocate the military model of taking the fight to the enemy and seeking to democratize the Middle East. Democrats, by contrast, generally propose the law enforcement model of better cooperation with nations and more security at home.<ref name=ankony1>Ankony, Robert C., \"A New Strategy for America's War on Terrorism\", ''Patrolling'' magazine, 75th Ranger Regiment Association, Winter 2011, 56–57.</ref> In the introduction of the ''U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual'', Sarah Sewall states the need for \"U.S. forces to make securing the civilian, rather than destroying the enemy, their top priority. The civilian population is the center of gravity—the deciding factor in the struggle.... Civilian deaths create an extended family of enemies—new insurgent recruits or informants––and erode support of the host nation.\" Sewall sums up the book's key points on how to win this battle: \"Sometimes, the more you protect your force, the less secure you may be.... Sometimes, the more force is used, the less effective it is.... The more successful the counterinsurgency is, the less force can be used and the more risk must be accepted.... Sometimes, doing nothing is the best reaction.\"<ref>Sewall, Sarah, introduction to ''The U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, (2007).</ref> This strategy, often termed \"courageous restraint\", has certainly led to some success on the Middle East battlefield, yet it fails to address the central truth: the terrorists we face are mostly homegrown.<ref name=ankony1 />\n\n=== Terrorism research ===\nTerrorism research, also called terrorism and counter-terrorism research, is an interdisciplinary academic field which seeks to understand the causes of terrorism, how to prevent it as well as its impact in the broadest sense. Terrorism research can be carried out in both military and civilian contexts, for example by research centres such as the British [[Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence]], the [[Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies]], and the [[International Centre for Counter-Terrorism]] (ICCT). There are several academic journals devoted to the field.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tinnes | first1 = J | year = 2013 | title = 100 Core and Periphery Journals for Terrorism Research | url = http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/258 | journal = Perspectives on Terrorism | volume = 7 | issue = 2 }}</ref>\n\n== Mass media ==\n\n[[File:Plakat La Terroriste.jpg|thumb|''La Terroriste'', a 1910 poster depicting a female member of the [[Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party]] throwing a bomb at a Russian official's car.|left]]\nMass media exposure may be a primary goal of those carrying out terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media.

However, this may encourage organizations to perform more extreme acts of terrorism to be shown in the mass media. Conversely [[James F.

Law enforcement took out 40 percent.  Ten percent won.  Only 20 groups, 7 percent, were taken out by military force.\n\nForty-two groups became large enough to be labeled an insurgency; 38 of those had ended by 2006.  Of those, 47 percent converted to nonviolent political actors.  Only 5 percent were taken out by law enforcement.   26 percent won.  21 percent succumbed to military force.<ref>Jones and Libicki (2008, p. 101, Table 5.4)</ref> Jones and Libicki concluded that military force may be necessary to deal with large insurgencies but are only occasionally decisive, because the military is too often seen as a bigger threat to civilians than the terrorists.
