It has been designed to replace the [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] which was developed by Praetox Technologies and later released into the [[public domain]]. The security advisory for HOIC was released by Prolexic Technologies in February 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stateoftheinternet.com/resources-web-security-threat-advisories-2012-high-orbit-ion-cannon.html |title=High Orbit Ion Cannon (HOIC) Threat Advisory |publisher=stateoftheinternet.com |date=23 February 2012 |accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |publisher=[[Prolexic Technologies]] |via=[[PRWeb]] |title=Prolexic Issues Threat Advisory Outlining DDoS Protection Strategies for High Orbit Ion Cannon; Latest Stealth Attack Tool Targets Hundreds of URLs Simultaneously |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/2/prweb9221167.htm |date=23 February 2012 |accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\nHOIC was developed during the conclusion of [[Operation Payback]] by the [[hacktivism|hacktivist]] collective [[Anonymous (Group)|Anonymous]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://security.radware.com/knowledge-center/DDoSPedia/hoic-high-orbit-ion-cannon/|title=Definition of HOIC |publisher=radware.com |date=2012-09-27 |accessdate= 2015-04-18}}</ref> As [[Operation Payback]] concluded there was massive pressure on the group from law enforcement agencies, which captured and prosecuted more than 13 individuals connected with the group.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Curtis|first1=Sophie|title=Who are the most notorious hacking groups?|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet-security/11371524/Who-are-the-most-notorious-hacking-groups.html |accessdate=18 April 2015 |date=27 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Anonymous busted: 13 hacktivists indicted over Operation Payback |url=http://rt.com/usa/anonymous-operation-payback-indictment-704/|accessdate= 2015-04-18|date= 3 October 2013}}</ref> This forced many members of the group to rethink their strategies and subsequently this part of the group launched [[Operation Leakspin]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Sean |last=Bonner |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2010/12/09/anonymous-stops-drop.html |title=Anonymous Stops Drop |work=[[Boing Boing]] |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> However a large part of Anonymous remained focused on launching opt-in DDoS attacks. However the [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] was not powerful enough to launch attacks with such a limited number of users. Therefore, HOIC was designed to remedy this with the ability to cause [[HTTP Flood]] with a low number of user agents with as few as 50 users being required to successfully launch an attack, and co-ordination between multiple users leading to an exponential increase in the damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5883146/what-is-hoic|title=What is HOIC |publisher=Sam Biddle |date=18 February 2012 |accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/12/how-ddos-attacks-work-and-why-theyre-so-hard-to-stop/|title=How DDoS Attacks Work, And Why They're So Hard To Stop |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |first=Jason |last=Schreier |date=31 December 2014 |accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> HOIC was the first tool of its kind to have support for the so-called \"booster files\", configurable VBscript modules that randomize the [[HTTP headers]] of attacking computers, allowing thousands upon thousands of highly randomized combinations for user agents.<ref name=\"prolex120216\"/> Apart from allowing user agents to implement some form of randomization countermeasures the booster files can and have been used to increase the magnitude of the attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rsaconference.com/writable/presentations/file_upload/sec-w04_final.pdf |title=DDoS ATTACKS: MOTIVES, MECHANISMS AND MITIGATION |publisher=[[RSA Conference]] |first=Stephen |last=Gates |date=15 May 2013 |accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nHOIC and its predecessor, the [[LOIC]], are named after an [[ion cannon]], a fictional [[directed-energy weapon]] described as firing beams of [[ion]]s from a space-based platform onto Earth-based targets. Although ion cannons appear in many movies, television shows, and video games that have a science fiction-based setting, the ones depicted in the ''[[Command & Conquer (series)|Command & Conquer]]'' series of video games are considered to be the inspiration for the graphics on the software's GUI and website.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=AirDemon.net |title=Low Orbit Ion Cannon |via=[[Archive.org]] |url=http://www.airdemon.net/loic.html |date=27 September 2012 |accessdate=18 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927082809/http://www.airdemon.net/loic.html |archivedate=September 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Use ==\nSimply described, HOIC is a program for sending [[POST (HTTP)|HTTP POST]] and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request methods|GET]] requests at a computer under attack, that uses a [[lulz]]-inspired [[Graphical user interface|graphical interface]].<ref name=\"arstec120216\"/> HOIC primarily performs a [[Denial-of-service attack|denial-of-service (DoS) attack]] and a [[Distributed denial-of-service attack|DDoS attack]] when co-ordinated by multiple individuals. The [[Denial-of-service attack|denial-of-service (DoS) attack]] on the target URL is accomplished by sending excessive traffic in an attempt to overload the site and bring it down. This basic version of the attack can be customized by using the booster files which follow the [[Visual Basic|VB 6]] mixed with [[Visual Basic .NET|VB .NET]] syntax. In addition, HOIC can simultaneously attack up to 256 domains, making it one of the most versatile tools for hackers who are attempting to co-ordinate DDoS attacks as a group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/high-orbit-vs-low-orbit-ion-cannonglimps-some-hacking-techniques |title=Glimpse into some hacking techniques|publisher=Avkash K |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate= 2015-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe minimalist GUI of the tool makes it user friendly and easy to control. The basic routine of an attack is to input the URL of the website which is to be attacked, set the power option on low, medium or high. The power option sets the request velocity with low at two requests per second, medium at four and high at eight requests per second. Then a booster file is added which uses .hoic extension to define dynamic request attributes, launch attacks on multiple pages within the same website and help evade some defense filters. The attack is then launched by pressing the red button in the GUI labelled as \"Fire Teh Lazer\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barnett|first1=Ryan C|title=Web Application Defender's Cookbook: Battling Hackers and Protecting Users|date=  4 January 2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118417058|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=flC9dFFLWIsC&pg=PT346&dq=%22High+Orbit+Ion+Cannon%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wwUyVe3tB8vlaJCXgIAP&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22High%20Orbit%20Ion%20Cannon%22&f=false|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref>  [[File:HOIC TARGET.png|thumb|High Orbit Ion Cannon's interface for targeting a website for stressing]]\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe basic limitation of HOIC is that it requires a coordinated group of users to ensure that the attacks are successful. Even though it has allowed attacks to be launched by far fewer users than the older Low Orbit Ion Cannon, HOIC still requires a minimum of 50 users to launch an effective attack and more are required to sustain it if the target website has protection.<ref name=\"prolex120216\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.prolexic.com/kcresources/prolexic-threat-advisories/prolexic-threat-advisory-hoic-031212/Prolexic_Threat_Advisory_HOIC_A4_052612.pdf |title=Threat: High Orbit Ion Cannon v2.1.003 |publisher=[[Prolexic Technologies]] |date=16 February 2012 |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> Another limiting factor is the lack of anonymizing and randomizing capability. Even though HOIC should, in theory, offer anonymizing through the use of booster files, the actual protection provided is not enough. Furthermore, anonymizing networks such as TOR are not capable of handling the bandwidth of attacks generated by HOIC. Any attempt to launch an attack using the TOR network will actually harm the network itself.<ref name=\"arstec120216\">{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Gallagher |work=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Cond√© Nast]] |title=High Orbits and Slowlorises: understanding the Anonymous attack tools |url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2012/02/high-orbits-and-slowlorises-understanding-the-anonymous-attack-tools/2/ |date=16 February 2012 |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> However, Anonymous members routinely use proxy servers based in Sweden to launch their attacks. It has been speculated that this is due to the notion that Sweden may have stricter [[internet privacy]] laws than the rest of the world.<ref name=\"arstec120216\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Online Privacy Law: Sweden |url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/online-privacy-law/sweden.php|website=Law Library of Congress |accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Legality ==\nPrimarily, HOIC has been designed as a stress testing tool and can be lawfully used as such to stress test local networks and servers provided the person initiating the test has authorization to test and as long as no other networks, servers, clients, networking equipment or URLs are disrupted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcauthority.com.au/Feature/401392,hackers-kit-bag-the-tools-that-terrorise-the-internet.aspx|title=Hackers' kit bag: the tools that terrorise the internet|publisher=James H.

The [[Police and Justice Act 2006]] of [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]] amended the [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]], and specifically outlawed denial-of-service attacks and set a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.<ref>Espiner, Tom (November 10, 2006).
