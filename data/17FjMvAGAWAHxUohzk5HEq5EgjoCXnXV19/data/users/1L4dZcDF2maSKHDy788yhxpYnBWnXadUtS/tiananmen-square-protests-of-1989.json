The [[Chinese economic reform|reforms of the 1980s]] had led to a nascent [[market economy]] which benefitted some people but seriously disaffected others; the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included [[inflation]], limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy, and restrictions on political participation. The students called for [[democracy]], greater accountability, [[freedom of the press]], and [[freedom of speech]], though they were loosely organized and their goals varied.<ref name=\"nathan\">{{cite web|first=Andrew J. |last=Nathan |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010101faessay4257-p0/andrew-j-nathan/the-tiananmen-papers.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040706113745/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010101faessay4257-p0/andrew-j-nathan/the-tiananmen-papers.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 6, 2004 |title=The Tiananmen Papers |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] |date=January–February 2001 |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |df= }}</ref><ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB16/documents/index.html Tiananmen Square, 1989: ''The Declassified History'']; George Washington University</ref> At the height of the protests, about 1 million people assembled in the Square.<ref name=\"zhao171\" />\n\nAs the protests developed, the authorities veered back and forth between conciliatory and hardline tactics, exposing deep divisions within the party leadership.<ref name=\"Saich\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=T-hxw0-d05gC&pg=PA121 Anthony Saich, ''The People's Movement: Perspective on Spring 1989''] M.E.

Events named by date in Chinese are conventionally named by the number of the month and the date, followed by the type of event. Thus, the common Chinese name for the crackdown on the 1989 massacre, is \"{{lang|zh|六四事件}}\" (June Fourth Incident), literally \"Six\" \"Four\" \"Incident\" (\"{{lang|zh|{{linktext|六}}}}\" means \"six\", \"{{lang|zh|{{linktext|四}}}}\" means \"four\", \"{{lang|zh|{{linktext|事件}}}}\" means \"incident\"). The nomenclature of the former is consistent with the customary names of the other two great protests that occurred in Tiananmen Square: the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919, and the [[Tiananmen Incident|April Fifth Movement]] of 1976. \"June Fourth\" refers to the day on which the People's Liberation Army cleared Tiananmen Square of protesters, although actual operations began on the evening of June 3. Names such as '''June Fourth Movement''' ({{zh |s = 六四运动 |p = Liù-Sì Yùndòng}}) and '''{{'}}89 Democracy Movement''' ({{zh|labels=no |s =八九民运 |p = Bā-Jiǔ Mínyùn}}) are used to describe the event in its entirety.\n\nOutside mainland China, and among circles critical of the crackdown within mainland China, it is commonly referred to in Chinese as '''June Fourth Massacre''' ({{zh|labels=no |s = 六四屠杀 |p = Liù-Sì Túshā }}) and '''June Fourth Crackdown''' ({{zh|labels=no |s = 六四镇压 |p = Liù-Sì Zhènyā }}). To bypass [[internet censorship in China]], which uniformly considers all the above-mentioned names too 'Sensitive' for search engines and public forums, alternative names have sprung up to describe the events on the Internet, such as May&nbsp;35th, VIIV ([[Roman numerals]] for 6 and 4) and \"Eight Squared\" (i.e., 8<sup>2</sup> = 64).<ref name=\"TheAge\">{{cite news |url = http://www.theage.com.au/world/china-tightens-information-controls-for-tiananmen-anniversary-20090604-bvxf.html |title = China tightens information controls for Tiananmen anniversary |agency = Agence France-Presse |date=June 4, 2009 |work=The Age |location=Australia |accessdate=November 3, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[government of the People's Republic of China]] have used numerous names for the event since 1989, gradually reducing the intensity of terminology applied.<ref name=\"vog\">{{cite book |last = Vogel |first = Ezra F. |title = Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China |year = 2011 |publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-05544-6 |page = 634 |id =   }}</ref> As the events were unfolding, it was labelled a \"counterrevolutionary riot\", which was later changed to simply \"riot\", followed by \"political storm\", and finally the leadership settled on the more neutralized phrase \"political turmoil between the Spring and Summer of 1989\", which it uses to this day.<ref name=\"vog\" /><ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/editorial/the-day-china-trampled-on-freedom/2009/05/29/1243456737644.html |title = The day China trampled on freedom |date=May 30, 2009 |work=The Age |location=Australia |accessdate=November 3, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn English, the terms '''Tiananmen Square Massacre''', '''Tiananmen Square Protests''' or '''Tiananmen Square Crackdown''' are often used to describe the series of events. However, much of the violence did not actually happen in Tiananmen, but outside the square in the city of Beijing near the [[Muxidi]] area.<ref name=\"miles\" /> The term also gives a misleading impression that demonstrations only happened in Beijing, when in fact they occurred in many cities throughout China.<ref name=\"miles\" /> (Examples include [[Chengdu]] from the account of Louisa Lim's ''[[The People's Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen Revisited|The People's Republic of Amnesia]]'').<ref>{{Cite book|title = People's Republic of Amnesia|last = Lim|first = Louisa|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0190227913|location = |page = 183}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n{{History of the People's Republic of China}}\n[[File:Deng Xiaoping picture.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as Mao's successor in 1978 and launched the [[Chinese economic reform|comprehensive economic reforms]]]]\n\nThe [[Cultural Revolution]] ended with chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976. The movement, spearheaded by Mao, caused severe damage to the country's economic and social fabric. The country was mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the Communist Party itself. At the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee]] in December 1978, [[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's [[Paramount leader|''de facto'' leader]]. Deng launched a comprehensive [[Chinese economic reform|program to reform the Chinese economy]]. Within several years, the country's direction entirely changed. The focus on ideological purity was replaced by a full-on drive to achieve material prosperity.\n\nTo run his reform agenda, Deng promoted his allies to top government and party posts. [[Hu Yaobang]] was appointed the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] in February 1980, and [[Zhao Ziyang]] was named as [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]] in September.\n\n=== Challenges with reform ===\nThe reforms aimed to decrease the role of the state in the economy and gradually introduced private forms of production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had de-collectivized and 80% of state owned enterprises were permitted to retain profits. Within a few years, production increased by leaps and bounds, and poverty was reduced substantially.\n\nWhile the reforms were generally well received by the public, concerns grew over a series of social problems that the changes brought about, including [[Corruption in China|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] by elite party bureaucrats.<ref>Naughton, B. p. 91.</ref> The state-mandated pricing system, in place since the 1950s, had long kept prices stable at low levels. The initial reforms created a two-tier system where some prices were fixed while others were allowed to fluctuate. In a market with chronic shortages, this allowed people with powerful connections to buy goods at low prices and sell at market prices.<ref name=autogenerated2>''Silenced Scream: a Visual History of the 1989 Tiananmen Protests''. Donna Rouviere Anderson, Forrest Anderson. p. 1</ref> In addition, the money supply had expanded too fast. At least a third of factories were unprofitable. The government tightened the money supply in 1988, leaving much of the economy without loans.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nFollowing the 1988 [[Beidaihe]] meeting, the party leadership under Deng agreed to a transition to a market-based pricing system.<ref name=\"Dingxin Zhao 2001. p. 127\">Dingxin Zhao.

Inflation soared. Official indices report that the [[Consumer Price Index]] increased 30% in Beijing between 1987 and 1988, leading to panic among salaried workers that they could no longer afford staple goods.<ref name=vog600>Vogel, E. 600–01</ref> Moreover, in the new market economy, unprofitable [[state-owned enterprise]]s were pressured to cut costs. This threatened a vast proportion of the population which relied on the \"[[iron rice bowl]]\", i.e. a host of social benefits such as job security, medical care and subsidized housing.<ref name=vog600/><ref>Wang, Hui, Thomas Huters ed.

(University enrollment increased from 625,319 in 1977 to 2,065,923 in 1988)</ref> the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased market demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 84</ref> The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 82</ref> Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered on the basis of [[nepotism]] and favoritism.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 89.</ref> Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in their area of jurisdiction.<ref name=vog600/> Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues. Small study groups, such as the \"Democracy Salon\" and the \"Lawn Salon\" (''Caodi Shalong''), began appearing on Beijing university campuses.<ref>Zhao D. p. 137.</ref> These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically.<ref name=\"Dingxin Zhao 2001. p. 127\"/>\n\nAt the same time, the party's nominally socialist ideology faced a legitimacy crisis as it gradually adopted capitalist practices.<ref name=\"Wang, H. p. 57\">Wang, H. p. 57</ref> Private enterprise gave rise to profiteers who took advantage of lax regulations, and who often flaunted their wealth in front of those who were less well off.<ref name=vog600/> Popular discontent was brewing over unfair wealth distribution. Greed, not skill, appeared to be the most crucial factor of success. There was widespread public disillusionment over the country's future. People wanted change, yet the power to define 'the correct path' continued to rest solely in the hands of the unelected government.<ref name=\"Wang, H. p. 57\"/>\n\nThe comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over the pace of [[marketization]] and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers (\"the right\", led by [[Hu Yaobang]]) favoured political liberalization and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent, and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives (\"the left\", led by [[Chen Yun]]) said that the reforms had gone too far, and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. Both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.<ref name=ghp>{{cite web|title=The Gate of Heavenly Peace|url=http://tsquare.tv/film/transcript.html|publisher=Long Bow Group Inc. in collaboration with ITVS|year=1995|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== 1986 student demonstrations ===\n{{Main article|1986 Chinese Student Demonstrations}}\nIn mid-1986, astrophysics professor [[Fang Lizhi]], who had returned from a  position at [[Princeton University]], began a personal tour around universities in China, speaking about liberty, human rights, and [[separation of powers]]. Fang was part of a wider undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution were a direct result of the authoritarian political system and the rigid command economy.<ref>Zhao, D. pp. 64, 215</ref> The view that political reform was the only answer to China's on-going problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated all over the country.<ref name=autogenerated3>Standoff at Tiananmen (2009). Eddie Cheng. p. 33</ref>  In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems, while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nInspired by Fang and other 'people-power' movements around the world, in December 1986, student demonstrators staged protests against the slow pace of reform. The issues were wide-ranging, and included demands for economic liberalization, democracy, and rule of law.<ref>Wang, Hui, Thomas Huters ed. ''China's New Order: Society, Politics, and Economy in Transition''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-674-02111-8}}. pp. 56–7.</ref> While the protests were initially contained in [[Hefei]], where Fang lived, they quickly spread to Shanghai, Beijing and other major cities. This alarmed the central leadership, who accused the students of instigating Cultural Revolution-style turmoil.\n\nGeneral secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] was blamed for taking a soft attitude and mishandling the protests, thus undermining social stability. He was denounced thoroughly by conservatives. Hu was forced to resign as general secretary on January 16, 1987.

Within days, most posters were writing about broader political issues, such as freedom of the press, democracy, and corruption.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 147</ref>\nSmall spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on April 15 around [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] at [[Tiananmen Square]]. On the same day, many students at [[Peking University]] (PKU) and [[Tsinghua University]] erected shrines, and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion. Organized student gatherings also began on a small scale in [[Xi'an]] and Shanghai on April 16. On April 17, students at the [[China University of Political Science and Law]] (CUPL) made a large [[wreath]] to commemorate Hu Yaobang. Its laying-party was on April 17 and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 148</ref> At 5 pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the [[Great Hall of the People]], near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu. The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds giving public orations commemorating Hu and discussing social problems. However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the operation of the Great Hall, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.\n\nStarting on the night of April 17, three thousand PKU students marched from the campus towards Tiananmen Square, and soon nearly a thousand students from Tsinghua joined. Upon arrival, they soon joined forces with those already gathered at the Square. As its size grew, the gathering gradually evolved into a protest, as students began to draft a list of pleas and suggestions (''Seven Demands'') for the government:\n\n#Affirm Hu Yaobang's views on democracy and freedom as correct;\n#Admit that the campaigns against [[Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign|spiritual pollution]] and bourgeois liberalization had been wrong;\n#Publish information on the income of state leaders and their family members;\n#Allow privately run newspapers and stop press censorship;\n#Increase funding for education and raise intellectuals' pay;\n#End restrictions on demonstrations in Beijing\n#Provide objective coverage of students in official media.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=}}<ref>Zhao D. p. 148</ref>\n\nOn the morning of April 18, students remained in the Square. Some gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes singing patriotic songs and listening to impromptu speeches by student organizers, others gathered at the Great Hall. Meanwhile, a few thousand students gathered at [[Xinhua Gate]], the entrance to [[Zhongnanhai]], the seat of the party leadership, where they demanded dialogue with the leadership. Police restrained the students from entering the compound. Students then staged a [[sit-in]].\n\nOn April 20, most students had been persuaded to leave Xinhua Gate. To disperse about 200 students that remained, police used batons; minor clashes were reported. Many students felt abused by the police, and rumours about police brutality spread quickly. This incident angered students on campus, where those who were not politically active decided to join the protests.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 149</ref> Also on this date, a group of workers calling themselves the \"[[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]]\" issued two handbills challenging the central leadership.<ref>Walder, Andrew W., and Gong Xiaoxia. \"Workers in the Tiananmen Protests: The Politics of the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation.\" ''Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs'', no. 29, January 1993. pp. 1–2.

On the evening of April 21, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, ignoring orders from Beijing municipal authorities that the Square was to be closed off for the funeral. The funeral, which took place inside the Great Hall and attended by the leadership, was broadcast live to the students. General secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] delivered the eulogy. The funeral seemed rushed, and only lasted 40 minutes, as emotions ran high in the Square. Students wept.<ref name=ghp/><ref>Zhao, D. pp. 152–3</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Li|first=Peng|title=Li Peng Diary: The Critical Moments|year=2010|publisher=Au Ya Publishing|location=Hong Kong|isbn=1-921815-00-0|chapter=21 April Entry}}</ref>\n\nSecurity cordoned off the east entrance to the Great Hall, but several students pressed forward. Three of these students knelt on the steps of the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier [[Li Peng]].<ref name=\"Zhao153\">Zhao, D. p. 153</ref> However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a class boycott.<ref name=\"Zhao153\"/>\n\nFrom April 21 to 23, students began organizing under the banners of formal organizations. On April 23, the \"[[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]]\" (also known as \"the Union\") was formed. It elected CUPL student [[Zhou Yongjun]] as chair; [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] and [[Wu'erkaixi]] also emerged as leaders. From this vantage point, the Union called for a general class boycott at all Beijing universities. Such an independent organization operating outside of party jurisdiction alarmed the leadership.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 154</ref>\n\nOn April 22, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in [[Changsha]] and [[Xi'an]]. In Xi'an, arson from rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate. In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities. In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government. As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government.<ref name=\"zzy\">{{cite book |last=Zhao |first=Ziyang |title=Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang |year=2009 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=1-4391-4938-0 |chapter=The origins of the 1989 Student Movement}}</ref> Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action.

On April 24, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] and mayor [[Chen Xitong]] to gauge the situation at the Square. The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis, and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and major party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed that firm action against protesters must be taken.<ref name=\"liu\" /> On the morning of April 25, President [[Yang Shangkun]] and Premier [[Li Peng]] met with Deng at the latter's residence. Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate 'warning' must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations.<ref name=vog603>Vogel, E. pp. 603–6</ref> The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests from the leadership, and highlighted Deng's having 'final say' on important issues. Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials in an effort to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.\n\nOn April 26, the party's official newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' issued a front-page editorial titled \"[[April 26 Editorial|It is necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances]].\" The language in the editorial effectively branded the student movement to be an anti-party, anti-government revolt.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2005-02/23/content_2609426.htm |archive-url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20060424034105/http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2005-02/23/content_2609426.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 24, 2006 |title=Full text of the April 26 Editorial |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=February 23, 2005 |df= }}</ref> The article enraged students, who interpreted it as a direct indictment on the protests and its cause.

On April 29, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman [[Yuan Mu]] ([[:zh:袁木|袁木]]) met with appointed representatives of government-sanctioned student associations. While the talks discussed a wide range of issues, including the editorial, the Xinhua Gate incident, and freedom of the press, they achieved few substantive results. Independent student leaders such as Wuer Kaixi refused to attend.<ref name=\"zhd157\">Zhao, D. p. 157.</ref>\n\nThe government's tone grew increasingly conciliatory as Zhao Ziyang returned from [[Pyongyang]] on April 30 and resumed his executive authority. In Zhao's view, the hardliner approach was not working, and concession was the only alternative.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 156</ref> Zhao asked that the press be opened to report the movement positively, and delivered two sympathetic speeches on 3–4 May. In the speeches, Zhao said that the student's concerns about corruption were legitimate, and that the student movement was patriotic in nature.<ref name=\"Vogel, E. p.608\">Vogel, E. p. 608.</ref> The speeches essentially negated the message presented by April 26 Editorial. While some 100,000 students marched on the streets of Beijing on 4 May to commemorate the [[May Fourth Movement]] and repeat demands from earlier marches, many students were satisfied with the government's concessions. On 4 May, all Beijing universities except PKU and BNU announced the end of the class boycott.

After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, factional tensions, between the progressive camp and the conservative camp, intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.<ref name=\"Vogel, E. p.608\"/>\n\nIn preparation for dialogue, the Autonomous Student Union elected representatives to a formal Dialogue Delegation. However, the Union leaders were reluctant to let the Delegation unilaterally take control of the movement.<ref name=zhao161>Zhao, D. p. 161.</ref> Facing internal discord and declining engagement from the student body at large, a group of charismatic leaders, including Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi, called for more radical measures to regain momentum. They believed that the government's 'dialogue' was merely a way to trick the students into submission. They began mobilizing students for a hunger strike on 11 May.<ref name=\"zhao161\" />\n\n=== Hunger strikes begin ===\n{{Main article|The Students' Hunger Strike of the 1989 Tiananmen Protests}}\n[[File:蒲志強19890510.jpg|thumb|A photo of [[Pu Zhiqiang]], a student protester at Tiananmen, taken on 10 May 1989]]\nStudents began the hunger strike on 13 May, two days before the highly publicized [[state visit]] by Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Knowing that the welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev was scheduled to be held on the Square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike there to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought.<ref name=\"vogel612\">Vogel, E. pp. 612–4.</ref> By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.<ref name=\"Zhao, D. p.167\">Zhao, D. p. 167.</ref>\n\nInspired by the course of events in Beijing, protests and strikes began at universities in other cities, with many students traveling to Beijing to join the demonstration. Generally, the demonstration at Tiananmen Square was well-ordered, with daily marches of students from various Beijing-area colleges displaying their solidarity with the class boycott and with the demands of the protest. The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'', the world socialist anthem, on their way to, and at, the square.<ref>[[Amnesty International]] (August 30, 1989). ''Preliminary Findings on Killings of Unarmed Civilians, Arbitrary Arrests and Summary Executions Since June 3, 1989''. p. 19.</ref>\n\nAfraid that the movement would spin out of control, Deng Xiaoping asked that the Square be cleared for Gorbachev's visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao again used a soft approach, and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately.<ref name=\"vogel612\" /> Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism, and that the students understood signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation (not just the government). On the morning of 13 May, [[Yan Mingfu]], head of the Communist Party's [[United Front (China)|United Front]], called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Chen Ziming]] and [[Wang Juntao]].<ref>Zhao, D. p. 164.</ref> Yan said the government was prepared to hold immediate dialogue with student representatives, but that the Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be cancelled whether the students withdraw or not—in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.<ref name=\"Zhao, D. p.165\">Zhao, D. p. 165.</ref>\n\n=== Gorbachev visit ===\n{{Main article|1989 Sino-Soviet Summit}}\n\nPress restrictions were loosened significantly during early to mid May. State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers. On 14 May, intellectuals led by [[Dai Qing]] gained permission from [[Hu Qili]] to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals on ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]''. The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the Square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict.<ref name=\"Zhao, D. p.167\" /> However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government, and refused to move. That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by [[Shen Tong]] and Xiang Xiaoji. Yan affirmed the patriotic nature of the student movement and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the Square.<ref name=\"Zhao, D. p.165\"/> While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership. Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 169</ref> Yan then personally went to the Square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage.<ref name=ghp/> Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the April 26 editorial and re-branding the movement as \"patriotic and democratic\"; Li refused.<ref>Li, Peng. Diary entry for 15 May.</ref>\n\nThe students remained in the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, the first of its kind in [[Sino-Soviet split|some 30 years]], marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. However, its smooth proceedings was derailed by the student movement; according to one scholar, this embarrassed the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 170</ref> The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the [[Great Hall of the People]] amid the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square.<ref name=vogel612/> When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told him, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. The statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.<ref name=vogel612/>\n\n=== Gathering momentum ===\nThe hunger strike galvanized support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from May 17-18. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials.<ref name=\"zhao171\">Zhao, D. p. 171.</ref> Many grassroots Party and [[Communist Youth League|Youth League]] organizations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate.<ref name=zhao171/> In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng in support of students. The [[Red Cross Society of China|Chinese Red Cross]] issued a special notice and sent in a large number of personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the Square. After the departure of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, giving the movement international spotlight. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.\n\nThe movement, on the wane at the end of April, now regained significant momentum. By 17 May, as students from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of varying sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities did not know how to respond. Because the demonstrations now included a wide array of social groups, each carrying its own set of grievances, it became increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate, and what the demands were. The government, still split on how to deal with the movement, saw its authority and legitimacy gradually erode as the hunger strikers took the limelight and gained widespread sympathy.<ref name=zhao171/> These combined circumstances put immense pressure on the authorities to act, and martial law was discussed as a viable response.<ref name=zhao181>Zhao, D. p. 181</ref>\n\nThe situation seemed intractable, so the weight of taking decisive action fell on paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.

Deng presided over the meeting and said that martial law was the only option. At the meeting Deng declared that he was 'mistaken' in choosing Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang as his successors, and resolved to remove Zhao from his position as general secretary.

In many cases, these were supported by the universities' Party committees. [[Jiang Zemin]], then-Municipal Party Secretary, addressed the student protesters in a bandage and 'expressed his understanding', as he was a former student agitator before 1949. At the same time, he moved swiftly to send in police forces to control the streets and to purge Communist Party leaders who had supported the students.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nOn April 19, the editors of the ''[[World Economic Herald]]'', a magazine close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu.

Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, [[Jiang Zemin]] demanded that the article be censored. Many newspapers were printed with a blank page.<ref>Kate Wright, \"The Political Fortunes of the World Economic Herald\", ''Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs'', nr 23, pp 121–132 (1990)</ref> Jiang then suspended Qin Benli.

He was convicted in 1992 of \"revealing state secrets and counter-revolutionary propagandizing\" and served seven years in prison. To purge sympathizers of Tiananmen demonstrators among the party's rank-and-file, the party leadership initiated a one-and-a-half-year-long rectification program to \"deal strictly with those inside the party with serious tendencies toward bourgeois liberalization\". Four million people were reportedly investigated for their role in the protests.

State media reports in the immediate aftermath were sympathetic to the students. As a result, those responsible were all later removed from their posts. Two news anchors [[Xue Fei (host)|Xue Fei]] and [[Du Xian (news anchor)|Du Xian]], who reported this event on June 4 in the daily ''[[Xinwen Lianbo]]'' broadcast on [[China Central Television]] were fired because they displayed sad emotions. Wu Xiaoyong, the son of former foreign minister [[Wu Xueqian]] was removed from the English Program Department of [[Chinese Radio International]], ostensibly for his sympathies towards protesters. Editors and other staff at ''[[People's Daily]]'', including director [[Qian Liren]] and Editor-in-Chief Tan Wenrui, were also sacked because of reports in the paper which were sympathetic towards the protesters.

In its aftermath, many of the freedoms introduced during the 1980s were rescinded, as the party returned to a conventional Leninist mold and re-established firm control over the press, publishing, and mass media. The protests were also a blow to the 'separation of powers' model established by the 1982 Constitution and by convention, whereby the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] was a symbolic position ([[figurehead]]), and the real centres of power of the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of the State Council]] and the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] were [[Separation of powers|intended to be different people]], to prevent the excesses of Mao-style personal rule. \n\nHowever, when President [[Yang Shangkun]] asserted his [[reserve powers]] with his post of [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] and openly split with general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] over the use of force to side with Premier [[Li Peng]] and Central Military Commission chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]], official policy became inconsistent and incoherent, significantly impeding the exercise of power. In 1993, the positions of General Secretary, Central Military Commission Chairman and President were all consolidated into the same office, reverting to the previous Maoist distribution of power that had previously existed since 1972.\n\nIn 1989, neither the Chinese military nor the Beijing police had sufficient anti-riot gear, such as rubber bullets and tear gas.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9906/02/tiananmen/MacKinnon/zhu.muzhi.html Chinese human rights official says the crackdown 'completely correct'] Rebecca MacKinnon, \"Tiananmen Ten Years Later.\" CNN, June 2, 1999.</ref> After the Tiananmen Square protests, riot police in Chinese cities were equipped with non-lethal equipment for riot control. The protests led to increased spending on internal security and expanded the role of the People's Armed Police in suppressing urban protests.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe aftermath of the protests saw the resurgence of conservative attitudes towards reform among policymakers, intended to slow the rapid changes that were said to have contributed to the causes of the protest.<ref name=\"Goodman\" /> Deng Xiaoping, the \"architect\" of the reform policy, saw his influence significantly reduced following the protests, forcing him into making concessions with socialist hardliners.<ref name=\"macfarquhar\">''The Politics of China'' By Roderick MacFarquhar</ref> In dismissing Zhao Ziyang, who shared Deng's vision for economic reform but disagreed with him over politics, Deng had lost the foremost champion of his own economic vision.

Initially ignored by Beijing, the Chinese Politburo eventually sided with Deng and economic reforms again gained prominence.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n[[File:2009candlevigil1.jpg|270px|thumb|[[Candlelight vigil]] in Hong Kong in 2009 on 20th anniversary of the June 4th incident]]\nIn Hong Kong, the Tiananmen square protests led to fears that the PRC would renege on its commitments under [[one country, two systems]] following the impending handover of Hong Kong from Great Britain in 1997. In response, Governor [[Chris Patten]] tried to expand the [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], which led to friction with Beijing. For many Hong Kongers, Tiananmen served as a turning point for when they lost trust in the Beijing government. The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to [[Waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong|a sizeable exodus of Hong Kongers]] to Western countries such as Canada and Australia prior to 1997.\n\nThere have been [[Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|large candlelight vigils attended by tens of thousands in Hong Kong every year since 1989]] even after the transfer of power to the PRC in 1997.

In its immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a [[pariah state]], increasingly isolated internationally. This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.  However, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalization policies after 1989.<ref>Deng et al., \"Minutes of the CCP Central Politburo Standing Committee Meeting\", in The Tiananmen Papers: The Chinese Leadership's Decision to use Force Against their own People – In their Own Words, eds.

Deng Xiaoping largely stayed out of politics until his groundbreaking 1992 \"southern tour\", which was intended to re-instate policies of economic liberalization.<ref>Cabestan, \"How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself\", 195.</ref>  Along with the liberalization came the loosening of state control in many areas of daily life. Privately run print media flourished. Private newspapers increased from 250 in the 1980s to over 7,000 by 2003.

The events continue to have a strong impact on perceptions of China, its government, attitudes towards democracy, and the extent to which Hong Kongers should identify as \"Chinese\". The events of June 4 are seen as emblematic of the Chinese 'brand' of authoritarianism and is prominently discussed in Hong Kong's political circles, often in relation to democratic reform in Hong Kong and the territory's relationship with Beijing.

The PRC has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from EU members. Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as \"outdated\", and damaging to China-EU relations. In early 2004, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] spearheaded a movement within the EU to lift the ban, which was supported by German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]. However, the passing of the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] in March 2005 increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban, and several EU Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban. Moreover, Schröder's successor [[Angela Merkel]] opposed lifting the ban. Members of the U.S. Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the EU if the latter lifted the ban. The UK also opposed the lifting of the embargo when it took charge of the EU presidency in July 2005.\n\nIn addition, the [[European Parliament]] has consistently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo to the PRC. Though its agreement is not necessary for lifting the ban, many argue it reflects the will of the European people better as it is the only directly elected European body. The arms embargo has limited China's options from where it may seek military hardware. Among the sources that were sought included the former [[Soviet bloc]] that it had a strained relationship with as a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Other willing suppliers have previously included Israel and South Africa, but American pressure has restricted this co-operation.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/11/27/afx4376482.html \"Japan concerned by call to lift China embargo – official\"] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071128105735/http://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/11/27/afx4376482.html |date = November 28, 2007 }}, ''Forbes'', November 27, 2008.</ref>\n\n== Legacy==\n=== Censorship in China ===\n{{Further information|Censorship in the People's Republic of China}}\n{{See also|Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China#Specific examples of internet censorship |l1=Internet censorship of the protest}}\n\nThe [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) forbids discussion of the Tiananmen Square protests,<ref>Robert Saiget, \"China Faces Dark Memory of Tiananmen\", Agence France-Presse, https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ixE-jRK7NgYPxXveg0taL2WzXr0w</ref> and has taken measures to block or censor related information.

The [[Chinese economic reform|reforms of the 1980s]] had led to a nascent [[market economy]] which benefitted some people but seriously disaffected others; the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included [[inflation]], limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy, and restrictions on political participation.

Events named by date in Chinese are conventionally named by the number of the month and the date, followed by the type of event. Thus, the common Chinese name for the crackdown on the 1989 massacre, is \"{{lang|zh|六四事件}}\" (June Fourth Incident), literally \"Six\" \"Four\" \"Incident\" (\"{{lang|zh|{{linktext|六}}}}\" means \"six\", \"{{lang|zh|{{linktext|四}}}}\" means \"four\", \"{{lang|zh|{{linktext|事件}}}}\" means \"incident\"). The nomenclature of the former is consistent with the customary names of the other two great protests that occurred in Tiananmen Square: the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919, and the [[Tiananmen Incident|April Fifth Movement]] of 1976. \"June Fourth\" refers to the day on which the People's Liberation Army cleared Tiananmen Square of protesters, although actual operations began on the evening of June 3. Names such as '''June Fourth Movement''' ({{zh |s = 六四运动 |p = Liù-Sì Yùndòng}}) and '''{{'}}89 Democracy Movement''' ({{zh|labels=no |s =八九民运 |p = Bā-Jiǔ Mínyùn}}) are used to describe the event in its entirety.\n\nOutside mainland China, and among circles critical of the crackdown within mainland China, it is commonly referred to in Chinese as '''June Fourth Massacre''' ({{zh|labels=no |s = 六四屠杀 |p = Liù-Sì Túshā }}) and '''June Fourth Crackdown''' ({{zh|labels=no |s = 六四镇压 |p = Liù-Sì Zhènyā }}). To bypass [[internet censorship in China]], which uniformly considers all the above-mentioned names too 'Sensitive' for search engines and public forums, alternative names have sprung up to describe the events on the Internet, such as May&nbsp;35th, VIIV ([[Roman numerals]] for 6 and 4) and \"Eight Squared\" (i.e., 8<sup>2</sup> = 64).<ref name=\"TheAge\">{{cite news |url = http://www.theage.com.au/world/china-tightens-information-controls-for-tiananmen-anniversary-20090604-bvxf.html |title = China tightens information controls for Tiananmen anniversary |agency = Agence France-Presse |date=June 4, 2009 |work=The Age |location=Australia |accessdate=November 3, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[government of the People's Republic of China]] have used numerous names for the event since 1989, gradually reducing the intensity of terminology applied.<ref name=\"vog\">{{cite book |last = Vogel |first = Ezra F. |title = Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China |year = 2011 |publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-05544-6 |page = 634 |id =   }}</ref> As the events were unfolding, it was labelled a \"counterrevolutionary riot\", which was later changed to simply \"riot\", followed by \"political storm\", and finally the leadership settled on the more neutralized phrase \"political turmoil between the Spring and Summer of 1989\", which it uses to this day.<ref name=\"vog\" /><ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/editorial/the-day-china-trampled-on-freedom/2009/05/29/1243456737644.html |title = The day China trampled on freedom |date=May 30, 2009 |work=The Age |location=Australia |accessdate=November 3, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn English, the terms '''Tiananmen Square Massacre''', '''Tiananmen Square Protests''' or '''Tiananmen Square Crackdown''' are often used to describe the series of events.

The movement, spearheaded by Mao, caused severe damage to the country's economic and social fabric. The country was mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the Communist Party itself. At the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee]] in December 1978, [[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's [[Paramount leader|''de facto'' leader]]. Deng launched a comprehensive [[Chinese economic reform|program to reform the Chinese economy]]. Within several years, the country's direction entirely changed. The focus on ideological purity was replaced by a full-on drive to achieve material prosperity.\n\nTo run his reform agenda, Deng promoted his allies to top government and party posts. [[Hu Yaobang]] was appointed the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] in February 1980, and [[Zhao Ziyang]] was named as [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]] in September.\n\n=== Challenges with reform ===\nThe reforms aimed to decrease the role of the state in the economy and gradually introduced private forms of production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had de-collectivized and 80% of state owned enterprises were permitted to retain profits. Within a few years, production increased by leaps and bounds, and poverty was reduced substantially.\n\nWhile the reforms were generally well received by the public, concerns grew over a series of social problems that the changes brought about, including [[Corruption in China|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] by elite party bureaucrats.<ref>Naughton, B. p. 91.</ref> The state-mandated pricing system, in place since the 1950s, had long kept prices stable at low levels. The initial reforms created a two-tier system where some prices were fixed while others were allowed to fluctuate. In a market with chronic shortages, this allowed people with powerful connections to buy goods at low prices and sell at market prices.<ref name=autogenerated2>''Silenced Scream: a Visual History of the 1989 Tiananmen Protests''. Donna Rouviere Anderson, Forrest Anderson. p. 1</ref> In addition, the money supply had expanded too fast. At least a third of factories were unprofitable. The government tightened the money supply in 1988, leaving much of the economy without loans.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nFollowing the 1988 [[Beidaihe]] meeting, the party leadership under Deng agreed to a transition to a market-based pricing system.<ref name=\"Dingxin Zhao 2001. p. 127\">Dingxin Zhao.

(University enrollment increased from 625,319 in 1977 to 2,065,923 in 1988)</ref> the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased market demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 84</ref> The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 82</ref> Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered on the basis of [[nepotism]] and favoritism.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 89.</ref> Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in their area of jurisdiction.<ref name=vog600/> Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues. Small study groups, such as the \"Democracy Salon\" and the \"Lawn Salon\" (''Caodi Shalong''), began appearing on Beijing university campuses.<ref>Zhao D. p. 137.</ref> These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically.<ref name=\"Dingxin Zhao 2001. p. 127\"/>\n\nAt the same time, the party's nominally socialist ideology faced a legitimacy crisis as it gradually adopted capitalist practices.<ref name=\"Wang, H. p. 57\">Wang, H. p. 57</ref> Private enterprise gave rise to profiteers who took advantage of lax regulations, and who often flaunted their wealth in front of those who were less well off.<ref name=vog600/> Popular discontent was brewing over unfair wealth distribution. Greed, not skill, appeared to be the most crucial factor of success. There was widespread public disillusionment over the country's future. People wanted change, yet the power to define 'the correct path' continued to rest solely in the hands of the unelected government.<ref name=\"Wang, H. p. 57\"/>\n\nThe comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over the pace of [[marketization]] and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers (\"the right\", led by [[Hu Yaobang]]) favoured political liberalization and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent, and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives (\"the left\", led by [[Chen Yun]]) said that the reforms had gone too far, and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. Both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.<ref name=ghp>{{cite web|title=The Gate of Heavenly Peace|url=http://tsquare.tv/film/transcript.html|publisher=Long Bow Group Inc. in collaboration with ITVS|year=1995|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== 1986 student demonstrations ===\n{{Main article|1986 Chinese Student Demonstrations}}\nIn mid-1986, astrophysics professor [[Fang Lizhi]], who had returned from a  position at [[Princeton University]], began a personal tour around universities in China, speaking about liberty, human rights, and [[separation of powers]]. Fang was part of a wider undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution were a direct result of the authoritarian political system and the rigid command economy.<ref>Zhao, D. pp. 64, 215</ref> The view that political reform was the only answer to China's on-going problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated all over the country.<ref name=autogenerated3>Standoff at Tiananmen (2009). Eddie Cheng. p. 33</ref>  In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems, while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nInspired by Fang and other 'people-power' movements around the world, in December 1986, student demonstrators staged protests against the slow pace of reform. The issues were wide-ranging, and included demands for economic liberalization, democracy, and rule of law.<ref>Wang, Hui, Thomas Huters ed. ''China's New Order: Society, Politics, and Economy in Transition''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-674-02111-8}}. pp. 56–7.</ref> While the protests were initially contained in [[Hefei]], where Fang lived, they quickly spread to Shanghai, Beijing and other major cities. This alarmed the central leadership, who accused the students of instigating Cultural Revolution-style turmoil.\n\nGeneral secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] was blamed for taking a soft attitude and mishandling the protests, thus undermining social stability. He was denounced thoroughly by conservatives. Hu was forced to resign as general secretary on January 16, 1987. Then the party began the \"Anti-[[bourgeois liberalization]] Campaign\", taking aim at Hu, political liberalization and Western-inspired ideas in general.<ref>Spence, Jonathan D. (1999). ''The Search for Modern China''. p. 685.

Within days, most posters were writing about broader political issues, such as freedom of the press, democracy, and corruption.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 147</ref>\nSmall spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on April 15 around [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] at [[Tiananmen Square]]. On the same day, many students at [[Peking University]] (PKU) and [[Tsinghua University]] erected shrines, and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion. Organized student gatherings also began on a small scale in [[Xi'an]] and Shanghai on April 16. On April 17, students at the [[China University of Political Science and Law]] (CUPL) made a large [[wreath]] to commemorate Hu Yaobang. Its laying-party was on April 17 and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 148</ref> At 5 pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the [[Great Hall of the People]], near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu. The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds giving public orations commemorating Hu and discussing social problems. However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the operation of the Great Hall, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.\n\nStarting on the night of April 17, three thousand PKU students marched from the campus towards Tiananmen Square, and soon nearly a thousand students from Tsinghua joined. Upon arrival, they soon joined forces with those already gathered at the Square. As its size grew, the gathering gradually evolved into a protest, as students began to draft a list of pleas and suggestions (''Seven Demands'') for the government:\n\n#Affirm Hu Yaobang's views on democracy and freedom as correct;\n#Admit that the campaigns against [[Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign|spiritual pollution]] and bourgeois liberalization had been wrong;\n#Publish information on the income of state leaders and their family members;\n#Allow privately run newspapers and stop press censorship;\n#Increase funding for education and raise intellectuals' pay;\n#End restrictions on demonstrations in Beijing\n#Provide objective coverage of students in official media.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=}}<ref>Zhao D. p. 148</ref>\n\nOn the morning of April 18, students remained in the Square. Some gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes singing patriotic songs and listening to impromptu speeches by student organizers, others gathered at the Great Hall. Meanwhile, a few thousand students gathered at [[Xinhua Gate]], the entrance to [[Zhongnanhai]], the seat of the party leadership, where they demanded dialogue with the leadership. Police restrained the students from entering the compound. Students then staged a [[sit-in]].\n\nOn April 20, most students had been persuaded to leave Xinhua Gate. To disperse about 200 students that remained, police used batons; minor clashes were reported. Many students felt abused by the police, and rumours about police brutality spread quickly. This incident angered students on campus, where those who were not politically active decided to join the protests.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 149</ref> Also on this date, a group of workers calling themselves the \"[[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]]\" issued two handbills challenging the central leadership.<ref>Walder, Andrew W., and Gong Xiaoxia. \"Workers in the Tiananmen Protests: The Politics of the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation.\" ''Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs'', no. 29, January 1993. pp. 1–2.

On the evening of April 21, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, ignoring orders from Beijing municipal authorities that the Square was to be closed off for the funeral. The funeral, which took place inside the Great Hall and attended by the leadership, was broadcast live to the students. General secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] delivered the eulogy. The funeral seemed rushed, and only lasted 40 minutes, as emotions ran high in the Square. Students wept.<ref name=ghp/><ref>Zhao, D. pp. 152–3</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Li|first=Peng|title=Li Peng Diary: The Critical Moments|year=2010|publisher=Au Ya Publishing|location=Hong Kong|isbn=1-921815-00-0|chapter=21 April Entry}}</ref>\n\nSecurity cordoned off the east entrance to the Great Hall, but several students pressed forward. Three of these students knelt on the steps of the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier [[Li Peng]].<ref name=\"Zhao153\">Zhao, D. p. 153</ref> However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a class boycott.<ref name=\"Zhao153\"/>\n\nFrom April 21 to 23, students began organizing under the banners of formal organizations. On April 23, the \"[[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]]\" (also known as \"the Union\") was formed. It elected CUPL student [[Zhou Yongjun]] as chair; [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] and [[Wu'erkaixi]] also emerged as leaders. From this vantage point, the Union called for a general class boycott at all Beijing universities. Such an independent organization operating outside of party jurisdiction alarmed the leadership.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 154</ref>\n\nOn April 22, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in [[Changsha]] and [[Xi'an]]. In Xi'an, arson from rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate. In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities. In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government. As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government.<ref name=\"zzy\">{{cite book |last=Zhao |first=Ziyang |title=Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang |year=2009 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=1-4391-4938-0 |chapter=The origins of the 1989 Student Movement}}</ref> Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action.

On April 24, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] and mayor [[Chen Xitong]] to gauge the situation at the Square. The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis, and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and major party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed that firm action against protesters must be taken.<ref name=\"liu\" /> On the morning of April 25, President [[Yang Shangkun]] and Premier [[Li Peng]] met with Deng at the latter's residence. Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate 'warning' must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations.<ref name=vog603>Vogel, E. pp. 603–6</ref> The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests from the leadership, and highlighted Deng's having 'final say' on important issues. Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials in an effort to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.\n\nOn April 26, the party's official newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' issued a front-page editorial titled \"[[April 26 Editorial|It is necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances]].\" The language in the editorial effectively branded the student movement to be an anti-party, anti-government revolt.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2005-02/23/content_2609426.htm |archive-url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20060424034105/http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2005-02/23/content_2609426.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 24, 2006 |title=Full text of the April 26 Editorial |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=February 23, 2005 |df= }}</ref> The article enraged students, who interpreted it as a direct indictment on the protests and its cause. The editorial backfired. Instead of scaring students into submission, it squarely antagonized the students against the government.<ref name=zhd155>Zhao, D. p. 155</ref> The polarizing nature of the editorial made it a major sticking point for the remainder of the protests.<ref name=vog603/> The editorial evoked memories of the Cultural Revolution, using similar rhetoric as that used during the 1976 [[Tiananmen Incident]]—an event that was initially branded an anti-government conspiracy but was later rehabilitated as \"patriotic\" under Deng's leadership.<ref name=ghp/>\n\n[[File:Han Dongfang.png|thumb|right|170px|[[Han Dongfang]], founder of the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]]]]\n\n=== April 27 demonstration ===\n{{Main article|April 27 Demonstration}}\n\nOrganized by the Union, on April 27 some 50,000–100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers.<ref name=ghp/> The student leaders, eager to show the patriotic nature of the movement, also toned down anti-Communist slogans, choosing to present a message of \"anti-corruption, anti-cronyism\" but \"pro-party\".<ref name=\"zhd155\" /> In a twist of irony, student factions who genuinely called for the overthrow of the Communist Party gained traction as the result of an April 26 editorial.<ref name=\"zhd155\" />\n\nThe stunning success of the March forced the government into making concessions and meeting with student representatives. On April 29, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman [[Yuan Mu]] ([[:zh:袁木|袁木]]) met with appointed representatives of government-sanctioned student associations. While the talks discussed a wide range of issues, including the editorial, the Xinhua Gate incident, and freedom of the press, they achieved few substantive results. Independent student leaders such as Wuer Kaixi refused to attend.<ref name=\"zhd157\">Zhao, D. p. 157.</ref>\n\nThe government's tone grew increasingly conciliatory as Zhao Ziyang returned from [[Pyongyang]] on April 30 and resumed his executive authority. In Zhao's view, the hardliner approach was not working, and concession was the only alternative.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 156</ref> Zhao asked that the press be opened to report the movement positively, and delivered two sympathetic speeches on 3–4 May. In the speeches, Zhao said that the student's concerns about corruption were legitimate, and that the student movement was patriotic in nature.<ref name=\"Vogel, E. p.608\">Vogel, E. p. 608.</ref> The speeches essentially negated the message presented by April 26 Editorial. While some 100,000 students marched on the streets of Beijing on 4 May to commemorate the [[May Fourth Movement]] and repeat demands from earlier marches, many students were satisfied with the government's concessions. On 4 May, all Beijing universities except PKU and BNU announced the end of the class boycott. Subsequently, the majority of students began to lose interest in the movement.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 159.</ref>\n\n== Protests escalate ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|+ Party and government leaders\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Name\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:320px;\"| Position(s) in 1989\n|-\n| ''[[Deng Xiaoping]]'' || [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]]; ''de facto'' \"[[paramount leader]]\"\n|-\n| ''[[Chen Yun]]'' || Chairman of the CPC [[Central Advisory Commission]]\n|-\n| '''[[Zhao Ziyang]]''' || [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] <br> First Vice-Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]]\n|-\n| '''[[Li Peng]]''' || [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]]\n|-\n| '''[[Qiao Shi]]''' || Secretary of the CPC [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] <br> Secretary of the CPC [[Political and Legislative Affairs Committee]]\n|-\n| '''[[Hu Qili]]''' || First Secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|Secretariat of the Communist Party]]\n|-\n| '''[[Yao Yilin]]''' || First [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China]]\n|-\n| ''[[Yang Shangkun]]'' || [[President of the People's Republic of China]] <br> Vice-Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission]]\n|-\n| ''[[Li Xiannian]]'' || [[Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|Chairman of the Conference National Committee]]\n|-\n| ''[[Wan Li]]'' || [[Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Chairman of the Congress Standing Committee]]\n|-\n| ''[[Wang Zhen (general)|Wang Zhen]]'' || [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China]]\n|-\n| [[Jiang Zemin]] || Communist Party [[Politics of Shanghai|Shanghai Municipal Secretary]]\n|-\n| [[Li Ximing]] || Communist Party [[Politics of Beijing|Beijing Municipal Secretary]]\n|-\n| [[Zhu Rongji]] || Mayor of Shanghai\n|-\n| [[Chen Xitong]] || [[Mayor of Beijing]]\n|-\n| [[Hu Jintao]] || Communist Party [[Politics of Tibet|Tibet Regional Secretary]]\n|-\n| [[Wen Jiabao]] || Chief of the [[General Office of the Communist Party of China]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #efefef;\" | Bold text indicates membership in the [[Politburo Standing Committee]]<br />Italics text indicates [[Eight Elders|Great Eminent Officials]] \n|}\n\n=== Preparing for dialogue ===\n{{Main article|Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement}}\n\nThe leadership was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, factional tensions, between the progressive camp and the conservative camp, intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.<ref name=\"Vogel, E. p.608\"/>\n\nIn preparation for dialogue, the Autonomous Student Union elected representatives to a formal Dialogue Delegation. However, the Union leaders were reluctant to let the Delegation unilaterally take control of the movement.<ref name=zhao161>Zhao, D. p. 161.</ref> Facing internal discord and declining engagement from the student body at large, a group of charismatic leaders, including Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi, called for more radical measures to regain momentum. They believed that the government's 'dialogue' was merely a way to trick the students into submission. They began mobilizing students for a hunger strike on 11 May.<ref name=\"zhao161\" />\n\n=== Hunger strikes begin ===\n{{Main article|The Students' Hunger Strike of the 1989 Tiananmen Protests}}\n[[File:蒲志強19890510.jpg|thumb|A photo of [[Pu Zhiqiang]], a student protester at Tiananmen, taken on 10 May 1989]]\nStudents began the hunger strike on 13 May, two days before the highly publicized [[state visit]] by Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Knowing that the welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev was scheduled to be held on the Square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike there to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought.<ref name=\"vogel612\">Vogel, E. pp. 612–4.</ref> By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.<ref name=\"Zhao, D. p.167\">Zhao, D. p. 167.</ref>\n\nInspired by the course of events in Beijing, protests and strikes began at universities in other cities, with many students traveling to Beijing to join the demonstration. Generally, the demonstration at Tiananmen Square was well-ordered, with daily marches of students from various Beijing-area colleges displaying their solidarity with the class boycott and with the demands of the protest. The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'', the world socialist anthem, on their way to, and at, the square.<ref>[[Amnesty International]] (August 30, 1989). ''Preliminary Findings on Killings of Unarmed Civilians, Arbitrary Arrests and Summary Executions Since June 3, 1989''. p. 19.</ref>\n\nAfraid that the movement would spin out of control, Deng Xiaoping asked that the Square be cleared for Gorbachev's visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao again used a soft approach, and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately.<ref name=\"vogel612\" /> Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism, and that the students understood signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation (not just the government). On the morning of 13 May, [[Yan Mingfu]], head of the Communist Party's [[United Front (China)|United Front]], called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Chen Ziming]] and [[Wang Juntao]].<ref>Zhao, D. p. 164.</ref> Yan said the government was prepared to hold immediate dialogue with student representatives, but that the Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be cancelled whether the students withdraw or not—in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.<ref name=\"Zhao, D. p.165\">Zhao, D. p. 165.</ref>\n\n=== Gorbachev visit ===\n{{Main article|1989 Sino-Soviet Summit}}\n\nPress restrictions were loosened significantly during early to mid May. State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers. On 14 May, intellectuals led by [[Dai Qing]] gained permission from [[Hu Qili]] to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals on ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]''. The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the Square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict.<ref name=\"Zhao, D. p.167\" /> However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government, and refused to move. That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by [[Shen Tong]] and Xiang Xiaoji. Yan affirmed the patriotic nature of the student movement and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the Square.<ref name=\"Zhao, D. p.165\"/> While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership. Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 169</ref> Yan then personally went to the Square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage.<ref name=ghp/> Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the April 26 editorial and re-branding the movement as \"patriotic and democratic\"; Li refused.<ref>Li, Peng. Diary entry for 15 May.</ref>\n\nThe students remained in the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, the first of its kind in [[Sino-Soviet split|some 30 years]], marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. However, its smooth proceedings was derailed by the student movement; according to one scholar, this embarrassed the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path.<ref>Zhao, D. p. 170</ref> The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the [[Great Hall of the People]] amid the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square.<ref name=vogel612/> When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told him, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. The statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.<ref name=vogel612/>\n\n=== Gathering momentum ===\nThe hunger strike galvanized support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from May 17-18. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials.<ref name=\"zhao171\">Zhao, D. p. 171.</ref> Many grassroots Party and [[Communist Youth League|Youth League]] organizations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate.<ref name=zhao171/> In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng in support of students. The [[Red Cross Society of China|Chinese Red Cross]] issued a special notice and sent in a large number of personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the Square. After the departure of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, giving the movement international spotlight. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.\n\nThe movement, on the wane at the end of April, now regained significant momentum. By 17 May, as students from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of varying sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities did not know how to respond.

Many workers were summarily tried and executed. In contrast, the students – many of whom came from relatively affluent backgrounds and were well-connected – received much lighter sentences. [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]], the student leader who topped the most wanted list, spent seven years in prison. Many of the students and university staff implicated were permanently politically stigmatized, some never to be employed again. Some student leaders such as [[Chai Ling]] and [[Wuer Kaixi]] were able to escape to the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other Western nations under [[Operation Yellowbird]] that was organized from Hong Kong, a British territory at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18141489.html|title=Article: Still on the wing; inside Operation Yellowbird, the daring plot to help dissidents escape.(special report: China)}}</ref>\n\nSmaller protest actions continued in other cities for a few days. Some university staff and students who had witnessed the killings in Beijing organized or spurred commemorative events upon their return to school.

He was, however, able to retain his party membership, and after \"changing his opinion\", was reassigned as deputy minister in the Ministry for Machinery and Electronics Industry. Another reform-minded Chinese leader, [[Wan Li]], was also put under house arrest immediately after he stepped out of his plane at [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Beijing Capital Airport]] upon returning from his shortened trip abroad; the authorities declared his detention to be on health grounds.

He was convicted in 1992 of \"revealing state secrets and counter-revolutionary propagandizing\" and served seven years in prison. To purge sympathizers of Tiananmen demonstrators among the party's rank-and-file, the party leadership initiated a one-and-a-half-year-long rectification program to \"deal strictly with those inside the party with serious tendencies toward bourgeois liberalization\". Four million people were reportedly investigated for their role in the protests.

State media reports in the immediate aftermath were sympathetic to the students. As a result, those responsible were all later removed from their posts. Two news anchors [[Xue Fei (host)|Xue Fei]] and [[Du Xian (news anchor)|Du Xian]], who reported this event on June 4 in the daily ''[[Xinwen Lianbo]]'' broadcast on [[China Central Television]] were fired because they displayed sad emotions.

In its aftermath, many of the freedoms introduced during the 1980s were rescinded, as the party returned to a conventional Leninist mold and re-established firm control over the press, publishing, and mass media. The protests were also a blow to the 'separation of powers' model established by the 1982 Constitution and by convention, whereby the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] was a symbolic position ([[figurehead]]), and the real centres of power of the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of the State Council]] and the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] were [[Separation of powers|intended to be different people]], to prevent the excesses of Mao-style personal rule. \n\nHowever, when President [[Yang Shangkun]] asserted his [[reserve powers]] with his post of [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] and openly split with general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] over the use of force to side with Premier [[Li Peng]] and Central Military Commission chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]], official policy became inconsistent and incoherent, significantly impeding the exercise of power. In 1993, the positions of General Secretary, Central Military Commission Chairman and President were all consolidated into the same office, reverting to the previous Maoist distribution of power that had previously existed since 1972.\n\nIn 1989, neither the Chinese military nor the Beijing police had sufficient anti-riot gear, such as rubber bullets and tear gas.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9906/02/tiananmen/MacKinnon/zhu.muzhi.html Chinese human rights official says the crackdown 'completely correct'] Rebecca MacKinnon, \"Tiananmen Ten Years Later.\" CNN, June 2, 1999.</ref> After the Tiananmen Square protests, riot police in Chinese cities were equipped with non-lethal equipment for riot control. The protests led to increased spending on internal security and expanded the role of the People's Armed Police in suppressing urban protests.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe aftermath of the protests saw the resurgence of conservative attitudes towards reform among policymakers, intended to slow the rapid changes that were said to have contributed to the causes of the protest.<ref name=\"Goodman\" /> Deng Xiaoping, the \"architect\" of the reform policy, saw his influence significantly reduced following the protests, forcing him into making concessions with socialist hardliners.<ref name=\"macfarquhar\">''The Politics of China'' By Roderick MacFarquhar</ref> In dismissing Zhao Ziyang, who shared Deng's vision for economic reform but disagreed with him over politics, Deng had lost the foremost champion of his own economic vision. Facing pressure from the conservative camp, Deng distanced himself from state affairs.<ref name=\"Goodman\"/>\n\nThis slow pace of reform was met with stiff resistance from provincial governors and broke down completely in the early 1990s as a result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Deng's Southern Tour of 1992, designed by the ailing but influential leader as a means to reinstate his economic reform agenda.<ref name=\"Goodman\"/> On the tour, Deng criticized the leftist hardliners that had gained power following the protests, and praised entrepreneurship and other market-driven policies. Initially ignored by Beijing, the Chinese Politburo eventually sided with Deng and economic reforms again gained prominence.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n[[File:2009candlevigil1.jpg|270px|thumb|[[Candlelight vigil]] in Hong Kong in 2009 on 20th anniversary of the June 4th incident]]\nIn Hong Kong, the Tiananmen square protests led to fears that the PRC would renege on its commitments under [[one country, two systems]] following the impending handover of Hong Kong from Great Britain in 1997. In response, Governor [[Chris Patten]] tried to expand the [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], which led to friction with Beijing. For many Hong Kongers, Tiananmen served as a turning point for when they lost trust in the Beijing government. The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to [[Waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong|a sizeable exodus of Hong Kongers]] to Western countries such as Canada and Australia prior to 1997.\n\nThere have been [[Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|large candlelight vigils attended by tens of thousands in Hong Kong every year since 1989]] even after the transfer of power to the PRC in 1997.

In its immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a [[pariah state]], increasingly isolated internationally. This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.  However, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalization policies after 1989.<ref>Deng et al., \"Minutes of the CCP Central Politburo Standing Committee Meeting\", in The Tiananmen Papers: The Chinese Leadership's Decision to use Force Against their own People – In their Own Words, eds.

Deng Xiaoping largely stayed out of politics until his groundbreaking 1992 \"southern tour\", which was intended to re-instate policies of economic liberalization.<ref>Cabestan, \"How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself\", 195.</ref>  Along with the liberalization came the loosening of state control in many areas of daily life. Privately run print media flourished. Private newspapers increased from 250 in the 1980s to over 7,000 by 2003. Provincially run satellite TV stations sprung up all over the country and challenged the market share of state-run CCTV.<ref>Joshua Kurlantzick, \"The Dragon Still Has Teeth: How the West Winks at Chinese Repression\", World Policy Journal, 20 no. 1 (2003): 50, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40209847</ref> The leadership also stepped away from promoting communism as an all-encompassing belief system. State-approved religious organizations increased their membership significantly, and traditional beliefs suppressed during the Mao era re-appeared.<ref>Kurlantzick, \"The Dragon Still Has Teeth\", 50.</ref>  This state-sanctioned plurality also created the environment for unsanctioned forms of spirituality and worship to grow.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Kurlantzick, \"The Dragon Still Has Teeth\", 52.</ref>  In order to reduce the need for controversial methods of state control, while Protestants, Buddhists, and Taoists were largely left alone, the state often used these 'approved' denominations to \"fight against cults\" such as [[Falun Gong]] – playing sects off each other.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nAs the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Cabestan, \"How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself\", 199.</ref>  This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's \"national pride\", turning public opinions in its favour.<ref>Cabestan, \"How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself\", 201.</ref>  This is perhaps most prominently seen in May 1999, when [[US bombing of the People's Republic of China embassy in Belgrade|the US bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Link, \"June Fourth: Memory and Ethics\", 30.</ref> The bombings saw an outpouring of nationalist sentiment and increased support for the party as the foremost advocate of China's national interest.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n==== International perception ====\nFacing global condemnation for their handling of the protests in 1989, China has endeavored to demonstrate its willingness to participate in international economic and defense institutions in order to secure investment for continued economic reforms.<ref>Link, \"June Fourth: Memory and Ethics\", 19.</ref>  Before the end of 1991, China normalized ties with the Russian government's newly elected president, [[Boris Yeltsin]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Cabestan, \"How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself\", 196.</ref> The PRC also welcomed Taiwanese business as a replacement for Western investment.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Further, China expedited negotiations with the [[World Trade Organization]] as well as established relations with Indonesia, Israel, South Korea, and others in 1992.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Regarding defense alignments, the government signed [[Non-Proliferation Treaty|The Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1992, [[Chemical Weapons Convention|The Convention on Chemical Weapons]] in 1993, and [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] in 1996.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Whereas China had been a member of just 30 international organizations in 1986, this membership increased to over 50 by 1997.<ref>Cabestan, \"How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself\", 198.</ref> Finally, while China was a net recipient of aid throughout the 1980s, its growing economic and military role transformed it into a provider of aid, with $100 million given to Thailand in 1997 alone.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Kurlantzick, \"The Dragon Still Has Teeth\", 56.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the government has successfully promoted China as an attractive destination for investment by emphasizing the country's skilled workers, comparatively lower wages, established infrastructure, and sizeable consumer base.<ref>Kurlantzick, \"The Dragon Still Has Teeth\", 55.</ref> Increased foreign investment in the country led many world leaders to believe that by constructively engaging China in the global marketplace, political reforms would inevitably follow.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> At the same time, the explosion of commercial interest in the country opened the way for multinational corporations to turn a blind eye to politics and human rights in favour of \"doing business.\" Since then, Western leaders who were previously critical of China have generally paid lip service to the legacy of Tiananmen, but the substance of bilateral relationships focus on business and trade interests.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>\n\nIn Hong Kong, the events of Tiananmen in 1989 – perhaps more than anywhere else outside mainland China – have become permanently etched in the public consciousness. The events continue to have a strong impact on perceptions of China, its government, attitudes towards democracy, and the extent to which Hong Kongers should identify as \"Chinese\". The events of June 4 are seen as emblematic of the Chinese 'brand' of authoritarianism and is prominently discussed in Hong Kong's political circles, often in relation to democratic reform in Hong Kong and the territory's relationship with Beijing. Academic studies indicate that those who supported the rehabilitation of the Tiananmen Square movement had a tendency to support democratization in the territory<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Francis L.

The PRC has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from EU members. Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as \"outdated\", and damaging to China-EU relations. In early 2004, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] spearheaded a movement within the EU to lift the ban, which was supported by German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]. However, the passing of the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] in March 2005 increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban, and several EU Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban. Moreover, Schröder's successor [[Angela Merkel]] opposed lifting the ban. Members of the U.S. Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the EU if the latter lifted the ban. The UK also opposed the lifting of the embargo when it took charge of the EU presidency in July 2005.\n\nIn addition, the [[European Parliament]] has consistently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo to the PRC. Though its agreement is not necessary for lifting the ban, many argue it reflects the will of the European people better as it is the only directly elected European body. The arms embargo has limited China's options from where it may seek military hardware. Among the sources that were sought included the former [[Soviet bloc]] that it had a strained relationship with as a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Other willing suppliers have previously included Israel and South Africa, but American pressure has restricted this co-operation.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/11/27/afx4376482.html \"Japan concerned by call to lift China embargo – official\"] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071128105735/http://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/11/27/afx4376482.html |date = November 28, 2007 }}, ''Forbes'', November 27, 2008.</ref>\n\n== Legacy==\n=== Censorship in China ===\n{{Further information|Censorship in the People's Republic of China}}\n{{See also|Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China#Specific examples of internet censorship |l1=Internet censorship of the protest}}\n\nThe [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) forbids discussion of the Tiananmen Square protests,<ref>Robert Saiget, \"China Faces Dark Memory of Tiananmen\", Agence France-Presse, https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ixE-jRK7NgYPxXveg0taL2WzXr0w</ref> and has taken measures to block or censor related information.
