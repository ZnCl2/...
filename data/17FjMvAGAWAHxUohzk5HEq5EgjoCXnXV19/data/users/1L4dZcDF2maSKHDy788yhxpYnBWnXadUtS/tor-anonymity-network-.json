The name is derived from an acronym for the original software project name \"The Onion Router\".<ref name=\"onion-router\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Tor Project: FAQ |url=https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#WhyCalledTor |website=www.torproject.org |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> Tor directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer [[overlay network]] consisting of more than seven thousand relays<ref name=\"torstatus\" /> to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone conducting [[Computer surveillance#Network surveillance|network surveillance]] or [[Traffic analysis#In computer security|traffic analysis]]. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity to the user: this includes \"visits to Web sites, online posts, instant messages, and other communication forms\".<ref name=\"nyt-navels\" /> The intent for Tor's use is to protect the personal privacy of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential communication by keeping their Internet activities from being monitored.\n\nTor does not prevent an online service from determining when it is being accessed through Tor. Tor protects a user's privacy, but does not hide the fact that someone is using Tor. Some websites restrict allowances through Tor. For example, the [[MediaWiki]] [[:mediawikiwiki:Extension:TorBlock|TorBlock]] extension automatically restricts edits made through Tor, although [[Wikipedia]] allows [[Wikipedia:Advice to users using Tor|some limited editing in exceptional circumstances]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Turks Click Away, but Wikipedia Is Gone |author=PATRICK KINGSLEY |date=June 10, 2017 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/world/europe/turkey-wikipedia-ban-recep-tayyip-erdogan.html |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Onion routing]] is implemented by [[encryption]] in the [[application layer]] of a communication protocol stack, nested like the layers of an [[onion]]. Tor encrypts the data, including the next node destination [[IP address]], multiple times and sends it through a [[virtual circuit]] comprising successive, random-selection Tor relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of encryption to reveal the next relay in the circuit to pass the remaining encrypted data on to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing or knowing the source IP address. Because the routing of the communication is partly concealed at every hop in the Tor circuit, this method eliminates any single point at which the communicating peers can be determined through network surveillance that relies upon knowing its source and destination.\n\nAn adversary may try to de-anonymize the user by some means. One way this may be achieved is by [[Exploit (computer security)|exploiting]] vulnerable software on the user's computer.<ref name=\"guardian-nsa-target\" /> The [[National Security Agency|NSA]] had a technique that targets a vulnerability – which they codenamed \"EgotisticalGiraffe\" – in an outdated [[Firefox]] browser version at one time bundled with the Tor package<ref name=\"guardian-peeling\" /> and, in general, targets Tor users for close monitoring under its [[XKeyscore]] program.<ref name=\"NDR\">{{cite news|author1=J.

It is an implementation of [[onion routing]], which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through a network of relays run by volunteers around the globe. These onion routers employ [[encryption]] in a multi-layered manner (hence the onion metaphor) to ensure [[perfect forward secrecy]] between relays, thereby providing users with anonymity in network location. That anonymity extends to the hosting of censorship-resistant content by Tor's anonymous hidden service feature.<ref name=\"usenix-design\" /> Furthermore, by keeping some of the entry relays (bridge relays) secret, users can evade [[Internet censorship]] that relies upon blocking public Tor relays.<ref name=\"torproject-bridges\" />\n\nBecause the [[IP address]] of the sender and the recipient are not ''both'' in [[cleartext]] at any hop along the way, anyone eavesdropping at any point along the communication channel cannot directly identify both ends. Furthermore, to the recipient it appears that the last Tor [[Node (networking)|node]] (called the exit node), rather than the sender, is the originator of the communication.\n\n===Originating traffic===\n[[File:EtherApeTorScreenShot.png|thumb|A visual depiction of the traffic between some Tor relay [[Node (networking)|nodes]] from the [[open-source]] [[packet sniffing]] program [[EtherApe]]]]\nA Tor user's [[SOCKS]]-aware applications can be configured to direct their network traffic through a Tor instance's SOCKS interface. Tor periodically creates virtual circuits through the Tor network through which it can [[multiplexing|multiplex]] and onion-route that traffic to its destination. Once inside a Tor network, the traffic is sent from router to router along the circuit, ultimately reaching an exit node at which point the [[cleartext]] packet is available and is forwarded on to its original destination. Viewed from the destination, the traffic appears to originate at the Tor exit node.\n\n[[File:Tor-non-exit-relay-bandwidth-usage.jpg|thumb|A Tor non-exit relay with a maximum output of 239.69 KB/s]]\nTor's application independence sets it apart from most other anonymity networks: it works at the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) stream level. Applications whose traffic is commonly anonymized using Tor include [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[instant messaging]], and [[World Wide Web]] browsing.\n\n===Hidden services===\n{{See also|List of Tor hidden services}}\nTor can also provide anonymity to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called [[Hidden Services|hidden services]]. Rather than revealing a server's IP address (and thus its network location), a hidden service is accessed through its [[.onion|onion address]], usually via the [[#Tor Browser|Tor Browser]]. The Tor network understands these addresses by looking up their corresponding [[public key]]s and ''introduction points'' from a [[distributed hash table]] within the network. It can route data to and from hidden services, even those hosted behind [[firewall (computing)|firewalls]] or [[network address translator]]s (NAT), while preserving the anonymity of both parties. Tor is necessary to access hidden services.<ref name=\"torproject-conf-hidden\" />\n\nHidden services were first specified in 2003<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mathewson|first1=Nick|title=Add first draft of rendezvous point document|url=https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/commit/?id=3d538f6d702937c23bec33b3bdd62ff9fba9d2a3|website=Tor Source Code|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> and have been deployed on the Tor network since 2004.<ref name=\"or-locating\" /> Other than the database that stores the hidden-service descriptors,<ref name=\"torproject-hidden\" /> Tor is decentralized by design; there is no direct readable list of all hidden services, although a number of hidden services catalog publicly known onion addresses.\n\nBecause hidden services {{clarifyspan|text=do not use exit nodes|date=October 2017}}, connection to a hidden service is encrypted end-to-end and not subject to eavesdropping. There are, however, security issues involving Tor hidden services. For example, services that are reachable through Tor hidden services ''and'' the public Internet are susceptible to correlation attacks and thus not perfectly hidden. Other pitfalls include misconfigured services (e.g. identifying information included by default in web server error responses), uptime and downtime statistics, intersection attacks, and user error.<ref name=\"torproject-hidden\" /><ref name=\"register-embassy-passwd\" /> The [[open source]] OnionScan program, written by independent security researcher [[Sarah Jamie Lewis]], comprehensively examines hidden services for numerous flaws and vulnerabilities.<ref name=\"OnionScan\">{{Cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kb7bg3/onionscan-checks-if-your-dark-web-site-really-is-anonymous |title=A Tool to Check If Your Dark Web Site Really Is Anonymous: ‘OnionScan' will probe dark web sites for security weaknesses.\n |last=Cox |first=Joseph |date=2016-04-06 |website=Motherboard |access-date=2017-07-07}}</ref> (Lewis has also pioneered the field of onion dildonics, inasmuch as [[sex toy]]s can be insecurely connected over the Internet.)<ref name=\"Onion Dildonics\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sex-toy-bluetooth-hacks-security-fix |title=keep getting hacked – but Tor could be the answer to safer connected sex Connected sex toys are gathering huge amounts of data about our most intimate moments.

It is [[free software]], available under the [[GNU General Public License]].\n\n==Weaknesses==\nLike all current [[low latency|low-latency]] [[anonymity network]]s, Tor cannot and does not attempt to protect against monitoring of traffic at the boundaries of the Tor network (i.e., the traffic entering and exiting the network). While Tor does provide protection against [[traffic analysis]], it cannot prevent traffic confirmation (also called ''end-to-end correlation'').<ref name=\"torproject-one-cell\" /><ref name=\"torproject-fail-both-ends\" />\n\nIn spite of known weaknesses and attacks listed here, a 2009 study revealed that Tor and the alternative network system [[Java Anon Proxy|JonDonym]] (Java Anon Proxy, JAP) are considered more resilient to website fingerprinting techniques than other [[tunneling protocol]]s.\n\nThe reason for this is that conventional single-hop [[VPN]] protocols do not need to reconstruct packet data nearly as much as a multi-hop service like Tor or JonDonym. Website fingerprinting yielded greater than 90% accuracy for identifying [[HTTP]] packets on conventional VPN protocols versus Tor which yielded only 2.96% accuracy. However some protocols like [[OpenSSH]] and [[OpenVPN]] required a large amount of data before HTTP packets were identified.<ref name=\"ccsw-attacking\" />\n\nResearchers from the [[University of Michigan]] developed a network scanner allowing identification of 86% of live Tor \"bridges\" with a single scan.<ref name=\"twe-zmap\" />\n\n===Eavesdropping===\n\n==== Autonomous system (AS) eavesdropping ====\nIf an [[Autonomous System (Internet)|autonomous system]] (AS) exists on both path segments from a client to entry relay and from exit relay to destination, such an AS can statistically correlate traffic on the entry and exit segments of the path and potentially infer the destination with which the client communicated. In 2012, LASTor proposed a method to predict a set of potential ASes on these two segments and then avoid choosing this path during path selection algorithm on client side. In this paper, they also improve latency by choosing shorter geographical paths between client and destination.<ref name=\"LASTor-2012\" />\n\n==== Exit node eavesdropping ====\nIn September 2007, Dan Egerstad, a Swedish security consultant, revealed that he had intercepted usernames and passwords for e-mail accounts by operating and monitoring Tor exit nodes.<ref name=\"wired-rogue-nodes\" /> As Tor cannot encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the target server, any exit node is in a position to capture traffic passing through it that does not use end-to-end encryption such as [[Secure Sockets Layer]] (SSL) or [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS). While this may not inherently breach the anonymity of the source, traffic intercepted in this way by self-selected third parties can expose information about the source in either or both of payload and protocol data.<ref name=\"sf-tor-hack\" /> Furthermore, Egerstad is circumspect about the possible subversion of Tor by intelligence agencies:<ref name=\"smh-hack-of-year\" />\n\n{{quote|\"If you actually look in to where these Tor nodes are hosted and how big they are, some of these nodes cost thousands of dollars each month just to host because they're using lots of bandwidth, they're heavy-duty servers and so on. Who would pay for this and be anonymous?\"}}\n\nIn October 2011, a research team from [[ESIEA (university)|ESIEA]] claimed to have discovered a way to compromise the Tor network by decrypting communication passing over it.<ref name=\"thn-compromised\" /><ref name=\"01-chercheurs\" /> The technique they describe requires creating a map of Tor network nodes, controlling one third of them, and then acquiring their encryption [[Key (cryptography)|keys]] and algorithm [[Random seed|seeds]]. Then, using these known keys and seeds, they claim the ability to decrypt two encryption layers out of three. They claim to break the third key by a statistical-based attack. In order to redirect Tor traffic to the nodes they controlled, they used a [[denial-of-service]] attack. A response to this claim has been published on the official Tor Blog stating that these rumours of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated.<ref name=\"torproject-rumors-exaggerated\" />\n\n===Traffic-analysis attack===\n[[Steven Murdoch|Steven J. Murdoch]] and George Danezis from [[University of Cambridge]] presented an article at the 2005 [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[Symposium]] on security and privacy on traffic-analysis techniques that allow adversaries with only a partial view of the network to infer which nodes are being used to relay the anonymous streams.<ref name=\"ieee-low-cost\" /> These techniques greatly reduce the anonymity provided by Tor. Murdoch and Danezis have also shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator. This attack, however, fails to reveal the identity of the original user.<ref name=\"ieee-low-cost\" /> Murdoch has been working with and has been funded by Tor since 2006.\n\n===Tor exit node block===\nOperators of Internet sites have the ability to prevent traffic from Tor exit nodes or to offer reduced functionality to Tor users. For example, it is not generally possible to edit [[Wikipedia]] when using Tor or when using an IP address that also is used by a Tor exit node, due to the use of the [[mw:Extension:TorBlock|TorBlock]] MediaWiki extension, unless an [[Wikipedia:IP block exemption|exemption]] is obtained. The [[BBC]] blocks the IP addresses of all known Tor guards and exit nodes from its [[iPlayer]] service - however relays and bridges are not blocked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/help/troubleshooting/tv-games-consoles/in_the_uk_message|title=BBC iPlayer Help - Why does BBC iPlayer think I'm outside the UK?|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-10}}</ref>\n\n===Bad apple attack===\nIn March 2011, researchers with the Rocquencourt [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] (Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique, INRIA), documented an attack that is capable of revealing the IP addresses of [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] users on the Tor network. The \"bad apple attack\" exploits Tor's design and takes advantage of insecure application use to associate the simultaneous use of a secure application with the IP address of the Tor user in question. One method of attack depends on control of an exit node or hijacking tracker responses, while a secondary attack method is based in part on the statistical exploitation of [[distributed hash table]] tracking.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" /> According to the study:<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" />\n\nThe results presented in the bad apple attack research paper are based on an attack in the wild launched against the Tor network by the authors of the study. The attack targeted six exit nodes, lasted for 23 days, and revealed a total of 10,000 IP addresses of active Tor users. This study is particularly significant because it is the first documented attack designed to target [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] file-sharing applications on Tor.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" /> BitTorrent may generate as much as 40% of all traffic on Tor.<ref name=\"shining-light\" /> Furthermore, the bad apple attack is effective against insecure use of any application over Tor, not just BitTorrent.<ref name=\"usenix-bad-apple\" />\n\n===Some protocols expose IP addresses===\nResearchers from the [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] (INRIA) showed that the Tor dissimulation technique in [[BitTorrent]] can be bypassed by attackers controlling a Tor exit node. The study was conducted by monitoring six exit nodes for a period of 23 days. Researches used three [[attack vector]]s:<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />\n;Inspection of BitTorrent control messages: Tracker announces and extension protocol handshakes may optionally contain client IP address. Analysis of collected data revealed that 35% and 33% of messages, respectively, contained addresses of clients.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|3}}\n;Hijacking trackers' responses: Due to lack of encryption or authentication in communication between tracker and peer, typical [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s allow attackers to determine peer IP addresses and even verify the distribution of content. Such attacks work when Tor is used only for tracker communication.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|4}}\n;Exploiting distributed hash tables (DHT): This attack exploits the fact that [[distributed hash table]] (DHT) connections through Tor are impossible, so an attacker is able to reveal a target's IP address by looking it up in the DHT even if the target uses Tor to connect to other peers.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />{{rp|4–5}}\n\nWith this technique, researchers were able to identify other streams initiated by users, whose IP addresses were revealed.<ref name=\"manils-compromising\" />\n\n===Sniper attack===\nJansen ''et al''., describe a [[DDoS]] attack targeted at the Tor node software, as well as defenses against that attack and its variants. The attack works using a colluding client and server, and filling the queues of the exit node until the node runs out of memory, and hence can serve no other (genuine) clients. By attacking a significant proportion of the exit nodes this way, an attacker can degrade the network and increase the chance of targets using nodes controlled by the attacker.<ref name=\"andssy-sniper\" />\n\n===Heartbleed bug===\nThe [[Heartbleed bug|Heartbleed]] [[OpenSSL]] [[Computer bug|bug]] disrupted the Tor network for several days in April 2014 while [[private key]]s were renewed. The Tor Project recommended that Tor relay operators and hidden service operators revoke and generate fresh keys after patching OpenSSL, but noted that Tor relays use two sets of keys and that Tor's multi-hop design minimizes the impact of exploiting a single relay.<ref name=\"torproject-openssl-cve\" /> 586 relays later found to be susceptible to the Heartbleed bug were taken off-line as a precautionary measure.<ref name=\"ml-rejecting\" /><ref name=\"torproject-news-20140416\" /><ref name=\"ars-ranks-cut\" /><ref name=\"tp-blacklisting\" />\n\n===Mouse fingerprinting===\nIn March 2016 a security researcher based in [[Barcelona]], demonstrated that laboratory techniques using time measurement via [[JavaScript]] at the 1-[[millisecond]] level<ref name=\"Researcher finds new methods of deanonymizing Tor users\">{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/tor-users-can-be-tracked-based-on-their-mouse-movements-501602.shtml |title=Tor Users Can Be Tracked Based on Their Mouse Movements |website=Softpedia |date=10 March 2016 |accessdate=11 March 2016 |last=Cimpanu |first=Catalin}}</ref> could potentially identify and correlate a user's unique [[computer mouse|mouse]] movements provided that the user has visited the same \"fingerprinting\" website with both the Tor browser and a regular browser.<ref name=\"Click bait\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/viral/335112-tor-mouse-movements-fingerprint/ |title=Click bait: Tor users can be tracked by mouse movements |work=Reuters |date=10 March 2016 |accessdate=10 March 2016 |last=Garanich |first=Gleb}}</ref> This [[proof of concept]] exploits the \"time measurement via JavaScript\" issue which has been an open ticket on the Tor Project for ten months.<ref name=\"Open Ticket for Ten Months\">{{cite web |url=http://news.slashdot.org/story/16/03/11/0045203/tor-users-can-be-tracked-based-on-their-mouse-movements |title=Tor Users Can Be Tracked Based On Their Mouse Movements |website=Slashdot |date=10 March 2016 |accessdate=11 March 2016 |author=Anonymous}}</ref>\n\n===Circuit fingerprinting attack===\n\nIn 2015, the administrators of [[Agora (online marketplace)|Agora]], a [[darknet market]], announced they were taking the site offline in response to a recently discovered security vulnerability in Tor.

In one way or another, human (user) errors can lead to detection. The Tor Project website provides best practices (instructions) on how to properly use the Tor browser. When improperly used, Tor is not secure. For example, Tor warns its users that not all traffic is protected; only the traffic routed through the Tor browser is protected. Users are also warned to use https versions of websites, not to use Tor over Tor, not to [[BitTorrent|torrent]] with Tor, not to enable browser plugins, not to open documents downloaded through Tor while online, and to use safe bridges.<ref>[https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en#warning \"Want Tor to Really Work?\" – Tor Project]</ref> Users are also warned that they cannot provide their name or other revealing information in web forums over Tor and stay anonymous at the same time.<ref name=stayan>{{cite web|title=Tor: Overview – Staying anonymous|url=https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en|accessdate=21 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nDespite intelligence agencies' claims that 80% of Tor users would be de-anonymized within 6 months in the year 2013,<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/08/building-a-new-tor-that-withstands-next-generation-state-surveillance/|title=Building a new Tor that can resist next-generation state surveillance|work=arstechnica.com|accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref> that has still not happened. In fact, as late as September 2016, FBI could not locate, de-anonymize and identify the Tor user who hacked into the email account of a staffer on [[Hillary Clinton]]'s email server.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3771474/Clinton-email-server-hit-dark-web-tools-Hillary-worried-hacked-getting-send-link-porn.html|title=Clinton feared hack after getting porn link sent to her secret email|work=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe best tactic of law enforcement agencies to de-anonymize users appears to remain with Tor-relay adversaries running poisoned nodes, as well as counting on the users themselves using Tor browser improperly. E.g., downloading video through Tor browser and then opening the same file on an unprotected hard drive while online can make the users' real IP addresses available to authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/08/aussie-cops-ran-child-porn-site-for-months-revealed-30-us-ips/|title=Aussie cops ran child porn site for months, revealed 30 US IPs|work=arstechnica.com|accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Odds of detection ===\nWhen properly used, odds of being de-anonymized through Tor are said to be extremely low. Tor project's cofounder Nick Mathewson recently explained that the problem of \"Tor-relay adversaries\" running poisoned nodes means that a theoretical adversary of this kind is not the network's greatest threat:\n\n{{quotation|\"No adversary is truly global, but no adversary needs to be truly global,\" he says. \"Eavesdropping on the entire Internet is a several-billion-dollar problem. Running a few computers to eavesdrop on a lot of traffic, a selective denial of service attack to drive traffic to your computers, that's like a tens-of-thousands-of-dollars problem.\" At the most basic level, an attacker who runs two poisoned Tor nodes—one entry, one exit—is able to analyse traffic and thereby identify the tiny, unlucky percentage of users whose circuit happened to cross both of those nodes. At present the Tor network offers, out of a total of around 7,000 relays, around 2,000 guard (entry) nodes and around 1,000 exit nodes. So the odds of such an event happening are one in two million (1/2000 x 1/1000), give or take.<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\"/>}}\n\nTor does not provide protection against [[end-to-end timing attack]]s: if an attacker can watch the traffic coming out of the target computer, and also the traffic arriving at the target's chosen destination (e.g. a server hosting a .onion site), he can use statistical analysis to discover that they are part of the same circuit.<ref name=stayan/>\n\n=== Levels of security ===\nDepending on individual user needs, Tor browser offers Three levels of security located under Onion tab > Security Settings. In addition to encrypting the data, including constantly changing IP address through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays, several other layers of security are at user's disposal:\n\n'''1. Low (default) – at this security level, all browser features are enabled.'''\n\n– This level provides the most usable experience, and the lowest level of security.\n\n'''2. Medium – at this security level, the following changes apply:'''\n\n– HTML5 video and audio media become click-to-play via NoScript.\n\n– On sites where JavaScript is enabled, performance optimizations are disabled. Scripts on some sites may run slower.\n\n– Some mechanisms of displaying math equations are disabled.\n\n– Some font rendering features are disabled.\n\n– JavaScript is disabled by default on all non-HTTPS sites.\n\n'''3. High – at this security level, these additional changes apply:'''\n\n– JavaScript is disabled by default on all sites.\n\n– Some types of images are disabled.\n\n– Some fonts and icons may display incorrectly.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar| Anarchism |Cryptography |Free software |Freedom of speech |Computer networking |Information technology |Internet |Law enforcement}}\n<!-- please keep
