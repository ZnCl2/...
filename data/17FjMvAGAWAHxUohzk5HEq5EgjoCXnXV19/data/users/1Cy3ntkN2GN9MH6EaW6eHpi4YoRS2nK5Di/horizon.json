The spider works by crawling zeronet pages, then compiling the data it finds into a MySQL database. This data is then exported to JSON, and when the site is started for the first time the JSON is converted back into an efficiently queryable database using [[ZeroNet]]'s built in SQLite functionality.\n\nSearches are then conducted by searching this database via ZeroNet's [[ZeroFrame]] API.\n\n===Search Speed===\n\nComments from blurhy (Sep 25,2018):\n\nI need to find a balance between slow database building and slow query. Also the data is very huge. Maybe Horizon's database is the biggest. I'm improving it now.\n\n===Further Thoughts===\n\nComments from blurhy (Sep 25,2018):\n\nHorizon isn't the final solution to the search problem of zeronet. You would see a lot of result because of it has huge data. If you download the 1.5TB whole zeronet, you will get more result. That spider just crawls keywords and a few phrases. So you can't get any result if you search a sentence.\n\nSo the final problem is <strong>How to search in non-downloaded zites</strong>\n\n* Search in other peers databases.
