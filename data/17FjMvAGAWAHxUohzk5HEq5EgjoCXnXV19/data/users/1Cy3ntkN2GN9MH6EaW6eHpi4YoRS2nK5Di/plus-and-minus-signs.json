Their use has been extended to many other meanings, more or less analogous. ''Plus'' and ''minus'' are [[Latin]] terms meaning \"more\" and \"less\", respectively.\n\n== History ==\nThough the signs now seem as familiar as the [[alphabet]] or the [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]], they are not of great antiquity. The [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]ic sign for addition, for example, resembled a pair of legs walking in the direction in which the text was written ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] could be written either from right to left or left to right), with the reverse sign indicating subtraction:<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Karpinski | first = Louis C.\n | doi = 10.2307/2973180\n | issue = 6\n | journal = [[The American Mathematical Monthly]]\n | mr = 1518824\n | pages = 257–265\n | title = Algebraical Developments Among the Egyptians and Babylonians\n | volume = 24\n | year = 1917}}</ref>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|<hiero>D54</hiero> or <hiero>D55</hiero>\n|}\n\n[[Nicole Oresme]]'s manuscripts from the 14th century show what may be one of the earliest uses of the plus sign \"+\".<ref>[http://educ.ubc.ca/courses/etec540/Sep02/ResearchAssignment/LustigovaZ/ra-LustigovaZ.htm The birth of symbols – Zdena Lustigova, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics Charles University, Prague]</ref>\n\nIn Europe in the early 15th century the letters \"P\" and \"M\" were generally used.<ref name=\"ley196504\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=April 1965\n |title=Symbolically Speaking\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v23n04_1965-04#page/n57/mode/2up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=57-67\n |type=\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Stallings|first=Lynn|date=May 2000|title=A brief history of algebraic notation|journal=School Science and Mathematics|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3667/is_200005/ai_n8885415/|accessdate=13 April 2009}}</ref>\nThe symbols (P with line ''p̄'' for ''più'', i.e., plus, and M with line ''m̄'' for ''meno'', i.e., minus) appeared for the first time in [[Luca Pacioli]]’s mathematics compendium, ''[[Summa de arithmetica|Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalità]]'', first printed and published in [[Venice]] in 1494.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Alan |last=Sangster |first2=Greg |last2=Stoner |first3=Patricia |last3=McCarthy |title=The market for Luca Pacioli’s Summa Arithmetica |journal=Accounting Historians Journal |volume=35 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=111–134 [p. 115] |url=http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/3201/1/final_final_proof_Market_paper_050308.pdf }}</ref> The '''+''' is a simplification of the Latin \"et\" (comparable to the [[ampersand]] '''&''').<ref>{{cite book|last=Cajori|first=Florian|title=A History of Mathematical Notations, Vol. 1|year=1928|publisher=The Open Court Company, Publishers|chapter=Origin and meanings of the signs + and -}}</ref> The '''−''' may be derived from a [[tilde]] written over '''m''' when used to indicate subtraction; or it may come from a shorthand version of the letter m itself.<ref>{{cite book|title=Intermediate Algebra|edition=4th|year=2000|first1=D.

It can also serve as a [[unary operator]] that leaves its [[operand]] [[identity function|unchanged]] (+''x'' means the same as ''x''). This notation may be used when it is desired to emphasize the positiveness of a number, especially when contrasting with the negative (+5 versus −5).\n\nThe plus sign can also indicate many other operations, depending on the mathematical system under consideration. Many [[algebraic structure]]s have some operation which is called, or is equivalent to, addition. It is conventional to use the plus sign to only denote [[commutative property|commutative operation]]s.<ref name=\"Fraleigh\">{{cite book\n | last = Fraleigh\n | first = John B.\n | authorlink =\n | title = A First Course in Abstract Algebra\n | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]]\n | series = \n | volume =\n | edition = 4\n | year = 1989\n | location = United States\n | pages = 52\n | language =\n | url =\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = 0-201-52821-5\n | mr =\n | zbl =\n | jfm = }}</ref> Moreover, the symbolism has been extended to very different operations; plus can also mean:\n* [[exclusive or]] (usually written ⊕): 1 + 1 = 0, 1 + 0 = 1\n* [[logical disjunction]] (usually written ∨): 1 + 1 = 1, 1 + 0 = 1\n\n== Minus sign ==\n\nThe minus sign ('''−''') has three main uses in mathematics:<ref>{{Cite book|\ntitle= The Algebra Lab | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nzukMBV6ReoC&pg=PA9 | author=Henri Picciotto | publisher=Creative Publications | page=9 | isbn=978-0-88488-964-9}}</ref>\n# The [[subtraction]] operator: A [[binary operator]] to indicate the operation of subtraction, as in 5&nbsp;−&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;2. Subtraction is the inverse of addition.\n# Directly [[Sign (mathematics)|in front of]] a number (numeric [[Literal (computer programming)|literal]]) and when it is not a subtraction operator it means a [[negative number]]. For instance −5 is negative 5.\n# A [[unary operator]] that acts as an instruction to replace the operand by its [[additive inverse]]. For example, if ''x'' is 3, then −''x'' is −3, but if ''x'' is −3, then −''x'' is 3. Similarly, −(−2) is equal to&nbsp;2. The above is a special case of this.\n\nAll three uses can be referred to as \"minus\" in everyday speech. In most English-speaking countries, −5 (for example) is normally pronounced \"minus five\", but in modern US usage it is instead sometimes pronounced \"negative five\"; here, \"minus\" may be used by speakers born before 1950, and is still popular in some contexts, but \"negative\" is usually taught as the only correct reading.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The words of mathematics |first=Steven |last=Schwartzman |year=1994 |publisher=The Mathematical Association of America |page=136}}</ref> Further, some textbooks in the United States encourage −''x'' to be read as \"the opposite of ''x''\" or \"the additive inverse of ''x''\" to avoid giving the impression that −''x'' is necessarily negative.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern Mathematics |first=Ruric E. |last=Wheeler |year=2001 |edition=11 |pages=171}}</ref>\n\nIn some contexts, different glyphs are used for these meanings; for instance in the computer language [[APL (programming language)|APL]] and the expression language used by [[Texas Instruments]] graphing calculators (definitely at least the early models including the [[TI-81]] and [[TI-82]]) a raised minus sign is used in negative numbers (as in 2&nbsp;−&nbsp;5 shows <sup>−</sup>3), but such usage is uncommon.\n\nIn mathematics and most programming languages, the rules for the [[order of operations]] mean that −5<sup>2</sup> is equal to −25: Powers bind more strongly than the unary minus, which binds more strongly than multiplication or division. However, in some programming languages and [[Microsoft Excel]] in particular, unary operators bind strongest, so in those cases −5^2 is 25 but 0−5^2 is −25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100788861033.aspx |title=Microsoft Office Excel Calculation operators and precedence |accessdate=2009-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811090433/http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100788861033.aspx |archivedate=2009-08-11 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Use in elementary education ==\n\nSome elementary teachers use raised plus and minus signs before numbers to show they are positive or negative numbers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding by design|author1=Grant P.

For example, B− (\"B minus\") is one grade lower than B. Sometimes this is extended to two plus or minus signs; for example A++ is two grades higher than A.\n\nPositive and negative are sometimes abbreviated as +ve and −ve.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford Handbook of Adult Nursing|first1=George|last1=Castledine|first2=Ann|last2=Close|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780191039676|page=xvii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6icAwAAQBAJ&pg=PR17}}.</ref>\n\nIn mathematics the [[one-sided limit]] ''x''→''a''<sup>+</sup> means ''x'' approaches ''a'' from the right, and ''x''→''a''<sup>−</sup>  means ''x'' approaches ''a'' from the left. For example, when calculating what ''x''<sup>−1</sup> is when ''x'' approaches 0, because ''x''<sup>−1</sup>→[[Extended real number line|+∞]] when ''x''→0<sup>+</sup> but ''x''<sup>−1</sup>→−∞ when ''x''→0<sup>−</sup>.\n\n[[Blood types]] are often qualified with a plus or minus to indicate the presence or absence of the [[Rh factor]]; for instance, A+ means [[ABO blood group system|A-type blood]] with the Rh factor present, while B− means B-type blood with the Rh factor absent.\n\nIn music, [[Augmented triad#Augmented chord table|augmented chord]]s are symbolized with a plus sign, although this practice is not universal as there are other methods for spelling those chords. For example, \"C+\" is read \"C augmented chord\". Also used as [[superscript]].\n\n== Uses in computing ==\n\nAs well as the normal mathematical usage plus and minus may be used for a number of other purposes in computing.\n\nPlus and minus signs are often used in [[tree view]] on a computer screen to show if a folder is collapsed or not.\n\nIn some programming languages, [[concatenation]] of [[string (computer science)|string]]s is written <code>\"a\" + \"b\"</code>, and results in <code>\"ab\"</code>.\n\nIn most programming languages, subtraction and negation are indicated with the ASCII [[hyphen-minus]] character, <code>-</code>. In [[APL (programming language)|APL]] a raised minus sign (Unicode U+00AF) is used to denote a negative number, as in <code>¯3</code>. While in [[J (programming language)|J]] a negative number is denoted by an [[underscore]], as in <code>_5</code>.\n\nIn [[C (programming language)|C]] and some other computer programming languages, two plus signs indicate the [[Increment operator|increment]] operator and two minus signs a decrement. For example, <code>x++</code> means \"increment the value of x by one\" and <code>x--</code> means \"decrement the value of x by one\". By extension, \"++\" is sometimes used in computing terminology to signify an improvement, as in the name of the language [[C++]].\n\nIn [[regular expression]]s, \"+\" is used to indicate \"1 or more\" in a pattern to be matched. For example, \"x+\" means \"one or more of the letter x\".\n\nThere is no concept of negative zero in mathematics, but in computing [[−0 (number)|−0]] may have a separate representation from zero. In the [[IEEE floating-point standard]], 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;−0 is [[negative infinity]] (−∞) whereas 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;0 is [[Infinity|positive infinity]] ([[∞]]).\n\n== Other uses ==\n\nIn chemistry, the minus sign (rather than an [[en dash]]) is used for a [[covalent bond|single covalent bond]] between two atoms, as in the [[skeletal formula]].\n\nSubscripted plus and minus signs are used as diacritics in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] to indicate [[Relative articulation|advanced or retracted articulations]] of speech sounds.\n\nThe minus sign is also used as tone letter in the orthographies of [[Dan language|Dan]], [[Krumen language|Krumen]], [[Karaboro languages|Karaboro]], [[Mwan language|Mwan]], [[Wan language|Wan]], [[Yaouré]], [[Wè language|Wè]], [[Nyabwa language|Nyabwa]] and [[Godie language|Godié]].<ref>Hartell, Rhonda L., ed. (1993), ''The Alphabets of Africa''. Dakar: UNESCO and SIL.</ref> The Unicode character used for the tone letter (U+02D7) is different from the mathematical minus sign.\n\nIn the [[Algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic notation]] used to record games of [[chess]], the plus sign (+) is used to denote a move that puts the opponent into [[Check (chess)|check]].  A double plus (++) is  sometimes used to denote [[double check]].  Combinations of the plus and minus signs are used to evaluate a move (+/&minus;, +/=, =/+, &minus;/+).\n\n== Character codes ==\n\n[[File:Plus Minus Hyphen-minus.svg|thumb|Plus, minus, and hyphen-minus.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

It is usually shorter in length than the plus sign and sometimes at a different height. It can be used as a substitute for the true minus sign when the character set is limited to [[ASCII]]. Most programming languages and other computer readable languages do this, since ASCII is generally available as a subset of most character encodings, while U+2212 is a Unicode feature only.\n\nThere is a '''commercial minus sign''' (⁒), which looks somewhat like an [[obelus]], at U+2052 (HTML <tt>&amp;#x2052;</tt>).\n\nThe <code>&amp;plus;</code> entity is HTML 5.\n\n{{Hatnote|For detailed distinctions between minus signs and dashes, see {{section link|Dash|Similar Unicode characters}}.}}\n\n=== Alternative plus sign ===\n{{See also|Up tack}}\n<div style=\"float:right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px; padding:40px; font-size:100%; font-family: Georgia; background-color: #ddddff; border: 1px solid #aaaaff;\">[[File:Altplus.svg|50px]]</div>\nA [[Jew]]ish tradition that dates from at least the 19th century is to write ''plus'' using a symbol like an inverted T.<ref name=JE>{{cite book|author=Kaufmann Kohler|editor=[[Cyrus Adler]] et al.|title=Jewish Encyclopedia|chapter=Cross|year=1901–1906|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4776-cross}}</ref> This practice was adopted into [[Israel]]i schools and is still commonplace today in [[elementary school]]s (including [[secular]] schools) but in fewer [[secondary school]]s.<ref name=\"University of California\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=m8sWAAAAIAAJ&dq=Jewish+plus+sign&q=%22plus+sign+used+in+mathematics%22&pgis=1 Christian-Jewish Dialogue: Theological Foundations By Peter von der Osten-Sacken (1986 – Fortress Press)] {{ISBN|0-8006-0771-6}} \"In Israel the plus sign used in mathematics is represented by a horizontal stroke with a vertical hook instead of the sign otherwise used all over the world, because the latter is reminiscent of a cross.\" (Page 96)</ref> It is also used occasionally in books by religious authors, but most books for adults use the international symbol \"+\".
