Larger groups may live in a [[nursing home]], [[Orphanage|children's home]], [[convent]] or any similar institution. A [[Homestead (buildings)|homestead]] also includes agricultural land and facilities for [[domesticated animals]]. Where more secure [[dwelling]]s are not available, people may live in the informal and sometimes illegal [[shack]]s found in [[slums]] and [[shanty town]]s. More generally, \"home\" may be considered to be a geographic area, such as a [[town]], [[village]], [[suburb]], [[city]], or [[country]].\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2013}}\nThe earliest homes that humans inhabited were likely naturally occurring features such as [[cave]]s. [[File:Taino petroglyph in cave.jpg|thumb|[[Taíno people|Taíno]] [[petroglyph]]s in a cave in Puerto Rico]]\nThroughout history, primitive peoples have made use of caves. The earliest human [[fossil]]s found in caves come from a series of caves near Krugersdorp and Mokopane in South Africa. The cave sites of [[Sterkfontein]], [[Swartkrans]], [[Kromdraai]] B, [[Drimolen]], [[Malapa]], Cooper's D, Gladysvale, Gondolin and Makapansgat have yielded a range of early human species dating back to between three and one million years ago, including ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'', ''7[[Australopithecus sediba]]'' and ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]''. However, it is not generally thought that these early humans were living in the caves, but that they were brought into the caves by carnivores that had killed them.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe first early hominid ever found in Africa, the [[Taung Child]] in 1924, was also thought for many years to come from a cave, where it had been deposited after being preyed upon by an eagle. However, this is now debated.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=23633001|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3edc/5e48456933d919bc305583c2762fa107c991.pdf|year=2013|last1=Hopley|first1=P.J.|title=Brief communication: Beyond the South African cave paradigm – ''Australopithecus africanus'' from Plio-Pleistocene paleosol deposits at Taung|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=151|issue=2|pages=316–324|last2=Herries|first2=A.I.|last3=Baker|first3=S.E.|last4=Kuhn|first4=B.F.|last5=Menter|first5=C.G.|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22272|access-date=22 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922101559/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3edc/5e48456933d919bc305583c2762fa107c991.pdf|archive-date=22 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Caves do form in the dolomite of the [[Ghaap Plateau]], including the Early, Middle and Later Stone Age site of [[Wonderwerk Cave]]; however, the caves that form along the escarpment's edge, like that hypothesised for the Taung Child, are formed within a secondary limestone deposit called [[tufa]]. There is numerous evidence for other early human species inhabiting caves from at least one million years ago in different parts of the world, including ''[[Homo erectus]]'' in China at [[Zhoukoudian]], ''[[Homo rhodesiensis]]'' in South Africa at the Cave of Hearths ([[Makapansgat]]), ''[[Homo neandertalensis]]'' and ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' in Europe at [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca]], ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' in Indonesia, and the [[Denisovans]] in southern Siberia.\n\nIn southern Africa, early modern humans regularly used sea caves as shelter starting about 180,000 years ago when they learned to exploit the sea for the first time.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17943129|year=2007|last1=Marean|first1=C.W.|title=Early human use of marine resources and pigment in South Africa during the Middle Pleistocene|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5902752_Early_human_use_of_marine_resources_and_pigment_in_South_Africa_during_the_Middle_Pleistocene|journal=Nature|volume=449|issue=7164|pages=905–908|last2=Bar-Matthews|first2=M.|last3=Bernatchez|first3=J.|last4=Fisher|first4=E.|last5=Goldberg|first5=P.|last6=Herries|first6=A.I.|last7=Jacobs|first7=Z.|last8=Jerardino|first8=A.|last9=Karkanas|first9=P.|last10=Minichillo|first10=T.|last11=Nilssen|first11=P.J.|last12=Thompson|first12=E.|last13=Watts|first13=I.|last14=Williams|first14=H.M.|doi=10.1038/nature06204|access-date=22 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922101726/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5902752_Early_human_use_of_marine_resources_and_pigment_in_South_Africa_during_the_Middle_Pleistocene|archive-date=22 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The oldest known site is PP13B at [[Pinnacle Point]]. This may have allowed rapid expansion of humans out of Africa and colonization of areas of the world such as Australia by 60–50,000 years ago. Throughout southern Africa, Australia, and Europe, early modern humans used caves and rock shelters as sites for rock art, such as those at [[Giants Castle]]. Caves such as the [[yaodong]] in China were used for shelter; other caves were used for burials (such as [[rock-cut tombs]]), or as religious sites (such as [[:Category:Buddhist caves|Buddhist caves]]).

In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, [[List of domesticated animals|domestic animals]] such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans. The social unit that lives in a house is known as a [[household]]. Most commonly, a household is a [[family]] unit of some kind, although households may also be other [[Group (sociology)|social groups]] or individuals. The design and structure of homes is also subject to change as a consequence of globalization, [[urbanization]] and other social, economic, demographic, and technological reasons. Various other cultural factors also influence the building style and patterns of domestic space.\n\nA [[terraced house]]{{efn|also known as a terrace house ([[British English|UK]]), townhouse ([[American English|US]]), row houses or linked houses}} is a style of [[medium-density housing]] where a row of identical or mirror-image houses share side walls, while [[semi-detached]] housing consists of pairs of houses built side-by-side or (less commonly) back-to-back,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227213313/https://www.ura.gov.sg/circulars/text/dchbr/pt1landedhousing-dchbr.pdf |title=Landed Housing |publisher=Ura.gov.sg |date=2018-03-08 |accessdate=2018-05-08}}</ref> sharing a [[party wall]] and with mirrored layouts.\n\nAn [[apartment]] (in [[Comparison of American and British English#Levels of buildings|American English]]) or a flat (in [[British English]]) is a self-contained housing unit (a type of residential [[real estate]]) that occupies only part of a [[building]]. Such a building may be called an ''apartment building'', ''apartment house'' (in American English), ''block of flats'', ''[[tower block]]'', ''high-rise'' or, occasionally ''mansion block'' (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for [[Renting|rent]]. In Scotland it is called a block of flats or if it's a traditional sandstone building a ''tenement'', which has a pejorative connotation elsewhere. Apartments may be owned by an ''owner/occupier'' by leasehold tenure or rented by ''tenants'' (two types of [[housing tenure]]).\n\nA [[Homestead (buildings)|homestead]] consists of a [[dwelling]], often a [[farm house]], together with other buildings and associated land, and facilities for [[domesticated animals]].
