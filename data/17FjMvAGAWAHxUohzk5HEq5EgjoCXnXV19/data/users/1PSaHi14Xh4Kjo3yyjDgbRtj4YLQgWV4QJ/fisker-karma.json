Johnson noted that it is probably one of the first production cars that actually looks like the [[concept car|concept version]] that is sketched beforehand, saying, \"It's a cracking looking jam-jar\".

Of the 239 cars, fewer than fifty had been delivered to customers, the rest were in dealerships, and at that time no car had been involved in a fire. In the report filed by Fisker Automotive with the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA), the carmaker said some hose clamps were not properly positioned, which could allow a coolant leak. \"If coolant enters the battery compartment an electrical short could possibly occur, causing a thermal event within the battery, including a possible fire in the [worst] case.\" The problem was discovered on 16 December at the Valmet Automotive assembly plant in Finland when workers noticed coolant dripping.<ref name=DT123011>{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20111230/AUTO01/112300333/1148/rss25|title=Fisker recalls plug-in hybrids; EV safety concerns revived |author=David Shepardson|work=[[The Detroit News]]|date=30 December 2011|access-date=2012-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author= Allan Graubæk|url=http://politiken.dk/tjek/ECE1493453/fiskers-luksusbil-kaldt-retur-i-usa/|title=Fisker's luxury car recalled in USA|work=Politiken|date=30 December 2011|access-date=2011-12-30|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/30/fisker-recalling-239-karma-electric-cars-for-fire-hazard/?ref=automobiles|title=Fisker Recalling 239 Karma Plug-In Hybrids for Fire Hazard |author=Christopher Jensen|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=30 December 2011|access-date=2012-01-02}}</ref><ref name=R92961>{{cite web|url=http://www.car-recall.com/Fisker/Karma/2012/92961?|title=2012 Fisker Karma Recall|date=28 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 January 2012, Fisker announced that most customer cars and cars stocked in dealerships affected by the recall involving [[A123 Systems]]-supplied battery packs are back in service.

Initially, a [[Fisker Automotive]] spokesman said the company \"''can't be certain exactly what happened at the port''\" but \"''we think being submerged in 13 feet of saltwater had something to do with it''\". The carmaker clarified that the Karmas were not charging at the time of the fire and there were no injuries. In the case of the Toyota's incident, a Prius PHV burned and two other Prius, a conventional hybrid and a plug-in, just smoldered. A Toyota spokeswoman said the fire \"''likely started because saltwater got into the electrical system''\".

Johnson noted that it is probably one of the first production cars that actually looks like the [[concept car|concept version]] that is sketched beforehand, saying, \"It's a cracking looking jam-jar\". May noticed similarities in the hybrid-powertrain to his own idea that was used in a segment for ''Top Gear'' a few years earlier (The ''Hammerhead Eagle i-Thrust''), though he admits that his idea was very crudely executed.

Of the 239 cars, fewer than fifty had been delivered to customers, the rest were in dealerships, and at that time no car had been involved in a fire. In the report filed by Fisker Automotive with the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA), the carmaker said some hose clamps were not properly positioned, which could allow a coolant leak. \"If coolant enters the battery compartment an electrical short could possibly occur, causing a thermal event within the battery, including a possible fire in the [worst] case.\" The problem was discovered on 16 December at the Valmet Automotive assembly plant in Finland when workers noticed coolant dripping.<ref name=DT123011>{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20111230/AUTO01/112300333/1148/rss25|title=Fisker recalls plug-in hybrids; EV safety concerns revived |author=David Shepardson|work=[[The Detroit News]]|date=30 December 2011|access-date=2012-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author= Allan Graubæk|url=http://politiken.dk/tjek/ECE1493453/fiskers-luksusbil-kaldt-retur-i-usa/|title=Fisker's luxury car recalled in USA|work=Politiken|date=30 December 2011|access-date=2011-12-30|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/30/fisker-recalling-239-karma-electric-cars-for-fire-hazard/?ref=automobiles|title=Fisker Recalling 239 Karma Plug-In Hybrids for Fire Hazard |author=Christopher Jensen|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=30 December 2011|access-date=2012-01-02}}</ref><ref name=R92961>{{cite web|url=http://www.car-recall.com/Fisker/Karma/2012/92961?|title=2012 Fisker Karma Recall|date=28 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 January 2012, Fisker announced that most customer cars and cars stocked in dealerships affected by the recall involving [[A123 Systems]]-supplied battery packs are back in service.

Initially, a [[Fisker Automotive]] spokesman said the company \"''can't be certain exactly what happened at the port''\" but \"''we think being submerged in 13 feet of saltwater had something to do with it''\". The carmaker clarified that the Karmas were not charging at the time of the fire and there were no injuries. In the case of the Toyota's incident, a Prius PHV burned and two other Prius, a conventional hybrid and a plug-in, just smoldered. A Toyota spokeswoman said the fire \"''likely started because saltwater got into the electrical system''\".
