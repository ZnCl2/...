It is often a [[house]], [[apartment]], or other [[building]], or alternatively a [[mobile home]], [[houseboat]], [[yurt]] or any other portable shelter. A principle of [[constitutional law]] in many countries, related to the [[right to privacy]] enshrined in article 12 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights<ref>http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf</ref> is the inviolability of the home as an individual's [[Shelter (building)|place of shelter and refuge]].\n\nHomes typically provide areas and facilities for sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene. Larger groups may live in a [[nursing home]], [[Orphanage|children's home]], [[convent]] or any similar institution. A [[Homestead (buildings)|homestead]] also includes agricultural land and facilities for [[domesticated animals]]. Where more secure [[dwelling]]s are not available, people may live in the informal and sometimes illegal [[shack]]s found in [[slums]] and [[shanty town]]s. More generally, \"home\" may be considered to be a geographic area, such as a [[town]], [[village]], [[suburb]], [[city]], or [[country]].\n\nTransitory accommodation in a treatment facility for a few weeks is not normally considered permanent enough to replace a more stable location as 'home'.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In 2005, 100 million people worldwide were estimated to be [[homelessness|homeless]].\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=November 2013}}\nBuildings such as [[Hut (dwelling)|huts]] and [[longhouse]]s have been used for living since the late [[Neolithic]].<ref name=\"Skara Brae\">{{cite web | url=http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/skarabrae/ | title=Skara Brae | publisher=Orkneyjar | accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt is unknown when the first mansion was built because there is no way to know for sure, but it is believed to have origins as a type of palace during the Mesopotamian period.<ref name=\"Quora.com\">{{cite web | url=https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-first-mansion-ever-built-on-the-entire-globe | title=What is the first mansion ever built on the entire globe? | publisher= Austin Bennett | accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n{{expand section|date=July 2015}}\n{{further|List of human habitation forms}}\n\n===Buildings===\n[[File:Hancock-homestead-settler.jpg|thumb|1910 American homestead]]\nA [[house]] is a [[building]] that functions as a home for [[human]]s <ref>American Shelter: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the American Home By Les Walker.

In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, [[List of domesticated animals|domestic animals]] such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans. The social unit that lives in a house is known as a [[household]]. Most commonly, a household is a [[family]] unit of some kind, although households may also be other [[Group (sociology)|social groups]] or individuals. The design and structure of homes is also subject to change as a consequence of globalization, urbanization and other social, economic, demographic, and technological reasons. Various other cultural factors also influence the building style and patterns of domestic space.\n\nA [[terraced house]]{{efn|also known as a terrace house ([[British English|UK]]), townhouse ([[American English|US]]), row houses or linked houses}} is a style of [[medium-density housing]] where a row of identical or mirror-image houses share side walls, while [[semi-detached]] housing consists of pairs of houses built side-by-side or (less commonly) back-to-back,<ref>https://www.ura.gov.sg/circulars/text/dchbr/pt1landedhousing-dchbr.pdf</ref> sharing a [[party wall]] and with mirrored layouts.\n\nAn [[apartment]] (in [[Comparison of American and British English#Levels of buildings|American English]]) or a flat (in [[British English]]) is a self-contained housing unit (a type of residential [[real estate]]) that occupies only part of a [[building]]. Such a building may be called an ''apartment building'', ''apartment house'' (in American English), ''block of flats'', ''[[tower block]]'', ''high-rise'' or, occasionally ''mansion block'' (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for [[Renting|rent]]. In Scotland it is called a block of flats or if it's a traditional sandstone building a ''tenement'', which has a pejorative connotation elsewhere. Apartments may be owned by an ''owner/occupier'' by leasehold tenure or rented by ''tenants'' (two types of [[housing tenure]]).\n\nA [[Homestead (buildings)|homestead]] consists of a [[dwelling]], often a [[farm house]], together with other buildings and associated land, and facilities for [[domesticated animals]].\n\n===Portable shelter===\n[[File:LakeUnionHouseboat.jpg|thumb|A [[houseboat]] on [[Lake Union]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]]]\n[[File:2006-10-Hausboot-Mississippi-037 34A.jpg|thumb|houseboat at the Mississippi]]\n[[File:17-GMC-Vandura-Chevrolet-G30-Daniela-Kloth-IMG 4026.JPG|thumb|Campervan as a mobile home]]\n*[[Mobile home]]\n*[[Houseboat]]\n*[[Yurt]]\n*[[Campervan]]\n\n===For larger groups===\n*[[Orphanage|Children's home]]\n*[[Convent]]\n\n===Informal===\n[[File:Homeless in LA.jpg|right|thumb|Makeshift homes in [[Los Angeles]]]]\n*[[Shack]]s found in [[slums]] and [[shanty town]]s\n\n==Occupants==\n{{expand section|date=July 2015}}\n{{further|Household|Roommate}}\nA home's occupants may be a single [[person|individual]], a [[family]], [[household]], or [[Longhouse|several families in a tribe]].

This category includes persons living in the streets without a shelter that would fall within the scope of living quarters.\n*(b) Secondary homelessness. This category may include persons with no place of usual residence who move frequently between various types of accommodations (including dwellings, shelters, and institutions for the homeless or other living quarters). This category includes persons living in private dwellings but reporting ‘no usual address’ on their census form.\n\nIn 2005, 100 million people worldwide were estimated to be [[homelessness|homeless]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/12/homelessness_around_the_world.html|title=Homelessness around the world|work=Boston Globe|date=14 December 2011}}</ref> although some prefer the term 'houseless' or 'unsheltered'.\n\n==Psychological significance==\nA home is generally a place that is close to the heart of the owner, and can become a prized possession.
