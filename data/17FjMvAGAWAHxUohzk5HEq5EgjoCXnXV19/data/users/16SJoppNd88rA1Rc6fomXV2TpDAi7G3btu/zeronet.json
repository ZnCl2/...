Site developers can also write sites in [[CoffeeScript]] instead of write in JavaScript, but they need to compile the .coffee files. ZeroNet can compile to JavaScript in development mode, so all .coffee files are compiled and saved to all.js file. This also supports compiling .sass files to CSS (also compiles to all.css).\n\n[[PHP]] is not supported, although ZeroNet can achieve user signup/login on [[MySQL]] databases, that are also distributed via [[P2P]].\n\nWith plugins and the [[ZeroFrame]] [[API]], sites can communicate with ZeroNet calling [[Python (programming language)|Python]] by JavaScript.\n\n== Sites ==\n\n* The BitTorrent website [[Play (p2p website)|Play]] hosts a magnet link repository on ZeroNet, which links to copyrighted content.<ref name=\":0\" /> There is a Reddit community which offers support for ZeroNet.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* On 11 August 2016<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://decentralize.today/new-version-0-4-0-zerome-social-site-de455aea85c1|title=New ZeroNet version: 0.4.0 + ZeroMe decentralized, P2P social site|date=2016-08-11|work=Decentralize Today|access-date=2018-09-14}}</ref>, [https://www.socialmediaalternatives.org/archive/collections/show/34 ZeroMe] has been launched as ZeroNet's first social network, based on [[Twitter]].
