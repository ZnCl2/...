Although there were about 70 people on the train, and Linsley apparently fought and injured her attacker, only one passenger reported hearing anything suspicious. The killer has not been identified. Stored blood evidence from the scene allowed the case to be re-examined a decade later using DNA technology, and in 2002 it was re-opened with a major publicity campaign. A police reward is on offer.\n\n==Background==\nDeborah \"Debbie\" Linsley was born in [[Bromley]], southeast London, in 1962 to Arthur and Marguerite Linsley. Her father was a retired [[insurance broker]], and Marguerite investigated fraud for the [[Department of Social Security (United Kingdom)|Department of Social Security]] (DSS).{{sfn|Rayner|2003}} By 1988, Deborah had moved out and was living and working in [[Edinburgh]] as a [[hotel manager]].{{sfn|BBC News|2013}}{{sfn|STV|2018}} She had returned to London to attend a hotel management course,{{sfn|Tanna|2013}} and stayed at her parents' house in Bromley.{{Sfn|Boseley|1988|p=4}} She also visited her brother Gordon, at whose wedding in two weeks she would have been a bridesmaid.{{sfn|BBC News|2013}}\n\nOn the afternoon of Wednesday 23 March,{{Sfn|Illustrated London News|1988|p=14}} Gordon gave Deborah a lift to Petts Wood station,{{sfn|Rayner|2003}}\nwhere she boarded the [[Orpington station|Orpington]]-to-London train at 14:16.{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} The intermediate stops en route to London were [[Bickley railway station|Bickley]], [[Bromley South railway station|Bromley South]], [[Shortlands railway station|Shortlands]], [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], [[Kent House railway station|Kent House]], [[Penge East railway station|Penge East]], [[Sydenham Hill railway station|Sydenham Hill]], [[West Dulwich railway station|West Dulwich]], [[Herne Hill railway station|Herne Hill]] and [[Brixton railway station|Brixton]],{{Sfn|Boseley|1988|p=4}} with arrival at Victoria scheduled for 14:50.{{sfn|BBC News|2013}}\n\nThe train was a [[4EPB]] [[electric multiple unit]] with [[Compartment coach|compartment stock]]{{sfn|Rayner|2003}}{{Sfn|NSERS|2016|p=}} made up of a mixture of carriage types. Some had compartments opening off a common corridor running the length of one side of the carriage; others had unconnected compartments seating twelve, each with a door on each side opening directly to the outside and no means of moving from compartment to compartment within the train.{{sfn|STV|2018}}{{sfn|Newcastle Journal|1988|p=3}}{{sfn|BellyTelly|2018}} The carriage Linsley was in was of the latter type, and she may have chosen it because it was one of the few in which smoking was permitted.{{sfn|The Times|1988c|p=2}} Following the murder, British Rail emphasised that trains always had at least some corridor-type carriages to give passengers a choice of corridor or non-corridor compartments.{{Sfn|Boseley|1988|p=4}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Lewisham. - geograph.org.uk - 103531.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|alt=A similar train to on which Linsley was killed, seen at Lewisham station six years later|A British Rail [[4EPB]] train similar to the one on which Linsley was killed]]\nAt some point before the journey ended, Linsley was stabbed to death. She sustained eleven stab wounds{{sfn|Rayner|2003}} to the face, neck and abdomen,{{sfn|Tanna|2013}} of which at least five were to the area around the heart.{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} One of these wounds was the cause of death.{{sfn|Tanna|2013}} When the train arrived on to Victoria's platform two at 14:50,{{sfn|BellyTelly|2018}} a [[British Rail]] [[Porter (railroad)|porter]]{{sfn|Tanna|2013}} (as was customary) walked through the train. The carriage floor and seat were covered in blood.{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} Some of this was discovered to be that of Linsley's killer, who had been injured in the struggle.{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} Linsley had [[Defense wound|defence wounds]] on her hands,{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} and a spokesman for [[Scotland Yard]] said that she may have been trying to defend herself from a sex attack,{{sfn|Sapsted|1988|p=3}} though police did not find any evidence of sexual interference.{{sfn|O'Hanlon|1988|p=3}}\n\nLinsley's funeral took place at Holy Trinity Church, Bromley, on 22 April, and she was buried in a nearby cemetery. The cortege was accompanied by a police escort between the church and cemetery,{{Sfn|LBC|1988b|p=}} where Deborah Linsley was buried in the bridesmaid's dress she was to have worn at her brother's wedding.{{sfn|Tanna|2013}} \n\nBritish Rail had been slowly phasing out carriages of the type in which Linsley died, and within a week of the murder it announced that the number used on [[off-peak]] journeys—such as Linsley had been travelling on—would be reduced in order to minimise the chance of passengers being isolated.{{Sfn|The Guardian|1988|p=2}} A thick red band was painted along the cantrail of coaches without corridors to allow passengers to identify them before boarding.{{Sfn|NSERS|2016}}\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe Metropolitan Police's [[Murder Investigation Team|senior investigating officer]], [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] Guy Mills{{Sfn|Boseley|1988|p=4}} described the crime as \"savage and brutal\".{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} He highlighted that because the compartment Linsley was travelling in had no corridor, she had had no means of escape, \"apart from through the side doors onto the track\".{{Sfn|Boseley|1988|p=4}} On account of the ferocity of the attack, Mills suggested that it was unlikely to have been the killer's first.{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} The short duration of the Brixton{{ndash}}Victoria journey{{snd}}six minutes{{snd}}suggested Linsley might have known her attacker.{{sfn|Rayner|2003}}\n\n[[File:Victoria Station geograph-4047117-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|alt=London Victoria station in May 1988|thumb|upright=2|Victoria Station's [[concourse]] (May 1988) seen from around platform 2, where Linsley's train arrived]]\n\nAlthough approximately 70 people had boarded and departed the train by the time it arrived at Victoria,{{sfn|Rayner|2003}} the only potential witness{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} appears to have been a French [[au pair]]{{sfn|Rayner|2003}} who reported hearing loud screams soon after the train had departed [[Brixton railway station|Brixton]].{{sfn|BBC News|2013}}\n\nOf interest to police were the following individuals:\n*A passenger described as \"a short, stocky man seen jumping from the train\" at Victoria.{{Sfn|Newcastle Journal|1988|p=3}}\n*A man seen leaving a compartment of the train at [[Penge East railway station|Penge East]], before reboarding, possibly into Linsley's coach.{{sfn|The Times|1988b|p=4}}\n*A passenger described by police as a \"scruffy man with dirty blond hair\" who alighted from the train at Penge East. Police released an [[artist's impression]] of this man.{{Sfn|The Observer|1988|p=2}}\n*A man seen staring at women boarding the train at Orpington.{{Sfn|Boseley|1988|p=4}}\n\nThe weapon was not found, but it is believed to have been five to seven-and-one-half inches long with a heavy blade.{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} The 1988 police investigation produced 1200 [[Witness statement|witness statements]]; 650 individuals were questioned and ruled out.{{sfn|STV|2018}}{{sfn|BellyTelly|2018}} The case was featured on the crime reconstruction programme ''[[Crimewatch UK]]'' on 14 April 1988.{{sfn|The Times|1988d|p=21}}\n\nAn inquest was held on 16 November 1988. The au pair who heard the attack was criticized by the Coroner for not pulling the [[communication cord]], despite believing that someone was being raped. She said she had been \"glued to her seat\" and contacted police only after she learned that a murder had occurred. The coroner highlighted that, although passengers reported hearing \"a commotion\", nobody investigated. A verdict of unlawful killing was returned.{{sfn|O'Hanlon|1988|p=3}}\n\nIn response to Linsley's murder, [[Eastern Region of British Railways|British Rail's Eastern Region]] ordered its [[Conductor (rail)|guards]] to proactively patrol their trains and be particularly observant for women travelling alone. Likewise, the police advised that passengers should be vigilant on the railway generally, but particularly to \"avoid [carriages] where the only means of escape was directly onto the line or platform\".{{Sfn|Newcastle Journal|1988|p=3}}\n\n===Case reopened===\nLinsley's killer had sustained injuries and left blood at the scene, which was collected and stored. DNA science was in its infancy in 1988,{{sfn|BBC Newsnight|2009}} but with advances in [[DNA profiling]] technology, the case was re-opened in 2002{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} and a complete DNA profile built from the sample.{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} Linsley's case was raised on the ''[[Tonight with Trevor MacDonald]]'' programme which aired on 13 September 2002.{{sfn|The Times|2002|p=27}}\n\nThe new investigation case was passed to the Met's [[cold case]] investigative section, formed in 2000.{{sfn|Rayner|2003}} An extensive publicity campaign was launched in Victoria station, and there was a peak-time television crime-scene reenactment.{{sfn|BBC News|2002}} \n\nIn 2013 the leading officer on the case called it \"puzzling\" that the DNA of Linsley's killer, who was \"a probable repeat violent offender\" had not been matched to anyone in the DNA database.{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} That same year, police offered a reward of [[£]]20,000 for information{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer.{{sfn|Tanna|2013}} The new investigation also re-examined steps taken in the previous investigation, including tracing Linsley's seventy fellow passengers that day; police say they know the identities of at least fifty of them.{{sfn|Rayner|2003}}\n\nDeborah Linsley's parents publicly appealed several times for the assistance of the public in solving her death.{{sfn|STV|2018}} Her mother had died by 2013.{{sfn|Tanna|2013}}\n\nA detective has suggested more recently that not only was the attacker injured and probably bloodied but likely \"behaved in a different way after the murder\", which friends or relatives may have noticed at the time.{{sfn|Tanna|2013}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[1988 in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Crime in London]]\n*[[List of unsolved

She said she had been \"glued to her seat\" and contacted police only after she learned that a murder had occurred. The coroner highlighted that, although passengers reported hearing \"a commotion\", nobody investigated. A verdict of unlawful killing was returned.{{sfn|O'Hanlon|1988|p=3}}\n\nIn response to Linsley's murder, [[Eastern Region of British Railways|British Rail's Eastern Region]] ordered its [[Conductor (rail)|guards]] to proactively patrol their trains and be particularly observant for women travelling alone. Likewise, the police advised that passengers should be vigilant on the railway generally, but particularly to \"avoid [carriages] where the only means of escape was directly onto the line or platform\".{{Sfn|Newcastle Journal|1988|p=3}}\n\n===Case reopened===\nLinsley's killer had sustained injuries and left blood at the scene, which was collected and stored. DNA science was in its infancy in 1988,{{sfn|BBC Newsnight|2009}} but with advances in [[DNA profiling]] technology, the case was re-opened in 2002{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} and a complete DNA profile built from the sample.{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} Linsley's case was raised on the ''[[Tonight with Trevor MacDonald]]'' programme which aired on 13 September 2002.{{sfn|The Times|2002|p=27}}\n\nThe new investigation case was passed to the Met's [[cold case]] investigative section, formed in 2000.{{sfn|Rayner|2003}} An extensive publicity campaign was launched in Victoria station, and there was a peak-time television crime-scene reenactment.{{sfn|BBC News|2002}} \n\nIn 2013 the leading officer on the case called it \"puzzling\" that the DNA of Linsley's killer, who was \"a probable repeat violent offender\" had not been matched to anyone in the DNA database.{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} That same year, police offered a reward of [[£]]20,000 for information{{sfn|BBC News|2013}} leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer.{{sfn|Tanna|2013}} The new investigation also re-examined steps taken in the previous investigation, including tracing Linsley's seventy fellow passengers that day; police say they know the identities of at least fifty of them.{{sfn|Rayner|2003}}\n\nDeborah Linsley's parents publicly appealed several times for the assistance of the public in solving her death.{{sfn|STV|2018}} Her mother had died by 2013.{{sfn|Tanna|2013}}\n\nA detective has suggested more recently that not only was the attacker injured and probably bloodied but likely \"behaved in a different way after the murder\", which friends or relatives may have noticed at the time.{{sfn|Tanna|2013}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[1988 in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Crime in London]]\n*[[List of unsolved
