In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs. It is often argued that federal states where the central government has the constitutional authority to suspend a constituent state's government by invoking gross mismanagement or civil unrest, or to adopt national legislation that overrides or infringe on the constituent states' powers by invoking the central government's constitutional authority to ensure \"peace and good government\" or to implement obligations contracted under an international treaty, are not truly federal states.\n\nThe governmental or constitutional structure found in a federation is considered to be federalist, or to be an example of [[federalism]]. It can be considered the opposite of another system, the [[unitary state]]. [[France]], for example, has been unitary for multiple centuries. [[Austria]] and its ''[[States of Austria|Bundesländer]]'' was a unitary state with [[administrative division]]s that became federated through the implementation of the [[Constitution of Austria|Austrian Constitution]] following the 1918 collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]]. [[Germany]], with its 16 [[states of Germany|states, or ''Bundesländer'']], is an example of a federation. Federations are often [[ethnic group|multiethnic]] and cover a large area of territory (such as [[Russia]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[India]], or [[Brazil]]), but neither is necessarily the case (such as [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]]).\n\nSeveral ancient chiefdoms and kingdoms, such as the 4th-century BCE [[League of Corinth]], [[Noricum]] in [[Central Europe]], and the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy]] in [[pre-Columbian North America]], could be described as federations or [[confederation]]s. The [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] was an early example of formal non-unitary statehood.\n\nSeveral colonies and dominions in the [[New World]] consisted of autonomous provinces, transformed to federal states upon independence such as the [[United States]], and various countries in [[Latin America]] (see [[Spanish American wars of independence]]). Some of the New World federations failed; the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] broke up into independent states less than 20 years after its founding. Others, such as [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]], have shifted between federal, [[Confederation|confederal]], and unitary systems, before settling into federalism. [[Brazil]] became a federation only after the fall of [[Brazilian Empire|the monarchy]], and [[Venezuela]] became a federation after the [[Federal War]]. Australia and Canada are also federations.\n\nGermany is another [[nation-state]] that has switched between confederal, federal and unitary rules, since the [[German Confederation]] was founded in 1815. The [[North German Confederation]], the succeeding [[German Empire]] and the [[Weimar Republic]] were federations.\n\nFounded in 1922, the [[Soviet Union]] was formally a federation of [[republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], [[Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union|autonomous republics]] and other federal subjects, though in practice highly centralized under the [[government of the Soviet Union]]. The [[Russia|Russian Federation]] has inherited a similar system.\n\n[[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Malaysia]] (then [[Federation of Malaya]]) became federations on or shortly before becoming independent from the [[British Empire]].\n\nIn some recent cases, federations have been instituted as a measure to handle [[ethnic conflict]] within a state, such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Federalism in Iraq|Iraq since 2005]].\n\nWith the [[United States Constitution]] having become effective on 4 March 1789, the [[United States]] is the oldest surviving federation. On the other end of the timeline is [[Nepal]], which became the newest federation after its [[Constitution of Nepal 2015|constitution]] went into effect on 20 September 2015.\n\n==Federations and other forms of state==\n[[File:Brazil, administrative divisions (states) - en - colored.svg|thumb|upright=1.1| A map of [[Brazil]], showing its [[Brazilian states|twenty-six constituent states]] and the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]]]]\n\n[[File:Map of Argentina with provinces names en.png|thumb|upright=1.1|right| A map of [[Argentina]], showing its twenty-three constituent provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires]]\n\n[[File:Nigeria states.png|thumb|upright=1.1|right| A map of the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]], showing its [[States of Nigeria|36 states and 1 Federal Capital Territory]]]]\n\n[[File:Mapa Mexico 2010.PNG|thumb|upright=1.1|right| A map of the United Mexican States (Mexico), showing its thirty-one constituent [[States of Mexico|states]] and [[Mexico City]]]]\n\n[[File:Map of USA with state names.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|right| A map of the United States of America showing its fifty constituent [[U.S. state|states]] and the [[Washington, D.C.|Federal District]]]]\n\n[[File:India-map-en.svg|thumb|A map showing India's 29 states and 7 Union territories including the National Capital Territory of Delhi]]\n\n===Federations===\nThe component states are in some sense sovereign, insofar as certain powers are reserved to them that may not be exercised by the central government. However, a federation is more than a mere loose alliance of independent states. The component states of a federation usually possess no powers in relation to foreign policy and so enjoy no independent status under [[international law]]. However, German Länder have that power,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Leonardy | first1 = U. | title = Federation and Länder in German foreign relations: Power‐sharing in treaty‐making and European affairs | doi = 10.1080/09644009208404305 | journal = German Politics | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 119–135 | year = 1992 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> which is beginning to be exercised on a European level.\n\nSome federations are called [[asymmetric federation|asymmetric]] because some states have more autonomy than others. An example of such a federation is [[Malaysia]], in which [[Sarawak]] and [[Sabah]] agreed to form the federation on different terms and conditions from the states of [[Peninsular Malaysia]].\n\nA federation often emerges from an initial agreement between a number of separate states. The purpose can be the will to solve mutual problems and to provide for mutual defense or to create a [[nation state|nation-state]] for an ethnicity spread over several states. The former was the case with the United States and Switzerland. However, as the histories of countries and nations vary, the federalist system of a state can be quite different from these models. Australia, for instance, is unique in that it came into existence as a nation by the democratic vote of the citizens of each state, who voted \"yes\" in referendums to adopt the [[Australian Constitution]]. Brazil, on the other hand, has experienced both the federal and the unitary state during its history. Some present day states of the Brazilian federation retain borders set during the Portuguese colonization (before the very existence of the Brazilian state), whereas the latest state, [[Tocantins (state)|Tocantins]], was created by the [[1988 Brazilian Constitution|1988 Constitution]] for chiefly administrative reasons.\n\nSeven of the top eight [[list of countries and outlying territories by total area|largest countries by area]] are governed as federations.<!-- Would it be safe to say here that Federalism is often associated with large countries? Probably Original Research... -->\n\n===Unitary states===\nA [[unitary state]] is sometimes one with only a single, centralised, national tier of government. However, unitary states often also include one or more self-governing regions. The difference between a federation and this kind of unitary state is that in a unitary state the autonomous status of self-governing regions exists by the sufferance of the central government, and may be unilaterally revoked. While it is common for a federation to be brought into being by agreement between a number of formally independent states, in a unitary state self-governing regions are often created through a process of devolution, where a formerly centralised state agrees to grant autonomy to a region that was previously entirely subordinate. Thus federations are often established voluntarily from 'below' whereas devolution grants self-government from 'above'.\n\nIt is often part of the philosophy of a unitary state that, regardless of the actual status of any of its parts, its entire territory constitutes a single sovereign entity or [[Nation state|nation-state]],{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} and that by virtue of this the central government exercises sovereignty over the whole territory ''as of right''. In a federation, on the other hand, sovereignty is often regarded as residing notionally in the component states, or as being shared between these states and the central government.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n====Confederation====\n[[File:Carte suisse2.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Swiss Confederation]] and its [[Cantons of Switzerland|26 cantons]].]]\n\nA [[confederation]], in modern political terms, is usually limited to a permanent union of sovereign states for common action in relation to other states.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref> The closest entity in the world to a confederation at this time is the [[European Union]]. While the word \"confederation\" was officially used when the present Canadian federal system was established in 1868, the term refers only to the process and not the resulting state since Canadian provinces are not sovereign and do not claim to be. In the case of Switzerland, while the country is still known as the Swiss Confederation (Confoederatio Helvetica, Confédération suisse) this is also now a misnomer since the Swiss cantons lost their sovereign status in 1848.<ref>[http://www.swissworld.org/en/politics/general_information/ch_confoederatio_helvetica/ CH: Confoederatio Helvetica - Switzerland - Information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330035550/http://www.swissworld.org/en/politics/general_information/ch_confoederatio_helvetica/ |date=30 March 2015 }}. Swissworld.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.</ref>\n\nIn Belgium, however, the opposite movement is under way.<ref name=\"lagasse\">One of the most important recent books about the Belgian institutions, written by one of the leading French-speaking jurists{{who|date=April 2014}} concludes : ''Vers le confédéralisme'' (Toward a Confederation). See: Charles-Etienne Lagasse, ''Les nouvelles institutions politiques de la Belgique et de l'Europe'', Erasme, [[Namur (city)|Namur]] 2003, p. 603 {{ISBN|2-87127-783-4}}</ref> Belgium was founded as a centralised state, after the French model, but has gradually been reformed into a federal state by consecutive constitutional reforms since the 1970s. Moreover, although nominally called a federal state, the country's structure already has a number of [[Confederation#Belgium|confederational traits]] (ex. competences are exclusive for either the federal or the state level, the treaty-making power of the Federating units almost without any possible veto of the Federal Government). At present, there is a growing movement to transform the existing federal state into a looser confederation with two or three constitutive states and/or two special regions.<ref name=\"belgium\">Many Flemings would prefer two states, Flanders and Wallonia, and two special regions, Brussels and the German-speaking region. In Wallonia, there is a wider support for three states : Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels.</ref>\n\nA confederation is most likely to feature three differences when contrasted with a federation: (1) No real direct powers: many confederal decisions are externalised by member-state legislation; (2) Decisions on day-to-day-matters are not taken by simple majority but by special majorities or even by consensus or unanimity (veto for every member); (3) Changes of the constitution, usually a treaty, require unanimity.\n\nOver time these terms acquired distinct connotations leading to the present difference in definition. An example of this is the United States under the [[Articles of Confederation]]. The Articles established a national government under what today would be defined as a federal system (albeit with a comparatively weaker federal government).  However, Canadians, designed with a ''stronger'' central government than the U.S. in the wake of the Civil War of the latter, use the term [[Canadian Confederation|\"Confederation\"]] to refer to the formation or joining, not the structure, of Canada. Legal reforms, court rulings, and political compromises have somewhat ''decentralised'' Canada in practice since its formation in 1867.\n\n===Empire===\nAn [[empire]] is a multi-ethnic state, [[multinational state]], or a group of nations with a [[central government]] established usually through [[coercion]] (on the model of the [[Roman Empire]]). An empire often includes self-governing regions, but these will possess autonomy only at the sufferance of the central government. On the other hand, a political entity that is an empire in name, may comprise several partly autonomous kingdoms organised together in a federation, with the empire being ruled over by an [[emperor]] or senior king ([[great king]], [[high king]], [[king of kings]]...). One example of this was the [[German Empire]] (1871-1918).\n\n===Comparison with other systems of autonomy===\n\n====Federacy====\nA [[federacy]]<ref>Some dictionaries, such as the Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (1989 ed.), state that federacy is synonymous with confederacy (\"by aphesis\"). In French, the English words federacy, confederacy and confederation are all translated by \"confédération\".</ref> is where a unitary state incorporates one or more self-governing [[autonomous area]]s. It is distinguished from a federation in that the constitutional structure of the state is still unitary, but incorporates federalist principles. Some federacies, notably the [[Åland Islands]], were established through [[international treaty]].\n\n====Devolution====\nA federation differs from a [[devolution|devolved state]], such as [[Indonesia]], the United Kingdom and the [[Kingdom of Spain]], because, in a devolved state, the central government can revoke the independence of the subunits ([[Scottish Parliament]], [[Welsh National Assembly]], [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] in the case of the UK) without changing the constitution.\n\n====Associated states====\nA federation also differs from an [[associated state]], such as the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (in free association with the United States) and [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] (which form part of the [[Realm of New Zealand]]).\nThere are two kinds of associated states: in case of Micronesia, association is concluded by treaty between two sovereign states; in case of Cook Islands and Niue, association is concluded by domestic legal arrangements.\n\n====Crown dependencies====\nThe relation between the [[Crown dependencies]] of the [[Isle of Man]] and the bailiwicks of [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]] in the [[Channel Islands]] and the United Kingdom is very similar to a federate relation: the Islands enjoy independence from the United Kingdom, which, via The Crown, takes care of their foreign relations and defence – although the UK Parliament does have overall power to legislate for the dependencies. However, the islands are neither an incorporated part of the United Kingdom, nor are they considered to be independent or associated states. The Isle of Man does not have a monarch, ''per se''; rather, the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Monarch]] is, ''[[ex officio]]'', [[Lord of Mann]].\n\n==== Dependent territories ====\n[[Dependent territory|Dependent territories]], such as the [[British overseas territories]], are vested with varying degrees of power; some enjoy considerable independence from the sovereign state, which only takes care of their foreign relations and defence. However, they are neither considered to be part of it, nor recognised as sovereign or associated states.\n\n===''De facto'' federations===\nThe distinction between a federation and a unitary state is often quite ambiguous. A unitary state may closely resemble a federation in structure and, while a central government may possess the theoretical right to revoke the autonomy of a self-governing region, it may be politically difficult for it to do so in practice. The self-governing regions of some unitary states also often enjoy greater autonomy than those of some federations. For these reasons, it is sometimes argued that some modern unitary states are ''de facto'' federations<ref>https://www.qmul.ac.uk/law/media/law/docs/undergrad/13-Sahadzic.pdf</ref>.\n\n''De facto'' federations, or quasi-federations, are often termed \"[[regional state]]s\".\n\n====Spain====\n[[File:Comunidades autónomas de España.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|The [[Autonomous communities of Spain]].]]\n\n[[Spain]] is suggested as one possible ''de facto'' federation<ref>https://www.eupedia.com/forum/threads/25811-Is-Spain-a-federation</ref> as it grants more self-government to its [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]]<ref name=\"Mallet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/de6c00f0-8c25-11de-b14f-00144feabdc0.html|title=Flimsier footings|last=Mallet|first=Victor|date=18 August 2010|work=Financial Times|accessdate=25 August 2010}}{{Registration required}}</ref><ref name=\"economist.com\">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12501023|title=A survey of Spain: How much is enough?|work=The Economist|accessdate=25 August 2010|date=6 November 2008}}{{Subscription required}}</ref> than are retained by the constituent entities of most federations.<ref>https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/36013985.pdf</ref> For the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish parliament]] to revoke the autonomy of regions such as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Catalonia]] or the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] would be a political near-impossibility, though nothing bars it legally.

Fuller]</ref>\n\n====Myanmar====\n\nConstitutionally a [[unitary state]], the political system in Myanmar bears many elements of federalism. Each [[administrative divisions of Myanmar|administrative divisions]] have its own cabinets and chief ministers, making it more like a federation rather than a unitary state.\n\n==Internal controversy and conflict==\n[[File:CentralAmerica1860MapSmall.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|The [[United Provinces of Central America]] was a short-lived federal republic]]\n \nCertain forms of political and constitutional dispute are common to federations. One issue is that the exact division of power and responsibility between federal and regional governments is often a source of controversy. Often, as is the case with the [[United States]], such conflicts are resolved through the judicial system, which delimits the powers of federal and local governments. The relationship between federal and local courts varies from nation to nation and can be a controversial and complex issue in itself.\n\nAnother common issue in federal systems is the conflict between regional and national interests, or between the interests and aspirations of different ethnic groups. In some federations the entire jurisdiction is relatively homogeneous and each constituent state resembles a miniature version of the whole; this is known as 'congruent federalism'. On the other hand, [[incongruent federalism]] exists where different states or regions possess distinct ethnic groups.\n\nThe ability of a federal government to create national institutions that can mediate differences that arise because of linguistic, ethnic, religious, or other regional differences is an important challenge. The inability to meet this challenge may lead to the secession of parts of a federation or to civil war, as occurred in the United States (southern states interpreted slavery under the tenth amendment as a state right, while northern states were against slavery, with a catalysis occurring in the then–[[Bleeding Kansas|Kansas Territory]]) and [[Switzerland]]. In the case of [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] was expelled from the federation because of rising racial tension. In some cases, internal conflict may lead a federation to collapse entirely, as occurred in [[Nigeria]], the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], the [[Gran Colombia]], the [[United Provinces of Central America]], and the [[West Indies Federation]].\n\n==Federal governments==\nThe federal government is the common or national government of a federation. A federal government may have distinct powers at various levels authorized or delegated to it by its member states. The structure of federal governments vary. Based on a broad definition of a basic [[federalism]], there are two or more levels of government that exist within an established territory and govern through common institutions with overlapping or shared powers as prescribed by a constitution.\n\nFederal government is the government at the level of the sovereign state. Usual responsibilities of this level of government are maintaining [[national security]] and exercising international diplomacy, including the right to sign binding [[treaties]]. Basically, a modern federal government, within the limits defined by its constitution, has the power to make laws for the whole country, unlike local governments. As originally written, the [[United States Constitution]] was created to limit the federal government from exerting power over the states by enumerating only specific powers.
