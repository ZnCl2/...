A goal of WebTorrent is to maintain compatibility with BitTorrent as much as possible.  WebTorrent uses the same [[Communication protocol|protocol]] as BitTorrent but uses a different [[Transport layer|transport]].  WebTorrent primarily relies on [[WebRTC]] connections, while BitTorrent uses [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] connections and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] datagrams directly.<ref name=\"Demuxed\" />\n\n== WebTorrent Desktop ==\n\nThe '''WebTorrent Desktop''' bridges the two networks of WebRTC-based WebTorrent and TCP/UDP-based BitTorrent simultaneously. The BitTorrent client [[Vuze]] (formerly [[Azureus (software)|Azureus]]) less gracefully but adequately functionally incorporated WebTorrent adding simultaneous network bridging to their software.  The developers used [[Electron (software framework)|Electron]] that makes desktop apps using JavaScript with access to all the [[API]]s from [[Chrome (programming language)|Chrome]] and [[Node.js|Node]].<ref name=\"Demuxed\" />\n\n== Functionality ==\n\nOnline video is the core focus as that is where WebTorrent is most useful.  It is less suited for smaller files or data sets but is ideal for larger files.<ref name=\"Demuxed\" />\n\nFile availability, as with BitTorrents, is dependent on torrent [[seeding (computing)|seeding]].  If few users are sharing a file an HTTP server providing [[webseeding]] would be the fall back.  There is no sharing without webseeding.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  Rather than using a middleman upload site to share a large private file with another person, with WebTorrent you may directly connect without leaving traces somewhere or potentially being archived on some upload site.  You simply drag and drop your file to create a magnet link you may share with your friend.  Connections are already encrypted but you may add extra layers of encryption with keys to send another way.  RAM limits may be managed with [[Indexed Database API|IndexDB]].<ref name=\"Demuxed\" />\n\n== Adoption ==\n\n=== BitChute ===\n\n{{main|BitChute}}\n\n[[BitChute]] is a [[video hosting service]] that uses WebTorrent P2P technology<ref name=\"torrentfreak\">{{Cite news |url=https://torrentfreak.com/bitchute-is-a-bittorrent-powered-youtube-alternative-170129/ |title=BitChute is a BitTorrent-Powered YouTube Alternative |last= |first= |date=2017-01-29 |work=TorrentFreak |access-date=2017-12-10 |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.itwire.com/entertainment/76552-bitchute-the-first-serious-youtube-competitor.html |title=iTWire - BitChute: the first serious YouTube competitor?|last=Beer |first=Doron |website=www.itwire.com |language=en-gb |access-date=2017-12-10}}</ref> in order to diffuse, redistribute, and ease bandwidth and issues of centralized streaming{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} and to make it much more difficult for governments and corporations to censor, disrupt, and/or block access to videos after they are uploaded and sharing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Brave ===\n\n{{main|Brave (web browser)}}\n\n[[Brave (web browser)|Brave]] web browser and [[PopChest]] are \"open source supporters\" of WebTorrent, as displayed on WebTorrent's homepage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://webtorrent.io |title=WebTorrent|last= |first= |website=WebTorrent.com |language=en |accessdate=2018-11-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Safari ===\n\n{{main|Safari (web browser)}}\n\nThe [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser is incorporating WebRTC and data channel support, as it is going to be in [[iOS 11]], however, it will be requesting permissions from users for access to webcams according to rumours.<ref name=\"Demuxed\" />\n\n=== Instant.io ===\n\nYou may try out the WebTorrent magnets at [https://instant.io Instant.io].\n\n== Reception ==\n\n: {{expand section|date=November 2018}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[BitChute]], uses WebTorrent\n* [[PeerTube]], uses WebTorrent\n* [[Comparison of BitTorrent clients]]\n* [[InterPlanetary File System]]\n* [[List of video hosting services]]\n** [[DailyMotion]]\n** [[Vidme]]\n** [[Vimeo]]\n** [[YouTube]]\n* \"tube\" sites of the [[MindGeek]] porn monopoly\n* [[YouTube Instant]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{Official website|https://webtorrent.io/}}\n* [https://webtorrent.io/ WebTorrent.io]\n* [https://instant.io Instant.io] for WebTorrent magnets.\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6eIOsvP6Jw ''Demuxed - Ep. #5, WebTorrent: Bringing BitTorrent to the Web''] on [[YouTube]], 2017-07-06, is an audio interview (not video) that starts as an excellent introduction to WebTorrent, drifts into past projects for context, then gets very technical about hacking streams, before concluding on vacuum frying banana chips.\n* [https://bitchute.com BitChute.com]\n* [https://popchest.com/ PopChest.com], The Pop Network, \"the hottest [new] video platform built on the [[Ethereum]] netowrk!\"\n\n{{File sharing|state=collapsed}}\n{{BitTorrent|state=collapsed}}\n{{File systems|state=collapsed}}\n{{Internet censorship circumvention technologies|state=collapsed}}\n{{Cryptocurrencies|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:WebTorrent}}\n[[Category:2013 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:American websites]]\n[[Category:Anonymity networks]]\n[[Category:Application layer protocols]]\n[[Category:BitTorrent]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2013]]\n[[Category:Distributed data storage]]\n[[Category:Distributed file systems]]\n[[Category:File sharing software]]\n[[Category:File transfer protocols]]\n[[Category:Free network-related software]]\n[[Category:Internet privacy software]]\n[[Category:Internet protocols]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2013]]\n[[Category:Network protocols]]\n[[Category:Peer-to-peer computing]]\n[[Category:Peer-to-peer software]]\n[[Category:Video hosting]]\n[[Category:World Wide Web]]",
