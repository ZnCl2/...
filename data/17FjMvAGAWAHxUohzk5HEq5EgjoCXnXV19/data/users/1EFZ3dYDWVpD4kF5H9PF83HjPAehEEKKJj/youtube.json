Three former [[PayPal]] employees—[[Chad Hurley]], [[Steve Chen]], and [[Jawed Karim]]—created the service in February 2005. [[Google]] bought the site in November 2006 for US$1.65&nbsp;billion; YouTube now operates as one of Google's [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]].\n\nYouTube allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to playlists, report, comment on [[video]]s, and [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|subscribe to other users]]. It offers a wide variety of [[user-generated content|user-generated]] and [[corporate media]] videos. Available content includes [[video clip]]s, [[TV show]] clips, [[music video]]s, [[short film|short]] and [[documentary film|documentary]] films, audio recordings, [[Trailer (promotion)|movie trailers]], [[live stream]]s, and other content such as [[video blog]]ging, short original videos, and [[edutainment|educational videos]]. Most content on YouTube is uploaded by individuals, but media corporations including [[CBS]], the [[BBC]], [[Vevo]], and [[Hulu]] offer some of their material via YouTube as part of the YouTube partnership program. Unregistered users can only watch videos on the site, while registered users are permitted to [[upload]] an unlimited number of videos and add comments to videos. Videos deemed potentially inappropriate are available only to registered users affirming themselves to be at least 18 years old.\n\nYouTube and selected creators earn advertising revenue from Google [[AdSense]], a program which targets ads according to site content and audience. The vast majority of its videos are free to view, but there are exceptions, including subscription-based premium channels, film rentals, as well as [[YouTube Music]] and [[YouTube Premium]], subscription services respectively offering premium and ad-free music streaming, and ad-free access to all content, including exclusive content commissioned from notable personalities. {{As of|2017|2}}, there were more than 400 hours of content uploaded to YouTube each minute, and one billion hours of content being watched on YouTube every day. {{As of|2018|8}}, the website is ranked as the second-most popular site in the world, according to [[Alexa Internet]].<ref name=\"alexa\"/> {{As of|2019|5}}, more than 500 hours of video content are uploaded to YouTube every minute.<ref name=\"500hrs\">{{cite news |accessdate=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/05/07/number-hours-video-uploaded-to-youtube-per-minute/ |title=More Than 500 Hours Of Content Are Now Being Uploaded To YouTube Every Minute |work=[[TubeFilter]] |location=Los Angeles, CA |date=May 7, 2019 |author=Loke Hale, James}}</ref>\n\nYouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations, including its handling of [[copyright]]ed content contained within uploaded videos, its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] and falsehoods, hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing [[Elsagate|violent and/or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters]], videos of minors attracting [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] activities in their comment sections, and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising.\n\n==Company history==\n{{Main|History of YouTube}}\n[[File:Youtube founders.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|From left to right: [[Chad Hurley]], [[Steve Chen]] and [[Jawed Karim]], the founders of YouTube]]\n\nYouTube was founded by [[Steve Chen]], [[Chad Hurley]], and [[Jawed Karim]], who were all early employees of [[PayPal]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Jefferson |last=Graham |title=Video websites pop up, invite postings |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2005-11-21-video-websites_x.htm |website=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=November 21, 2005 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref> Hurley had studied design at [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], and Chen and Karim studied [[computer science]] together at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]].<ref>{{cite web |title=YouTube: Sharing Digital Camera Videos |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] |url=http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/news/articles.php?id=2006Feb3-126 |accessdate=November 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111223210/http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/news/articles.php?id=2006Feb3-126 |archivedate=January 11, 2009}}</ref>\n\nKarim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from [[Janet Jackson]]'s role in the 2004 [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Super Bowl incident]], when her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]].

These functions were notably used as the basis for [[interactive video]]s, which used hyperlinks to other videos to achieve branching elements. In March 2017, it was announced that the annotations editor had been discontinued and the feature would be sunset, because their use had fallen rapidly, users had found them to be an annoyance, and because they were incompatible with mobile versions of the service. Annotations were removed entirely from all videos on January 15, 2019. YouTube had introduced standardized [[Widget (GUI)|widgets]] intended to replace annotations in a cross-platform manner, including \"end screens\" (a customizable array of thumbnails for specified videos displayed near the end of the video) and \"cards\", but they are not backwards compatible with existing annotations, while the removal of annotations will also break all interactive experiences which depended on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/article/the-death-of-youtube-annotations/|title=The death of YouTube annotations marks an end for early interactive web video|last=Binder|first=Matt|website=Mashable|language=en|access-date=January 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/youtube-launches-mobile-friendly-end-screens-feature-to-keep-viewers-watching-more-video/|title=YouTube launches mobile-friendly \"End Screens\" feature to keep viewers watching more video|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=January 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18114581/youtube-annotations-discontinued-january-2019|title=YouTube annotations will disappear for good in January|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=November 27, 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=January 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/16/14953756/youtube-annotations-feature-discontinue-cards-end-screens|title=YouTube to discontinue video annotations because they never worked on mobile|last=Statt|first=Nick|date=March 16, 2017|website=The Verge|access-date=January 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Live streaming====\nYouTube carried out early experiments with [[live streaming]], including a concert by [[U2]] in 2009, and a question-and-answer session with US President [[Barack Obama]] in February 2010.<ref name=\"CNN 2010\">{{Cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/09/13/youtube.livestreaming/index.html?hpt=C2 |title=YouTube testing live streaming |last=Gross |first=Doug |date=September 13, 2010 |website=CNN |access-date=September 22, 2017}}</ref> These tests had relied on technology from 3rd-party partners, but in September 2010, YouTube began testing its own live streaming infrastructure.<ref name=\"BBC 2010\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-11282240 |title=YouTube in two-day live video-streaming test |date=September 13, 2010 |newspaper=BBC News}}</ref> In April 2011, YouTube announced the rollout of ''YouTube Live'', with a portal page at the URL \"www.youtube.com/live\".

Three former [[PayPal]] employees—[[Chad Hurley]], [[Steve Chen]], and [[Jawed Karim]]—created the service in February 2005. [[Google]] bought the site in November 2006 for US$1.65&nbsp;billion; YouTube now operates as one of Google's [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]].\n\nYouTube allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to playlists, report, comment on [[video]]s, and [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|subscribe to other users]]. It offers a wide variety of [[user-generated content|user-generated]] and [[corporate media]] videos. Available content includes [[video clip]]s, [[TV show]] clips, [[music video]]s, [[short film|short]] and [[documentary film|documentary]] films, audio recordings, [[Trailer (promotion)|movie trailers]], [[live stream]]s, and other content such as [[video blog]]ging, short original videos, and [[edutainment|educational videos]]. Most content on YouTube is uploaded by individuals, but media corporations including [[CBS]], the [[BBC]], [[Vevo]], and [[Hulu]] offer some of their material via YouTube as part of the YouTube partnership program. Unregistered users can only watch videos on the site, while registered users are permitted to [[upload]] an unlimited number of videos and add comments to videos. Videos deemed potentially inappropriate are available only to registered users affirming themselves to be at least 18 years old.\n\nYouTube and selected creators earn advertising revenue from Google [[AdSense]], a program which targets ads according to site content and audience. The vast majority of its videos are free to view, but there are exceptions, including subscription-based premium channels, film rentals, as well as [[YouTube Music]] and [[YouTube Premium]], subscription services respectively offering premium and ad-free music streaming, and ad-free access to all content, including exclusive content commissioned from notable personalities. {{As of|2017|2}}, there were more than 400 hours of content uploaded to YouTube each minute, and one billion hours of content being watched on YouTube every day. {{As of|2018|8}}, the website is ranked as the second-most popular site in the world, according to [[Alexa Internet]].<ref name=\"alexa\"/> {{As of|2019|5}}, more than 500 hours of video content are uploaded to YouTube every minute.<ref name=\"500hrs\">{{cite news |accessdate=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/05/07/number-hours-video-uploaded-to-youtube-per-minute/ |title=More Than 500 Hours Of Content Are Now Being Uploaded To YouTube Every Minute |work=[[TubeFilter]] |location=Los Angeles, CA |date=May 7, 2019 |author=Loke Hale, James}}</ref>\n\nYouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations, including its handling of [[copyright]]ed content contained within uploaded videos, its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] and falsehoods, hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing [[Elsagate|violent and/or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters]], videos of minors attracting [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] activities in their comment sections, and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising.\n\n==Company history==\n{{Main|History of YouTube}}\n[[File:Youtube founders.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|From left to right: [[Chad Hurley]], [[Steve Chen]] and [[Jawed Karim]], the founders of YouTube]]\n\nYouTube was founded by [[Steve Chen]], [[Chad Hurley]], and [[Jawed Karim]], who were all early employees of [[PayPal]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Jefferson |last=Graham |title=Video websites pop up, invite postings |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2005-11-21-video-websites_x.htm |website=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=November 21, 2005 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref> Hurley had studied design at [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], and Chen and Karim studied [[computer science]] together at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]].<ref>{{cite web |title=YouTube: Sharing Digital Camera Videos |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] |url=http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/news/articles.php?id=2006Feb3-126 |accessdate=November 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111223210/http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/news/articles.php?id=2006Feb3-126 |archivedate=January 11, 2009}}</ref>\n\nKarim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from [[Janet Jackson]]'s role in the 2004 [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Super Bowl incident]], when her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]].
