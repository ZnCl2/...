Human cultivation of the coconut selected, not for larger size, but for thinner husks and increased volume of endosperm, the solid “meat” or liquid “water” that provides the fruit its food value. Although these modifications for domestication would reduce the fruit’s ability to float, this ability would be irrelevant to a cultivated population.\n\nAmong modern ''C. nucifera'', two major types or variants occur: a thick-husked, angular fruit and a thin-husked, spherical fruit with a higher proportion of [[endosperm]] reflect a trend of cultivation in ''C. nucifera''. The first coconuts were of the ''niu kafa'' type, with thick husks to protect the seed, an angular, highly ridged shape to promote buoyancy during ocean dispersal, and a pointed base that allowed fruits to dig into the sand, preventing them from being washed away during [[germination]] on a new island. As early human communities began to harvest coconuts for eating and planting, they (perhaps unintentionally) selected for a larger endosperm-to-husk ratio and a broader, spherical base, which rendered the fruit useful as a cup or bowl, thus creating the ''niu vai'' type. The decreased buoyancy and increased fragility of this spherical, thin-husked fruit would not matter for a species that had started to be dispersed by humans and grown in plantations. Harries’ adoption of the Polynesian terms ''niu kafa'' and ''niu vai'' has now passed into general scientific discourse, and his hypothesis is generally accepted.<ref name=Lebrun>{{cite journal | last1 = Lebrun | first1 = P. | last2 = Seguin | first2 = M. | last3 = Grivet | first3 = L. | last4 = Baudouin | first4 = L. | year = 1998 | title = Genetic diversity in coconut (''Cocos nucifera'' L.) revealed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers | doi = 10.1023/a:1018323721803 | journal = Euphytica | volume = 101 | issue = | pages = 103–108 }}</ref><ref name=Shukla>{{cite journal | last1 = Shukla | first1 = A. | last2 = Mehrotra | first2 = R.

But we had laid about half among the special provisions below deck, with the waves washing around them. Every single one of these was ruined by the sea water. And no coconut can float over the sea faster than a [[balsa]] raft moves with the wind behind it.\"<ref name=Heyerdahl /></blockquote>\nHe also notes that several of the nuts began to germinate by the time they had been ten weeks at sea, precluding an unassisted journey of 100 days or more. However, the coconut variety Heyerdahl chose for his long sea voyage likely was of the large, fleshy, spherical ''niu vai'' type, which Harries observed to have a significantly shorter germination type and worse buoyancy than the uncultivated ''niu kafa'' type.<ref name=Harries /> Therefore, Heyerdahl’s observations cannot be considered conclusive when it comes to determining the independent dispersal ability of the uncultivated coconut.\n\nDrift models based on wind and ocean currents have shown that coconuts could not have drifted across the Pacific unaided.<ref name=Ward />  If they were naturally distributed and had been in the Pacific for a thousand years or so, then we would expect the eastern shore of Australia, with its own islands sheltered by the [[Great Barrier Reef]], to have been thick with coconut palms: the currents were directly into, and down along this coast.

We know from early Spanish documents that they deliberately planted coconuts shortly after first contact,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} and some nuts would certainly have self-seeded when they floated ashore following shipwrecks.

More recently, genomic analysis of cultivated coconut (''C. nucifera'' L.) has shed light on the movement. By examining 10 microsatellite loci, researchers found two genetically distinct subpopulations of coconut—one originating in the Indian Ocean, the other in the Pacific Ocean.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} However, [[Genetic admixture|admixture]], the transfer of genetic material, evidently occurred between the two populations.\n\nGiven that coconuts are ideally suited for inter-island group ocean dispersal, obviously some natural distribution did take place. However, this should not be extrapolated to claims that one ocean's subgenera possibly could have floated to interbreed with the other.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} However, the locations of the admixture events are limited to [[Madagascar]] and coastal east Africa, and exclude the [[Seychelles]]. This pattern coincides with the known trade routes of Austronesian sailors. Additionally, a genetically distinct subpopulation of coconut on the Pacific coast of Latin America has undergone a genetic bottleneck resulting from a [[founder effect]];{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} however, its ancestral population is the Pacific coconut.

A coconut tree is also included in the country's [[Coat of arms of the Maldives|national emblem and coat of arms]]. Coconut trees are grown on all the islands. Before modern construction methods were introduced, coconut leaves were used as roofing material for many houses in the islands, while [[coconut timber]] was used to build houses and boats.\n\n===Middle East===\nThe main coconut-producing area in the Middle East is the [[Dhofar]] region of [[Oman]], but they can be grown all along the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Arabian Sea]], and [[Red Sea]] coasts, because these seas are tropical and provide enough humidity (through seawater evaporation) for coconut trees to grow. The young coconut plants need to be nursed and irrigated with drip pipes until they are old enough (stem bulb development) to be irrigated with [[brackish water]] or seawater alone, after which they can be replanted on the beaches. In particular, the area around [[Salalah]] maintains large coconut plantations similar to those found across the Arabian Sea in [[Kerala]]. The reasons why coconut are cultivated only in [[Yemen]]'s [[Al Mahrah]] and [[Hadramaut]] governorates and in the Sultanate of Oman, but not in other suitable areas in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], may originate from the fact that Oman and Hadramaut had long [[dhow]] trade relations with [[Burma]], Malaysia, Indonesia, East Africa, and [[Zanzibar]], as well as southern India and China. Omani people needed the coir rope from the coconut fiber to stitch together their traditional seagoing [[dhow]] vessels in which nails were never used. The knowhow of coconut cultivation and necessary soil fixation and irrigation may have found its way into Omani, Hadrami and Al-Mahra culture by people who returned from those overseas areas.\n\n[[File:Al hafa corniche.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coconut trees line the beaches and corniches of [[Oman]].]]\n\nThe coconut cultivars grown in Oman are generally of the drought-resistant Indian 'West Coast tall' <!-- (WC Tall) --> variety. Unlike the [[UAE]], which grows mostly non-native dwarf or hybrid coconut cultivars imported from Florida for ornamental purposes, the slender, tall Omani coconut cultivars are relatively well-adapted to the Middle East's hot dry seasons, but need longer to reach maturity. The Middle East's hot, dry climate favors the development of [[coconut mite]]s, which cause immature seed dropping and may cause brownish-gray discoloration on the coconut's outer green fiber.\n\nThe ancient coconut groves of Dhofar were mentioned by the medieval Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] in his writings, known as ''Al [[Rihla]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1354-ibnbattuta.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Ibn Battuta: Travels in Asia and Africa 1325–1354 |author=Halsall, Paul.

It is spread by host insects, that thrive on heavy turf grasses. Therefore, heavy turf grass environments ([[beach resort]]s and [[golf course]]s) also pose a major threat to local coconut trees. Traditionally, [[dessert banana]] plants and local wild beach flora such as ''[[Scaevola taccada]]'' and ''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae]]'' were used as humidity-supplying green undergrowth for coconut trees, mixed with [[sea almond]] and [[sea hibiscus]].

Many of the smallest coral islands in the Florida Keys are known to have abundant coconut palms sprouting from coconuts that have drifted or been deposited by ocean currents. Coconut palms are cultivated north of south Florida to roughly Cocoa Beach on the East Coast and the St/Petersburg on the West Coast.\n\n===Australia===\nCoconuts are commonly grown around the northern coast of Australia, and in some warmer parts of [[New South Wales]].\n\nThe 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia records that the Cocus nucifera \"nut is so well known that the following few notes concerning it will be sufficient. As an article of food the kernel is of\ngreat importance to the inhabitants of the tropics. In the Laccadives it forms the chief food, each person consuming four nuts per day, and the fluid, commonly called milk, which it contains, affords them an agreeable beverage. While young they yield a delicious substance resembling blancmange. Among other products of this palm may be mentioned \" toddy,\" which when fermented is intoxicating ; strong arrack is also distilled from it, besides which it yields vinegar and \"jaggery\" or sugar.\"<ref>{{cite book | author=J.

In more recent years, the importation of coconuts was prohibited; therefore, a large proportion of the younger trees have been propagated from locally grown coconuts.\n\nIn the winter, the growth rate of coconut trees declines due to cooler temperatures and people have commonly attributed this to the reduced yield of coconuts in comparison to tropical regions. However, whilst cooler winter temperatures may be a factor in reducing fruit production, the primary reason for the reduced yield is a lack of water. Bermuda's soil is generally very shallow ({{convert|1+1/2|to|3|ft|cm|disp=sqbr}}) and much of a coconut tree's root mass is found in the porous [[limestone]] underneath the soil. Due to the [[porosity]] of the limestone, Bermuda's coconut trees do not generally have a sufficient supply of water with which they are able to support a large number of fruit as rainwater quickly drains down through the limestone layer to the [[water table]] which is far too deep for a coconut's roots to reach. This typically leads to a reduction in fruit yield (sometimes as few as one or two mature fruits), as well as a reduced milk content inside the coconut that often causes the fruit to be infertile.\n\nConversely, trees growing in close proximity to the sea almost universally yield much more fruit, as they are able to tap directly into the seawater which permeates the limestone in such areas. Not only do these trees produce a significantly higher yield, but also the fruit itself tends to be far more fertile due to the higher milk content. Trees found growing in Bermuda's marshy inland areas enjoy a similar degree of success, as they are also able to tap directly into a constant supply of water.\n\n===Substitutes for cooler climates===\nIn cooler climates (but not less than [[Hardiness zone|USDA Zone 9]]), a similar palm, the [[queen palm]] (''Syagrus romanzoffiana''), is used in [[landscaping]]. Its fruits are similar to the coconut, but smaller. The queen palm was originally classified in the genus ''Cocos'' along with the coconut, but was later reclassified in ''[[Syagrus (plant)|Syagrus]]''. A recently discovered palm, ''[[Beccariophoenix alfredii]]'' from [[Madagascar]], is nearly identical to the coconut, more so than the queen palm and can also be grown in slightly cooler climates than the coconut palm. Coconuts can only be grown in temperatures above {{convert|18|C|F}} and need a daily temperature above {{convert|22|C|F}} to produce fruit.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Coconuts for sale, Puthia (01).jpg|thumb|right|Green coconuts]]\nThe coconut palm is grown throughout the [[tropics]] for decoration, as well as for its many culinary and nonculinary uses; virtually every part of the coconut palm can be used by humans in some manner and has significant economic value. Coconuts' versatility is sometimes noted in its naming. In [[Sanskrit]], it is ''kalpa vriksha'' (\"the tree which provides all the necessities of life\"). In the [[Malay language]], it is ''pokok seribu guna'' (\"the tree of a thousand uses\"). In the Philippines, the coconut is commonly called the \"[[tree of life]]\".<ref>Margolis, Jason.

In [[Jakarta]], ''soto babat'' or [[Tripe#Beef tripe|beef tripe]] soup also uses coconut milk. On the island of [[Java]], the sweet and savoury ''tempe bacem'' is made by cooking ''[[tempeh]]'' with coconut water, [[coconut sugar]], and other spices until thickened. ''Klapertart'' is the famous Dutch-influenced dessert from Manado, North [[Sulawesi]], that uses young coconut meat and coconut milk.\n\nIn 2010, Indonesia increased its coconut production.

Coconuts in the Philippines are usually used in making main dishes, refreshments, and desserts. Coconut juice is also a popular drink in the country. In the Philippines, particularly [[Cebu]], rice is wrapped in coconut leaves for cooking and subsequent storage; these packets are called ''[[ketupat|puso]]''. Coconut milk, known as ''gata'', and grated coconut flakes are used in the preparation of dishes such as ''[[Taro#(Philippines)|laing]]'', ''[[ginataan]]'', ''[[bibingka]]'', ''[[ube halaya]]'', ''[[pitsi-pitsî]]'', ''[[palitaw]]'' and ''[[buko pie]]''.  [[Coconut jam]] is made by mixing [[muscovado]] with coconut milk. Coconut [[Sport (botany)|sport fruit]]s are also harvested. One such variety of coconut is known as ''macapuno''. Its meat is sweetened, cut into strands, and sold in glass jars as coconut strings, sometimes labeled as \"gelatinous mutant coconut\". Coconut water can be fermented to make a different product—''[[nata de coco]]'' (coconut gel).\n\n===Vietnam===\nIn [[Vietnam]], coconut is grown abundantly across [[Central Vietnam|central]] and [[southern Vietnam]], and especially in [[Bến Tre Province]], often called the \"land of the coconut\". It is used to make [[coconut candy]], [[caramel]], and jelly. Coconut juice and coconut milk are used, especially in Vietnam's southern style of cooking, including ''[[kho (cooking technique)|kho]]'', ''[[chè]]'', and curry (''cà ri'').\n\n===India===\n[[File:Steamed Goan rice and jaggery cakes.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Patoleo]]'' (sweet [[rice cake]]s steamed in turmeric leaves consisting of a filling of freshly grated coconut and [[coconut sugar]]) prepared in [[Goan Catholic]] style.]]\n\nIn southern India, the most common way of cooking vegetables is to add grated coconut and then steam them with spices fried in oil. People from southern India also make [[chutney]], which involves grinding the coconut with salt, chillies, and whole spices. ''[[Uruttu Chammanthi|Uruttu chammanthi]]'' (granulated chutney) is eaten with rice or ''kanji'' (rice [[gruel]]). It is also a main side dish served with ''[[idli]], [[vadai]]'', and ''[[dosai]]''. Coconut ground with spices is mixed in ''[[Sambar (dish)|sambar]]'' and other various lunch dishes for extra taste. Dishes garnished with grated coconut are generally referred to as  ''[[poduthol]]'' in [[North Malabar]] and ''thoran'' in [[Kerala]]. ''[[Puttu]]'' is a culinary delicacy of Kerala and [[Tamil Nadu]], in which layers of coconut alternate with layers of powdered rice, all of which fit into a bamboo stalk. ''[[Solkadhi]]'', a drink made from coconut milk and ''[[kokum]]'', is usually consumed after meals. ''Narali paak'' is another sweet dish, created with coconut and sugar. Coconut meat can be eaten as a snack sweetened with [[jaggery]] or [[molasses]]. In [[Karnataka]], sweets are prepared using coconut and dry coconut copra.\n\n===Commercial, industrial, and household use===\n\n====Cultivars====\nCoconut has a number of commercial and traditional [[cultivar]]s. They can be sorted mainly into tall cultivars, dwarf cultivars, and hybrid cultivars (hybrids between talls and dwarfs). Some of the dwarf cultivars such as 'Malayan dwarf' have shown some promising resistance to lethal yellowing, while other cultivars such as 'Jamaican tall' are highly affected by the same plant disease. Some cultivars are more drought resistant such as 'West coast tall' (India) while others such as 'Hainan Tall' (China) are more cold tolerant. Other aspects such as seed size, shape and weight, and copra thickness are also important factors in the selection of new cultivars. Some cultivars such as 'Fiji dwarf' form a large bulb at the lower stem and others are cultivated to produce very sweet coconut water with orange-coloured husks ([[king coconut]]) used entirely in fruit stalls for drinking (Sri Lanka, India).\n\n====Coir====\n[[File:srilanka coconut fibre.jpg|thumb|upright|Extracting the fiber from the husk (Sri Lanka)]]\n\n[[Coir]] (the fiber from the husk of the coconut) is used in [[rope]]s, [[mat]]s, [[mat|doormats]], [[brush]]es, and sacks, as [[caulking]] for boats, and as stuffing fiber for [[mattress]]es.<ref>Grimwood 1975, p.

It is known as a ''bunot'' in the Philippines and simply a \"coconut brush\" in [[Jamaica]]. The fresh husk of a brown coconut may serve as a dish sponge or body sponge. A ''[[coco chocolatero]]'' was a cup used to serve small quantities of beverages (such as chocolate drinks) between the 17th and  19th centuries in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Venezuela.\n\n[[File:Coconut button factory in Dongjiao - 02.JPG|thumb|Coconut buttons in Dongjiao Town, [[Hainan]], China]]\nIn Asia, coconut shells are also used as bowls and in the manufacture of various handicrafts, including buttons carved from dried shell. Coconut buttons are often used for Hawaiian [[aloha shirt]]s. ''Tempurung'', as the shell is called in the Malay language, can be used as a soup bowl and—if fixed with a handle—a ladle. In Thailand, the coconut husk is used as a potting medium to produce healthy forest tree [[sapling]]s. The process of husk extraction from the coir bypasses the retting process, using a custom-built coconut husk extractor designed by [[ASEAN]]–Canada Forest Tree Seed Centre <!-- (ACFTSC) --> in 1986. Fresh husks contain more [[tannin]] than old husks. Tannin produces negative effects on sapling growth.<ref>Somyos Kijkar. \"Handbook: Coconut husk as a potting medium\".

Dried half shells are used as the bodies of musical instruments, including the Chinese ''[[yehu]]'' and ''[[banhu]]'', along with the Vietnamese ''[[đàn gáo]]'' and Arabo-Turkic ''[[rebab]]''. In the Philippines, dried half shells are also used as a music instrument in a folk dance called ''[[maglalatik]]''.\n\nIn World War II, [[coastwatchers|coastwatcher]] scout [[Biuku Gasa]] was the first of two from the [[Solomon Islands]] to reach the shipwrecked and wounded crew of [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109]] commanded by future U.S. president [[John F.

In [[Kerala]], coconut trunks are used for house construction. [[Coconut timber]] comes from the trunk, and is increasingly being used as an ecologically sound substitute for endangered hardwoods. It has applications in furniture and specialized construction, as notably demonstrated in [[Manila]]'s [[Coconut Palace]].\n\nHawaiians hollowed the trunk to form drums, containers, or small canoes. The \"branches\" (leaf [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]s) are strong and flexible enough to make a [[switch (rod)|switch]]. The use of coconut branches in corporal punishment was revived in the Gilbertese community on Choiseul in the [[Solomon Islands]] in 2005.<ref>Herming, George. (March 6, 2006).

This ritual, known as ''niniyogan'', is an offering made to the deceased and one's ancestors. This accompanies the ''palagip'' (prayer to the dead).\n\nA coconut ({{lang-sa|nalikera}}) is an essential element of [[rituals]] in [[Hindu]] tradition. Often it is decorated with bright metal foils and other symbols of auspiciousness. It is offered during worship to a Hindu god or goddess. [[Narali Purnima]] is celebrated on a [[full moon]] day which usually signifies the end of [[monsoon]] season in India. The word ‘Narali’ is derived from ''naral'' implying ‘coconut’ in [[Marathi people|Marathi]]. Fishermen give an offering of coconut to the sea to celebrate the beginning of a new fishing season.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.maharashtratourism.net/festivals/narali-poornima.html | title=Narali Purnima | publisher=Maharashtra Tourism | date=2016 | accessdate=3 August 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715223636/http://www.maharashtratourism.net/festivals/narali-poornima.html | archivedate=July 15, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Irrespective of their religious affiliations, fishermen of India often offer it to the rivers and seas in the hopes of having bountiful catches. Hindus often initiate the beginning of any new activity by breaking a coconut to ensure the blessings of the gods and successful completion of the activity. The Hindu goddess of well-being and wealth,  [[Lakshmi]], is often shown holding a coconut.<ref>Dallapiccola, Anna. ''[[Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend]]''. {{ISBN|0-500-51088-1}}.</ref> In the foothills of the temple town of  [[Palani]], before going to worship [[Murugan]] for the [[Ganesha]], coconuts are broken at a place marked for the purpose. Every day, thousands of coconuts are broken, and some devotees break as many as 108 coconuts at a time as per the prayer. In  [[tantra|tantric]] practices, coconuts are sometimes used as substitutes for human skulls.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn [[Hindu wedding]] ceremonies, a coconut is placed over the opening of a pot, representing a [[womb]]. Coconut flowers are auspicious symbols and are fixtures at [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] weddings and other important occasions. In Kerala, coconut flowers must be present during a marriage ceremony. The flowers are inserted into a barrel of unhusked rice (paddy) and placed within sight of the wedding ceremony. Similarly in [[Sri Lanka]], coconut flowers, standing in brass urns, are placed in prominent positions.\n\nThe [[Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club]] of [[New Orleans]] traditionally throws hand-decorated coconuts, the most valuable of Mardi Gras souvenirs, to parade revelers. The \"Tramps\" began the tradition ''circa'' 1901. In 1987, a \"coconut law\" was signed by Governor [[Edwin Edwards]] exempting from insurance liability any decorated coconut \"handed\" from a Zulu float.\n\nThe coconut is also used as a target and prize in the traditional British fairground game \"coconut shy\". The player buys some small balls which he throws as hard as he can at coconuts balanced on sticks. The aim is to knock a coconut off the stand and win it.\n\nIt was the main food of adherents of the now discontinued Vietnamese religion [[Coconut Religion|Đạo Dừa]] in [[Bến Tre]].\n\n====Myths and legends====\nSome South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Pacific Ocean cultures have [[origin myth]]s in which the coconut plays the main role.
