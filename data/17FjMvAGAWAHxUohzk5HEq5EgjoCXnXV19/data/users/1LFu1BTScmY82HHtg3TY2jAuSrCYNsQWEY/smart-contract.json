Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible.\n\nProponents of smart contracts claim that many kinds of contractual clauses may be made partially or fully self-executing, self-enforcing, or both. The aim of smart contracts is to provide security that is superior to traditional contract law and to reduce other [[transaction costs]] associated with contracting. Various [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] have implemented types of smart contracts.\n\n==History==\nSmart contracts were first proposed by [[Nick Szabo]], who coined the term.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2014/01/21/bitcoin-is-not-just-digital-currency-its-napster-for-finance/ |title=Bitcoin is not just digital currency.

In this interpretation, used for example by the Ethereum Foundation<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|last1=Buterin|first1=Vitalik|title=Ethereum Whitepaper|url=https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper/f18902f4e7fb21dc92b37e8a0963eec4b3f4793a|website=github|accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref> or IBM,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cachin|first1=Christian|title=Architecture of the Hyperledger Blockchain Fabric|url=https://www.zurich.ibm.com/dccl/papers/cachin_dccl.pdf|website=ibm.com}}</ref> a smart contract is not necessarily related to the classical concept of a contract, but can be any kind of computer program.\n\nIn 2018, a [[US Senate]] report said:  \"While smart contracts might sound new, the concept is rooted in basic contract law. Usually, the judicial system adjudicates contractual disputes and enforces terms, but it is also common to have another arbitration method, especially for international transactions. With smart contracts, a program enforces the contract built into the code.\"<ref name=usSenate201803>[https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/aaac3a69-e9fb-45b6-be9f-b1fd96dd738b/chapter-9-building-a-secure-future-one-blockchain-at-a-time.pdf Chapter 9:  Building a Secure Future, One blockchain at a time], [[US Senate]] [[Joint Economic Committee]], March 2018.</ref>\n\n==Implementations==\n[[Byzantine fault tolerance|Byzantine fault-tolerant]] algorithms allowed digital security through decentralization to form smart contracts.
