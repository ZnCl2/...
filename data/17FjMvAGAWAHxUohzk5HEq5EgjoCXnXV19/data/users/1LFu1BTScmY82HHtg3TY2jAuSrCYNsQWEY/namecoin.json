The original proposal for Namecoin called for Namecoin to insert data into bitcoin's blockchain directly. Anticipating scaling difficulties with this approach, a shared [[proof-of-work]] (POW)  system was proposed to secure new cryptocurrencies with different [[use cases]].\n\nNamecoin's flagship use case is the censorship-resistant [[top level domain]] <code>[[.bit]]</code>, which is functionally similar to <code>[[.com]]</code> or <code>[[.net]]</code> domains but is independent of [[ICANN]], the main governing body for domain names.<ref name=\"dourado2013\">{{cite news | url=http://theumlaut.com/2014/02/05/namecoin-icann/  | work=Theumlaut | title=Can Namecoin Obsolete ICANN (and More)? | first=Eli | last=Dourado | date=2014-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n== Transactions ==\nA peer-to-peer network similar to [[bitcoin]]'s handles Namecoin's transactions, balances and issuance through [[SHA256]], [[proof-of-work]] scheme (they are issued when a small enough [[cryptographic hash|hash]] value is found, at which point a block is created; the process of finding these hashes and creating blocks is called mining). The issuing rate forms a [[geometric series]], and the rate halves every 210,000 blocks, roughly every four years, reaching a final total of 21 million NMC.\n\nNamecoins are currently traded primarily for USD and other cryptocurrencies, mostly on online [[Digital currency exchanger|exchanges]]. To avoid the danger of [[chargebacks]], reversible transactions, such as those with [[credit cards]] or PayPal, are not advised since Namecoin transactions are irreversible.\n\n=== Addresses ===\nPayments and records in the Namecoin network are made to ''addresses'', which are [[Base58]]-encoded hashes of users' [[public key]]s. They are strings of 33 numbers and letters which begin with the letter ''N'' or ''M''. Initially addresses beginning with ''1'' existed but this was changed to avoid confusion with [[Bitcoin]] addresses. <!-- do NOT put any example addresses here -->\n\n=== Records ===\nEach Namecoin record consists of a key and a value which can be up to 520 [[byte]]s in size.  Each key is actually a path, with the namespace preceding the name of the record.  The key <code>d/example</code> signifies a record stored in the [[DNS]] namespace <code>d</code> with the name <code>example</code> and corresponds to the record for the <code>example.bit</code> website.  The content of <code>d/example</code> is expected to conform to the DNS namespace specification.\n\nThe current fee for a record is 0.01 NMC and records expire after 36000 blocks (~200 days) unless updated or renewed. Namecoins used to purchase records are marked as used and destroyed, as giving the fee to miners would enable larger miners to register names at a significant discount.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://wiki.namecoin.info/index.php?title=FAQ|title = Namecoin FAQ|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\nProposed potential uses for Namecoin besides domain name registration include:\n* [[Identity system]]s\n* [[Messaging system]]s\n* Personal [[namespace]]s\n* [[Notary]]/[[timestamp]] systems<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.techworld.com/security/3449015/could-the-bitcoin-network-be-used-as-an-ultrasecure-notary-service/ | title=Could the Bitcoin network be used as an ultrasecure notary service? | work=Techworld | first=Jeremy | last=Kirk | date=2013-05-24 }}</ref>\n* [[Pseudonym|Alias]] systems<ref>[http://ecdsa.org/bitcoin-alias/ ecdsa.org/bitcoin-alias/], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120531230204/http://ecdsa.org/bitcoin-alias/ Archived page]</ref><ref>[http://ecdsa.org/bitcoin_URIs.html ecdsa.org/bitcoin_URIs.html], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120704170347/http://ecdsa.org/bitcoin_URIs.html Archived page]</ref>\n* Issuance of [[Share (finance)|shares]]/stocks\n\n== History ==\nIn September 2010, a discussion was started in the Bitcointalk forum about a hypothetical system called BitDNS and generalizing bitcoin. [[Gavin Andresen]] and [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] joined the discussion in the Bitcointalk forum and supported the idea of BitDNS, and a reward for implementing BitDNS was announced at the Bitcointalk forum in December 2010. In June 2011, [[WikiLeaks]] mentioned the project via Twitter.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/78906603948093440 | date=2011-06-09 | title=Twitter / wikileaks: Namecoin and Bitcoin will be ... | publisher=WikiLeaks, via Twitter | accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref>\n\nOn block 19200 Namecoin activated the merged mining upgrade to allow mining of Bitcoin and Namecoin simultaneously, instead of having to choose between one or the other; this fixed the issue of miners jumping from one blockchain to another when the profitability becomes favorable in the former.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://repositum.tuwien.ac.at/obvutwhs/download/pdf/2315652?originalFilename=true|title=Merged Mining: Analysis of Effects and Implications|last=|first=|date=|website=repositum.tuwien.ac.at|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later, in June 2013, NameID was launched.<ref name=nameidPost>{{cite web | url=https://forum.namecoin.info/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1013 | first=Daniel | last=Kraft | title=<nowiki>NameID - Use namecoin id/ to log into OpenID sites</nowiki> | work=Namecoin Forum | date=2013-07-25 }}</ref> NameID allows to associate profile information with identities on the Namecoin blockchain, and an [[OpenID]] provider to allow logging into existing websites with Namecoin identities.  The main site itself is accompanied by an open protocol for password-less authentication with Namecoin identities, a corresponding [[Free Software|free-software]] implementation and a supporting [[Browser extension|extension]] for [[Firefox]].\n\nIn October 2013, Michael Gronager, main developer of libcoin, found a security issue in the Namecoin protocol, which allowed modifying foreign names. It was successfully fixed in a short timeframe and was never exploited, except for bitcoin.bit as a proof-of-concept.<ref name=gilson2013>{{cite news | title=Developers attempt to resurrect Namecoin after fundamental flaw discovered | first=David | last=Gilson | date=2013-10-28 | url=http://www.coindesk.com/namecoin-flaw-patch-needed/ | work=CoinDesk }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2014, a [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] for Firefox compatible with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]], FreeSpeechMe, was released, providing automatic resolution of [[.bit]] addresses.

(To be implemented.)\n</source>\n\n=What does Namecoin do under the hood?=\n\n<source>-Securely record and transfer arbitrary names (keys).\n-Attach a value (data) to the names (up to 520 bytes).\n-Transact the digital currency namecoins (NMC).\n-Like bitcoins, Namecoin names are difficult to censor or seize.\n-Lookups do not generate network traffic (improves privacy).\n</source>\n\nNamecoin was the first fork of Bitcoin and still is one of the most innovative “altcoins”. It was first to implement merged mining and a decentralized DNS. Namecoin was also the first solution to Zooko’s Triangle, the long-standing problem of producing a naming system that is simultaneously secure, decentralized, and human-meaningful.\n\n=Donate=\n\nYou can donate to support Namecoin via a number of methods.\n\nNote: donations are not tax-deductible.\n\n=Direct Cryptocurrency Donations=\n\nThe Namecoin Marketing and Development Fund (operated by Phelix) accepts donations via Bitcoin and Namecoin.\n\n<source>BTC: 18kYBKu2pvj9XRRaAfUMbkm72QniwW2Dre\nNMC: NDtPuyg3adscr6HCE1GUiSsKPtA8ewKgz3\n</source>\n\n<strong>Warnings: Bitcoin and Namecoin do not provide anonymity for donations, although they may (under some circumstances) provide pseudonymity or location-anonymity.
