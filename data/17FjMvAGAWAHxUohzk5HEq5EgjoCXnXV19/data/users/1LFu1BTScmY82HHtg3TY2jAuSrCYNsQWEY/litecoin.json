It was a fork of the [[Bitcoin Core]] client, differing primarily by having a decreased block generation time (2.5 minutes), increased maximum number of coins, different hashing algorithm ([[scrypt]], instead of [[SHA-2|SHA-256]]), and a slightly modified [[GUI]].\n\nDuring the month of November 2013, the aggregate value of Litecoin experienced massive growth which included a 100% leap within 24 hours.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/525867/20131128/litcoin-value-leaps-100-percent-market-cap.htm |title=Litecoin value leaps 100% in a day as market cap passes $1bn |work=International Business Times, UK Edition|first=Alistair|last=Charlton|date=2013-11-28 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref>\n\nLitecoin reached a $1 billion market capitalization in November 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/reuvencohen/2013/11/28/cryto-currency-bubble-continues-litecoin-surpasses-a-billion-dollar-market-capitalization/ |title=Crypto-currency bubble continues: Litecoin surpasses billion dollar market capitalization |work=Forbes |date=2013-11-28 |first=Reuven|last=Cohen|accessdate=2014-01-19}}</ref><!-- Forbes contributor source -->\n\nIn May 2017, Litecoin became the first of the top 5 (by market cap) cryptocurrencies to adopt [[Segregated Witness]]. Later in May of the same year, the first [[Lightning Network]] transaction was completed through Litecoin, transferring 0.00000001 LTC from Zürich to San Francisco in under one second.\n\n== Differences from Bitcoin ==\nLitecoin is different in some ways from [[Bitcoin]].\n\n* The Litecoin Network aims to process a block every 2.5 minutes, rather than Bitcoin's 10 minutes. The developers claim that this allows Litecoin to have faster transaction confirmation.<ref>{{cite news |first= Ian |last=Steadman|date=2013-05-11|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2013/05/wary-of-bitcoin-a-guide-to-some-other-cryptocurrencies/ |title=Wary of Bitcoin?
