This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). State denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. State is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private \"keys\"]] or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 \"HD Wallet\". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.\n\nTo send ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account. Ether accounts are pseudonymous in that they are not linked to individual persons, but rather to one or more specific addresses.\n\n===Ether===\n{{Infobox cryptocurrency\n| currency_name = Ether\n| subunit_ratio_3 = 10<sup>−9</sup>\n| subunit_name_3 = Gwei\n| subunit_ratio_5 = 10<sup>−18</sup>\n| subunit_name_5 = Wei, after cryptocurrency pionneer [[Wei Dai]]\n| symbol = Ξ\n| ticker_symbol = ETH\n| coin_definition = Balances from accounts to be debited/credited, in Wei, non-UTXO scheme\n| block_explorer = {{URL|etherscan.io}}, {{URL|eth.btc.com}}, {{URL|blockchair.com/ethereum}}\n| ledger_genesis = July 30, 2015 (2 years ago)\n| hash_function = [[Keccak]]\n| issuance = Block and Uncle/Ommer reward\n| timestamping = [[Proof-of-work system|Proof-of-work]]\n[[Ethash]]\n| block_time = 14-15 seconds on average\n| block_reward = 2 ETH (non-deterministic)\n| circulating_supply =\n| total_supply = Currently not limited, tending towards halting of new coins.\n| exchange_rate =\n| market_cap =\n| footnotes = {{notelist|group=infobox}}\n}}\n''Ether'' is a fundamental token for operation of Ethereum, which thereby provides a public [[distributed ledger]] for transactions. It is used to pay for gas, a unit of computation used in transactions and other state transitions. Mistakenly, this currency is also referred to as ''Ethereum''.\n\nIt is listed under the [[ticker symbol]] ETH and traded on [[cryptocurrency]] exchanges, and the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Xi (letter)|uppercase Xi]] character (Ξ) is generally used for its [[currency symbol]]. It is also used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum network.<ref name=NYTEVCRB>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/business/dealbook/ethereum-a-virtual-currency-enables-transactions-that-rival-bitcoins.html |title=Ethereum, a Virtual Currency, Enables Transactions That Rival Bitcoin's |last=Popper |first=Nathaniel |date=27 March 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=2 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724214904/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/business/dealbook/ethereum-a-virtual-currency-enables-transactions-that-rival-bitcoins.html |archivedate=24 July 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Addresses===\nEthereum addresses are composed of the prefix \"0x\", a common identifier for [[hexadecimal]], concatenated with the rightmost 20 bytes of the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash ([[Endianness|big endian]]) of the [[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm|ECDSA]] [[Public-key cryptography|public key]].

This is typically measured in Gwei. Bitcoin transactions usually have fees specified in satoshis per byte.\n* Transaction fees are generally considerably lower for Ethereum than for Bitcoin. In December 2017, the median transaction fee for Ethereum corresponded to $0.33, while for bitcoin it corresponded to $23.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n* Ethereum uses an account system where values in Wei are debited from accounts and credited to another, as opposed to Bitcoin's UTXO system, which is more analogous to spending cash and receiving change in return.\n\n===Supply===\nThe total supply of ether was Ξ100 million as of June 2018. In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply. Casper FFG and CBC are expected to reduce the inflation rate to between 0.5% to 2%. There is no currently implemented hard cap on the total supply of ETH.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Markets and stores===\nEther can be traded by regular currency [[brokers]], [[cryptocurrency exchanges]], as well as many online [[cryptocurrency wallet]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/fans-of-digital-currency-ether-can-now-buy-etns-in-sweden|title=Fans of Digital Currency Ether Can Now Buy ETNs—In Sweden|author=Olga Kharif|date=2017-10-11|website=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]}}</ref>\n\n== Platform ==\n\n=== Virtual Machine ===\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.
