the codebase of Bytecoin into the name BitMonero, which is a compound of [[Bit]] (as in [[Bitcoin]]) and Monero (literally meaning \"coin\" in [[Esperanto]]).<ref name=\"WIREDFire\" /> The release of BitMonero was very poorly received by the community that initially backed it. Plans to fix and improve Bytecoin with changes to block time, tail emission and block reward had all been ignored, and thankful_for_today simply disappeared from the development scene. A group of users led by Johnny Mnemonic decided that the community should take over the project, and five days later they did while also changing the name to Monero.\n\nDue to its privacy features, Monero experienced rapid growth in [[market capitalization]] and transaction volume during the year 2016, faster and bigger than any other cryptocurrency that year. This growth was driven by its uptake in the [[darknet market]], where people used it to buy stolen credit cards, guns, and drugs.<ref name=WIREDFire /> Two major darknet markets were shut down in July 2017 by law enforcement.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Popper |first1=Nathaniel |last2=Ruiz |first2=Rebecca R. |title=2 Leading Online Black Markets Are Shut Down by Authorities |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/business/dealbook/alphabay-dark-web-opioids.html?_r=0 |work=The New York Times |date=20 July 2017}}</ref>  From the beginning, Monero has been used by people holding other cryptocurrencies like [[Bitcoin]] to break the link between transactions, with the other cryptocoins first converted to Monero, then after some delay converted back and sent to an address unrelated to those used before.\n\nOn January 10, 2017, the privacy of Monero transactions was further strengthened by the adoption of Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell's algorithm ''Confidential Transactions'', hiding the amounts being transacted, in combination with an improved version of ''Ring Signatures''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/12/bittercoin-true-blockchain-believers-vs-the-trough-of-disillusionment/|title=Bittercoin: true blockchain believers versus the trough of disillusionment|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-19}}</ref>\n\nAfter many online payment platforms shut down access for [[white nationalists]] following the [[Unite the Right rally]] in 2017, some of them, including [[Christopher Cantwell]] and [[weev|Andrew Auernheimer]] (\"weev\"), started using and promoting Monero.<ref name=NewsweekCite>{{cite news |last1=Hayden |first1=Michael Edison |title=White supremacists are investing in a cryptocurrency that promises to be completely untraceable |url=https://www.newsweek.com/white-supremacists-cryptocurrency-monero-bitcoin-861104 |work=Newsweek |date=27 March 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=MotherboardCite>{{cite news |last1=Cox |first1=Joseph |title=Neo-Nazis Turn to Privacy-Focused Cryptocurrency Monero |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/neqy7z/neo-nazis-monero-weev-daily-stormer |work=Motherboard |date=5 March 2018 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nThe operators behind the May 2017 global ransomware incident [[WannaCry]] converted their proceeds into Monero.<ref name=ArsWanna />  In June, [[The Shadow Brokers]], the group that leaked the code used in WannaCry, started accepting payments in Monero.<ref name=ArsWanna />\n\nMalicious hackers have previously embedded Monero mining code into websites and apps seeking profit for themselves.<ref name=\"ZDNetApps\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/android-security-coin-miners-show-up-in-apps-and-sites-to-wear-out-your-cpu/ |title=Android security: Coin miners show up in apps and sites to wear out your CPU {{!}} ZDNet|last=Tung|first=Liam|work=ZDNet|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}</ref> In late 2017 malware and antivirus service providers blocked a [[JavaScript]] implementation of Monero miner Coinhive that was embedded in websites and apps, in some cases by hackers.

Monero developers also noted that Monero Research Labs, their academic and research arm, already noted and outlined the deficiency in two public research papers in 2014 and 2015.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Money}}\n* [[Crypto-anarchism]]\n* [[Darknet]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website|https://getmonero.org/}}\n\n{{Cryptocurrencies|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Alternative currencies]]\n[[Category:Cryptocurrencies]]\n[[Category:Currencies introduced in 2014]]",
