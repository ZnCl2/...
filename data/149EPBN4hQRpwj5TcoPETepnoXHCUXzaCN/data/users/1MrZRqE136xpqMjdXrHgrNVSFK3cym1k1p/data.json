			"description": "An enormously creative and witty comedic film created by the combination of seemingly random and out of place animation clips with accompanying audio sound bites, to create a feature length gag reel that is witty, hilarious, and often downright irreverent.\n\nAMV 3: The Motion Picture, has no real plot to it, and relies heavily on pop culture references, but follows through with several running jokes and repeated character appearances including the main cast of the show Azumanga Daioh, characters from Neon Genesis Evangelion, real life figures like Adolf Hitler, parodies of Soviet Russia, and other completely unrelated events and works of fiction.\n\nFrom classic music hits, to iconic scenes from TV shows and movies used to dub over Anime, it creates a constant run of humorous pokes and prods, ironic representations, and hilarious retakes of memories we all remember fondly.\n\nIt's quite difficult to put into length and detail of what the film is about in whole because it's so random, and yet crafted with smart and clever editing to allow a fluid flow of gag after gag, running jokes, and visual puns and one liners.\n\nReminiscent of early internet humor, it's 60+ minutes of head shaking laughs and jokes with plenty of moments you'll laugh about for years. A movie that you quote back to your friends, for quick laughs.\n\nUltimately the entire film is based on pop culture, Japanese animation, music, and historical events to create a comedy representative of the times, and anyone of age to understand the references will likely have a blast with the film from start to finish.",
