The latter was featured in the episode \"Songs to Love and Die By\", titled after their second album. They also remade a version of Carly Simon's \"Nobody Does It Better\" which was used in the film Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Their song \"Liar\" was featured on Grey's Anatomy and on the season finale of Dirt. MTV used the track \"Give It Up\" on its hit show Road Rules and \"Never Enough\" for a preview of an upcoming episode of The Real World: Sydney.

Bringing their unique spell of melodies and rhythms to Crosstown Rebels, they deliver their cover version of the famous Pink Floyd classic, Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun. Guy Gerber also steps in to deliver a deeply mystical dance floor remix.\n\nSharing an eclectic sonic vision that pulls from diverse influences owing to their Middle Eastern heritage, Western upbringing, and world travels, here Bedouin deliver some of their best productions to date. “Getting the chance to play the song to Pink Floyd’s drummer Nick Mason personally and him liking it was very exciting for us. We're also happy to have the very talented and our good friend Guy Gerber to be the first ever to remix one of our tracks. The b-side, ‘Guacamole’, is an original track conceived in Mexico and made for the dance floor.”\n\nIn 2016, as well as touring the world extensively, Bedouin curated a compilation entitled Kindisch Stories and had the honour of recording an Essential Mix for Pete Tong’s BBC Radio 1 show. 2017 saw the launch of their brand SAGA at Heart Ibiza, where they turn Ibiza Sundays into a mirage of musical odysseys. Guy Gerber also runs his highly successful Rumors party in Ibiza on Sundays, which takes the same name as his acclaimed record label.",

Their pure hear and soul fusion has created this amazing EP which is for sure to take over dancefloors and charts in all corners of the world. Him_self_Her are a Midlands based DJ/Production duo, bringing you all genres of underground house from deep grooves to driving tech, right through to disco infused techno. This duo was formed in late 2011, when the paths of two experienced DJs crossed at a number of Midlands events. Soon they began to realize their deep love for house music that they both shared. They decided to hook up for a studio session and the rest, as they say, is history. Strong creative skills and a deep knowledge of underground music shows in their production work with solid, bouncy basslines rolling underneath unique melodies and vocal stabs and the clever use of strange but deep textures and noises, to layer their sound and create their own distinctive style.\"\n\nPhoto edited by David Ryle",
