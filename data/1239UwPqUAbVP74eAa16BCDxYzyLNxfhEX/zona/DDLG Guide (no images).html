<div pbzloc="2" style="text-align: justify">This guide is not for sissies but for young pedophiles with guts, an above average IQ, good physical and mental health, good self-control and high morality. My hope is that this guide decreases suffering, not increase it. My goal is that I want pedophiles to take care of vulnerable orphans as a win-win, to both be happy and secure in a <em class="text-italics">permanent</em> relationship. You can extend her attractive period of her life by letting her grow up in a good environment so she keeps a nice shape, nice skin longer. And a sweet expression on her face and a sweet character maybe for life. See more about this in below chapters. Most non-pedo guys also stop feeling sexually attracted to their wife at some point but it is nice to stay together if she is a pleasant woman. The child would technically be your slave and that is safer for her. Note children are also a slave of their parents, as in child <em class="text-italics">custody</em>. Be careful not to make her pregnant before her hips are fully grown. And try to remember how overwhelming feelings can be as a child. Keywords to keep in mind while reading this guide are <em class="text-italics">her trust and innocence</em> (instead of feminist independence) and <em class="text-italics">control and sustainability</em> (instead of casual sex or having to dump her). To make my guide more acceptable I omitted manhandling techniques but we must not completely bend over for the #metoo show incl. the new explicit-consent-only movements. On the other hand I think pedosexual culture should not be allowed to be hijacked by promotion of casual sex, odd fetishes and child porn. If you get a girl please give her at least a clean bed and fruit and veggies and a source of vitamin B12, which can make you feel good about yourself[1]. Do not keep her illiterate or worse so that when is is 18, and she does not want to stay with you anymore or you do not want her anymore, she can go and integrate into society. And a warning for authorities of most countries: You can eat a bullet from me with your nonconstructive witch hunt.</div>

&nbsp;

<div pbzloc="5" style="text-align: justify"><em class="text-italics" pbzloc="6">Pedophile relationships can be amazing and the gentleness of it might be even more virtuous than adult fucking. Pedophilia is not primarily a matter of sex, but of love, of being wanted (...) and to some pedophiles, their relationships with children are constituted by an intense love and affection (Li, Chin-Keung, 1990). Child porn collectors are often not pedophiles but older men who are drawn by the taboo and sexiness of the child. Most child porn producers focus on the pussy and anus but in a relationship with a child there is no point to get obsessed with penetrating her if you cannot get her to like that yet. There are confident pretty young girls who will like naughtiness or can learn to like it. But if she does not understand the concept sexy it will turn into something psychopathic. That there is no cure for pedophilia makes me think it is not a disorder. Does a Daddy Dom abuse his adult little? No, like a good daddy he is sensitive to what his little is ready for when. He communicates with her and she trusts him. A man and a young girl can really complement each other in their interaction and exploration of each other, more so than close-in-age relationships. And shared experiences in her younger years, the extra trust and bonding during the teenage rewiring of the brain create extra longterm bond. The bond of a childhood sweetheart can be strong and there are people who get back with their childhood sweetheart after divorce. Actually I think the solution to the high divorce rate of nowadays and teenagers being brats is back to the natural way of marrying at onset of puberty. Mental maturity is more through nurture, with nature not a limiting factor. Casual-sex-only for teens and divorce are considered normal nowadays but both are the real child abuse. And institutional education, a career, equality and independence are what is actually harmful, too. Human rights are an invention. It is all but a brainwashed suicide race and a waste of time. Instead of rights what we have is needs and it is not a career we need. If you want equality in a relationship you better become gay and have tantrum fights every day. It is not possible anymore to find a teen partner as it is frowned upon and teens are brainwashed. Better get her very young and raise your own wife hidden away (see chapter 2.1). Be careful not to make her pregnant before her hips are fully grown. If this does go wrong you can try to perform symphysiotomy on her. Always be ready to perform this. Until a century ago girls would have their menarche at around 16 and to bring it back to that as much as possible the girl needs to stay free of toxins from when she is conceived in the womb and that is hard to control for the first generation. After she has reached the age of majority you might want to keep her and do not need to hide her anymore. I propose an approach to the relationship and that is DD/lg (while I tried to avoid TL/dr). This first chapter is based on a debate I had with a user at GaP in June and older debates at MK. I have studied child psychology and have observed tribal children and teens. I did not add the grooming tips I posted before at MK as these can be used too easily by serial rapists. Also research about child sexuality and consent I have mostly omitted, which can be found at <a class="postlink" href="http://es2adizg32j3kob5.onion/">Topic Links</a>. And of course there is also useful general info on relationships on clearnet. </em></div>

<em pbzloc="19">DDLG, or dd/lg, is a relationship in which one person is the caregiver or &quot;daddy&quot; and the other is childlike.

This is a type of BDSM relationship that may or may not involve sex, but often involves play with child-like things, such as stuffed animals, bed-time stories, and spankings.

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 110%; line-height: normal">1.1 Applying child psychology to the DD/lg life style</span></div>
&nbsp;

<div pbzloc="59" style="text-align: justify">What about if we apply child psychology to the DD/lg life style? I think it is OK to have a child sex slave (and I like to be crude). I think casual sex with children is harmful as she will feel unsafe after it is finished and she loses bonding ability. Permanent relationships are the way to go if you have the mental strength for this. I think it should be based on the same principles as the normal parent-child relationship[3][4]. It is proven that permissive style is bad for children. Do not put them in the driver seat completely. At the same time authoritarian is bad too. The way to go with a permanent sexual relationship with a child is authoritative. Girls like to be lusted for by their man and need a man who can handle her firmly and consistently and children like to please adults. It makes her feel secure and desirable. The only way is a trusting relationship, not equality, so a large age gap and making her your happy little slave is fine. Watch the movie Pretty Baby and Lolita and ask yourself if anyone is served with allowing her to rebel like that and for you to flip your lid on her. Be firm but do not flip your lid because she will feel unsafe and that is the real harm. As a good Daddy Dom you control yourself and her. Most precocious lolitas are of the naughty kind who need to submit to some authority. Equality gets you quarrels and hence the high divorce rate. The man should have the final decision. Do not allow her to manipulate you. Show her your competence with her so learn for example some daddy hair dos, (story) massage and finger plays. Except submission, do not explicitly teach the kid things too early[5][6] but let her play freely with abstract toys[7], including sexual activities. The mind of a toddler is godly being less constrained to fixed concepts. It is fun to see what sexy things she comes up by herself so allow her to take initiatives. When she gets older she can become your advisor[8]. A man is only half without his woman. I would personally let her slowly become my equal to have a buddy to scrub my back and talk with when I am old.</div>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 110%; line-height: normal">1.2 Child sexuality, consent and spanking your little</span></div>
&nbsp;

<div pbzloc="58" style="text-align: justify">Going deeper down the hole in this second paragraph. I think a 20yo guy with a 10yo girl looks pretty epic and if he gets a little bit lustful with her and she feels safe with that it would be more beautiful still. Sex is kid play to feel good with sensory exploring and creativity[8]. Many children, but not all, love to experiment with spanking, to explore with their senses. They are just very sensitive to taboo[9]. Even BDSM[10] with a child can be beneficial for the child because it is natural. Adult women have rape fantasies[11]. But if you look at how naughty kids can be and what they talk about among each other, these fantasies start small and slowly progress into maturity. Currently one after the other country in Europe is making sex without explicit consent forbidden. If you mistaken her &quot;no&quot; for yes in a relationship it is not more harmful than non-sexual things she does not want to do. What actually is important is to be sensitive to her, as a good master[12][13]. If you do BDSM with a child it should increase her trust in you more than without, not make her trust you less. If you do BDSM with a child it is best to do trust games mostly. Do not turn her into a crazy bitch. A pretty girl is prettiest if she behaves gracefully feminine and funny but a brat is less desirable to most men. If you love her and try hard to imagine how something feels you might just refrain from things such as needle play. Try it on yourself first and see if this is what you want her to feel. Take it slow during anal sex because it is just dumb if it feels to her like having constipation and diarrhea at the same time. If that does not sound convincing know that karma can be a bitch if you fuck around too much with Gods little angles. If you are too horny and want to do things you might feel sorry about afterwards just wank it off and play with her after that. If you say there must always be explicit consent I have good news. From what age can someone give consent? The answer is easy. Some kids become emotionally mature already when they are&nbsp;young and some people never will, scientifically proven again last year. This paper says maturity comes from behavior, not from the brain structure itself. That is also how modern teens can be infantile while in ages before they were not. And still now in tribal groups teens are much more mature, ready to marry[14]. Western society typically keeps teens infantile. But whether she is mature or not you can handle your pet[15] firmly if you like and decide <em class="text-italics">for her</em> as a good master, while carefully reading her signals. You can own her without harm and she can own your body somewhat. A young girl has not&nbsp;experienced that casual sexual relations makes her loose bonding ability so an innocent girl can never give full consent. She only has full ability to consent, having experienced all the implications, when she is not innocent anymore. Rather keep her innocent I would&nbsp;say. Full consent is kind of robotic. Sex is more fun if it is overwhelming and naughty. It is&nbsp;OK to make her submit to you when she is ready for that. Usually the prettier and more feminine the girl is, the earlier you can start with BDSM. Tweens and teens can give consent well, as healthy[14] ones in this age bracket have a strong morality and idealism and are extra sensitive to peer-control[16]. Do not&nbsp;lie to the child about moral standards, e.g. incest, and do not&nbsp;abuse her trust, e.g. doing as if you love her, to avoid trauma (Finkelhor, 1985) but tell her after a few happy years with you how society views girl love so she can choose to stay with you or leave when she is 18.</div>

&nbsp;

<div style="text-align: justify"><em class="text-italics">This chapter is independent from the other chapters. A common factor between the chapters is that I try to find the most sustainable solution at every step of the plan.</em></div>
&nbsp;

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 110%; line-height: normal">2.1 Justifications for hiding her</span></div>
&nbsp;

<div pbzloc="19" style="text-align: justify">I think it is OK to hide a girl if she has no family you could traumatize or a very abusive family. But if you do not&nbsp;want to have the whole world on your ass just buy the girl or use a surrogate mother. See chapter 3 on selecting a girl. It is up to you to choose to be indeed the worst scum or be a despised secret hero. At least give her a clean bed but you can do a lot more. If you get caught you leave her with secondary trauma with people telling her it was bad. I wrote in the intro to chapter 1 why young marriage is better and nicer. But as this is frowned upon and modern teens are too brainwashed the only way to have her young is to get her very young and hide her. I believe it is&nbsp;OK to hide her because modern society is hazardous to children[17]. Even just unavoidable car accidents are unacceptable. Or realize how thick-headed people are when for example that plastic packaging is only in 2018 starting to get outlawed, while the oceans and our actual blood if full of degraded plastic micro particles. I have the continuum concept[18] in mind with how it should be, which would outlaw many kinds of professions. Pretty much every profession that cannot be observed by children day-to-day are unsustainable. I like the continuum concept because when I was a kid the whole world did not&nbsp;make sense to me because I could not&nbsp;observe what adults did and I went too deep with my analysis of things. Also part of the social aspect is that I think homeschooling kids makes them way nicer people, considering how mature tribal kids and teens were, who I observed in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Instead of rebelling, tribal teens find a partner. You can have a nice girl similar to tribal kids by keeping her away from modern influences. So if you hide the kid well and create a nurturing environment for her I think it is worth the risk for her. Then there are even precocious girls who have to hide their sadness about not being able to have sex. Openly precocious girls are the pretty confident ones most of the times. But the quiet ones have the biggest fantasies. So for precocious girls it is double justified to hide her, for her own sexuality and for the harm of society, if you have a plan that is as good as it can get.</div>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 110%; line-height: normal">2.2 Hiding her in plain sight or off the grid</span></div>
&nbsp;

<div pbzloc="20" style="text-align: justify">If you hide her create a nurturing environment for her, see paragraph 1. Practical aspects with hiding her is if you go self-sustainable with a farm and must avoid medical costs, let her play outside for vitamin D and to avoid myopia, not let her rot away in a cellar. Drill emergency situations with her for her to learn to be quick to get back into the house but not to act suspiciously. If you can create a nice home for her she might get a wet pussy from it[19]. You can hide the girl just in your own house in a town or in plain sight as a digital nomad[20][21]. Or better still off the grid or in plain sight with a farm[21]. Pick an option where you can circumvent compulsory education[22]. With the latter try to be as self-sustainable as possible to be flexible and stay off the radar. But why not sell produce from your farm or make things things to sell[23]. I have personally found gardening to be therapeutic. As English-speaking digital nomad if you have no useful qualifications for this: the market for online English teaching is getting quite large and the pay can be pretty good. Jackpot could be if you can find a prostitute pregnant with a half race daughter from another guy. You can then have your name put on the birth certificate. So you can travel with the girl. But got to be lucky for her to turn out a girl that you like. Once the girl is adult I think she will&nbsp;be loyal to you but if not, let her go. Do not&nbsp;keep her illiterate, so she can integrate back into society if she wishes. There is no need for early exposure to digital media at all[7][24] but do show her what the world is about, to prepare her to work by herself when you get old and die. Treat her well so she will not&nbsp;stab you in your back or bite off your dick later. Last but not least have a plan for when you get found out. I will not&nbsp;give too many specific ideas about the latter as that would help LEA. As I stated in my opening statement I think this thing is only for if you have an above average IQ. For the sake of the girl at least do not&nbsp;do anything stupid with anything in your life that gets you on the police radar. Be a perfectionist. Never get sloppy, at least not until she is 18. Create a home that will outsmart LEA with whatever emergency option you take, have a bag of things to take to jail and a bug-out bag, know your rights and if you live abroad have phone numbers of your embassy, etc. In case of a farm at least have a bark-happy dog and a private road, to buy you time. Expect police to come in the wee hours when they find out. If you buy security tech ware do not&nbsp;let your purchases leave traces, e.g. top up internet money anonymously at an ATM, order online and receive it at a post office in a country where just a copy of a (fake) passport suffices.

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 110%; line-height: normal"><strong class="text-strong">3. GETTING A GIRL</strong></span></div>
&nbsp;

<div style="text-align: justify"><em class="text-italics">This chapter is independent from the other chapters. A common factor between the chapters is that I try to find the most sustainable solution at every step of the plan. Also see chapter 2.2 with buying tips that enable you to hide her in plain sight.</em></div>
&nbsp;

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 110%; line-height: normal">3.1 The who, how and where of finding her</span></div>
&nbsp;

<div pbzloc="22" style="text-align: justify">As for the who: When you can choose a girl check her first reaction to you and thereafter. It might show if she is precocious, if she likes you and if she is wild or docile. As a Daddy Dom I personally like girls who have slight flaws such being slightly senile or having crossed eyes but with a great body. If I could choose I would skip her if she has hairy legs and a hairy lower back[25] and if she has Mongolian spots[26] on her ass and back, both which both Asian and Latin girls can be affected by. Not all young girls have soft skin so you might want to check e.g. her hand and arm. Medically first of all check her teeth as you might not be able to bring her to the dentist. If she is breastfed at least 6 months by a healthy mother this is a big pro, the longer the better. It is a good sign if she has long legs and long fingers. You could also check her eye sight and if she can walk on a line without limping and all the other checks of a pediatric examination, if the situation allows. If the girl is very pretty I would&nbsp;just accept the deal before mom changes her mind. For me most important would be if I feel a click with the girl, call it genetic attraction. If you are white and get a white girl from Eastern Europe or Russia she could pass as your daughter, if you take her to live with you at your home in Europe. But if you want to buy a girl from poor people of color, let us say&nbsp;Latin America, Africa or Asia, you might want to look for a half-race girl to still look like as if your daughter. With a half-race girl you can get away with it better if she totally does not&nbsp;look like you, if people do not&nbsp;know how the mom looks like. The younger the faster the girl can adjust, as long as she has gone through her attachment period, just like with legal adoption. The pros of getting her extra young is that time flies, she is small which is easy for transportation, she eats little, she is more adaptable[27], you can avoid her getting cavities in her adult teeth in time and avoid other diseases with healthy food without processed sugar. With a very young girl the chance is also smaller she has deformed feet due to wrong shoes. Very young is also good if you want her to forget[28] her parentage and religion and want her to be like a native speaker of a new language. Girls of different ages is good for the language development of the younger one(s). Different ages is good to avoid fights if you know how to exploit this. More than one girl is less scary for her. The prettier the girl is, the better her sexual self-image, the more sexually willing she will likely be.<br />
<br />
As for the how: Half-race girls who need a daddy can be found where white sex tourists misbehave abroad and make prostitutes pregnant. These half-race babies however usually do not&nbsp;grow up in the brothel area. They might be living with grandparents in an area near to the brothel area or just as likely anywhere else in countries which have sex tourist areas. Slowly show interest to see if they are interested to give away the girl (see appendix below). Sometimes they are happy to give her away because of the stigma of prostitution and it is easy to make up an excuse for them to say the kid has gone to live with mom. Moms are sometimes willing to give away their little daughter because her new boyfriend does not&nbsp;want kids. Some Southeast Asian, Latin and African moms even think it is funny to give her daughter to a pedo, I kid you not. They do not&nbsp;worry about a thing so do not&nbsp;start about difficult things. Another way is just to hook up with several hookers and ask her if she has kids. Or ask her if she knows if any of her hooker friends have kids. But with the latter approach you have to be real subtle and slow, e.g. asking her if there are hookers who need help or something. There are also still orphanages in several countries[29]. Any party might ask you for a deposit with you having to come back later, which is risky. But do not&nbsp;show too much distrust or they will not&nbsp;trust you either. Do not&nbsp;appear gullible either, making you look like an easy victim to rip off. Show you know what you are doing but also not too much which makes you look like a trafficker.<br />
<br />
As for the where: With picking a country think ahead what language you want your girl to (continue) to speak, even if you keep her for life as she will likely survive you in age. If you do not&nbsp;keep her for life, which I do not&nbsp;recommend, think ahead where the girl could go. In Asia you can pose e.g. as a tourist, photographer, journalist or NGO. Especially as the latter two it is perfectly normal to bring a translator/driver along or look around construction sites, municipal dumps, disaster zones or war zones. You might want to go without the translator/driver when it is time for the transaction. In Southeast Asia one has to be very careful with new crackdowns this year. The Philippines and Thailand have actually been swept clean a lot the past two years. No more hush hush. In South America you can also do this but at least in Brazil, Colombia and Bolivia only if you look like a local or if you know the right people who can protect you. Same goes for the Middle East, North Africa and Russia, you must look like a local, unless posing as NGO (in a war zone). Police in South America and Asia are fast becoming much more high tech on every level so forget about sticking out by using Tor there. And beware of plain-clothed informants and CCTV everywhere, including corporate CCTV pointed towards public space, including from behind a tinted window. Together with CCTV do not&nbsp;forget that many cars these days have dash cams and people all have smart phones with cameras. I have no info on individual African countries as this continent is prone to be completely different every few years. All non-western countries are becoming increasingly xenophobic towards white people but Asia is still safest if you have money and appear laid-back. There is much possible in South Asia. The latest thing in India is the death penalty for child rapists but it is geographically hard to bring a girl out of there overland. Finally, in Central Asia there are some ISIS-sympathetic no-go areas but there is also places with heavy crackdown on Islam there. As a plus to all the obstacles mentioned here you will have less competition I suppose. The past two or three decades child prostitution was possible for foreigners but that era is finished. But with the decline of communism it actually is less dangerous to travel in some interesting developing countries than before the child sex tourism period.</div>

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 110%; line-height: normal">3.2 The transaction and transportation</span></div>
&nbsp;

<div pbzloc="29" style="text-align: justify">Money buys everything. Call it an adoption fee or compensation for the costs of having raised the girl so far. I would avoid calling it a dowry though. I would convince the caretaker of the child I will take good care of the child, as I would (see below appendix). A benefit of picking the girl up late at night is that she will be sleepy. Keep account that it could be a setup. You cannot prepare this step enough, also for the safety of the girl. It is&nbsp;best to take the girl right away after the proposal. But if the mom can be trusted enough you could have the girl go to the dentist first to extract any bad milk teeth or even do an HIV test. After the proposal has been made stay outside near the door opening. Do not&nbsp;go inside a room where you can get ambushed by a mob in case it is a setup. You can opt to listen in on police radio or after the first meeting you can leave a button mic in the parents living room to see what they say after you have left. In countries where police is advanced it is hard to get away in case of a setup or the parent changing their mind. Think of helicopters and drones with infrared cameras, etc. Getting over a land border with her right away is best in developing countries. I do not&nbsp;want to give too much info because that could be used by readers with purely ill intentions. This part of the plan is the riskiest but you only need to go through this once. It is much safer than being a sex tourist who takes the risk multiple times. Be patient to find that mother who really wants to get rid of her pretty dau, just to get that new rich boyfriend. Which such a mom the girl would also be better off with a good girl lover. It is hard and risky like hell to try to bring a girl by yourself from Asia through Russia or from Africa to Europe or from Latin America to North America. You can figure that but I have done the actual research and survey. It is not impossible but I might give up on the long distance trafficking option myself. The Americas option is possible by yacht[30] by hiding her in plain sight. The Russia route is becoming more and more possible as roads are improving[31] in East Russia but better have a Russian driver, Russian plates and a legal guardian of the child with police at state border checkpoints and along the whole way in West Russia. But as European you might first want to try to find an illegal immigrant child in Europe itself who needs a daddy. The same goes for illegal immigrants in North America. The general consensus on Tor is that it is too dangerous to try within the USA. But why not have a look around with at least 10 grand in the pocket. If you feel you have a suitable bankrupt candidate try very subtly and only very subtly. If you get a no or they play stupid, stop poking and consider scrapping this state and move on and try in another. Note if the mom is broke and you are a good and good-looking pedo her daughter might just be better off with you if she is no older than three.</div>

</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li pbzloc="33">At least depends on the stability of everything of course and if I am not too old by the time I finally have a girl and she finally being ready to become my baby machine. It could take decades from now, until the moment I finally splurt my cum deep into her (again) when her hips are full-grown, including the time to find a girl.</li>
	<li pbzloc="37">Not planning to. Just DD/lg with an orphan ideally. Morality is subjective. But taken that daddies have less testosterone when a baby is born with the imprinting that goes with it I think incest is innately unnatural. And that is funny for me to say while promoting Daddy/little relationships. But especially with the whole witch hunt on us who am I to judge if you keep it to your daughter. Personally I would have felt pretty fucked up if I was used by my parents but less so by handsome non-family. Additionally for both the girl and the daddy there is the Westermarck effect. But as a real Daddy Dom I would love my little daughter (and son) a LOT. I am not really a boy lover but if my son would look the way I looked when I was young I would eat him up. As a kid I was a boy lovers dream. But to give her away to another guy, especially a girl lover, would be pretty cool, too.</li>
	<li pbzloc="38">I think I cannot fall in love anymore after having lost my first love. So I would&nbsp;ideally get three girls. One to tease myself with to only hug (dressed in white), a girl to tempt into showing me her young hidden desires (dressed in pink) and a girl for bdsm (dressed in black). By not letting them be equal and each knowing their place they can avoid conflicts. I would&nbsp;let them get a bit lesbian together but not like crazy.</li>
	<li pbzloc="39">I am pedophile but I also get rock hard instantly when I see pregnant young women. If I get to hide a girl I make her pregnant as soon she she hits 16 if her hips are wide enough and she loves me.</li>
	<li pbzloc="41">I have totally rewritten the article. How about it now? I do not&nbsp;want to touch the quote from The Urban Dictionary, except from having crossed out &quot;or any minor.&quot;</li>

Please note this is legally speaking not abduction but human trafficking, with consent of the childs guardian. Or I like to call it informal adoption. This practise has happened for thousands of years. Real abusers will not&nbsp;bother to do it this way. And abuse nowadays happens virtually as incest only. Fuck the government with their witch hunt on girl lovers. The girl might have a hard first few weeks but that is also with legal adoption. The most important thing to let her get used to her new life is lots of platonic love and get her 3 year old&nbsp;ideally. have nice things that kids like to distract her with the first few weeks. If the girl is better off, from an unsafe poor family that does not&nbsp;care, to a rich girl lover, that would be a triple win on the longterm (parent happier, pedo happier, girl happier).</p>

With rapid development of technology, one has to think pretty big not to get caught, e.g. going very rural and/or abroad or e.g. an elaborate plan as digital nomad. Or just have nerves of steel and deal with the risk if you consider it worth it.<br />
<br />
But what do you actually mean with it being unsustainable? The relationship itself on the long term? Note that a permanent relationship without outside influence and casual sex are rather different. Have you seen how young girls outside modern social control behave sexually? If you raise your own wife from when she is 2 or 3 years old, you might be pleasantly surprised.<br />

What baldflat says in this guide makes sense. Pretty much all of it. He has a somewhat slave/master-mentality that <strong class="text-strong">may not be for everyone</strong> but it still makes sense. Even if you are not a slave/master/BDSM kind of guy you should know that they do have A LOT right! The &quot;Redpill&quot; sub-reddit is a nice reference here I would say. In keeping (and teaching) men to BE MEN. Women are not always right you know. There is some kind of &quot;master/slave&quot; thing between the sexes evolutionary and biologically. <strong class="text-strong" pbzloc="249">There is however a fine line...!</strong> But if you are strong, authorative and loving, it is possibly a healthier and better way to treat our sisters than &quot;equality no matter what&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
As for the means on how to do it - that also makes sense. <strong class="text-strong">If you are going to pull off having a relationship with a young one, this is one of the best, safest and healthiest ways to do it.</strong> And I must emphasize that THIS IS ADULT-CHILDREN relationships we are talking about. Hardly the norm... You are doing something that in itself might or might not be beneficial. If you do it you might as well do it in a way that harms less. And while it might sound like this is a masochistic approach to it - it might actually be the best way. <strong class="text-strong">Human life is uniquely complex and NOT black-and-white. Think about the many horrible human fates out there. If this guide is followed and you stay loving and listen to and try to feel what the child feels, this life should actually not become horrible and miserable for the kid. I would indeed say it could be a very good life.</strong></div>

For the 4th time Replyer 15: no abduction in any version of my guide or previously as article. Not even parental abduction. It is informal adoption I promote, of girls who need a daddy. Read the guide first. Harm to the child is a good one but should be asked by anyone else. Let me already say it is best to get her as young as possible. And many children get adopted and need time to get used to their new caretaker.Showing love helps a lot. Children have different love languages and you need to find out hers. And not seduce, sedate or gape her like the way you promote in your posts.<br />

Yes, any hobby requires a good bit of obsession.

The ones here who are obsessive are &quot;original-file-name&quot; &quot;collect-all-you-can&quot; addicts. Like you said once, it is just porn.

The idea I propose is, legally speaking, human trafficking, not abduction, as the mother consents to give her child away. Legally she is not allowed to just give the child away as she has legal <em class="text-italics">custody</em> over it. Again, read the guide first. In there I write some legal loopholes e.g. getting your name as father on the birth certificate e.g. for the digital nomad option. That is better than legal adoption is most countries. I actually forgot for a moment I should not solicit ideas about legal adoption which are too easy options for abusers in some countries. My way to make the risk acceptably low of getting caught takes a lot of preparation and surveying, which abusers will not be willing to do. So I think the only responsible way to promote is illegal adoption, not legal adoption. Legal adoption in countries where it is not easy is of course not safe.<br />

Seduction with casual encounters you promote gets her PTSD. My way has been done for thousands of years. It is very popular nowadays to break with old customs. We will see. TBH&nbsp;I would&nbsp;want to overwhelm the girl, as a man. But if she is scared I will give it time and... seduce her. In my case seducing is fine because it happens in a protected environment where no one can give her secondary trauma.<br />
<br />
How do you see your way in practise? Explain. You speak in other threads of using opportunities. These kind of opportunities a lot of pedophiles cannot handle. I know what I am talking about because as I had this as a teen. I could not keep my fingers out of girls panties with &quot;opportunities.&quot; There is a big chance the pedophile goes too far and gives the child direct psychological harm and after that secondary harm.

</blockquote>
This is a good point for discussion in this Daddy Dom / little girl topic, as spanking over the knee is the hallmark of DD/lg. You might have a point as far as parenting. I am not sure TBH. But in a DD/lg interdependency a little spanking is always good. Without a little spanking it makes the job of a parent too frustrating. Advanced skills are needed to assert your authority over a child without touching it. It is a natural part of child development to go through phases where it is motivated <em class="text-italics">ex</em>trinsically (punishment and reward, the child cannot keep itself from taking the candy) and later <em class="text-italics">in</em>trinsically (morality, the child can control herself).<br />
<br />
However I think it should be avoided that mothers spank their sons. Anyway in a sexual relationship with a child I have no qualms about a gentle spanking to teach her to be submissive. If you think female submission is wrong than you write off 80% of the worlds cultures dude. Apparently female submission is natural. Submissive females, if with a good husband, are way happier than their feminist independent counterparts. Most feminine women who do not get laid properly are cantankerous bitches.<br />
<br />
Permissive child rearing is an absolute no. Has never worked with a child, ever and you sound like you have no idea what you are talking about with children. But yes I would worship and cherish her body and soul. I am sure you have watched the movie Pretty Baby or read Lolita. Is that how you want it to end up for her and you? If girls are reared by their parents to be submissive it is very happy for the girl. There are always exceptions and that is great to have some diversity but I mean as a general rule.<br />

I have ideas about this in my guide and that is the best reason why it is good to have a guide. Also in a close-in-age relationship she will also surpass the age of attraction of her man. It is this misguided pedo subculture that guys like you have promoted the past 30 years that makes every pedo think now it is not possible to stay with her for life.

With rapid development of technology, one has to think pretty big not to get caught, e.g. going very rural and/or abroad or e.g. an elaborate plan as digital nomad. Or just have nerves of steel and deal with the risk if you consider it worth it.<br />
<br />
But what do you actually mean with it being unsustainable? The relationship itself on the long term? Note that a permanent relationship without outside influence and casual sex are rather different. Have you seen how young girls outside modern social control behave sexually? If you raise your own wife from when she is 2 or 3 years old, you might be pleasantly surprised.<br />

You actually reference parenting styles, which is great and point out that both Permissive and Authoritarian styles are problematic. This is accurate, but parenting does not actually fall on a spectrum with an x-y access and there are many other styles as well, both positive and negative. The Wikipedia page you cite has a very incomplete section on this (it leaves out &quot;Neglectful&quot; and &quot;Co-dependent&quot; for example) but it does mention both &quot;Positive&quot; parenting and what it calls &quot;Child centered&quot; parenting, which I personally feel are what we should be going for here (and are emphatically not Authoritative parenting).<br />
<br />
I believe the only ethical way to sexualize a relationship with a child is one that results in a sexually empowered adult at the end. One that aims to sort of mold a perfect lover will not get you that and is not ethical. And I recognize the irony of talking about ethics, as a man who wants to have sex with my own children, with my wifes participation someday (ASAP).</strong> When/if that happens, we will be using your guide more as a &quot;what not to do&quot; than as a helpful handbook.</div>

<p pbzloc="237">I think&nbsp;Replyer 29&nbsp;confuses authoritarian with authorative. And I think positive parenting does not need to be child-centered. I prefer the Continuum Concept which is typically not child-centered. And I think it should be judged case by case how much body autonomy she needs. I hope I will find a girl who likes to get manhandled and played with. That is how it used to be, being able to grab your girl whenever you want and she loved the attention. People are so full of the explicit consent thing suddenly. The body autonomy I would teach her is that I am the only man who can touch her (and that she can touch me any time she feels need, too).<br />

So now that several users have expressed their opinion about the ethics it could be time to look at real child psychology.<br />
<br />
There could be more conversation about whether little girls get traumatized from even the mildest manhandling <em class="text-italics">during sex play</em> but there is of course lack of research. Best empirical evidence is child porn, e.g. with Bibigons Natasha. She was into it except for cum in her mouth and too fast anal. And remember the discussion at MK when the vomiting deepthroat girl vid came out. The general consensus at MK was that vid is not hurtcore as she seemed to be into performing well and thus the vid was allowed to stay up. But we can hardly examine the longterm effects of rough play on children, as child porn actors always get abandoned, see the popular What happened to.. topic here on FF.<br />
<br />
Actually it is so easy: you can see if she enjoys it or not. If she is very scared, feels very unsafe all the time, yes, PTSD guaranteed. But even then there is still the Stockholm Sydrome and rape fantasies as an adult. But I do not think psychos will bother reading my guide. I hope they do actually, to start some introspection, triggering some emphaty. It is the same technique I use when debating atheists I pose as the Devils advocate, refraining form telling what side I am on as long as possible.<br />
<br />
I believe instead of trauma, docile feminine erotophilic girls will be extra happy with a guy who lusts for her, also on the longterm, if you allow her to become your equal gradually. Healthy children crave being wanted and crave intimacy and crave for boundaries, either sexual or non-sexual. If there are no boundaries most children will start pushing it to try to find the limit. But if you have a girl with a docile temperament and if you can get your girl to trust you she will like sexual manhandling and will not need much correction in day-to-living.</em></p>
