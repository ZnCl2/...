			"body": "'sleep' command is very useful when setting a timer before running any command just like:\n\n```\nsleep 5s && echo \"hello world\";\n```\n\nBut there's no dedicated command for setting an alarm on a certain date-time such as:\n\n```\nalarm 'tomorrow 7:24AM' && \"wake up!\";\n```\n\nNow I'm going to show you how to implement this with the embedded commands like 'sleep' and 'date'. A good thing with 'date' command is it has its own timestamp parsing function in it. That is, we can describe date-time format in a various ways such as 'today 21:30', '+1day 13:10' (= Mon 8 Apr 13:10:00 KST 2019 in case of Korea), or '2019-04-09 23:01:03':\n\n```\nsleep $(( $( date -d '13:0' +%s ) - $(date -d now +%s) )) && echo \"It's 13:00:00!\";\n```\n\n`+%s` means it shows the output in a format of the seconds elapsed since 1970 Jan 1 till 2019 April 7 13:00:00 or till now. `$(( a - b ))` shows the mathematical operation of 'a -b' so that sleep for the time difference in seconds between the target time and the current time, and then print \"It's 13:00:00!\".\n\nMake it into a function:\n\n```\nsleep-alarm() { sleep $(( $( date -d \"$1\" +%s ) - $(date -d now +%s) )); }\n\nsleep-alarm 'today 7PM' && echo 'Kick the door and surprise Tom.';\n```"

The front letter of a pair of letters which makes up each title is repeated in order of 10 [천간cheongan; 天干; Heavenly Stems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavenly_Stems), and the tail letter is repeated in order of 12 [지지Jiji; 地支; Earthly Branches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthly_Branches). The both letters make up total 60 titles ( = 10 x 12 ). It's a kind of sexagenary numbering system. Each of 10 heavenly stems and 12 earthly branches has its own meaning so that each of 60 titles comes to have a unique meaning as well.\n.\nFor example it's 기해(Giihae; 己亥) this year. Gii means Yellow and Hae means Pig. People used to call it Golden Pig's year. In Asia, pig as a symbol has a meaning of richness or prosperity, and yellow reminds of gold. So it is believed that it's very lucky year.\n.\nHow do they make it into their luck? They used to give a special meaning if a baby is born in the year Giihae. And his Asian star sign becomes Pig. But nowadays most people don't give it much meaning anyway. Most times it is used as only marketing purposes, it's like, to induce people to spend some extra money.\n.\nBut it's still meaningful to those who're preparing university entrance exam or civil service exams because in history many historical events were named after the year title of the year it happened. And in my case I even memorized the formula to convert Gregorian calendar year into sexagenary title and vise versa.\n.\nIn regard with the tail letter as the animal sign, Koreans call this a birth star sign 띠(Tii; year of animal) though it's actually not related to horoscope or constellation of the West, but this system was originally created based on Jupiter's 12 year routine anyway. If one was born in 2019, his animal sign is Pig.\n.\nWhen you meet someone in Korea and if u feel like asking his/her age, u can ask him/her his/her Tii rather than asking him/her his/her birth year or age directly since it's a little rude. And then u can easily find out how old he/she is if the age gap between u and him/her is less than 24 years. This is the usual way to find out someone's age because it has a little bit of funny thing to talk about animal signs of each other. ( born in 2019 pig, 2020 mouse, 2021 cow, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, chicken, dog, pig(again). Animal signs were introduced from 12 gods of Buddhism. )\n.\nThese 12 animal signs or earthly branches have been also used as unit of hours of a day in ancient times by saying each branch points a pair of hours so that total 12 make up 24 hours a day since thousands of years ago. That is, there was also duodecimal numbering system in Asia.\n.\nAnyway, if u're going to have time with ur family or friends during Surl holidays, this post will give u a small tip to make a talk with others.\n.\nHappy lunar new year!

You can put `visit_zeronet.io_to_download_zeronet_server_client` as well! lol.\n\n# Or you can just open the first level path to anything whatever they type!\n\nLike, \"[http://127.0.0.1:43110/**This_is_how_to_kill_the_mocking_bird**/16J4mEgR5aqerfzGy2WctNV3onPQUgF2E5/upload/real%20size%20of%20countries%20map%206wncgOBGIC8.jpg](/16J4mEgR5aqerfzGy2WctNV3onPQUgF2E5/upload/real%20size%20of%20countries%20map%206wncgOBGIC8.jpg)\". lol.\n\n**What's the benefit?**\n\nBy adding this feature in zeronet URL format, even though u put zeronet URL in the clearnet, people can still find a hint where to go with zeronet URL. At the moment, if u put zeronet URL anywhere in the world, most people will think it's just a crab and some will regard it just a stupid newbie's mistake putting his home local PC's server URL in the public.\n\nBut if u put `zeronet.io`, they will definitely notice it and will try to figure out what `zeronet.io` is. (Of course, if it's zeronet`.net` it would attract people's interest more easily anyway. -- by [leftside](../Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Profile/1SunAWK2VUT9GQK32MpwRfFPVgcBSJN9a/16dEowtNbV89NxPcDrAKkmnuXtiJVoVcDm/leftside@zeroid.bit) sos4sos@riseup.net // 2019-02-12 10:27:35+0900\n\nPS: Furthermore we also need to make the design [http://zeronet.io](http://zeronet.io) more intuitive."

			"date_published": 1549905498,
			"body": "`sed` is a very convenient tool to replace the matching strings in the text in various ways. But it is not possible to apply a function or a set of commands to manipulate the replacing process for the searched pattern. For example you can replace every number in the text with 'USD [number]' from '[number]' such as '34.50' to 'USD 34.50' by simply executing `cat text.txt | sed 's/[0-9\\.]*/USD &/g'`. But In case you may want to change every random number found in the text to be replaced with the number multiplied by 2 of each such as 34.50 to 69.00, it doesn't work with `cat text.txt | sed \"s/[0-9\\.]*/$(echo \"&*2\"|bc)/g\"` because the sub-shell `$(echo ...)` runs before `sed` completes its syntax. There're many workarounds for this purpose, but I'll introduce the most optimum way I found.\n\nFirst of all, let's see the sample commands below:\n\n`./ZeroNet.sh dbQuery 1MeFqFfFFGQfa1J3gJyYYUvb5Lksczq7nH \"SELECT * FROM follow WHERE auth_address IS '16dEowtNbV89NxPcDrAKkmnuXtiJVoVcDm'\" | xargs -d '\\n' -i bash -c 'echo '\\'{}\\'' | grep -q date_added && (echo '\\'{}\\'' | egrep -o \"[0-9]*\" | while read a; do echo \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \"\\\"date_added\\\": \\\"$(date -d @$a +%Y-%m-%d\\ %H:%M:%S)\\\",\"; done ) || echo '\\'{}\\'`\n\n**EXPLAIN**\n\n./ZeroNet.sh dbQuery 1MeFqFfFFGQfa1J3gJyYYUvb5Lksczq7nH \"SELECT * FROM follow WHERE auth_address IS '16dEowtNbV89NxPcDrAKkmnuXtiJVoVcDm'\"\n\n: lists all the followers of user '16dEowtNbV89NxPcDrAKkmnuXtiJVoVcDm'.\n\n: sample result is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    \"follow_id\": 28,\n    \"hub\": \"1SunAWK2VUT9GQK32MpwRfFPVgcBSJN9a\",\n    \"auth_address\": \"16dEowtNbV89NxPcDrAKkmnuXtiJVoVcDm\",\n    \"json_id\": 28779,\n    \"date_added\": 1522618500,\n    \"user_name\": \"leftside\"\n},\n```\n\n: But the property \"date_added\" is not human readable. It's Epoch time format so that we need to convert this value into normal YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS format whenever this property matches the regex pattern. Will discuss later.\n\n| xargs -d '\\n' -i bash -c '[shell commands]'\n\n: Executes bash [shell commands] for every string from the result of the previous command. -d option defines the delimiter which tells xargs how to separate strings received from the previous command. -d '\\n' means the conventional end of line CR-LF character will be a separator or a delimiter for each string. -i option tells xargs the substitution sign of the string is by default '{}'. Whenever u put '{}' in the middle of the [shell commands] it automatically interprets it into the full string which was sorted by the delimiter. For example, `echo \"Simson has four fingers\" | xargs -i echo \"This is the string received from the previous command : {}\";` will print:\n\n; This is the string received from the previous command : Simson has four fingers\n\necho '{}' | grep -q date_added\n\n: Tests {} string with grep -q [pattern]; command. -q means DO NOT PRINT THE MATCHING STRING but SEND SUCCESS OR FAILURE expression as a result of grep command. 'date_added' means the pattern what we're searching for in the string.\n\n&& [command#1] || [command#2]\n\n: && means that if the result of the previous command is SUCCESS precede [command#1], but if FAILed precede [command#2] after || sign. So, if the grep command found 'date_added' in the string it will execute [command#1] but if there's other than 'date_added' it will execute [command#2].\n\n[command#1] : && (echo '{}' | egrep -o \"[0-9]*\" | while read a; do echo \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \"\\\"date_added\\\": \\\"$(date -d @$a +%Y-%m-%d\\ %H:%M:%S)\\\",\"; done )\n\n: If SUCCESS, it will extract the value for the property 'date_added' and send it to `while read a; do ... done` command to manipulate it into normal date format. egrep means it will grep but the target pattern will be expressed in regex format such as `[0-9]*` which means 'any characters which are numbers in series'. In this case it will be 1522618500 from the string '\"date_added\": 1522618500,'. -o means print only the matched characters since without -o option it will print the entire string '\"date_added\": 1522618500,' just by coloring 1522618500 with red to indicates which parts are matching among the full string.\n\nwhile read a; do echo \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \"\\\"date_added\\\": \\\"$(date -d @$a +%Y-%m-%d\\ %H:%M:%S)\\\",\"; done\n\n: Put the matched string '1522618500' in the previous command into the variable $a. And reconstruct the full string with the converted date format and print it.\n\n[command#2] : || echo '\\'{}\\'\n\n: If FAILED in searching 'date_added' which means the received line from dbQuery is just a normal string which doesn't have 'date_added' pattern in it. Then just print it out without any manipulation.\n\n```\n{\n    \"follow_id\": 28,\n    \"hub\": \"1SunAWK2VUT9GQK32MpwRfFPVgcBSJN9a\",\n    \"auth_address\": \"16dEowtNbV89NxPcDrAKkmnuXtiJVoVcDm\",\n    \"json_id\": 28779,\n    \"date_added\": \"2018-04-02 06:35:00\",\n    \"user_name\": \"leftside\"\n},\n```\n\nAs u see, the date format of 'date_added' is now human readable.\n\n**PROBLEM OF EXECUTION TIME**\n\nBut in spite of somewhat short addition of the commands such as 'egrep -o .... date -d@ ...' the processing speed became too slow compared to the set of the commands without xargs and its trailing commands. Without xargs and etc, it counts 0.789s, but with the above full commands it counts 15.818s!\n\n**BENEFIT OF SH OVER BASH**\n\nThe culprit was `bash`. If I replace it with `sh` it counts only 3.799s! Not bad.\n\n**BENEFIT OF WHILE OVER XARGS**\n\nWhat'bout using `| while read b; do ... done` without `bash` or `sh` instead of `| xargs` combination? It's even faster! 2.321s! But `| while` doesn't have a method to make a delimiter to include the head spaces of the string. For example the result becomes as follows:\n\n```\n{\n\"follow_id\": 2,\n\"hub\": \"1SunAWK2VUT9GQK32MpwRfFPVgcBSJN9a\",\n\"auth_address\": \"16dEowtNbV89NxPcDrAKkmnuXtiJVoVcDm\",\n\"json_id\": 22119,\n        \"date_added\": \"2018-03-04 18:53:44\",\n\"user_name\": \"Leftside\"\n},\n```\n\nAs you see it destroyed the indentation in front of each properties except what I forced to print `\\ \\ \\ \\ ...` while reconstructing the date_added line.\n\n**WHILE-READ ALSO HAS DELIMITER**\n\nBut it's my lack of knowledge. It has a delimiter feature. Use `| while IFS='\\n' read b; do ... done`. It behaves exactly the same as `| xargs -d '\\n'`. Although xargs doesn't let multiple commands to executed inside it without the help of `bash -c` or `sh -c` with the followed annoying single quotes, 'while read' allows normal commands without any limit and without the additional CPU consuming commands such as bash -c or sh -c.\n\n**FINAL VERSION**\n\n`time ./ZeroNet.sh dbQuery 1MeFqFfFFGQfa1J3gJyYYUvb5Lksczq7nH \"SELECT * FROM follow WHERE auth_address IS '16dEowtNbV89NxPcDrAKkmnuXtiJVoVcDm'\" | while IFS='\\n' read b; do echo \"$b\" | grep -q date_added && (echo \"$b\" | egrep -o \"[0-9]*\" | while read a; do echo \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \"\\\"date_added\\\": \\\"$(date -d @$a +%Y-%m-%d\\ %H:%M:%S)\\\",\"; done ) || echo \"$b\"; done;`\n\n; 2.321s\n\n-- by leftside , sos4sos@riseup.net 2019-02-11 17:18:18+0900\n\nFurther reading: [bash command trick: Accepting piped stdout from the previous command without xargs](../1Gtubs5zzkhkVAxiEyZuYTJMWSpJ1qY22s/?Post:6)"

The Google service <span style=\"color: red;\">\"http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain_url=\"</span> was used to display favicons of unloaded sites.\n\n        Believe me, I do not work for Google, and did it just because of the lack of information. Everything that I did - I did only for the convenience of users, favicons allow you to better navigate when downloading large sessions.\n\n    Now, by default, <span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: red;\">the display of favicons sites is disabled</span>, the option in the settings is marked in <span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: red;\">red</span>, as dangerous.\n\n![1.png (0x0)](data/img/post_8_1.png)\n\n    Algorithm for getting favicon next, a request is sent\n\n<span style=\"color: red;\">\"http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain_url={Domains_URL_of_a_tab}\"</span>\n\nonly the domain is sent to Google (not the full URL), <span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: red;\">but this allows Google to collect statistics about the domains you visited</span>.\n\n    This extension does not collect cookies, passwords, emails or any other sensitive information. Only domain names (not full URLs) of the websites you visit (<span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: red;\">if you allow</span>) and nothing else!\n    Thank you for your support and understanding.\n\n</div>\n\n<span></span></div>\n\n<div>Bug report or suggestions?
