          <p>Salla’s books about Goode and others came in. Worth a good read. <br />
..or so I thought…
<!--more--></p>

<p>I wish Goode would put the info more presentable on his website.<br />
That said, the SSP is dead until Skunkworks brings it back.</p>

<p>Some people seem to think that by showing us cruft, that the project
is still active. Do I think Corey Goode worked w it? Possibly..Perhaps but he is not the younger image in that case..he’d be much older.</p>

<p>Like 1970s older or more. Buzz Aldrin old. This is not what he is portraying. He is however, making claims
of contact w Blue Avians. Shorter Yellow ones exist. Hyper inteligent.Very intellectual.Blue beings elsewhere exist too.
So it wouldnt be out of the question to have direct contact like he claims.</p>

<p>If you had high level FEDERATION access, you wouldnt shun it. Something or someone had to force you away.<br />
But it would be correct for us to ask to continue future relations.</p>

<p>Anyone in IT, deeply involved with IT can tell you, that its a “happy man’s career”. Once you get into it at a decent clip,
you dont generally give it up. The pay for one, is too high to just go back to “pinching pennies” outside of the “rat race”.</p>

<p>I should know, I have experience here. Ive seen 60-120K Govt contracts. IT isnt a career you drop out of.<br />
You either like it at first and fall in love or hate it to death, like being a car mechanic.</p>

<p>I have “stranger at the pentagon”, “planet serpo”, and “outwitting tomorrow(really written by Valiant Thor)” as well at my disposal as well as other resources.<br />
So, no, Im not pulling this out my ass here.</p>

<p>ET exists. Most ET want to be friends.<br />
Some DO NOT.<br /></p>

<p>The Area51 SpecialOps Manual explicitly states this.<br />
And there are many races that look like “the Greys”. Please be specific when addressing them, they appear to be semi-friendly and aware of self-consciousness and doing the right thing at least.I will give them credit for that. Many have spoken to this, some have ongoing connections.</p>

<p>Ive been “cut off” for the time being, I have to gather what I can get.</p>

<p>I HAD a “NICE LIFE”.<br /> 
Or at least I thought I did on neighboring Centauri…until one WEEE EARLY morning….<br /></p>
