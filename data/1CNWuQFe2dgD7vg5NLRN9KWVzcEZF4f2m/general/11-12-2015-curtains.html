          <p>Welcome to OZ..</p>

<p>-or-</p>

<p>What really happens behind those black classified closed doors belonging to the US Government.</p>

<p>Yes, Im going there.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Some of this was not mentioned on the ESSEX because of obvious reasons.<br />
But its time you know. <br />
And as far as those (steel) doors go, assaults and slander and flinging of words seem to take high priority.<br />
Nobody gives a shit who you are.</p>

<p>You are either IN or OUT.<br />
Gentlemens CLUB all the way-<br /> 
Let the beat downs commence while Chief is away.</p>

<p>E4 and below are the first to get attacked. LITERALLY.</p>

<p>I know a second class that owes me, I couldve killed his sorry ass for pulling that stunt. <br />
Dont swing at me unless you want the beat down of your life. <br />
Dont shoot at me unless you intend to DIE.</p>

<p>I have NO PROBLEM taking people out or leaving them for dead. <br />
Paramedic? <br />
Hope you can get to a phone…..<br />
<br /></p>

<p>I have friends in dark places.<br />
Friends even SEALS would be unwise to cross.<br /> 
And I know some of em give you hell  for doing your job sometimes, but they mean well and they do jobs nobody else will.</p>

<p>So I give them credit, and when I can, they get the special treatment. <br />
BECAUSE they DESERVE IT.</p>

<p>As I said, Im <em>not from here</em>.<br /></p>

<p>People understand that Im different.<br />
That Im a badass and I dont take shit from anyone.<br />
I hold people accountable.</p>

<p>But they cant figure out where the allspark comes from. <br />
They see the glimmer for a split-second, but they dont know.<br />
<em>ASTRONAUGHTS know.</em></p>

<p>They know its beyond what they see when they look at me. <br />
Its that odd spirit energy thats not unique to this place. <br />
They just cant place it.</p>

<p>HMMMMM……. but yet…. I look like you.<br /> 
I BLEND IN.<br /></p>

<p>Sometimes so well that my bosses cant find me when I pass them in the hallways..<br />
Yes, MESTA, I meant YOU. <br />
RIGHT fucking in front of you and you couldnt find me because ‘I didnt want to be found’.</p>

<p>As I have said, I have been to places that if you knew what happened there, would make your skin crawl. <br />
Those are not rumors you are hearing.</p>

<p>ACTIVITY that people in high places KILL to keep people quiet.</p>

<p>MYSTERIOUS CANCERS suddenly showing up? (Doc. Micheal Wolf)</p>

<p>Of note also:</p>

<pre><code>Planet Serpo DIA personell have died mysteriously in a similar fashion. 
</code></pre>

<p>The official report says:</p>

<pre><code>"of cancers caused by planetary radiation" [during the trip to Serpo].
</code></pre>

<p>YEAH…. Not buying it.</p>

<p>Were that the case, those personell would have been treated by the Greys they encountered.<br />
No race that I know of would intentionally allow a sickness to infect other races if they knew those conditions to be present.</p>

<pre><code>	The cow mutilations.
	The Hybrid breeding programs.
</code></pre>

<p><img src="../assets/base9.jpg" alt="base9" /></p>

<pre><code>	The offworld "alternate" projects. (ALT3 - four parts in Real Player format)
	Montauk/El Segundo activity involving (Forced) Remote Viewing and Stargate activity to places like Mars (Think DOOM)
	The PSY-OP evil Projecting Reptilians.
	The idea that Greys and Reptilians are here not in your best interests and want to either EAT you or CONQUER you into submissive slaves.. 	 
</code></pre>

<p>The last one for some reason seems to be a half truth.
There are however some weird videos floating around, one showing secret subways under NYC and creepy activity going on that would seem to support this.</p>

<p>Im sure the list goes on but this is what I have for now. <br />
The “breeding projects” and Montauk activity I can confirm and so can some NSA agents. <br />
There is documentation pointing to an agreement with Greys (and maybe Reptilians) for these purposes, possibly others.</p>

<p>The rest of us offworld people are working on fixing that rushed arrangement. <br /></p>

<p>We have another proposition but Washington does not seem willing to listen just yet. <br />
Washington can put these letter agencies in  line if they wanted to.</p>

<p>But they arent doing it.<br /> 
Yeah, you guessed it. <br />
Whose in charge? <em>Whiskey Hotel</em>.</p>

<p>The UN sure isnt taking point. <br />
They could override the POTUS if they wanted to.<br /> 
But they arent doing that either.</p>

<p>You see this is GLOBAL AFFAIR, not a US one. <br />
And we EXPECT people to step up.<br />
UNDER ATTACK? Doubtful.</p>

<p>By some ET bully race or two? <br />
Sounds like a job for a HERO.<br />
Maybe more than one…And those under thier direct leadership.<br /></p>

<p>And those they know, and those those people know, and whole councils behind them…….we dont like bullies either.<br />
So what to do? <br /></p>

<p>EDUCATE the MASSES to turn on thier puppet leaders and put someone in power than can do what is needed.</p>

<p>Someone:</p>

<pre><code>	That can set offworld relations straight. 
	That can set the country and planet straight. 
	That can make the bold moves that shut down terror wherever it may crop up. 
</code></pre>

<p>Because you deserve better than this senseless violence.<br /></p>

<p>And we know you want a better life.<br /> 
NOBODY should be attacked by bullies. <br />
Or ganged up on. <br />
BY ANYONE.</p>

<p>ANYWHERE.  <br />
AT ANY TIME.</p>

<p>And these cartels can go straight to hell.</p>

<p>Nothing <em>Magical</em> about these documents:<br /></p>

<p>A Quick summary of contents of CATCHERS of HEAVEN by Dr. Micheal Wolf (former NSA Agent working at A51):</p>

<p><a href="../assets/REVELATIONS-OF-AN-MJ-12-SPECIAL-STUDIES-GROUP-AGENT.pdf">revalations</a></p>

<p>(contact me offline if you want the book, I have copy.
It is out of print. 
Dorrance will not republish it AFAIK, But has been contacted.
This is what Doc would have wanted.)</p>

<p>In major cities the library may have a copy.</p>

<p>The author has been executed and his foundation has gone belly up shortly afterwards.<br /> 
It no longer exists.</p>

<p>Streiber’s “Communion” is still being printed but you may have to request a copy of it from Strieber 
as its one of his first books on the matter.<br />
The library should have that one.</p>

<p>What the letter agencies <em>dont know</em> wont hurt them right, Snowden?<br />
“One laptap hard drive…what damage could that cause?” -FBI<br /></p>

<p>To answer the question:</p>

<p>In this day and age:</p>

<pre><code>	nuclear war
	alien invasion
	The best thing that ever happened to you
