CommandMent the Third:<br />

"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, <br />
or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above,<br /> 
or that is in the earth beneath, <br />
or that is in the water under the earth" -Exodus 20:4

Im discussing the topic of SUN GOD worship and the premise behind the GOLDEN COW.<br />
But notice that every statute, every (church) ornamnet violates this commandment???

</pre>

<!--more-->

<p>Since worshipping is truely communion- then let us commune(discuss).</p>

<p>The passage of the “bible” referenced (“biblia” in spanish - a bibliographic disaster) refers to SUN GOD PAGAN worship.
( A bibliography lists sources for an article..”the bible” has many sources…)</p>

<p>So lets review another example of it.</p>

<pre>

Exodus 32:8 

"How quickly they have turned aside from the way I commanded them. 
They have made for themselves a MOLTEN CALF and have bowed down to it, 
sacrificed to it, and said, 'O Israel, this is your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.'"

</pre>

<p>When the text was written, the new religion- founded by the ROMAN CHURCH, (the POPE)<br />
was incompatible with current pagan (and often ROMAN) belifs.</p>

<p>You see a lot of PAGAN THEFT going on with rites and rituals, yet nothing is attributed to them.<br />
Winter Solstice, ESTARA(known as easter),fall harvests, etc.</p>

<p>NOBODY wants the PAST to be SEEN, HEARD, or SPOKE ABOUT.
Its like the GREAT FIREWALL of CHINA (North Korea)….
WIPE OUT YOUR COMPETITORS…</p>

<p>The problem is that history is rediscovered.<br />
“Nothing is ever truely deleted…”</p>

<p>The reason is POWER and CONTROL.<br />
Without it you cannot rule your people, 
you are not in charge of them.</p>

<p>YOU CANT TELL THEM WHAT TO DO!
They run amok like little lemmings in a video game…</p>

<p>They start uprisings…(CANT HAVE THAT!!!)..like the early humans did to the ANUNAKI.
YES, I said it….the offspring uprose and caused trouble and the “gods” nearly took us all out.</p>

<p>The ROMAN CHURCH wants CONTROL.<br />
The ROMAN CHURCH wants MONEY.<br />
The ROMAN CHURCH wants OBEDIENCE.</p>

<p>YOU ARE THE SLAVE OF THE ROMAN CHURCH if you bow down to “thier god”.<br />
The ROMANS ruled with an IRON FIST, much like HITLER.</p>

<p>BLOOD RITUALS, GRUESOMENESS…shit that scares little kids….ROMAN (or Greece SPARTAN) produced.</p>

<p>I dont doubt cruxifictions happened.<br />
(Research indicates corupt translation- if you are worshipping at the T (t) of a cross- you are worshipping a false doctrine.
The proper translation is “Died at the stake”, much like Salem witch trials “burning at the stake”. Source is below.)</p>

<p>I dont doubt religion could be based (to fit a narrative) on someones death- or the death of a prophet.<br />
I dont doubt for one MINUTE that an experienced being like myself(I had help) could claw thier way back from the dead to the living once more.</p>

<p>-Most, however stay in spirit form and DO NOT remanifest physically. <br />
(the JESUS JUICE princible- once you drink it…youre gone…a ghost at best..)</p>

<p>I dont doubt a ghost can appear post death to someone.</p>

<p>WHAT I DOUBT is the CHURCH.<br />
WHAT I DOUBT is the CONTROL.<br />
WHAT I DOUBT is the COVERUPS that are getting more and more exposed.<br />
WHAT I DOUBT is the COMPOSITE PRODUCTION with a laymens copywright called “THE BIBLE”.</p>

<p>I dont need someone telling me whats good.<br />
I dont need someone telling me whats HOLY.<br />
I dont need someone BRAINBASHING A CULT INTO ME. (and neither do you)</p>

<p>Because its a PONZI (italian word again!!) scheme from DAY ONE.</p>

<p>Give so we can grow the curch….<br />
Give so we can expand…..<br />
We need to grow the church again…..</p>

<p>-or-</p>

<p>I need missionaries to go places and beat religion into more people around the world.<br />
I MUST CONVERT EVERYONE TO THE NEW RELIGION.<br />
EVERYONE <strong>MUST</strong> OBEY.</p>

<p><strong>EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW</strong><br /></p>

<p>-Conquer by any means necessary.<br />
-SILENCE by any means necessary.<br />
-PAYOFF by any means necessary.</p>

<p>Thats called MKULTRA.<br />
“MIND CONTROL”<br />
“Brainwashing occultism”</p>

<p>DUMB DOWN THE MASSES into CULT LIKE WORSHIP, REPEATABLE PHRASES THAT HAVE NO MEANING.<br />
LETS USE REPEATABLE PHRASES and “traditional customs” and turn them into REQUIRED FORMAL RESPONSES.</p>

<p>(MAY GOD BE WITH YOU…AND ALSO WITH YOU….)</p>

<p></p>

<p>so back to the COW and GOLDEN GRAVEN IMAGES…..</p>

<p>People were worshipping a sacred golden calf.<br />
Thats all you hear about.</p>

<pre><code>	Because of the ROMAN CHURCH.
</code></pre>

<p>What you dont hear is that these pagans were worshipping the SUN GOD in the form of a COW-</p>

<p>They were worshipping the SUN as thier HOLY PROVIDER of MEAT, MILK, etc. by USE of the COW.
COWS were like GOLD back in the day(3300 PLUS years ago). The more you had, the richer you were.</p>

<pre><code>	COW= prosperity
</code></pre>

<p>When you slaughtered the COW- the whole town could eat at the same time. It was a time to CELEBRATE.
You should see the steaks coming fresh from a slaughterhouse - your freezer will run out of room.</p>

<p>Literally, the Roman CHURCH(the POPE) “brain bashed” people who were following GOD  (Master creator, great maker, the everlasting……)
into paying HOMAGE that wasnt DUE. This is the highest form of extortion and blackmail known to man.</p>

<p>Roman Catholic INBRED CONQUERORS tried to rule a world that 
DIDNT NEED YOU, 
DIDNT WANT YOU (still doesnt), 
and DOESNT CARE FOR YOU (or your actions).<br /></p>

<p>The POPE has tried INTERVENE between humanity and GOD.<br /></p>

<p>As with the video game lore- you practiced magic to BECOME a SAINT and turned into a Devil’s dark angel.<br />
You corrupted those around you with your lore, your fake GOD, your false RELIGION, your MONEY, and your IMPERIALISM techniques.</p>

<p>You pretended that it was alright by use of your symbology- symbology which is expressly forbidden under your own
“documentation”, the BIBLE. There goes the 3rd commandment. Get on your knees, Vatican!</p>

<p>Oh- we caught you coveting our neighbors wife and kids too.
We caught you stealing, commiting adultery, and you bore false witness.
You committed all of this unto GOD with no true intention of it ever begin his will and corrupting his wishes.</p>

<p>There goes the 10 commandments!</p>

<p>Is the sacrement sacred? Is the confession box- (yes that little ackward phone booth in the church) sacred?
Apparently not. More corruption. There is a link below.</p>

<p>NOBODY NEEDS AN INTERMEDIARY to talk to GOD– <br />
they didnt until ROMAN CATHOLOGY came along – <br />
why do they NOW? <br />
-THEY DONT!</p>

<p>Act like you are muslim and worship the suns set and rise..EGYPT counted on it!<br />
Whole rituals were based on it.<br />
They (usually) respect the ancient ways.</p>

<p>They call “god is great” in Arabic and issue VOCAL prayer calls several times a day-<br />
“why should we use an instrument- we have the most holy of them, ourselves..”</p>

<p>The movie is a remake of the actual event(The true story of Islam) but goes to prove a point.</p>

<p></p>

<p>NOW I HAVE TO PAY YOU (ROME/ the church)? <br />
-GET BENT!</p>

<p>-TAX THAT MAN! IF HE REFUSES TO PAY, KILL HIM. (julius ceaser)</p>

<p></p>

<p>This is how ROME was RAN.<br />
THIS IS HOW AMERICA <strong>IS RUN</strong>.
TAXATION IS DEATH.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You have two years to pay taxes on a house or land - if you dont pay: BYEBYE.<br />
PROPERTY VALUE: IRRELEVANT</p>

<p>You have 12 months to pay on your car or you cant drive it.<br />
VALUE: IRRELEVANT</p>

<p>You have 12 months to pay on CRYPTO SALES, STUDENT LOANS, or INCOME - if you dont pay: WE (IRS) TAKE THINGS FROM YOU.<br />
VALUE: IRRELEVANT</p>

<p>– or you serve time in jail.</p>

<p></p>

<p>TAXATION is not only THEFT, ITS MURDER.<br />
It was created from the HERESY called RELIGION, THE CHURCH, the VATICAN, and ANCIENT ROMAN IMPERIALISM.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>If anything needs to go, its RELIGION. Several chrisitan artists have commented it the “devils music”, etc.
while not understanding that most of what they bitch about describes the bible in context.</p>

<p>IRON MAN
TOM SAWYER
Some songs by Mettallica</p>

<p>And yet you- the artist- use the same chords and rhythms and tempos, sometimes music(sans words)
Does that not make you therefore a DEVIL WORSHIPPER and portrayer of the devils work?</p>

<p>God Gave Rock and Roll to you</p>

<p>is a non-chrisitian work,and you didnt write the song, Petra. Quite frankly, you should be sued over its mis-use.</p>

<p>“but its the devils music”… the “freedom electric/electronic music movement” concerning the BERLIN WALL and other events???
I DONT THINK SO.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I say WE GO BACK to the GOLDEN COW.<br />
WORSHIP THE SUN.<br />
WORSHIP GOD - not religion, not a prophet, NOT A FAIRY TALE ….GOD.</p>

<p>THE EMINESCENCE OF LIGHT.<br />
THE GREAT MAKER<br /></p>

<p>-AND TAKE YOUR CALENDAR WITH YOU, YOUR UNHOLINESS….WE DONT WANT ITS INACCURATE LIES ANYMORE.</p>

<p>(A 28 day -13 month (MOON) calendar does us just fine….)</p>

<p></p>

<p>-CANT HAVE THAT!!!!! - CAN WE???<br />
Then go ahead and be ROME’s SLAVE.</p>

<p>I think the story about paying CAESAR “what was his” is an effort to silence opposition to overthrowing the NEW church.<br />
The ROMAN CHURCH worked so well that CHRISTIANITY FOLLOWED IT and used it as a “business model”.<br />
We couldnt upset those we were following…OH NO!</p>

<p>But its just as corrupt as the vatican.<br />
SEX SLAVES…<br />
PEDOPHILIA……</p>

<p>Those arent blind accusations…..<br />
THE CHURCH DOES IT because its so CORRUPT.<br />
BECAUSE THE WHOLE THING IS A LIE!</p>

<p>The ROMAN CHURCH is all about CONQUERING (ROME/ROMAN VALUES).</p>

<pre>
What does a BAD MAN do? 
(yes, there are bad ladies but im using pedophilia as an example here)

		he rapes ( a form of domination and conquering- ask a cop)
		he robs and steals ("I WIN" conquer)
		he kills (the ultimate conquer)
		he lies (to cover it up)
		he protects his "brothers" -perpetuating a coverup and a lie
		he SEIZES things not his (again, theft)
		he demands HOMAGE (repsect) NOT DUE
		
</pre>

<p>You could never keep a kingdom alive long given these parameters…<br />
but a cult religion with a mafia style enterprise…AH!</p>

<p>-YOU COULD RULE THE WORLD!</p>

<p>Wikipedia paints Babylon as Rome itself.
Information leads one to assume that NEW BABYLON is the Roman Church.
Symbology seems to indicate this.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A Review of THE CAUSE FOR CHRIST VIDEO:</p>

<p>“The truth is that nothing other than the love of Christ, revealed in a Christian’s life, has ever, <br />
<strong>or will ever</strong> serve as proof for the existence of God.” -<a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2017/04/06/case-and-problem-case-christ">American Magazine</a></p>

<p>THE MOVIE IS A LIE.</p>
