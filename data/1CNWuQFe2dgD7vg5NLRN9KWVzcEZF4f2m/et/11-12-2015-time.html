          <p>“GO GO Sonic warrior?”</p>

<p>“The power is in your mind..<br />
To save the planet and con-quer time!”<br />
-by Masafumi Ogata / Casey Rankin</p>

<p>-or-<br /></p>

<p>Back to the future? <br /></p>

<p>Im gonna let you decide. <br />
I favor the first, and no, its not by Nilsen.<br /> 
The AMERICAN/EUROPEAN track, however, is. <br />
But enough about a videogame….(Sonic CD)
<!--more--></p>

<p>I was talking about the TIME traveling HEDGEHOG, portrayed in the (attached) game. <br />
He is portrayed as running so fast that even time cannot hold him still(mind you with some magic help).</p>

<p><strong>WARNING: Temporal anomaly detected. Tread with Care!</strong></p>

<p>As my ‘wife’ once put it:</p>

<pre><code>	"Where one goes now, beyond time and space, one just might not be able to recover or return from..."
</code></pre>

<p><img src="../assets/stargate.gif" alt="stargate" /><br />
YES, just like THAT.</p>

<p>So Jeb wants to Jab, eh? <br />
Does he even know what he’s joking about?<br /> 
Lets see… <br /></p>

<p>well, the good ole US of EN (Yes, USN) has something on this.<br /> 
HMMM… <br />
Y is the US of EN always involved with <em>really weird shit</em>?</p>

<pre><code>	UFOS
	NAZI BASES in ANT-ARCTIC
	TIME TRAVEL EXPERIMENTS
	TOR Networks(ONION)
</code></pre>

<p>HMMM…</p>

<p>Yes, hold onto your hats folks.</p>

<p>The <strong>US Navy</strong> has experimented with <span style="color: #0000ff">TIME</span>.</p>

<p>Its called the Philadelphia Experiment. <br />
It was FULLY documented and published. <br />
People have already come clean about it. <br />
They threw a whole ship into a vortex and minutes later it emerged elsewhere,
 a journey that should normally taken days to weeks to travel.</p>

<p>SADLY, the “mission” FAILED miserably. <br />
The crew was either severely sickened and disoriented (well, DUH!) or thrown 
through entire bulkheads in some cases.</p>

<p>Rumor has it the experiment happened twice, officially.</p>

<p>The first instance started the operation but could not be stopped. <br /></p>

<p>So a team of a few people jumped backwards in time to fix the problem to shut it down. <br />
They used a land based system for that. <br />
And a major problem like that would be understood, actually.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, Shatner touched on it in one of the Star Trek movies. <br /></p>

<p>The warp engine got stuck into overdrive and had to be forced out of it before 
the Enterprise got smashed to bits by a space rock.</p>

<p>What happens is that the ships hull is part of the ships electrical system.(Negative ground)</p>

<p>This causes TWO faults.</p>

<p>Namely:</p>
<ol>
	<li>All current is sent into the already live ships electrical systems, triggering a 
	runaway condition. To avoid this, the time circuit would have to be portable 
	running off its own power supply.Generally speaking this is not easy to do 
	on a ship as the circuit requires a high amount of power to operate. Such 
	power is generally not available to be made portable or seperate from the 
	existing ship systems.</li>
	
	<li>The ships hull acts to amplify the already electrified temporal circuit, 
	acting as a mega antenna. This should be avoidable by utilizing some sort of 
	shield array. But this world doesnt officially (well en-mass production anyhoo) 
	have that sort of technology.</li>
</ol>

<p>As far as we know, the experiment was never duplicated on a Navy ship. <br />
On Land? <br />
Do we really know?</p>

<p>We know for a fact that jumpgates like the one above were used to send people 
to/from Mars (NSA source) and I have it from a good “space people source” 
that other places (worlds) have been jumped to as well.</p>

<p>From my understanding of how the gates work, it would be a trivial maneuver 
to modify a time gate into a location gate.</p>

<p>Of course you would be jumping blindly unless you hijacked someone else’ equipment…<br />
which from what Im told appears to be the case.</p>

<p>Other civilians have made claims of temporal travel via special places or 
configurations of hand-made gates that they are using.</p>

<p>Astral Project from what Im told is generally how it works without the gate 
itself or special earth energy vortex, which happens naturally in certain places. <br />
I know at least two individuals (civilians) making claim to have used a time device.</p>

<p>One is in Kansas, the other is in Russia somewhere.</p>

<p>Claim has been made that time cops (temporal MIB?) were made aware of certain 
jumps made by one of these individuals.</p>

<p>Names withheld for obvious reasons. <br />
Im sure you can do your homework. <br />
The how-to guide costs less than $50. <br />
Yes, Ive seen the documents and it appears sound.<br /> 
Even if the logic seems a tad off. <br />
Then again, people have made circuits that are not supposed to work, and they do apparently.</p>

<p>Then there is the weird WunderWaffle Nazi SS Acorn that just “appeared” in Pennsylvania. <br />
It seemed to have hieroglyphic alien writing on it. <br />
People are calling it the German “Bell”. (Die Glock) <br />
It is PA’s “Area51 event”.</p>

<p>And THEN… AND THEN…<br />
(Oh this gets intel-esting…)<br /> 
There is a ship off of South America that discovered a Nazi route into 
the South Pole..<br />
not much is known about this event, claims are that Nazi tech got put on the South
 Pole in or near a base somehow.</p>

<p>Reports seem to indicate some sort of UFO base may be there, or at least was. <br />
We know from documents that the Nazi were playing around with the design, 
but from what Ive seen, those designs mimic what the AF was toying with:</p>

<pre><code>	Nothing close to what the Grey's use. 
</code></pre>

<p>A flying lightweight silver disc-type aircraft, that may have hovered under 
its own power.</p>

<p>Certainly neither nuclear nor warp capable. <br />
Assuming its a warp drive and not a frequency resonant “jump” drive, as similar ships appear to use.</p>
