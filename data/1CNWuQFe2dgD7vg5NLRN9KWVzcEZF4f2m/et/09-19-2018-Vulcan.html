          <p>Eggcellent news, mae friends….<br />
it appears someone was telling zee truth all of zee time…<br /></p>

<p>Now about that hedgehog….</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Yes… ok its an old story… Robuttnik (Dr.Ivonovich) doesnt just end it by walking into a pet store…<br />
(I wish it was that simple…)</p>

<p>No, I wasnt kidding.</p>

<p>The hedgehog, at least one of them, 6 foot 2, has been repeatedly spotted “with BLUE hairs standing on end” on this planet.<br />
Multiple MUFON reports about it. Check around 1980.</p>

<p>Long stemming dresses from HEAD to TOE? <br />
Likely full-body quills.</p>

<p>Now we have a report of scientist finding an actual star located in “Star Trek” phantasy realms.<br />
Its actually used as a waypoint.</p>

<p>AC is referenced multiple times in Star Trek but avoided by NASA and scientists…<br />
Its strange, but true.</p>

<p>Anyway-</p>

<pre><code>	We found Vulcan today. (Eridani 40A)
	From what we can gather- its a dusty desert of a planet, close to earths environment.
	HOT...but possibly habitable.
	YUGE GIANT EARTH.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This IS NOT A JOKE. WE FOUND “VULCAN”</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned in “Star Trek”:</p>

<p>The parameters of Vulcan itself as specified by Roddenbery and others- with one noteable exception so far.<br />
(ITS IMPORTANT)</p>

<p>We cant tell yet if its a rock or a gas giant. We believe it to be a Rock, like earth.<br />
Mass is unknown and unverified but plans to scan the area are in the works(TESS).</p>

<p>There are other Systems nearby. This is one of Three. This is only ONE EXO or planetoid.</p>

<p>While Earth yet has no official WARP DRIVE, (SSP is a lie.) Earth scans for life here.</p>

<pre>
The story goes:

Vulcans came to Earth when Zephram Cochran conducted a warp ONE test from a NEW ROCKET post WWIII.
(We had Korea step down- not WWIII. Iran is non compliant so far. 
We thought for decades this was impossibe.)

ELON WANTS TO GO AROUND THE MOON-- 
a move which NASA Set off and upset aliens doing decades ago.

I have pictoral proof- probably the only in existance other than NASA's own footage.



Here is what I know:


I came from around 20LY. Altara/PAvo system. (Certainly close to there it seems.)

There was not only a space station, but a furry feline homeworld near a system that 
was relatively closeby but a ways away (FROM THERE). 
We took a slow ass moving transport vessel to get there.

It was somewhere out past home in some direction- I dont remember which.
It was not out this far(near earth).

Vulcan is out around 14.5LY.


That world was a dust bucket- a desert. It has lakes, caverns but its still a desert.
We sure had a good time fishing that day- then laughing about it.
I can still draw -from memory- some scenes from that life.

That world, and station are FEDERATED.
Possibly ALLIANCE supported and ran, but FEDERATED.

After leaving the station and taking care of personal matters I left out this way, apparently, and
arrived on AC. AC1 AC2..depends on your view. 4th orbit. Northern Hemisphere.

I lived there for over a year, had a son- ok surrogated, but a son was born to me-- 
then I was ripped out of bed one morning.
My son was still in diapers when I left.

I remember working at A51, then being a ghost...been hueman-ish since.

The memories took awhile- to make sence of all of this- to surface.
I wont remember everything the way things happened.


Thats MY STORY and IM NOT CHANGING IT.
I AM A hedgehog.
--Well, I was. "Recently"



EARTH:

We have the Rocket. 
We have Albaquirre. 
Skunkworks has the power souce(CFR).
We have balsy space engineers (Elon, Bezos, etc)
We have micro controllers(arduino, maple, etc)
We have computers / AI to compute trajectory and correct flight paths
We have antimatter- at least partially at CERN
We have plans but no motivation or financing (sans warp) for an ENTERPRISE 1701.
We are detecting what appears to be FTL messages in space by the masses

Our society is still fucked up.
</pre>

<p>Something to think about.</p>

<p><strong>This concludes todays briefing.</strong></p>

<hr />
<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="security-check">Security Check</h4>

<p><strong>FAILED</strong> –other notices will be updated shortly.</p>

<p>The FBI- or someone trying to be CIA- hacked both my linux boxes recently, then tried to infect them again.<br />
A keylogger was buggered into the systemlog daemon somewhere,trying to hide.<br />
My landlord isnt that smart.</p>

<p>Didnt infect my windows boxes. I have formatted to be sure.</p>

<p>FYI: I was the one reporting that Zero was having console screenshots taken.<br />
Direct your questions <em>here</em>.<br /></p>

<p>When I get a working blog on the zero that I can put in a subfolder- It will be here and working.</p>

<p>-And yes, its creepy. <br />
If you didnt screenshot it- and you see ANY file type of image in your ZERO folder- remove it at once!</p>

<p>Linux catches incorrect filetypes- the file browser displayed it correctly as an image- a snapshot of my <br />
ZeroNet in the console. Windows wont do that- extra files in some folder- so what…</p>

<p>Linux will let you know they are there by the filetype of the file itself.<br />
The command is called: file.</p>

<p>file <something>...it will often guess what it is correctly.</something></p>

<p>You can mod the eff out of the file -and it will still guess correctly the contents of it.</p>

<p>TRACERS:</p>

<p>My comm lines (cable) have been tapped- and cell phone bugged in software-<br />
to listen to my GPS unit(safe- hasnt been altered) for police to harass me with.<br /></p>

<p>This is a story for another day, Im tired.<br />
All of my webzites were broken and I have like 3 more to fix.</p>

<p>ISP and ICANN are still playing games with my IP (intellectual property -main website)</p>

<p>They keep missing me by 30 seconds IRL but thats besides tha point.<br />
My life and belongings are not in danger, yet.</p>

<p>Someone wants to track me and its a Letter agency of some sort.<br />
This is not ET related…yet.</p>

<p>I have chewed them out- both up and down the chain.<br />
I still know some good folks in the intel communities.</p>

<p>Be advised. 
Same can happen to you, to anyone since the attacks on Alex Jones.</p>

<p>I wish this were not so.</p>

<p>TOR is crackable by FBI endpoint nodes.
Someone needs to secretly gather letter agency IPs (WL has many of em) and add them to a TOR ban list.</p>

<p>I will keep em out(for now)- but it wont stop other sorts of browser attacks.<br />
And how to we know that PORN- or other files arent flagged?</p>

<p>Once you nab it- you are public enemy number one- and so is your machine.<br /></p>

<p>There is such a thing as a GIF bomb and theres nothing your computer can do about it-<br />
-except not load or preview the image.</p>

<p>Convienence is the means of attack vectors as of late.<br />
Your inconvience closes those security loopholes.</p>

<p>GRC research labs and Sophos nose more. <br />
Pay attention.</p>

<p>UPNP has been abated for now- as long as your router is “recently recent”.</p>

<p>Stay safe!</p>
