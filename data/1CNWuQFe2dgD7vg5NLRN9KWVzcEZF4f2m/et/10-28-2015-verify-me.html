<p>Im begining to love that term. <br />
It means <em>unverified</em>.</p>

<p>In the world of secret projects, somewhat murky and otherwise hard to prove it exists
 or happened. Although to some extent you could say the same about the info presented here, 
 I assure you as best possible, I present factual information.</p>

<p>Some of this information can be confirmed by science(or very good math).
<!--more--></p>

<p>Other info can be comfirmed by the very fact that people know we exist as a 
whole and understand our basic operating principles.</p>

<p>Some have channeled the information. <br />
Some thought it was a dream. <br />
Kinda hard to say it was though when your dream objects or those you dream about 
suddenly appear before your eyes.</p>

<p>When multiple people are making claim of things and have not yet proven themselves
to be unreliable and multiple people seem to think the information is legit, 
well it must be,  even if we could not otherwise prove it.</p>

<p>When multiple people not living together suddenly know things that are similar in
nature, it MUST be LEGIT in some way.</p>

<p>Some of this evidence was gathered long before the internet.<br />
Its not just sheepish “follow the leader” going on.</p>

<p>You say you were visited by aliens…  <br />
did you wake up anal probed clothe-less in a ditch?<br /> 
Did your car cut out suddenly as the UFO was overhead? <br />
Did you notice a whirring or sudden ripping sound? <br />
Did the stars move?</p>

<p>Thats concrete evidence.<br />
It might be unknown but SOMETHING HAPPENED. <br />
A lot of MUFON and even NASA activity falls into this category.</p>

<p>So I ask.. <br />
can your information be confirmed in some manner?<br /> 
if not, its SUBJECT to VERIFICATION.</p>

<p>That goes for people’’s credentials too.<br />
I make no claim to what Im not.</p>

<p>What I am, at least here on this rock, CAN be verified and validated. <br />
If you ask around maybe you can very the other stuff from before I was here.</p>

<p>But that may require you to learn a new skill or two. <br />
Or meet a few people I know. <br />
Some from before, some from now.</p>

<p>Are YOU, is YOUR INFO SUBJECT to VERIFICATION?</p>

<p>Meier<br />
Corey Goode<br />
and quite a few other made this list. (this is NOT a list you want to be on)</p>
