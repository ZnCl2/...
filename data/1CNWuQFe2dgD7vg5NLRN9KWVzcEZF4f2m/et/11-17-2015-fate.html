<p>Again with the History channel meme…</p>

<p>“fate or destiny– let the past the judge of the future be”</p>

<p>No, I am NOT quoting the Virginia based Historical society.</p>

<p>I am quoting Lord Enki of the ANNUNAKI of yester-year.<br />
(That was thier mistake.) 
<!--more--></p>

<p>No doubt you have heard of the EPIC of GILGAMESH? Its older….than THAT…<br />
Almost verbatim copy from Zechariah Stitchin’s UNPUBLISHED work
(I have yet to find it again) directly translated from Lord Enki of the 
ANNUNAKI and left in Sanskrit</p>

<p>(Written THOUSANDS of years ago, supposedly in Gold on Lapiz Lazuli 
tablets with a laser-like ‘pen’) :</p>

<p>”
Would different matters have been were the Weapons of Terror un-used?
(nukes,chem/bio. warfare…etc.)</p>

<p>Is not what on Earth happened, what on Nibiru had taken place mirrored?</p>

<p>Is not in that tale of the Past the outline of the Future written-
Will Mankind, in our image created, our attainments and failures repeat?</p>

<p>Fate or Destiny? asks Lord Enki (to himself).</p>

<p>How it all began and how it thus far ended, he sat and pondered.</p>

<p>Was it all destined, or was it fate by this and that decision fashioned?
If Heaven and Earth by cycles within cycles regulated,
What had happened will again occur? Is the Past-the Future?</p>

<p>Will the Earthlings the Anunnaki emulate, will Earth relive Nibiru(in its futility)?</p>

<p>All the events and decisions, starting with Nibiru to this day on Earth,
To put in a record, a guide to future generations to become;</p>

<p>Let posterity, at a time by destiny designated,
The record read, the Past remember, the Future as prophecy understand,
Let the Future of the Past the judge be!
These are the words of Enki, Firstborn of Anu of Nibiru.
“</p>

<p>And so ends the book. If any of you know the Undernet user that has the collective zip
 file, FIND ME.<br />
IT IS EXTREMELY RARE!</p>

<p>-This appears to be put into “The Lost book of Enki” so I do not know for sure if this is just
a draft that got OCR into another document and saved or was just a preview release…</p>

<p>Google for it. Push comes to shove, I’ll add it here.</p>
