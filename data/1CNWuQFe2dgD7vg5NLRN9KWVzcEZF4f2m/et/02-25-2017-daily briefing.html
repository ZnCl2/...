          <p><strong>Welcome to todays Inteligence Briefing.</strong></p>

<p>Today we will focus on BREAKING Events concering NASA.(Feb 17-25)</p>

<p>On Feb 17th, the approximate evening of a clear night broadcast, NASA cut the feed once more to see our ET friends.<br />
They appeared to fly in groups or a formation.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Houston CAPCOM seems to be doing this as they monitor ISS feeds on a more frequent basis.</p>

<p>Whether this is stop conspiracy nuts, stop religious zealouts…etc. I dont think anybody knows.<br />
But thats not the intent.<br />
What we care about is the fact that NASA is doing it.<br />
Like CNN chopping Clinton during a broadcast.</p>

<p>You are interrupting a LIVE ISS camera feed, with a remote termination signal to stop people from viewing
whats going on outside the ISS. NASA did this to the Moon Lander team, Buzz included too.</p>

<p>If you look hard enough on the Net, HAMs caught this.It chops off right after “Jezi-bell”.<br />
What I believe Buzz and the team was trying to say was….OMG..what is this? Houston this is incredible..<br />
You never get to hear the conversation or see what was found. Aparently the “mona Lisa EBE”, a Annunaki it appears, 
was discovered and brought into the capsule near the controls.What happened to it? God only knows.</p>

<p>People have hacked satellites and turned them around to zoom into space.</p>

<p>I think its time to lockout the signal interruption signal and encrypt the lockout code.</p>

<p>SOME of those flyby are indeed starships flying at impulse to and from Earth. And a group of them
are Federation(FoW) craft coming and going thru this system.</p>

<p>Think what you want of me, or my last life. But I was in the fleet that by all intensive purposes should be not far 
from the space station or between here and Jupiter.This said, read on.</p>

<p>We had a flyby. The feed was cut.</p>

<p>Three days later NASA(Never a Straight Answer) has a MEGA announcement:</p>

<p>[Weve (repeated) Gilese and found ANOTHER 7 planet system, 3 more planets here are potentially inhabited.]</p>

<pre><code>	MIND FUCKING BLOWING NEWS....
</code></pre>

<p>NOT!</p>

<p>Every heard of the HELLO FROM EARTH project? Gilese was found years ago.Like within 8.</p>

<p>Either NASA has a SERIOUS PR and FUNDING issue -(POTUS Trump wants MEN on that Rocket, Houston!) or we have a
BRAINFUCK STUPIDITY problem over at JPL. Id like to know which please….</p>

<p>Science, medicine, research, building space stuff…thats what JPL and NASA are about. And THAT is whats COOL.<br />
THAT is what gets people into STEM/STEAM and to NASAs gates.</p>

<p>-Of course thier selection is worse than Mars One. No, I didnt make the cut.</p>

<p>That needs to change. Or buh-bye NASA…</p>

<p>Commercializing Space starts with <em>working rockets</em>. <br />
If SpaceX(Elon Musk) can repeatedly launch AND LAND the same rocket…its in the bag.</p>

<p>If the feed got cut the other day again..and it <em>may have</em>, yer welcome. It was ME, again.<br />
Sorry, but I like my fleet, my family and friends….the sooner I can get onboard up there, the better this planet will be.</p>

<p>My ships-nearly to the specs I made them- have flown over Patchogue,NY and Seattle,WA.<br /> 
My wife took a photo with me standing next to one.</p>

<p>All I have of it is a memory and a fuzzy sketch.</p>

<p>ET has been here for years, folks.</p>

<p>But its the DOD keeping it quiet, not NASA/JPL.<br />
NASA just silently cuts the feeds….</p>

<p><strong>This concludes todays briefing.</strong></p>
