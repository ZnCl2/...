          <h2 id="gfl">GFL?</h2>

<p>No, not Flourescence bulb…wrong abbreviation.</p>

<p>So whats with the ‘L’ in GFL?</p>

<p>We know what the GF is for, its short for GFOP, the Galactic Federation of Planets, or “Federation” for short. 
The actual classified beyond all HELL reference reads:</p>

<pre><code>	Federation of Worlds(FOW).
</code></pre>

<!--more-->

<p>That in and of itself warrants a discussion and another post. <br />
Roddenberry gave us some idea how that works…</p>

<p>But its not what you think or how you think. The people are different, for one. Lets call it “creative license”…</p>

<p>-But the ‘L’?<br />
Its short for Light.</p>

<p>Theres an Enlightenment movement going on. Not just information enlightenment.  An actual energy force at work to do good.
Commitments to aid each other in nearly every way possible.  To aide everyone. Although we (this group) intend to reach as many possible and the more the merrier, we do not force ourselves on you.</p>

<p>We are not and do not claim to be GODS. Anyone that does or that commands a followership is a false prophet (and probly off thier meds).</p>

<p>On that note, as far as the Federation goes:</p>

<pre><code>	Even as space people, we are NOT GODS. 
</code></pre>

<p>We just have access to very very advanced technology.</p>

<p>Some races ARE laying claim to have created you. Most likely this is a CONTROL factor.</p>

<p>It is rumored the ANNUNAKI are the only ancient ones to have attempted such a hybrid 
 breeding program. They were not pleased with the end result. They did not want 
 mirrors of themselves “playing god” or causing wars as they had.</p>

<p>Stitchin touches on this in a unpublished translated work and lays claim that the 
 disaster in the desert was not thier doing, but a side effect of it. Since they 
 dare not destroy what remain of thier precious human, the Annunaki left.</p>

<p>The hope was to return someday, but their home planet, Niburu, a red dwarf, 
 was dying off and the attempts to save its atmosphere had failed.</p>

<p>The gold mines in Giza remained as a side effect. I will try and touch more on this in another post, I will have to attempt to retrieve the information once more. Nobody on the ‘actual’ internet seems to have this information.</p>

<p>Everyone in this group(GFL) is just like you. Other humans. Well, there is another side of the equation. You had to get the idea from someone somewhere else.And we do mean (and wish you) well.
And when I say ‘we’, this is the ‘we’ I mean.</p>

<p>Some races decided not to be physically involved here.This is what manifested instead.</p>

<p>Some here still believe in religion and it is hard to get out of that trap. Belief in God or a “source” of all high order energy
 is common. You are not required and are recommended NOT to believe in a prophet.</p>

<p>-I just love the JESUS is an ALIEN concept, AS-IF….youd need HUNDREDS of JESUS for ET to believe…
..but there ARE rumors of one LIKE JESUS out there.</p>

<p>The choice is yours, but please do not force it on others.</p>

<p>Such forcefulness is the base of religion and all the evils it brings.</p>

<p>And this may surprise you:<br /></p>

<pre><code>	GOD does not judge.
</code></pre>

<p>Quoted via direct channeling from soundofheart:<br /></p>

<pre><code>	Why would I do that? Why would I judge you? 
	If my father is love and so am I, what purpose would judging you accomplish? 
	You judge yourselves. 
	This has been used by religion for years to control you.
</code></pre>

<p>If you are seeking these channelers, you need to find thier websites or locate them on facebook thru the GFL 
group page.The group stems from the website.</p>

<p>Religion is a CONTROL FACTOR, often to persuade you to do the right thing.</p>

<pre><code>	Got beer? 
	Got drugs? 
	OBsessed by SEX?
</code></pre>

<p>-See, how well that worked?</p>

<p>Now youre sober and drug free.You just had to have religion and God beaten into you first.</p>

<p>The ability to work with angels, spirit guides or demons is sort of expected. 
You were given this ability to assist you. You should have an understanding of it.</p>

<p>Ceremonial Magic generally focuses on this. There are many teachers.</p>

<p>Crowley is well known.(embrace the dark side anyone?)</p>

<p>Magic in general’s idea is to focus a working energy to enhance the life of 
  the practitioner (or witch) in every aspect of life.</p>

<p>Ceremonial magic explicitly invokes either angels or demons to do ones bidding
   or protect from harm. The Ouija board is often used with ceremonial magic.</p>

<p>Other uses of said board are not only <em>dangerous</em> but <strong>forbidden</strong>.</p>

<p>The invocation power of the witch (or in this case, Mage) is not to be taken lightly.
It isnt a joke, and it isnt funny or just for laughs. <em>This</em> is a <em>very</em> serious matter. 
This is how people get into magic and karma trouble.</p>

<p><em>YOU</em> invited the poltergeist. <br />
<em>YOU</em> need to excise it.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, it is the HUMAN mentality to outwardly seek the dark ways and means instead of the light. 
 We do not know why you choose this. There is much power in the light.</p>

<p>The only general religious concept outside of this planet that is generally
  accepted is Magic.But our magic is more real than you know.</p>

<p>Its not Hollywood Industrial light and magic effects. In some cases its like a form of technology so high 
   nobody knows how it works. In other instances it is a natural energy effect. It ebbs and flows, sometimes gets 
   channeled through things for desired effect.</p>

<p>The concept with magic(k) is that one creates into being what they want, does away with the rest in everything they 
do. Essential you LIVE magic.</p>

<p>The other accepted concept is that of working spirit energy or mental energy of 
a person (or group) and focuses on those abilities.</p>

<pre><code>	Telepathy
	healing
	psychic activities 
</code></pre>

<p>are all possible in this realm and verified by quasi-psychology majors (Dr. Goldberg and others ) as a form of 
etheric science. Etheric, meaning to work with the ether or ether-world, the world/area/dimensions of non-physical being.</p>

<p>Dont be deluded into thinking you will be orbing yourself permanently
 out of your body or to other places anytime soon. That is simply a delusion.</p>

<p>Im not talking astral projection.That works differently.</p>

<p>Im starting to get the impression that people in the GFL group are under this 
impression.</p>

<p>The concept of en-mass orb away(or being taken en-mass) 
on a moments notice… AH-WELL, yall got left behind…NOPE.</p>

<p>This is much like the ‘Chirst’ concept
that has been presented for thousands of years.That TOO is a delusion.</p>

<p>–Well guess WHAT?</p>

<p>There are OTHER religions and beliefs that go back 4x or more in age than 
‘Christ’. They ALL stem from the ANNUNAKI concept. They might check on you, but
THEYRE NOT COMING BACK to RESURRECT YOU.</p>

<p>‘SAVE’ YOURSELF.</p>

<p>If you could leave your physical body and exist only in pure energy existance(non-astral projection)
, you would have done it already.</p>

<p><em>You</em> are stuck in this form just as <em>I</em> am. I may have had a different body from another planet, 
but it is STILL a physical form.</p>

<p>The ONLY way to otherwise BE ELSEWHERE is through astral projection or long distance (time 
and space have no meaning and are one) telepathy. This is what is meant by being 5d.</p>

<p>YOU EXIST. YOU CREATE REALITY on HOW you ACT.</p>

<p>And you do it in such a way to have access to information and people which are not 
around you physically.</p>

<p>YOU KNOW THINGS that CANNOT otherwise be known.</p>

<p>You use that information to send energy or focus it around. You use this ability to 
help and assist or inform others.</p>

<p>This is generally how healing people works. True energy healers are <em>God sends</em>.</p>

<pre><code>	Tarot readings
	crystal balls
	Remote viewing 
</code></pre>

<p>are also possible in this realm. As is astrology.</p>

<p>Crowley and another have a workbook of sorts on the matter. Its a few HUNDRED pages long.<br /></p>

<p>Its not a laughing hocus-pocus matter.Its practically accepted science. Remote viewing was a Government pet project.
“PROJECT STARGATE”</p>

<p>Yes, not only is it <em>possible</em>, it <em>works</em>.</p>

<p>There are decent books on these subjects.</p>

<p>There are always fakes, even fake information books, anywhere you go. Truely gifted persons are rare finds
 unless they decide to gather. Shit may go haywire in such a place when people have gathered.</p>

<p>Believe it or not that means your damn good at whatever you do. It happens with unfocused energy surrounding these groups.</p>

<p>So all this NESARA and NWO crap, good luck. I dont believe a word of it. None of it is confirmable anyways.</p>

<p>And I WILL EXPOSE YOU. <br />
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. <br />
I DONT GIVE A DAMN IF YOU LIKE IT.</p>

<p>The banks will fall when the people have had enough. Not until.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a step in the right direction.</p>

<pre><code>	No banker 
	no bank
	no lender
	no mortgage company (and in some cases)
	no car dealer
	de-centralized public ledger (on every full node)
</code></pre>

<p>You make your own (money) and ARE your own bank.YOU decide how safe your (money) is. That said:</p>

<pre><code>	It is NOT EFFICIENT to produce money in this way by mine coin. It costs WAAY more to verify the blockchain than its worth.
	The money is in buying ASICs and selling them to noobs. Or selling GPU mine rigs to people.
</code></pre>

<p>-AND Ive ran the numbers every way..you wont make money on those, either. Neo-(s)crypt has <em>potential</em> here as its ASIC-proof.</p>
