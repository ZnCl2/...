          <p><strong>Welcome to todays Inteligence Briefing.</strong></p>

<p>What we have here is intel from a Ukranian source about ET, compiled into a repeating rolling release.<br />
<!--more-->
From what Ive gathered from the document, additions will be published in the future, not whole updates, and this may indeed
be one of those updates.</p>

<p>What it points to however, is other intelligence that has yet to be disclosed, discovered, or released in any form.</p>

<p>As you know we are talking ATS here (code word minimum clearance) and the information, unless leaked, is unlikely to surface.</p>

<p>My connection are first hand.</p>

<pre><code>    1- Sasebo Japan 04-late 07
</code></pre>

<p>Strange reports during deployment about strange lizard-like men walking around (non-draco of origin) from the locals and shipboard personell. <br />
The report says Tokyo, Yokuska area–I knew in Sasebo and around Nagasaki. I could feel thier proximity. The info leaked after I came stateside.</p>

<pre><code>    2- As one of "video game characters" mentioned or alluded to close to 40 years ago.
</code></pre>

<p>(Most likely in reference to SEGA mascot)</p>

<p>This is a often looked over “brief” and peice of information. Most dont know because they werent there when events occurred, nor do others
seem to have the neccessary security clearance to properly inquire. I am not one of ewe humans. I was never meant to be, I do not think like you, 
I do not act like you….etc. This is apparent if you interact with me. I am very “pokey and brisk” but fair.
Nobody knows my “true” name, and it has always meant “to light the path or the way”. It has sufficed for the time being.</p>

<p>Someone in the Pentagon knows I exist. Most Anyone Ive encountered vouches for my clearance without question. But Im not sure that they TRUELY
know who (or what) I am.</p>

<p>I got married elsewhere, the one most people think I am- is still single to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>MUFON and similar sighting reports within this timeframe indicate the heavy possibility that not only was I here, so were my friends, pokey or otherwise
and potentially in multiple places over time as event occurred. These sighting reports have been compiled and printed(as books).</p>

<pre><code>    3- Based on other intelligence I have or prior connections and modus operandi
</code></pre>

<p>This is based on how the Fow/Alliance as alluded to in “Catchers of Heaven” operate. Our inner workings and regulations are not posted here, 
let alone in full, however, our modus operandi and regulations are fairly simple and understood. Shipboard crews have an internal code and set of regulations.</p>

<p>Noting these parts, please read the document, or at least skip the begining section. Flying saucers are a dime a dozen, the meat of the document is beyond the middle half.</p>

<p>I am noting, however that a lot of races listed look similar, and others are alluded to–like the “video game characters” are excluded in the list, however, people like Clifford Stone have made lists like this of thier own from working in clandestine places(“57 races” by Clifford Stone). Clearly the information is somewhere. Others might not want it getting out.</p>

<p>This particular torrent is available on the bay–for now.</p>
