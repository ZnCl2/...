<p>Earth has <em>WHISPERS</em> in SPACE….
<!--more--></p>

<p>What happened?
NASA send a satellite into space.(No surprise there…)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it had no direct target and flew willy nilly out of the solar system
several years ago. It was not intended for any nearby (or relatively nearby) star.</p>

<p>TOUCHE!</p>

<p>NASA put everything onto a capcitance disk<br /></p>

<p><img src="../assets/ced.jpg" alt="Capacitance Disk" /><br /></p>

<p>-a combined, VERY ANALOG AUDIO/VIDEO recording.(PRE-Laserdisc) 
Which very much resembles a LP, but obvioulsy made of GOLD or similar metals to 
preserve the data.</p>

<p>It was etched like a vynil LP but it was not plastic, rubber, etc. <br />
The disc was attached to the satellite.Attached were the means to read the recording, and unlike
systems of the time, TODAY we have Laser LP players. Not cheap, but very good quality.</p>

<p>The instructions to read the disc can be misinterpreted somewhat.</p>

<p>The issue with what we have is that those players are designed for AUDIO and not 3-color RGB VIDEO
and AUDIO as your TV is used to.Only Capacitance discs and players can play those types of discs.<br />
Now, some exist but they are very rare.Finding the needle and replacement hardware becomes the issue.</p>

<p>One might run into the problem I did, even with older DVD drives such that the motor or drive belt
either wears out or blows and then there is no way to replace it. I dunno, maybe a servo Arduino-based motor 
can replace it? Rubber bands work in a pinch for belts but they dont stay on. I had an old BETAMAX player.</p>

<p>First the belt blew, then the drive motor for the video to keep the tape spinning over the head. And you 
could almost keep it playing by hand but not continuously.It would be just enough for a few seconds of video.</p>

<p>So what Ive done here is attach the images as a video stream. Obviously its LOW-DEF.
The Audio is obviously a seperate track and is combined for the video.</p>

<p>At the very least, the AUDIO is playable for some very far off
distanct alien race when they find the satellite. DONT EXPECT a RESPONCE anytime soon.</p>

<p>There are other means for that, and NASA it appears, is in a HURRY to make CONTACT.</p>

<p>Heres the murmurs video on the disc with the Secretary UN General (pre-OOSA) recording a 
greeting message to ET.Ive included all images on the disc as appropriate as republished later on.</p>

<p>-Hence the copyright logos.</p>

<video width="320" height="240" controls="" noautoplay="">
  <source src="../assets/murmurs.mp4" type="video/ogg" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>If you want a replica, someone is selling them on NASA’s behalf.
-ERP! Apparently not the whole thing!</p>

<p>Fuck it! I’ll torrent it to you in FULL..minus this movie, of course.
