          <p><strong>Earth-Quake…..</strong></p>

<p>Youve noticed.</p>

<p>You were woken up.</p>

<p>SHAKY SHAKY……<br />
SHAKY SHAKY THERE TOO!…</p>

<p>Poof! No power here. WHUUUT? Where does this magic come from?<br />
Seems like we been here before….INDEED WE HAVE. Did the dark ones not learn?</p>

<!--more-->
<p>…contrails WAAAY WAAAY UP in space-o-sphere(TWO ISS Nauts witness it).</p>

<p>“There something up in the ney-bo-hood”…. “who u gonna call?”
-Who <strong>can</strong> u call?</p>

<p>What do you do when ET invades and wrecks your homes and villages by way of quake?</p>

<p>SENDAI was no accident, folks.<br />
Neither was Equador.<br />
Or Kyushu.<br />
Or outside of Daytona Beach on the ocean.</p>

<p>Those are PRIME civilian targets. Just like where I am.</p>

<p>YOU WANT ME? COME AND GET ME!!!! Even as a GHOST, I will slay you out of existence.<br />
YOU DONT WANT A PIECE OF ME!</p>

<p>Leave these people alone!</p>

<p>Funny, though, those responsible for causing this or failing to uphold thier own 
protocols on the matter sit on thier asses as if nothing to see……<br />
<strong>NOTHING TO SE HERE, FOLKS</strong>…</p>

<p>So let me spell it out for you.</p>

<p>Since the 1950s, probly upon visitation by Dunn/Thor and friends(stranger at the pentagon),
DC airspace was invaded.<br />
Now, those three were nice. They were LIKE YOU.</p>

<p>They stayed a few years.They advised.</p>

<p>And when they left, a SUPER DUPER SECRET<br />
protocol was left behind. Most call it “crash and recovery”.</p>

<p>ROSWELL in a nutshell. WE ALL KNOW about ROSWELL.</p>

<p>–Well, recent vids have surfaced.</p>

<p>Crash is STILL ACTIVE.<br />
This was NEVER INTENDED to declassify. <br />
NEV-ER EV-ER.</p>

<p>The only way to change the policy is to OVERRIDE it or have another order issued to CANCEL
it.</p>

<p>So either SECDEF and POTUS (good luck) need to get off thier asses, or someone of higher caliper
needs to override them and the policy in effect.Thats where the rest of us step in.</p>

<p>This is YOUR planet, you should not be living in FEAR of outsiders INVADING IT.</p>

<p>The fact we EXIST…should NEVER be classified. And you will find out about that in due time
eventually.</p>

<p>Your nearest neighbor is NOT a TERRAN world. You are in for ONE HELLUVA surprise.<br />
Joke is on YOU, Meier.</p>

<p>It fooled us too.</p>

<p>–And were used to that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Still want your “gun touting xenophobia”? Someone has unleashed “the cracken” on you.<br /></p>

<p>You <strong>REALLY</strong> want to SIT THERE and TAKE IT REPEATEDLY?<br /></p>

<p>There are some here that can help. We need your help to force these idiots to act,
or force them to allow us to do so.</p>

<p>WE HAVE FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES.<br />
WE DONT GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT TO THE BITTER END.<br />
WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY and SECRETS you dont know about.<br />
WEVE BEEN HERE BEFORE.</p>

<p>WE CAN WIN THIS.<br />
Lets do this TOGETHER.<br />
BTW, welcome to deep space….</p>
