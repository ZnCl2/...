<p>Alright scully and Mulder, heres your sign: (cue the creepy music)</p>

<p>This is a condensed(ok, very very condensed) list of semi-recent UFO reports in 
relation to what appears to be Federation involvement here.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Prime Directive? <br />
Directive be damned! <br />
WERE ALREADY HERE! The PRICE IS RIGHT…..COME ON DOWN!</p>

<p>Freedom to choose and LOVE IS THE PRIME DIRECTIVE. AND NOTHING MORE.<br />
You got it WRONG all these years…(and it was decided..we were asked to come here)</p>

<p>Thanks goes to my documentation friend on facebook. He has a very large list of UFO reports.<br />
I have others which arent here for some reason. <br />
There are just tons of saucer and fly-over incidents and Big-eyed short-statured grey events.<br /> 
Ive weeded those out. <br /></p>

<p>The last one here, IS THERE FOR A REASON. <br />
Of note (Im missing this one) is a recent flyover of Daytona BEACH by Yellow-ish orbs 
over I40/I92 crossover in late 2014 to early 2015. <br />
Silent Movers.<br /></p>

<p>Daytona Beach DOESNT GET UFO ENCOUNTERS.<br />
Ontario does. Theres a wormhole right over Pickering…IIRC it drops out near Proxima.</p>

<p>Yes, Daytona has an airport, even a training flight airport from Riddle nearby.<br />
They mostly shut down after dark.</p>

<p>That comment should say something. <br />
Yes, I lived in Daytona for some time. Dad has a place not far from there.</p>

Time: night<br />
The two witnesses were driving down a road when a strange figure ran up to their car.</p>

<p>The figure ran zigzagging all over the roadway and acted as if injured. 
The being’s face was apparently scarred and his cheekbones protruded out. 
He had fangs that came down from its mouth and there was blood dripping from them. 
The being was about 6-foot tall, thin but well built, had had scraggly or tore up 
clothing and his eyes were very peculiar looking. (apparently had gotten into a fight with someone..)</p>

<p>The driver of the vehicle had to swerve in order to avoid hitting the creature. 
He dropped off his girlfriend then returned to the scene to see the creature enter a 
yellow and black car then proceeded to turn into a dead end street and vanish.</p>

<p>*Apparently the Pentagon hasnt seen this.</p>

Time: 0030(After midnight)<br />
A man recuperating from surgery at a local hospital was looking out the window when 
he saw a football-shaped object silently gliding over a nearby building. The object 
had multi-colored lights along its upper edge. As the object passed in front of the 
witness it briefly turned some lights on, illuminating four white windows along the 
middle of the craft. The witness was then able to see several figures at the windows, 
their heads facing the direction of the flight. The figures were humanoid with 
short-cropped hair and normal human features. The object made several passes over 
the area before leaving.</p>

Time: late night<br />
A family was sleeping in an isolated cabin in the woods when a bright bluish 
light filled the cabin. The father and his 12-year old son woke up and both 
looked out the window at the source of the light. Speechless they watched a 
luminous ball of approximately 1 meter in diameter, sitting in the middle of 
the front yard. Curious they both went outside and walked to within 4 meters 
from it. Then a tiny door opened, like the door of a castle, forming a bridge 
to walk on. Both stared as a luminous blue doll-like figure walked down to the 
grass. It stood there looking at the witnesses. They could see a smile on its 
face, which was reassuring. The father went around it and attempted to grab it 
but had to put it down, because it felt very soft like gelatin and could not get
a grip on it. At this point their memory ended and both woke up the next morning
in their beds. They ran outside and found a yellow circle on the grass where the
ball had landed.</p>

Time: 0300A<br />
James Forber woke up in the middle of the night feeling a terrific thirst, 
but to his displeasure he is unable to move from bed. He notices a kind of 
blue nebulosity forming in the room; the center of the blue light implodes 
without noise. A being now appeared in the center of the light. Is a man-like 
figure approximately 2.30 m in height, wearing a white suit with shiny silver-
blue eyes—Forber remembers is the same face he saw at the window of a hovering
saucer 6 months before. On its suit he sees a gilded badge, resembling a 
triangle and a pointed star. The man calls himself Karne, and tells Forber he is 
from a planet called “Aenstria”. Two night later the entity returns, this time 
two young people are the main witnesses who see the entity enter the house. 
They both then accompany the entity into a landed saucer where he meets a female 
alien called “Meyae” apparently the commander of the craft. Both witnesses are 
told that the aliens come from the star system called Andromeda and that they were 
the ones who brought the prototype of all humans to earth, which they called “Adam Kadmon”.</p>

<p>(Certainly not the first andromedian visitor, Moraney is another)</p>

The witness had gone out to her backyard to pick up some clothing from the wash
when she spotted dozens of bright specks of light that united together to form a
tall humanoid figure. The figure was a man with long silvery blond hair, wearing a 
silvery outfit with a double inverted pyramid symbol on the chest area. The being 
had beautiful blue green eyes and told the witness that his name was “Ashtar Sheran.”</p>

<p>Location: Leon Province Spain<br />
Date: August 15 1980<br />
Time: midnight<br />
The main witness (an ex member of the Basque terrorist group ETA) was at a camping 
tent with members of his family, all which had been unable to sleep for some unknown 
reason. Suddenly everything became bright just like daytime. In the air just above 
them a human figure began forming, first the head then the rest of the body. The witnesses
became filled with a sense of peace and tranquility and were not afraid. The figure was
a man almost 3 meters tall, apparently middle aged, very tanned, with blue eyes and 
long white hair. He wore a white flowing tunic. He spoke to the witnesses telling them
to choose the path of peace and reconciliation. He finally gave a hand signal, 
signifying love and peace and vanished.</p>

Date: August 22 1980<br />
Time: early am<br />
The witness was driving with her young daughter on a desolate road when her car 
radio became garbled and she heard a loud electrical noise, then her headlights 
dimmed. She and the vehicle were suddenly lifted off the road and the car entered
the flat metallic bottom of a hovering craft and into a bright circular room. 
A voice in her head told her to get out of the car but she did not move, a small
humanoid, his feet encased in mist, now appeared and opened the door forcing 
the witness and her young daughter to follow him. He was described as having 
a large head with huge oval eyes, no body hair, a broad flat nose, and a small
slit for a mouth. Both were then clamped down on metallic tables and were probed
by two humanoids using different types of devices. Before being returned to the
car and lowered to the ground, the witnesses were fed various colored pills. 
Under hypnosis the witness recalled extensive communication with the beings. 
Including the disturbing statement that earth “was a fearful planet with a 
tendency for annihilation.” She also recalled being shown seven characters, 
which represented the name of the place they came from, it sounded like 
“Asterisk” but the witness could not pronounce it properly.</p>

<p>Location. 85 km from Riga, Latvia (USSR)<br />
Date: October 23 1980<br />
Time: daytime<br />
A woman was walking near the forest 85 km outside the Latvian capital and was 
passing a clearing when she suddenly saw a yellowish hemispherical shape, like 
a bubble or some kind of protective field that she could she through. It was 
about 15 meters in diameter and a smaller hemispheric-shaped object emanating 
red light was visible inside it, positioned in the center approximately 5-8m 
in diameter. She then saw 3 humanoid entities coming out of the forest; these 
were about 1.60m in height, dressed in white coveralls, like flight suits, with 
brown peaked helmets on their heads. Suddenly what appeared to have been a 
“protective” shield was deactivated and then she saw a disk-shaped object about 
8 meters in diameter with 3 landing props standing on the clearing. The aliens 
then quickly entered the object; it then zoomed up into the sky, gained speed 
and disappeared from sight. She saw all that from a distance of several dozen 
meters. Ground traces apparently from the landing props were found on the soil, 
shaped like an isosceles triangle, 290 x 190mm in size.</p>

Time: night<br />
An area around Maryland’s eastern shore is reputed to be the home of a bizarre 
entity dubbed the “Cat Man”. Four people parked near a landfill looked out to see 
two yellow eyes looking in the car window. Frightened they quickly left the 
area but soon decided to return. They returned in two cars this time and parked
them at angles so they could direct the headlights and be able to see more area.
Soon they saw something crouched down and moving towards them. The creature came 
over to them on all fours. He was all black and hairy, and had claws or hook 
like fingernails on each hand. He came over to one car and hooked his claws on
the car and looked inside the window. His yellow eyes glowed in the dark as he 
peered inside. Again terrified, the witnesses started the car causing the 
creature to fall away from the car letting out a high-pitched scream and run
away. Scratch marks were reportedly found on the car.</p>

<p>Location. Near Auckland, New Zealand<br />
Date: December 1980<br />
Time: evening<br />
The witness, known as Miss Nosbocaj was employed as a tomato harvester on a 
plantation located near Auckland. The owners of the plantation had a small 
pyramid made of plywood, which they used for recreational purposes. (This 
was a fashionable fad in New Zealand). There was always a sofa placed at 
one third of its height. Inside such a pyramid the owners/users spend time
designated for resting. They would lie down or simply take a nap. During 
one of her lunch breaks Miss Nosbocaj decided to lie down in the pyramid. 
From there she was beamed up onto the deck of a UFO, which hovered at a great
distance from Earth. The first part of her hypnotic recall described the 
impression she had during the telekinetic flight from the pyramid to the 
UFO, including the cold tingling resulting from the telekinetic absorption
of heat from her body, and the feeling of an impact when her body bumped 
and penetrated the shell of the UFO. Her transportation onto the deck of 
the UFO occurred with the aid of the telekinetic transporting beam. She was
then subjected to an undisclosed genetic “experiment” followed by various 
medical tests and examination. Later Miss Nosbocaj was invited to a brief 
tour around the vehicle. Her guide, which she described as taller than 
normal, and with very blond fine hair, which was almost see through, he 
had a long face, with pale skin and there was something strange about his
eyes. He wore a sort of overall, which he let the witness touch, it 
appeared to be a one piece outfit made out of very fine cloth. She was
shown all the important compartments of the UFO including the bridge, 
the navigation compartment etc. One of the halls visited was a type of 
recreation room where she was shown a three-dimensional film about, 
“where humans currently go with their untamed barbarism”. This film 
mainly concentrated on showing her various tools that people throughout
the ages invented for killing each other, and to illustrate to her the
possible consequences of using the nuclear weapons accumulated presently
by humans. She was also shown a separate hall, which could be called 
an “incubatory” which contained numerous shelves entirely loaded with 
large transparent cylinders connected to devices that imitate organs 
of mothers, apparently used to grow or create human-like replicas. 
After the tour was finished Miss Nosbocaj was returned to earth by 
a process that she was only able to describe as moving back in time.
She could not explain how she got back to the recreational pyramid. 
She felt she spend a longer period of time onboard the UFO than it 
felt like as she returned.</p>

<p>Location. Near Short Mountain, Warren County, Tennessee<br />
Date: December 7 1980<br />
Time: before dusk<br />
Two witnesses (brother &amp; sister) were sitting on there back patio when 
they saw what appeared to be a bipedal, light gray colored creature, that 
appeared to have a head shaped like a feline. It walked slowly out of a tree 
line towards a pond and upon reaching the pond; the creature bent over and 
drank. They both noticed that it had large canines that were visible even 
from a distance of about 100 yards. The creature then stood up and walked 
back the same way it had come from.</p>

<p>Location. Selden, Suffolk County, New York<br />
Date: August 1980<br />
Time: 2000<br />
The witness who was out at the intersection of Country Rd and Boyle Rd, saw 
a sort of blimp or cigar shaped object about 75 to 125 ft in length hovering 
about 30 ft in the air. The object seemed to have dimly lit opaque panels or 
windows along the outside length and he saw shapes of “people” looking out. 
The underside was covered with hundreds of small light-bulb size white lights. 
The object was totally silent and remained stationary for a minute or two. It 
then moved across the road, reversed directions, and then veered to the south 
and out of sight.</p>
