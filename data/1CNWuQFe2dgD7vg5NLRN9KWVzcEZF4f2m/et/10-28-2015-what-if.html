          <p>“im not saying it aliens…” <br />
“but its aliens…“<br />
-History Channel MEME</p>

<p>Before you go bashing the Federation as we know it, lemme present some information.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>And its not how you think. Roddenberry was CLOSE, not exact.<br />
I dunno why human get the bug up thier ass that THEY are the dominating majority race
at least in THIS part of the galaxy…<br />
this is a YUUUGE misinterpretation of facts.</p>

<p>Its SIMPLY UNTRUE.</p>

<p>Im giving you two scenarios that should help spread some light on the matter at hand
 and why star races feel the way they do.<br />
(Especially about EARTH)</p>

<p>Scenario 1:</p>

<p>A ship lands. Somebody walks out, vaguely resembling a human. <br />
Dressed in some sort of uniform. <br />
This is all you see.</p>

<pre><code>	Do you greet them? 
	Do you welcome them? 
	Do you go run for your shotgun? 
	Do you go hide under the bed? 
	Do you offer them Tea and conversation? 
	Are they even human? 
	Do they come in peace? 
	What do they believe in? 
	Where do they come from? 
	Do you dare ask to go with them?
	And if you go, will you ever planning on returning?
</code></pre>

<p>Scenario 2:</p>

<p>This is your planet.<br />
Somebody or some-THING has already been here and landed.<br /> 
They are clearly NOT human.</p>

<p>You dont know where the ship is or where they came from. <br />
A beast. <br />
A monster by your standards.<br /> 
Tall and big and beefy.</p>

<p>Seems to be ravaging through neighborhoods like high on something. <br />
No fences seem to contain them. <br />
No laws seem to apply to them.</p>

<p>Where are your kids? <br />
Your pets? <br />
Is that your car being thrown about wildly? <br />
Your things being gone thru?</p>

<p>Ready the poison darts, the bullets, the jails? <br />
The guns? <br />
Slay the beast? <br />
Or just knock it out?</p>

<p>Do you send it to the morgue or the hospital? <br /> 
Or do you call in the NSA nest team(that covers things up) for extraction?</p>

<p>My favorite passage(god, what a pain that was): “He’s just gone mad…”</p>

<p>You actions judge you and speak volumes about you.<br /> 
Do you take the more humane route?</p>

<p>Or do you let “gun touting paranoid xenophobia” take over? <br />
Thats a direct quote from Dr.Micheal Wolf, BTW. He worked with aliens 
at A51 while under NSA direction.</p>

<p>For Guidance:</p>

<pre><code>	The latter happened on another planet. 
	There was no landing involved. It was a native race. 
</code></pre>

<p>The situation was handled and contained.<br />
The individual is receiving ongoing treatment and therapy, and is monitored closely.<br /> 
There have been other minor incidents. Even we are not immune.</p>

<p>And yet if visiting some places you might say we are cruel, even to our own. <br /></p>

<p>BUT ARE WE?</p>

<p>Someone once put it(talking about humanoids):</p>

<p>“The only thing separating us from the savage animals on our planet 
is the fact that we have our heads on straight, we have intellect, and 
some sense of sensibility, and respect for one another.</p>

<p>Minus those things, we resemble them in every way but one:</p>

<p>we stand on two legs, not four. “</p>
