          <p><strong>Welcome to todays Inteligence Briefing.</strong></p>

<p>Today we will focus on BREAKING Events concering ALL THINGS STRANGE.<br />
Im not saying its always aliens, nor UFO involved.</p>

<p>But this time, it very well may be.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Bermuda Triangle and Devils Triange have been home to strange events for years.<br />
Very few of things that go in- come out, let alone with alive crews.</p>

<p>US Navy and other ships seem to be taking advantage of this fact as of late-</p>

<pre><code>	or we have a vexxing wormhole problem at sea
</code></pre>

<p>and ships really are “coming out of nowhere”(out of the ether).</p>

<p>Recent UFO reporting and intel gathering has created a whirlwind of activity.<br />
Rightly so- the US MIL has declared that it knew, has known for years-</p>

<p>They gathered the data in accordance with MAJESTIC PROTOCOLS. “Project Aquarius”<br />
Operations “previously known” were called BLUE BOOK and “according to those lines”.</p>

<p>BLUE BOOK SPECIFICALLY targeted:</p>

<pre><code>	tracking (and interception) of UFOs
	detailed catalogging of UFOs
	identifying of UFOs
</code></pre>

<p>and the coverups that proceeded said. <br />
Multiple witnesses and witnesses to the information presented have commented “on record”.</p>

<p>Certainly someone ELSE, someone NOT FROM HERE-</p>

<pre><code>	is flying those things
</code></pre>

<p>Earth- to date- CANNOT produce a craft capable of maneuvering such speeds and trajectories.<br />
“The G forces alone inside the craft would kill you”.</p>

<p>Well- 
		obviously we have learned to counter those, as well as gravity.</p>

<p>Yes- I said we.</p>

<p>Here is the “official as it gets” US GOVT “Project directive”.<br />
This was either microfiched(put on micro film) or stored for a very loong time.</p>

<p>You will see reverse pages stamped and copied thru. <br />
(Wouldnt want this confused with the common files, now would we?)</p>

<p>Archiving methods, unfortunately- degrade scanned copies.<br />
As does a copy of a copy of a copy- with paper files.</p>

<hr />
<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="security-check">Security Check</h4>

<p>Failed.</p>

<p>Someone has broken in previously. <br />
ZeroNet was targeted, again.</p>

<p>mysterious “scanner or indexing files” have been left behind.</p>

<p>Data is archived on tape and via NAS.<br />
Remote access has been disabled to said NAS.</p>

<p>Files have been scanned for viruses. <br />
No apparent damage other than to physical hardware.</p>

<p>Files will be locally “rehashed for integrity” shortly.</p>

<p>-because you have “a need to know”</p>
