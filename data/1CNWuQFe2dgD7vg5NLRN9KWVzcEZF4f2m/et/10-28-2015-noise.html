          <p>I dunno what it is about the acenine behaviour in the US.</p>

<p>Its not just .. just north of the southern border activity neither.</p>

<p>Mid-country, north country, deep south..its all over.
People are just badasses, whether theyre from here or not.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I dunno what it is with these people either because this is NOT NORMAL behaviour, especially in other countries.</p>

<p>But they come over here in droves and think they can just mis behave.</p>

<p>In some parts of the country it must either be heavily in bed with drug dealers or 
inbreed stupid beyond recognition.</p>

<p>They are asking to have thier asses handed to them.</p>

<p>Bouncy houses, kids screeming, loud ass bass shaking everyones windows and walls…. 
go deep into Mexico, into Canada,  overseas into Japan…</p>

<p>you’‘ll never see it. <br />
EVER. <br />
Anywhere. <br /></p>

<p>So why do these people think they can come to our country and  be a badass torwards everyone they meet?</p>

<p>THEY ARE NOBODYS!</p>

<p>Half of them ARENT EVEN LEGAL HERE! AND THEY WONT GO AWAY!</p>

<p>They would rather pick a fight with you and call over some druglord friends of theirs to finish the job. 
I should know.  <br /></p>

<p>Some drunk ass druglord mafia wanna be from the ZETA cartel tried to chuck a beer bottle at me one night.</p>

<p>And then he gets  all pissed off at me. At ME!</p>

<p>The dumbfuck throws a beer bottle at my feet, and wants to pick a fight with me!</p>

<p>All I can say  is he was damn lucky my comrade didnt see his ass doing it.
The cartel has been pushed south in recent years but the badass mentality remains, seemingly everywhere I go.</p>

<p>Now Im getting it from black ass hudlums wasting money on engine bling and blacklights (they arent even 18 yet),
yet want to street race somewhere.</p>

<p>The evidence is all around me. No, the numbnuts cant drive neither.<br />
BOOM BOOM goes the bass 24/7 and nobody seems to give a shit. <br />
NOBODY. <br />
And all these people do is leech off of welfare and have like ten kids each, 
then get into beer brawls after midnight that can wake the whole neighborhood IFFF thier neighbors
 werent honking repeatedly or revving louder than shit car engines,</p>

<p>which O:  BTW is also illegal and against the lease.</p>

<p>Dont get me started on the stray pitbulls around here… when does the bullshit end?</p>

<p><em>Where</em> does it end?
I cant afford to live in million dollar house in the middle of nowhere or rich kiddie-ville….<br />
cmon….<br />
be reasonable.</p>

<p>FUCKING HUMANS, TOO! BUNCH of GOD DAMNED INBRED HOOLIGANS!
You dont see this sort of activity on our worlds…<br />
No planets is perfect, but you dont see it.</p>

<p>-And then you complain…O we cant be elsewhere? We cant be in space?<br />
Why do you make us wait so damn long?</p>

<p>Because you dont behave and know when to quit. When you learn what reasonable intelligence
and respectable behaviours are…then you can come out here. I dont care if you cuss or hunt.</p>

<p>-Just be mindful of who and what your cussing at. And watch your paranoia.</p>
