          <h2 id="hello">Hello..</h2>

<p>(Station) CDR Kelly, This ones for YOU.</p>

<p>Surely a TAKE on ADELE, but none the less:</p>

<p>HELLO.<br />
This is EARTH…..<br />
WE mustve tweet a thousand times….</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="the-tweets-to-space">The tweets to space</h3>

<p>This campaign started a few years back. The attempt was to send (Im assuming in 
ASCII RTTY mode) ‘tweets’ to space to convey the intentions of those here to 
offworld civilizations.All who posted were guaranteed to be sent.</p>

<p>(There is another contest RUNNING RIGHT NOW…)</p>

<p>Several thousand made the cut.<br />
Some are funny, some sincere, some curious…..<br />
and finally we get to ask: <br />
“Is this your tweet?”</p>

<p><img src="../assets/tweets.jpg" alt="tweets" /></p>

<p>Obama seems to be there…still waiting to see if its actually him.<br />
As part of an ongoing peace process these tweets are included in diplomatic relations.</p>

<p>Several pages worth if Im not mistaken.</p>

<p>The answer to the main question at hand has already been answered.</p>

<p>Someone from VEGA responded to ARICEBO and left some modified corn to prove it. <br />
The answer was similar to the graphic sent.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<pre><code>	Are we alone? (See the above paragraph).
	WHO are you
	WHERE do you come from
	WHAT are you doing here
</code></pre>

<p>..and you said you had a response?</p>

<p>You know thats more than one question.
WE shall answer you.<br />
As far as the who:</p>

<pre><code>It appears that a federation vessel has intercepted this. The tweets, not the ARICEBO message.
</code></pre>

<p>WHERE:</p>

<pre><code>	WE are not one distinct race from any one world. WE are many.
</code></pre>

<p>Be more specific.</p>

<p>WHAT:</p>

<pre><code>	Isnt that obvious by now? 
</code></pre>

<p>Dont you think if we were hostile we would have
invaded you already?</p>

<p>We want whats best for you. <br />
Eventually, maybe trade or exchange people.</p>

<p>Maybe keep some of you if you wish to be kept.</p>

<p>To violate ones will is to violate ourselves and all we hold dear. <br />
We do not generally abduct others. <br />
And landing here has been restricted for various reasons.</p>

<p>“You said federation?”
Yes. But its not what you think. Roddenberry had shall we say “creative license”.<br />
BUT, he gave you a rough idea.</p>

<p>There are good guys, bad guys, unaligned planets,
you get the idea. We will go a little more in depth on this in a minute.</p>

<p>Response:</p>

<p>To do this on a tweet by tweet basis would be a waste of time and counter
productive. Besides there is like one of us responding to like so many of you. <br />
One can speak on behalf of others.</p>

<p>So lets highlight a few points.</p>

<p>Music:</p>

<p>Favorites very by race type and planet. Some like hard rock, some
something softer, some Mozart or similar.Rap is generally well, there are
some liked and some not so liked. Rap is a little out there and harder to
understand.</p>

<p>There is no “THUG LIFE” in outer space. There is no place for that
behavior.Its counter productive. That noted, EMINEM makes a few good points.<br />
Generally acid and heavy techno are worse than raping ones ears. But feel
free to crack open a bass guitar.</p>

<p>Trade:</p>

<p>You havent earned that yet.</p>

<p>Its not imposing of a GOD complex from those with more tech than you can dream of.</p>

<p>If you want to trade, you have to learn how to behave. Same goes for exchanging people.</p>

<p>You are justly feared.</p>

<p>We have been trying to teach you this since the 1950s. You should have
learned something about that from Roddenberry. Or Valiant Thor.</p>

<p>What its like:</p>

<p>A rock is a rock. <br />
Most have trees and water. <br />
Some are barren. <br />
Location and name are unimportant.</p>

<p>How the society lives and builds and treats the place it inhabits with respect for all things is
whats important. How others are treated is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>One is expected to help others and put service before self. But there is plenty of
time for self and those you care about.</p>

<p>You are not worked to death.</p>

<p>Living expenses and requirements are met.<br />
There is no general debt or money or need for money.</p>

<p>There is always an exchange medium, but the greed and money itself basically dont exist.<br />
You can sort of think of it like Bitcoin. There is no central bank.</p>

<p>All people and exchanges are expected to be able to honor the currency anywhere
at any time. You dont need to rely on a banker.There is generally no need
for coin or bills. We exchange people, technology and things all the time.</p>

<p>People are nice. NASA has some idea of how this works.</p>

<p>Resources:</p>

<p>You have to know how to fetch them from thier source in such a way
that they are sustainable and not damaging to the environment. In some
instances that means getting them from uninhabitable or semi-inhabitable
locations. Scarce resources are a problem for everyone anywhere.</p>

<p>There are many many other subject areas. We will get to you in time.
This post was not meant to do the work of another yet to be posted.</p>

<p>It is asked again:</p>

<pre><code>Is THIS your TWEET?
