Now they just get intel from microsoft through their backdoors because as it was mentioned microsoft is a private company with billions of dollars that tricks people into volunteering there information in their terms of service.",

Lol :)\n\nThe masses do not adopt; you must become their trusty servant leader. You help them and they protect you because they know you are the good not the evil like the government.\n\nJust dont let it get like China. This is what we are fighting to protect here right now. If we lose, then I die.",
