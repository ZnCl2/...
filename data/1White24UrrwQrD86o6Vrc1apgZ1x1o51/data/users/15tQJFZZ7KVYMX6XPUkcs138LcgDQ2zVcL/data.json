It might help if more of us that can, run more public proxies and hubs.\n\nOver the years I've run every kind of social media site known to man, for the greater good. Even before the internet as we know it today. We have come a long way.\n\nBut as censorship and censorship proxies like copyright continued to grow, it became just too much of a hassle and expense to run a site for the greater good.\n\nSites like Google get some astronomical number of takedown requests every second. And that's just a fraction of the total number of censorship requests.\n\nBut it has occurred to me that running a Zeronet proxy or hub is essentially the same thing as being a common carrier like at&t. We essentially have no control over the content, only the connection through our proxy.\n\nSo we should be able to provide an easy access public proxy without having to hassle with all that censorship bullshit..üëçüòÄ\n\nSo I think if I ever join any of the public commercial social media sites again, my Zeronet ID profile and my easy access public proxy will be my main contact. And my most reliable backup if a commercial site goes down. Or I get banned for some reason.\n\nZeronet may also be a good place to bring a fight.

While  most of you are clueless as to why your broke ass is hurting.\n\nFor example, most of the US's so called deficit spending is really just theft. A highly advanced form of political white collar crime.\n\nIt's a combination of government mismanagement. Corrupt spending priorities. And unfair and inadequate taxation. Entitlements are not the problem. Political corruption is the problem. \n\nNearly a hundred years ago US politicians promised the American people two chickens in every pot on Sunday, and two cars in every garage. Yet many US citizens still go hungry in America. While the US sends billions of dollars in financial aid to some of the wealthiest countries in the world.\n\nAs RT as previously reported, the US is sending 40 to 50 billion dollars in financial aid to one of the richest countries in the world, Israel. $34,000 per Jew Israeli household.  While many United States citizens go hungry and scramble to find food. \n\nSome members of Congress are so corrupt, stupid and arrogant as to complain about doing too much for We The People Of The United States, their bosses. The 40 to 50 billion dollars to Israel would give each adult United States Citizen! $200+ a month in grocery money a year.\n\nThe 40 to 50 billion per year to Israel is just financial aid to Israel. It doesn't include the hundreds of billions we've already given Israel. Or the probably trillions we've already given Israel in Military Support. I suspect much of our trillion dollar deficit is directly related to spending for racist apartheid Israel. Disgusting scumbags.\n\nWe don't know exact numbers. Because Congress refuses to give We The People Of The United States a full accounting of the total amount Congress has assisted Israel in stealing from us.\n\nCongress better finally come up with the \"chickens in every pot on Sunday\" that was promised, a 100 years ago. We already have a system in place in every state of the United States. All they have to do is send everyone a SNAP card with $200 or more in grocery money on it every month.\n\nIf Congress doesn't do so soon, heads are going to roll politically. From the White House on down. Enough is enough. \n\nThose selfish greedy bastards can look at it this way. That grocery money goes right back into the US economy, because everyone has to eat. Creeps!..üòÄ\n\n</pre>",
