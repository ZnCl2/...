			"body": "@caryoscelus: \n>: well, one conclusion i've came to long time ago is that physicalism (materialism) cannot be correct (without losing its monistic character; substantial amount of people consider themselves materialists while admitting consciousness)\n&nbsp;\nphysicalism may very well fall short but there is no contradiction in believing (inductively based on scientific research) that consciousness arises from physical interactions. do you agree with Searle's Chinese room experiment? can you see the problem with it?\n\n>Time is fundamental and cannot have beginning or end\n\nTime is fundamental (as we know it) to our particular universe configuration, and we don't know if it could be changed, it could be fundamentally changed through for instance metastability. that is to say if something fundamental to time change, like its dimensionality we could say that time has phases or rather that a particular universe has changed its properties from this to that on certain moments, its quantifiable.\n&nbsp;\nat the very least we could argue the following, the existence of moments in dimensions is a natural phenomena, that if there are multiverses their boundaries may not share time because that is where the first phenomena of the big bang occurs, its exogenic to time, that is to say, time has beginning and ending because outside of it there is no time and no one to keep track of time.\n&nbsp;\none may argue that everything needs moments to occur but its hard to argue that these moments are similar to time. i don't understand string theory besides terminology and their relationship but higher dimensions interact with time differently, not being subject to it.\n&nbsp;\nis it fundamental?\nin the same way that one believes in solipsism the same amount of doubt should be applied to the idea that consciousness and self-awareness may not be special but an emergent phenomena that gives the illusion of oneness.\n&nbsp;\nthe manifestation of consciousness, to begin with is very specific to humans, it may very well exist outside like boltzmann brains but even then we can investigate what does it look like, there could a b. brain that is exactly like a random human *or* an entirely different type of consciousness, but no matter how different, its manifestation, the only way we would be able to observe is through data, through measurement instruments.\n(assuming such required knowledge and capabilities of course)\n&nbsp;\nbut that opens the debate to not only question the uniqueness of our human consciousness but other kinds even, and if it could be reasonably observable, measurable, quantified, what would it be a fundamental instead of emergent?\n&nbsp;\nlet's deviate a little bit.\n&nbsp;\nwhat can be said to be fundamental? that which must exist or that which may exist? if a closed-universe can exist, is it fundamental? \nwhat can be said about the existence of creation itself for a particular universe is that creation is possibility (i could even make a half-baked argument about random fluctuations but i'm going to ignore that).\nfurther, we mustn't fall into a composition fallacy, if creation is a possibility then possibility itself is fundamental but any particular universe is not fundamental. that is to say that creation of particular universes may have laws but may not be deterministic, but it doesn't mean that the particular universe created is not deterministic. (here's one for free will).\n&nbsp;\nwe can however say that after something is made it has fundamentals, that is, consciousness as we know it is fundamental to our universe configuration.\n&nbsp;\nfurthermore, if consciousness is fundamental in this context of particular universe than *it is* particular to this universe, that is not to say that it cannot exist in other universes but to say that our current is locked into a particular range, to particular compatible configurations.\n&nbsp;\nlets go back.\n&nbsp;\nit really doesn't matter what is fundamental here anymore, because its about what can happen, as everything must happen eventually (lets assume that is true for our universe) everything can be said to be fundamental.\n&nbsp;\nin that way humans and what they make is fundamental. soon we can unveil the unimportant distinction between fundamental and emergent and see that there is not a single difference between them in reality.",
