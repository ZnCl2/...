Reminded me of the old Bene Gesseritt litany against fear:\n\n> I must not fear. \n> Fear is the mind-killer. \n> Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. \n> I will face my fear. \n> I will permit it to pass over me and through me. \n> And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. \n> Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain\n",
