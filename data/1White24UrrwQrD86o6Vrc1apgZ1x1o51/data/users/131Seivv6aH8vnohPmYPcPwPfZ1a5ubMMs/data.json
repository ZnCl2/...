So after just 5 weeks on ZeroMe I was getting \"include too large\" errors without understanding what they meant  or why.\n\nI feel it should not be possible for someone to join ZeroMe without them at least being shown a page of brief explanation (about hubs, space etc) and being offered a list of hubs to choose from (with details like space limit etc). \"Prevention is better than cure.\"\n\n> you don't see that you are still following on their page (though subscription per se seems to work fine)\nSorry, I don't understand.",

The other day I needed some info/help and I looked again at ZeroExchange (actually I've still got the tab open). And the zite had about 5 posts over a year. With the most \"recent\" being 4 months old. \n.\n(Also I clicked on the \"About\" page and it literally was just a page with a big  \"About Page!\" written on it :) )\n.\nSo I asked on ZeroTalk, where I felt more confident I would get a response. I don't really know if ZeroExchange is better, per se, than ZeroTalk. But I do know ZT has much more activity from many more users. So I posted there because people post there. I.e. network effect.\n.\nKiwipedia has additional issues: it was only on my 4th or 5th visit (I only returned because it kept nagging me for space) that I finally found  that there's any actual content on it. I literally clicked every single damned link on the home page until I finally found something (buried two/three levels down under a small link called \"Hub list\"). They've made a few small changes to the home page since then, but there are so many basic usability flaws with Kiwipedia I find it useless.\n.\nAnd even if the design & usability issues were fixed, it would still, like Wikipedia, rely on a critical mass of contributors, providing, editing and updating content.",

Click on \"Hub List\".\n3. Click on \"en\".\n4. Click on \"List of English Wikipedia Pages\".\n5. Wait until I remember that does nothing.\n6. Click on \"Article Index\".\n7. Wait. The page looks blank but will eventually show something.\n8. Press CTRL+F and search. (Obviously this will only search article titles, not content). Go through results until finding the right one (if present).\n9. If no result (likely), go to Wikipedia and repeat the process with fewer steps (i.e. use Wikipedia's search box). \n\n.\nBookmarking \"Article Index\" would take care of steps 1-5. Are there other things I can do to make it easier to find info on Kiwipedia? I tried ZeroHello search (`xyz site:kiwipedia`) but that doesn't work.",

That means on all the other things in life we are reliant on others and on whatever info about it stuck in our minds over the years from casual exposure.
