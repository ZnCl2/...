Phones are in large part for being contacted and notified of things. Browsers are for going *to* places.\nImagine getting home from a restaurant and someone walking in asking if you want a drink refill. You expect that while you're \"there\" but not after.\n\nMaybe I'm just old hat not wanting browsers and web tech to do literally everything all the time.",
