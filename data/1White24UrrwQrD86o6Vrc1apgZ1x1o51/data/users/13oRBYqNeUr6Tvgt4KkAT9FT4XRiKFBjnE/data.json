This sounds like a complicated, if not impossible, task. But only as long as we allow user-submitted code to do anything, if we treat it as a compiled blob. If we treat code as pure expressions (*code is data*), we can see what they evaluate to, which variables are in the formula (side note: implemented in most straightforward way, the system would allow false positives, e.g. if code author writes `current_time * 0`, the system might consider that `current_time` is used in calculation; but nobody should need such code and even if they somehow do, there can be a way to account for that too). As such, we can notify user exactly which data is collected (for example: text in field `message` and timestamp of clicking `post` button can be collected on message board); if user is curious, they can look what processing is done with that data, but for most low-interactive sites that shouldn't even be necessary. More complex apps, such as games (especially realtime ones), would need more thorough inspection, but even then those are supposed to collect your actions anyway (and passive fingerprinting info such as screen resolution can still be preserved).",

I think i've noticed i don't really think in any language after i was learning lojban, but directly it was a result of introspection, so i can't say whether it was influenced by lojban in any way or not. Otherwise, lojban has capabilities to express thoughts in ways closer to how they appear, at least in terms of grammar; that might influence thinking processes, but i've never got to the point where i could actually construct complex construct on the fly. At best, i could think \"what are the particles used in that construct?\", then look them up and then make sentence; the great thing is, of course, that in lojban desired constructs exist more often than in natlangs. So one aspect of my thinking definitely changed: i became less forgiving to clumsiness of natlangs' grammar ^_^\n  \nNow for the bad things. The language itself is a little bit heavy; simple constructs are very simple, but when you want more complex grammar, the amount of particles can grow fast (one of the reasons for this is \"monoparsing\" and related to it lack of intonation based punctuation; \"punctuation\" in lojban is just words). I can't be certain of this due to lack of fluency, but it seems that some of the decisions might have been less than optimal. Another famous caveat is that for fine-grained concepts you either have long barely pronounceable words, or arbitrarily chosen words which you have to learn separately (like in any natlang; one of lojban's initial features was that if you learn ~2k root-words + particles and grammar, that's basically it)\n  \nBut perhaps more disheartening for me were the community issues. Many people were creating new constructs in lojban, or alter how things work; some of these changes were adopted by majority, some weren't; but at some point the difference in dialects and ambitions of people to call their dialect \"true lojban\" led to some \"heavy disputes\". I might even be better off recommending [\"zantufa\"](https://mw.lojban.org/papri/zantufa), although i don't quite remember what were grammatical differences exactly\n  \nMy final conclusion that it might be better to create a new language, taking experience of lojban and possibly other conlangs (ithkuil seems like another great language, but whereas learning lojban is easier than natlangs (barring lexical similarity), ithkuil might actually be harder), but then, of course, i never went far",

The easiest solution: do not mix&match fs and dbs, do not split db into multiple ones. This simplifies storage on one hand, but on the other, it poses some challenges in terms of organizing data flexibly. This can be solved either by allowing custom tables (inside one db) or by having universal schema extendible via tags. First approach simplifies advanced schemas, while second one simplifies things like search.\n  \nBoth inter-node communication and API are probably to be based on db-access commands (i.e. create/modify/delete row(s)), with some hints to user as to why certain permissions are required. User should be able to give these permissions individually, or even using some (possibly complex) criteria (e.g. only allow certain app posting into certain \"site\", which by the way becomes ephemeral concept, but more on that later)\n\nOne question can arise from this: can all this coexist with current fs/db system? The answer is, of course, yes. Adopting existing data might be not the most pleasant thing, but it shouldn't be impossible. A conversion utility from signed `content.json` can be made, which, if enabled, would be alternative way to prove ownership of data. It would, of course require \"too much\" permissions, but 1) they will be \"local\" and 2) history logging should be available anyway\n",

Daß etwa ein paar junge Leute gleichen Standes, aber verschiedenen Geschlechtes, unbewacht einen Ausflug hätten unternehmen dürfen, war völlig undenkbar - oder stattdessen, der erste Gedanke war, es könnte dabei etwas ›passieren‹. Ein solches Zusammensein wurde höchstens erlaubt, wenn irgendwelche Aufsichtspersonen, Mütter oder Gouvernanten, die jungen Leute Schritt für Schritt begleiteten. Daß junge Mädchen auch im heißesten Sommer Tennis in fußfreien Kleidern oder gar mit nackten Armen, hätte als skandalös gegolten, und wenn eine wohlgesittete Frau in der Gesellschaft die Füße überschlug, empfand die ›Sitte‹ dies als grauenhaft anstößig, weil dadurch ihr Knöchel unter dem Kleidersaum entblößt werden könnte. Selbst den Elementen der Natur, selbst Sonne, Wasser und Luft, war es nicht gegönnt, die nackte Haut einer Frau zu berühren. Im freien Meer quälten sie sich mühsam vorwärts in schweren Kostümen, bekleidet vom Hals bis zur Ferse, in den Pensionaten und Klöstern mußten die jungen Mädchen, um zu vergessen, daß sie einen Körper besaßen, sogar ihr häusliches Bad in langen, weißen Hemden nehmen.

			"body": "@Binchan:\n\n>We can also change to question to: Why do some people begin to care about understanding their native language?\n\nYeah, i suppose that question makes more scientific sense ;) Originally the context (in my head) was that even supposedly educated and smart people are in practice very often susceptible to selective perception of information, even on the level of not being careful about language parsing.\n\nI know i shouldn't be really surprised by it and i can name many reasons that explain such behaviour. For one, it can be due to preferring fast reaction to multiple sources of information rather spending a lot of time to process one. For another, it can be due to a habit: by being exposed to a lot of low quality information (that does not need higher level processing) we risk dulling our ability to think.\n\nBut specifically the reason for my \"surprise\" was that even when people are being repeatedly exposed to the facts of miscommunication, they are not very likely to reflect on it and start listening others and expressing themselves more carefully.\n\n>People don't learn a native language by learning grammar or language theory\n\nYeah, and sadly formal grammar education in school usually misses most of the audience. Learning second language is usually more useful in that regard because it leads to at least some comparison and thus better understanding even of the first one.\n\n>I agree that identity isn't a good word, as it sometimes isolates a group and raises racism. Maybe familiarity, feeling at home, consensus are some better words.\n\nMy point about identity being illusionary was not about the word being appropriate. Rather, that the feeling of being similar due to speaking same language is largely an illusion.\n\nAdmittedly, sometimes language and cultural tradition go hand in hand and not very separated, but then it is more correct to say that language is a part of cultural identity, but it does not define it (i.e. you may speak the language but feel alienated from the rest of culture, even if there is single culture associated with language).\n\nI think we can draw a fancy programmer parallel here. There's a saying \"libs are languages\": choice of library/framework quite often means more than language. Somewhat similar is with human languages: direction of thought, common themes, education and worldview often contribute more to productivity of communication than sharing native language.\n\n>That's also something I'm concerning about. Because some children of my relatives here now speak more national language taught in school than native language learnt from the beginning. That's unavoidable I guess, because most of their time is now spent and exposed to the national language, and because they live in a more (inter)nationlized region.\n\nYeah, that's quite common and to some degree unavoidable. But personally i don't see anything *inherently* bad in it. I'd be quite happy if everybody would switch to a single logical constructed language as first lang or at least would be able to communicate in english.\n\nI do like language diversity from aesthetical point of view, even if i don't spend a lot of time on systematic language learning these days. But from aesthetical PoV thousands of slightly differing languages might not be optimal.\n\nBut it seems to me that attaching inherent ethical value to diversity is a dangerous path (less dangerous than attaching ethical value to unification, though). It might be calculated as useful from evolutionary point of view, but such calculations can never be perfect.\n\nThat said, in reality such processes might happen in a bad way. As far as i understand, children bilingualism is more likely to cause issues than benefits with overall low level of education.\n",

			"body": "@Binchan:\n\n>but I also feel your answers missed the keyword \"native\", i.e. you are more answering \"Why do some people begin to care about understanding language?\"\n\nWell, generally i think that distinguishing between native and non-native is secondary and so i'm more interested in generic. As for the question, i'm not really answering it anyway; rather i gave an explanation for why it doesn't happen.\n\nAlso, i just noticed that phrase \"to understand language\" can have two somewhat different emphasises. I originally meant it to mean \"to be able to understand what is said in language\", but the emphasis can also be placed on understanding language as a separate entity.\n\n>For some culture the language may not define the identity, but for some culture it does. German and Germany is a good example I guess, though some Dutch seems to consider German as not a real language, from the popular \"American first, the Netherlands second\" video [IFS] [Youtube] (so it may be just a joke).\n\nDo you use german as example of language that defines identity?\n\n>Similarly once I saw someone complaint \"the grammar of English is that English has no grammar\".\n\nThat's a really weird claim, unless the context is something like \"most english speakers are non-native and don't know its grammar\".\n\n>If an individual gets alienated, it has nothing to do with the language, and my previous view \"a group with same/similar identity (language) have some consensus, can understand and accept each other more easily, and are more willing to talk to and help each other.\" is still proper I guess.\n\nIf a language is only spoken by a tight culturally similar group, it may make sense for that language. But for a language spoken by hundred thousands or millions? It's hard to imagine such a group being all that homogeneous.\n\nI would however agree that many people would \"accept each other more easily, and are more willing to talk to and help each other\" on the basis of using the same language. But when confronted with someone with different views, they can happily apply [\"no true scotsman\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman) argument or any other fallacy or cognitive bias to avoid actually accepting and understanding.\n\nThis is why i call the consensus and identity illusionary. It often works for people who are similar, but breaks when differently enough people confront each other.\n\n>I guess the Japanese example I mentioned in previous post is still a counterpoint to this view.\n\n>counterpoint\n\nHmm, did you mean \"counterargument\"? (Supposedly) more common musical meaning of word \"counterpoint\" seems to be only tangentially related.\n\n>I prefer an idea that capable individuals learn more languages and bridge different culture (or creating a high quality translation machine), instead of all people in the world can communicate each other with the same language.\n\nThe problem with that is that it directs efforts of so-called \"capable individuals\" into learning languages instead of doing something else. But i'm not really interested in persuading anybody in that view.\n\n>For the trend of decentralization (if it's not an illusion), I think we are favoring diversity than unification.\n\nWell, decentralization isn't end value as well. Usually it's considered good for the sake of freedom and/or for the sake of instrumental advantages (such as better resource usage for torrents). Now, as for language diversity, i don't see how it can increase freedom. And instrumental advantages are always relative, not absolute (and we may not assess them correctly).\n",

I don't think i can persuade people who are not close to my opinion that it would be better if there would be a single common language, but it seems to me that arguing in favour of strictly keeping current balance is a very week position.\n\nLooking from another angle: diversity in one area may take away resources from another. For example, consider how much resources is put into translation. Are you sure those can't be put to a better use that would create more possibility?\n\nNatural sciences, social sciences, arts all create more possibilities and things you still don't understand and probably won't ever have time to consume. Even understanding each other while speaking supposedly single (macro)language proves to be a hard task. Every person can be viewed as unique regardless of language.\n",

I wish some better language would become ubiquitous, perhaps a carefully created conlang (i find it unlikely to find natlang without irregularities).\n\n>English isn't a good language for precise writing, if you agree..\n\nI think it's slightly better than average, due to having a rich \"extended\" grammar that is however rarely used in many areas and can be misunderstood by those unfamiliar with it. That said, i suppose any language with philosophy and science tradition would have that.\n\nIn the end, i can't objectively compare english to other natlangs. One thing i do really like about it as a world's computer & network language is that it is pretty [analitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_language) language (thus dumb string search is pretty reliable and generating messages is simple).\n\n>a high quality translation machine is also ideal I suppose.\n\nThere are a lot of untranslatable ambiguities and nuances though.\n\n>I think this problem should be solved by technology instead, aka translation machine or others.\n\nI suspect that even the most sophisticated machine would not stop smaller languages being influenced by and even possibly merged into bigger ones. While it would solve the problem of extra work, it might also end up accelerating language extinction.\n\n>What about replacing languages with species: would it be better if there are millions of species in the world? Or only hundreds of species?\n\nBetter for whom? What hundreds of species? Depending on that, it may be considered better or worse.\n\nAs for me, i don't like attempts to fit humanity into reflecting biological processes. Evolution and nature isn't all fluffy and nice. It's generally more cold and harsh. I think humans can do better. And if they can't, what's the point in their survival? Might as well die to make place for nature to spit out another bald monkeys after some millions of years.\n\n>Arts has nothing to do with this topic I guess\n\nArts, just like sciences were an example of diversity and things to explore unrelated to language diversity.\n\n>communicated arts with a common language.\n\nEven if there would be one common language, it doesn't mean people won't be able to learn another or create their own (including conlanging as a form of art).",

Even best translation rids you of that chance and the only way to get those nuances across would be to write a long footnote describe all possible meanings in the original.\n\n>Why not try to save (keep) them from the beginning when it's possible?\n\nI don't think you've answered why should we be trying to preserve them, rather than trying to reduce their amount or, on the contrary, invent new ones. For my \"anti-conservative\" mind possibility that exactly current situation is the best sounds very improbable and should be proved with something other than \"lets save status quo\".\n\n>I don't think arts is unrelated to language diversity. Even some arts from the beginning are languages, like calligraphy.\n\nYou said that language diversity is good (perhaps among other things) because it creates interesting new things to explore. My point is that the efforts put into language diversity might as well be put into other diversities or just things to explore (where sciences, arts and math are just *examples*) and i don't see any way to evaluate what will result in a better diversity overall.\n\nI won't argue about ecosystem analogy, because it is nothing more than an analogy and thus biased towards getting certain points across, but not proving them. In other words, it is good for illustrating position, but it isn't evidence that can be used as sound argument. If you believe otherwise, that would be deep enough difference to make further argument about languages useless.\n",

At the point when there are only a handful of languages left it would be much easier to learn most of them, thus preventing further processes. Even if one language is dominating, there probably will always be people who would be interested in learning other (including dead ones; and note that internet languages will be much better preserved than ancient ones) languages for fun.\n\n>They are not in conflict I suppose\n\nWell, not in direct conflict, just sharing same resources.\n\n>But without language diversity, no one could do the former any more. \n\nLanguage diversity already exists and it doesn't require us to actually speak them. Even if we imagine that suddenly everyone starts teaching their kids only english (or any other single language), we would still have large archives that no single human would be able to digest in a current lifetime.\n\n>Yep, though imo proving, sound arguments may be necessary for debate, are not always necessary for discussion or understanding.

The main point is that the same posts can be made on different zites and people will see or not see them not based on their content preferences, but on their interface preferences.\n\nI totally realize this isn't a trivial thing to do. Quite often it is easier to just write your own thing instead of spending great amount of time on negotiations and solving compatibility issues. I've done that myself and i guess that 0net might not have appeared at all without that. The reason i'm specifically talking about social zites (though it applies to content hosting zites to a lesser degree as well) is that their main goal isn't \"make shiny interface with as much features as possible\", but to be able to have meaningful conversations with interesting people (and secondary do it in a most convenient way).\n\nI don't want to blame anybody for doing something wrong way. \"If you want to do something right, do it yourself\", but since i'm not doing it i wanted to at least share my perspective.\n\nIf i'd be motivated enough to develop a social zite, i'd start by trying to assemble as much active developers doing the same as i could and start discussing data structures, core engine features and migration possibilities. If developers would reach a reasonable consensus, technical issues like db migration can be solved, even if existing content will be migrated in an imperfect way. If i missed something and there's a place where developers discuss these things, i'd be happy to participate if not with code than at least with general ideas.\n\nIn conclusion: i think the issue is **more social than technical**.",

(Since i'm unaware of all technical difficulties and existing experiments, i may be wrong about viability of this idea; hopefully this comment describes my basic position well enough)\n\nOf course, not everybody would want to download all the content when it gets too big. And people might prefer different ways of splitting content. But i think the solution can be found, even if it would require some additions to 0net core / plugins.\n\n>The problem is there has to be a commonality between the way all the zites store their data. This isn't always the case.\n\nThere's always a more generic design that would allow for merging. I would agree it might be found impractical though, but i wonder whether it was actually discussed at all..\n\n**Re: ownership**\n\nOwnership problem still exists today. I might not understand all technical details yet, but from what i see it's pretty much federation system. And when it is in form of multiple thematic 0talk clones (or personal/group blogs), i can see a good reason for that: people want to put their community communication under their control. However, main 0talk vs 0me vs 0voat vs 0medium still seem to put a lot of control into the hands of creators and/or hub owners. I'm reading more about merger zites now, so i'll have to postpone specific judgements on what can be currently achieved or what can be reasonably achieved, but anyhow the idea is that even with single database *it should certainly be not fully owned/be controllable by single entity*.\n\n>One more thing.

Times table, quadratic equations, trigonometry, polynomials and many other math topics are a good way to force people away from math on one stage or another. Of course, they can be taught differently; explaining concepts usually doesn't hurt anybody. But forcing people to perform useless operations and memorize useless information just because \"it will make you smarter\" is killing interest.\n\nMath is supposed to not rely on blind faith. Then why teaching it relies exactly on blind faith that your teacher knows what's good for you?\n\nIf you think category theory is hard to understand, i'll probably have to agree. In the end, i haven't actually learned it yet. But if one has to build enough concrete examples to understand it, then those examples might as well be something more exciting than abstract trigonometry and polynomials; for example, functional programming and cs in general, if learning other sciences doesn't sound like it would provide necessary abstractions. Learning programming is generally a very good way to make abstract math concepts concrete and interesting to wider audience: trigonometry suddenly becomes applicable in graphics, as do low-degree polynomials.

Although it's mostly keeping certain class and id properties, so if you just move things around it should generally not break. But the style mostly depends on css, which you can even experiment with builtin browser tools (e.g. in [firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/UI_Tour)).\n\n***\n\nBut whatever you use, for non-trivial tasks you'll likely have to have some level of understanding of how things work. The amount of things you can do with css alone is so big that presenting all of these options visually will be more confusing than with smart combination of visuals and text.\n\nIn general most UIs are bad for you though, encouraging ineffective interaction. But then so is html, so i wouldn't blame anyone for not desiring learning it.\n\n***\n\nBy the way, my site (0net version of it) runs on custom engine (i can't exactly advise to use it, though that's an option), which means that there is no \"file drop\" method of copying layout or design into typical zeroblog-based one (although it's largely compatible with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)). And it also implies i have little idea how hard it is to work with zeroblog engine in terms of layout ─ most customizations of it are pure stylistic ones. [Here's](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/) the best one i've seen, btw.\n\n***\n\nSo in a nutshell, there is no single tool specifically for this, but you don't have to learn that much html either.\n\n> vi or some other lame text editor to make it happen\n\nI don't think it's appropriate to call one of the two most advanced and time-proven editors \"lame\".

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a good answer to that; anything besides \"one moment\" and \"eternity\" sounds arbitrary; and eternity is dubious when the only thing that \"connects\" consciousness of a person with, say, its 10 year ago self is memory, notoriously untrustworthy construct..\n  \n..at the end of the day, no one is going to answer simple question \"why is it present now\"",

Scientific research is all good, but it is necessarily based on some assumptions about how the world and our ability to explore it work; so philosophy takes precedence. \n  \nBesides, what's more important here, science cannot say anything about phenomenal consciousness: at best, every person has a \"proof\" about existence of their own consciousness, its universality is just extrapolation; so there's no way to apply proper scientific methods to it or meaningfully share results\n\n> do you agree with Searle's Chinese room experiment? can you see the problem with it?\n\nNot sure what does it mean to \"agree with experiment\"? You mean Searle's conclusion? In physicalist setting, it can be easily reapplied to prove that humans are analogous to weak AI as well ;) Which is i believe true in physicalist setting\n  \nIf we ditch physicalism though, we're sorta out of luck in finding answers. Most reasonable to me seems that computers can't have consciousness, but i highly doubt that humans can, too\n\n> our particular universe configuration\n\nOh, this needs terminology elaboration, i guess. If you're fan of talking about \"multiple universes\", that's fine too, but then what word should we designate to the meaning of \"everything that exist\"? Perhaps, \"the world\"?\n\nAnyway, i was speaking of fundamentality of time (as well as consciousness) in the whole world, or to our thinking, which is essentially the same (since the only things we can reason about is product of our interpretation of raw input, which is just data, not \"things in themselves\"). I could imagine (though i find it highly unlikely) situation where *some notion* of time is no longer fundamental, e.g. some sorts of time travel; but to describe them, we'd need to add another notion of time, in which those travels actually happen\n\n> as everything must happen eventually\n\nWhile i disagree with that as i understand it, i should also point out that again, talking about \"everything\" is very prone to misunderstanding and confusion unless you specify what kind of \"everything\" you're talking about",

That said, for some reason the most easily found english translation misses an important point, but here it is:\n\n> Perhaps we can still understand that in those days it would have been a crime for a woman to wear a pair of trousers at play. **But how to make comprehensible prudery which forbidden women to say the word \"pants\" itself? She should have, if it wasn't possible to omit mention of such perilous object as men's pants, say \"leg's dress\" or the specially invented evasive term \"the inexpressible.\"**. The possibility of two young people of the same social class, but of different sexes, going on an excursion together without proper supervision was unthinkable; or rather, the first thought would have been that “something might happen.” Such companionship was only permissible if some chaperone, a mother or a governess, followed the young people step by step. That even in the hottest summers young girls should play tennis in clothes that permitted freedom to their legs or with naked arms, would have been scandalous, and when a well-behaved woman crossed her feet in society, custom found this to be horribly improper, because her ankles might be disclosed under the hem of her dress. Even the elements, sun, water, and air, were not permitted to touch the skin of a woman. In the open sea women made painful progress in heavy suits which covered them from top to toe, and in the boarding schools and convents the young girls, in order to forget that they had bodies, were forced to bathe in long, white shirts. It is neither legendary nor exaggerated to say that old women died, the lines of whose shoulders or knees no one had ever seen, with the exception of the midwife, their husbands, and the undertaker.\n\nThe part in my bold is my translation based on russian version and a bit of german, so it might be not 100% accurate, but it gets the meaning conveyed",

If they are notified, however, it gets even trickier. On one hand, they could say that CC-BY-SA license notice is there (assuming it is) and they have the right to display video via it. But on the other hand, i'm not sure if their user agreement doesn't put additional restrictions which would mean they don't actually offer the video under SA license to viewers\n\n> would be very impractical for the creator to issue a lawsuit.\n\nYeah, i think getting video removed will be as far as it'd go. For single video it won't be anything interested, but i wonder if some kind of mass enforcing is possible. Just to spite YT/show people it doesn't even allow uploading content's free for distribution. Not that i'll personally be bothered to go through with this idea, though",
