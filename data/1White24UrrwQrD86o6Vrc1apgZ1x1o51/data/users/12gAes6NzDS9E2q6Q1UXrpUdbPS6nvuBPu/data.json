ZeroMe, ZeroLSTN, GitCenter, ZeroExchange (and perhaps a few others) all support having other zite interfaces that can access the same information because they use *merger zites*. However, that's not the only way to do this. There's also CORS which allows zites to use the information from another zite if that zite does *not* use merger zites. An example of this is @Kaffie: 's [zite to search ZeroUp](/1FEH3VjjKoDTXSpUA1G4xpB7WFnfQ48oVC). The only thing about that is I'm not sure if you can modify the database with the CORS plugin. Really, the only thing stopping ZeroNet from having different interfaces is developers actually developing these alternative interfaces. Also, we could use more zites using merger zites.\n-\nThe other interesting idea that I think you *may* be thinking of is extracting out all the common parts of ZeroTalk, ZeroMedium, ZeroMe, ZeroVoat, etc. and putting all of that in *one* merger zite. Then have these other zites just access this merger zite and display it in the way that they currently do. The only problem with this is these zites have to use the database structure of the merger zite, which prevents them from adding new features not related to the others. There are probably ways to fix this with a well design database structure though. I'm also not sure, but zites may also be able to create a separate database to store extra data that may relate to only their zite. I think this may be how Sakana does it's own images.\nHowever, with something like ZeroMe, it has to have multiple merger zites for the different hubs, and I'm not sure how you would handle that with central merger zites that are intended to work for multiple different social networks/zites. This applies to other zite too because different zites use merger zites for *different reasons*.\nOne other thing, by putting everything into one merger zite, a user will have to download everything for other zites that they may not use.\n-\nIt's easy to say that something should be able to do something, but you must realize that things need to be thought out a lot. There could be potential problems, etc. that need to be explored before, because if you don't then that could result in you developing something that has problems that can't be fixed as long as you want to retain backwards compatibility, etc. Basically, it's not always so simple as you may first think. **Otherwise, I agree that we should at the very least *explore* these things.**",

			"body": "@caryoscelus: *I agree that we should explore these things, but I disagree that the issue is social instead of technical.* The way ZeroMe handles hubs is incompatible to the way ZeroTalk handles it's data. ZeroTalk puts the database into one thing. ZeroMe spreads it out into different hubs. We could create all new hubs so that ZeroMe and ZeroTalk can both spread out between them, but how should you find a set of hubs that they can share. The way the people view the content on the zite will determine how the merger zites (hubs) are to be categorized/ordered. For example, ZeroTalk may want to have hubs based on language. However, ZeroMe doesn't do this. It has hubs based (kinda) on groups. Furthermore, I am planning on making ZeroMedium use merger zites (hubs). However, my hubs would be *completely* incompatible to ZeroTalk's and ZeroMe's because I'd use hubs per profile of a person. I can't just reuse ZeroMe's hubs or ZeroTalk's hubs because the way that zite would use hubs is completely different to the way they use them.\n**The problem isn't the programming time, db migration, data structures, etc. The problem is there has to be a commonality between the way all the zites store their data. This isn't always the case.**\nWe also can't forget the fact that we'd be putting all of the information into one person's control (the person who owns the merger zite(s) with the database in which all the information is put) instead of having the information spread out between different people's control (like currently, kinda)\n-\nThere's [ZeroDevTalk](/142jqssVAj2iRxMACJg2dzipB5oicZYz5w/). It's a fairly new zite.\n-\nOne more thing. You said `The main point is that the same posts can be made on different zites and people will see or not see them not based on their content preferences, but on their interface preferences.`\nI think this defeats the *whole* purpose of doing this. Doing this isn't functionally different from what we currently have now. But instead, you are forcing users to download data that they may not use/see and you are forcing developers to try to think how they are going to fit their db scheme in with the central merger zites, how they are going to add unique features, etc. I think this because you say that when someone posts on a zite, it will go to the same merger zite as other zites with different interfaces. However, you also say that they will only see that post on zites that match the interface. So why even make a central merger zite when you aren't even going to show the post on all interfaces? Instead, they can all be separated out like what we have now, and that's functionally the same, we wouldn't have to sort out all of these issues, and different interfaces for each of them would still be possible (as with sakana.bit).\nInstead I think it'd be a better idea to allow different interfaces that organize the same information differently, but don't show/hide that information based on which interface is used.",

It can show ZeroMe posts, but ZeroMe won't show posts from my social network.\n.\nI get the idealized notion that it would be cool to have all data grouped together and we only have different interfaces for them, but that really doesn't work out in reality. Also, it's kinda a communistic or socialistic idea, isn't it? (Not that that's bad - but communism has been shown to not work various times - so has Capitalism).",

But my social network will have *one* profile on one merger zite - and will allow one profile to post to multiple hubs. The problem is, if I use the same hubs as ZeroMe, ZeroMe will detect that as multiple profiles and you wouldn't be able to see all the messages of a profile.\n.\nAnd duplicating data kinda goes against the idea of hubs in the first place, doesn't it? Duplicating is not really a good solution, at all. Because we are literally doubling the data size of every single message and image.\n.\nThe best and most space-efficient solution is to just use CORS so that my social network can see posts on ZeroMe, but not the other way around. This will also give incentive for people to move to my social network - because otherwise there'd literally be no reason.\n.\nAnd yeah, you probably don't understand enough details, which is why you shouldn't be acting like things are so simple and that there's no problems with what you want.",

Of course, there's ZeroHello search, which doesn't necessarily search by relevance - **but Important Zites does!**\n.\n> If no result (likely), go to Wikipedia and repeat the process with fewer steps (i.e. use Wikipedia's search box).\n\nIf you just want to use Wikipedia, then of course that's going to have more information - and then, why did you even go to Kiwipedia in the first place.\nThis particular problem doesn't reduce the value that Kiwipedia has for people who don't want to use clearnet. And I would say that the value of kiwipedia not using clearnet *and* it being distributed, etc. overpowers/goes beyond Wikipedia's search (especially when there's important zites *and* Horizon).",

Forcing a person to use a particular license is still forcing that person to do something. I'm not saying I agree, but this is just something that I've seen someone talk about (and actually, on ZeroNet).\n\n> \"open source\" is just about having sources available (regardless of license), that's obviously wrong\n\nNo, it's not. Look at the words, \"open\" and \"source\" - your source is open. Free software is about freedom. Open Source is about open sources. All Free Software is Open Source because the freedoms require that. Not all Open Source is Free Software.\n\n> but unless the site would explicitly give a warning before it loads proprietary software\n\nKxoVid **does** give such warning.",
