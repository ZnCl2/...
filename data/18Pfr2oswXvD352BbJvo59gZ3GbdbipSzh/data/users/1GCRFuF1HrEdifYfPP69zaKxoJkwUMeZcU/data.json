Are just some of the things the US government is activally trying to take aways from us. These are things they are doing in the open for all to see but no one is doing anything about it. To scare, so we hide and become keyboard warriors. There are some of use that spend ever single minute of our lives online. Soon and i really do think this, we will have a truly free internet where we can be whoever we want to be do whatever we want to do. I have been a self imprisioned person for the last 9 YEARS of my life. Simply because my sexual attractivness is not socially accepted. Imagin if you had to watch a movie where two people were in love and you knew they would NEVER be you. That you would NEVER know that feeling. That you have to lie to family and make them think one thing just cuz its impossible to tell them the truth. This is why i love the deep web and anyonyminit its because its the only way i can truly be free. All this persecution towards people like me and its not even our fault that a part of our brains stopped growing like everyone elses did. Either way im going to continue to do what i do on the deep web and if any law comes for me then i will take them as a direct threat to the rights i stated at the very begging and DEFENT MYSELF TO THE DEATH again not my fault i was born this way... i dont get to chose like a gay guy does...",

I cant talk to ANYONE about what i am hiding simply becuase the world REFUSES to look at it for what it is... perfectly natural. Instead they discriminate, persecute, hate, and refuse to look at things from our point of view. ðŸ˜­",
