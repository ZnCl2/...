				"body": "The reason why wifi and Bluetooth interfere with each other is because both use the same 2.4 GHz frequency so their signals can bounce off of each other. Bluetooth has about 80 channels that it rotates through rapidly per second so transmission ends up being spotty. Cordless phones also use 2.4 GHz so if any are lying around they can be a culprit also. ",
