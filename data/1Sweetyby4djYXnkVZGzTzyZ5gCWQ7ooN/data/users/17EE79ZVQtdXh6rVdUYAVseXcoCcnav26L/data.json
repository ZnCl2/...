Updated version at:== [ZeroNet on Tails](/1NDp4MzD5U52SjCnPAHgxo7qYJsa7ozmrT/)\n\n1. Have a USB with Tails.\n2. Set up admin password at start!\n3. Download ZeroNet and verify sig.\n4. Create and edit /etc/onion-grater.d/zeronet.yml as root and write/paste:\n\n(those dots should be -)\n[code]\n---\n- exe-paths:\n    - '*'\n  users:\n    - 'amnesia'\n  hosts:\n    - '*'\n  commands:\n    SIGNAL:\n      - 'NEWNYM'\n    ADD_ONION:\n      - pattern:     'NEW:(\\S+) port=15441'\n        replacement: 'NEW:{} port=15441'\n    DEL_ONION:\n      - '.+'\n    GETCONF:\n      - 'hiddenservicesinglehopmode'\n    GETINFO:\n      - 'version'\n[/code]\n\n5. Run `sudo service onion-grater restart` in terminal to load the new config file\n6. Check local ip with `ip addr` (one of the `inet x.x.x.x` lines) you need this for next step.\n7. Edit zeronet.conf in ZeroNet folder:\n[code]\n[global]\nui_ip = {local ip}\nfileserver_ip = {local ip}\ntor = always\n[/code]\n8. Start Tor Browser and add local ip to not use proxy (Network Settings)\n9. Now run ./ZeroNet.sh as you normally would.\n\nLet me know if you had problems, or if this helped!",

So you should either not run anything remotley untrusted on the host, or you could use Qubes as host to secure this, but that's even more hassle to set up. Tails is just less work than installing whonix and so more friendly to tech illiterate people.\n\nhttps://www.whonix.org/wiki/Host_Security\n\nI updated my guide with GETINFO whitelisted, then the ZeroNet sourcecode no longer needs be altered. I will to see if I can limit the yml whitelisted commands even farther without breaking Zeronet (GETINFO to  just version, exe-paths to just zn, hosts maybe)",

From what I understand the control port is on `9052` and always open but not accessible to any program except onion-grater which makes it available on `9051` to other programs. Onion-grater filters commands before sending them to tor, and sanitizes the responses before giving them back.",
