While we wait for an alternative those are things that could be done I guess.\n\nSpeaking of alternatives there is a P2P browser called ''Beaker''.\nFrom what I've heard it seems somewhat similar to what ZeroNet is doing but without needing an external software **other than the Beaker browser itself.**\nI wonder if it would work well for an imageboard like this.\n\n>peer numbers at least mine are more or less the same\nI never felt like that was a good way to measure things around here.\nIt seems to fluctuate a lot based on many factors.\nBased on some recent issues that were raised in the ZeroNet's repository I'd assume it be down since, apparently, Chinese people are, once again, having problems accessing the network.\n\n>This specific issue could be solved with an freenet-ish contribution of disk space for data of random ZeroNet zites in encrypted form.\nYeah that could be interesting albeit the fact that Freenet stores random data in the user's computer is exactly what keeps some people away from it, especially the ones who aren't very knowledgeable about cryptography.\nAlso, I'm not sure if it could even be done here without a major rewrite of the protocol.\nIt's simple in Freenet because of the way routing works there.\nEvery node is a router that is constantly receiving random data so they just need to cache it.\nHere peers only receive data they've requested.",
