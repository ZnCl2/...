But there is no way(that I am aware of) to change the auth_address for any zite. Even when adding new certificates, since zeronet will just assume that they were always signed for the current zites auth_address regardless of whether or not the signature on that certificate is actually valid or not, which is really misleading. All that means that, unless you delete your users.json file, '''all''' anonymous posting features are broken(millchan, 0chan, ZeroVoat and others).\n</rant>\n>I think the only limit is the 5MB limit on required files (data.json).\n>By default, there are no restrictions on optional files.\nTrue, but I thought millchan would refuse to upload files bigger than 10MB in javascript, but skimming through millchan source code this doesn't appear to be the case.

Not sure why that is though, probably because of the distinct lack of content and/or because there isn't much to talk about.\nZeroNet has the issue that a lot of content requires many people to propagate fast, without peers the amount of content is somewhat limited and without content peers will lose interest. And this is in addition to the I already have X, why should I go to Y. This specific issue could be solved with an freenet-ish contribution of disk space for data of random ZeroNet zites in encrypted form.",

Especially if that someone else is within your AoA and can literally read your every thought, every backdoor you might have set yourself up for the future, every bad thought you had in a time when you were in a bad place and everything you are now actively trying to hide from her.\nThe introduction part of Alex to Alyssa was (for me at least) absolutely intense. With so much on the line for both of them, the implications that surfaced as the situation progressed and the tensity of that whole scene really hit me hard.\n\nGreat story! Thanks for sharing, definitely worth reading!\n\n**Also: I want a sweet psychic lgf, that just wants to be tightly hugged ;_;**",

Assuming they are just html stuff, mirroring them here on zeronet would take no time at all.\n>>6cb73360-6b9e-402a-b45c-ea9aa2cd1932\nYou can do multi line code with\n[|code][/|code]\n**(remove the | symbol)**\nSee >>200fcbc9-8968-4cec-a757-2f782cc9cf28 for a more complete list.\n\nDo you want the resulting json file to be compatible with the zeronet sqlite database importing mechanism? In that case the json has to be fairly shallow(your idea girls->name->sets->ImgName->size wouldn't work). If you want this mechanism to be able to collect it into an database,  you can have at most two 'layers' of object, so something like this:\n[code]\n{\n\t\"CandyDolls\":{\n\t\t\"AbroraH\":{\n\t\t\t\"Image\":[PathToImageHere],\n\t\t\t\"Image_size\":100,\n\t\t\t[age, sets and so on]\n\t\t},\n\t\t[moar girls]\n\t},\n\t[moar studios]\n}\n[/code]\nwould work.",
