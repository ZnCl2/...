Both in the magical sense, and in the sense of \"I am delighted!\"<br><br>Q: Isn't there already enough trading card games?<br>A: Incanta is more; Incantata is an art project, a magical library, a myth, a thinking system, a culture mirror, and much more.<br>Every Incantata card is magical through and through.<br><br>Q: Oh you fright, isn't magic also dangerous? <br>A: Don't worry, the Mantra of Purity will protect you as it marks the transition to the Incantata universe.<br><br>Q: Why all this with the crypto cards?<br>A: Incantata is completely non-commercial and will ultimately be freely copyable and printable by anyone; the idea with the crypto cards serves as an incentive for artists to participate - they receive certificates, so to speak, that prove that they have helped. So we can create a work of art without money - because such is not available.<br><br>Q: And why Byeteball to mint the cards.?<br>A: With Byteball you can easily mint digital objects. The Byteball Wallet is very advanced and it will certainly soon be possible to display the images in the Byetballwallet. Just read the Byteball Whitepaper (https:\/\/byteball.org).<br><br>Q: How many cards will there be?<br>A: 841<br><br>Q: How long will it take to get everyone ready?<br>A: As long as it takes to get it done - certainly longer than a year.<br><br>Q: Will there be rarer cards<br>A: In principle no. Only the legends (allowed only once per library) are logically minted only 1\/3 times.<br><br>Q: What is the \u201egioiello d\u2019arco\u201c?<br>A: The Incantata cards 1-91 are called <b>gioiello d\u2019arco<\/b>.<br><br>Q: Who decides which cards belong to Incantata? <br>A: In the end I decide for myself, but in this process the net community, the card sponsors and the artists are highly involved.<br><br>Q: Isn't this somehow a kind of dictatorial central structure?<br>A: Basically, especially with regard to communication structures, I favor decentralized constructs. In this case, however, it is an art project whose literary direction I am in charge of. The whole thing is not as authoritarian as it looks, because everyone who participates changes Incantata!<br><br>Q: Open source code?<br>A: All program tools used for Incantata are free in the sense of the GNU Project and\/or in the sense of the FSF\/FSFE.",
