			"title": "[Other] Anybody heard of Nimrod (Programming language)?",
			"body": "A while ago I stumbled upon a programming language called Nim (previously called Nimrod). And upon looking at the tutorial documentation I must say it is a great language (something to entertain me whilst I do Python, because pure-oop approachs are confusing at points). It has type inference if you wish to use such a feature but variables can also be statically typed (as I you can tell it what type a vareiable identifier must be).\n-\nOn the Nim site is states that the compiler (as it is a compiled language) can even compile to C++ or Objective C. What does this mean? Well, that it can compile to an extremely fast prpogramming language, **C++**.\n-\nAnyway here are some links:\n\n1. [Official Nim Hoempage](http://nim-lang.org/)\n2. [Nim on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim_%28programming_language%29)\n-\nI don't know about you guys but I am definately going to be learning Nim (I started yesterday (I forgot all the stuff I learnt when first looking at Nim when I first stumbled upon it)) as a dedicated language to my _portfolio-of-programming-languages_ because hoesntly it is a great programming language.",

This is where `libtype` comes in its has function that return boolean values like `isInt(value=\"d\")` and also functions that return a string containing the name of the data type `getType(value=3)`.\n-\n##And the source code?\n-\nI am currently working on the library. It will be available very soon (tomorrow). Probably at [https://notabug.org/deavmi/libtype](https://notabug.org/deavmi/libtype). I will post a new thread onto the forum as soon as it has been completed and the source code has been uploaded to [Notabug](https://notabug.org).",

Something similar would be cool.Perhaps ZeroNet could be used to share folders accompanied with a simple web admin interface. What do you think?\n\nYes, you could try [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net). It is open-source, sadly they changed from the GPL to the MPL. Syncthing is awesome, like really awesome.
