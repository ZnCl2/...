				"body": "it doesnt. check out the `rand_idx` function. the comment is badly written so ill explain what it does.\n\n`p` is an array of probabilities for each possible output. the 3 values are always 1/3. `rand_idx` is a function that takes a list of probabilities (which add up to 1) and returns a number that says which slot was picked.\n\nwith that 1/3 setup it has an equal chance of returning 0, 1, or 2. but, somebody could change it to `double p[3] = {1./4, 1./2, 1./4};` and then it will pick paper half the time, else it has a 50/50 chance of picking either rock or scissors.\n\nby the way, one thing they left out: if you run the rock paper scissors program, play a round, close it, open it again, and play another round, youll see that the program will keep picking the same thing over and over again (im getting scissors on my machine). if you keep playing a few more rounds, youll see that it will keep picking the same things in order.\n\nthis is because the random number generator is starting in the same state. to get it to start somewhere new each time, you should check out the `srand` function. pass it a fresh value and the random number generator will start somewhere else. an easy place to get a fresh value is the `time` function, though if you run linux and you wanna get even better seeds, try the `getrandom` function.",
