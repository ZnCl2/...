  If our strategy does not explain the facts We change the facts and report changed facts , Typical mediocre approach to solving problems or making decisions.

  One need invest time in focus and clarity of thought on the issues, one deals with everyday,as soon as they mature, as otherwise  one is not
  dealing with them, but just stuck.

  Most of the funded and hence commercialized researchs domains  are heavily cannonized, breadth is treated like
  chalk and cheese and presented with cut and dry lectures, people on edge about doubts.
  one cannon means being ignorant about the rest, knowing a pardigm usually means being ignorant about its' criticism.As you are supposed to have abstracted your journey in the paradigm and the paradigm itself, before one critical
  comment of yours warrants any non-PR attention. Since most people suck at abstract thinking, they resort to
  glorified note-taking, formatting and other clerical chores in name of <b>organizing their knowledge</b> and
  so long it is productive at any level of hirarchy or status quo , instructors, managers or administrators don't care too. Each position has to be populated in proportion, to maintain the equilibria .
