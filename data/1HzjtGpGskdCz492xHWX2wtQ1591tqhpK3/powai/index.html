  These are just a few scoped e-mail conversations which correspond to a 8-10 years of my stay in Powai, since 06.
  I came there,  husteling my ways out of the logical negativist[s] and Anastas[es], I was connected to or So I thought ..
When a bump will topple me from my budding pursuit in sci-tech to the world of  manipulations, which d never
stop telling me that I am naive.

Although the bump was not an issue, as I never (over)heard a buzz about Pluto being a planet or not, I found that on my HTPC,
it has no DC++, it definitely does not have a windows.
      
It's not some polemic, I did, do and will use other mediums and devices for that.
For one evidence (not that I need  provide one) , that ship has sailed.

<expara>
  So why: </br>
  Sharing these openly, violates some the policies I d for myself.Then again, a policy is not very different from a busines.
  Once it s gone belly up.There s no pint pumping it.

It was the time when I tried to use Gmail,orkut and blogspot to keep in touch and lees frequently meeting people for real.
Back then I d no clue about e-mail tracking, bananatag or how my data is snooped or how yahoo/gmail can delete my mails w/o me telling em to,
the issue just d not comone up in any communication whatsoever and alternatives were insignificant, in comparison.

<quote>Scope links don't live more than 15 days, this is the most handy method I have to get a permanent url. </quote>

<quote>Scope works for gmail only, I am still looking a similar tool for FB messenger/Yahoomail/LinkediIN. Any hat-tips, before I write
  one on my own, will be appriciated.</quote>
<quote>This is not to say that keeping in touch was my priority.</quote>

These services had people on the other side and that d be followed by rise of new social-media as new form of expression, a butt-load
of crappy apps and devices promising to be the furture of X..

This was just like being some ministry of Delhi and being asked for your IITB ID card by some lowlife clerk with a schmuck smile on his
face. It d be so frutrating, that I d not even feel like saying, boss I did not carry one over 1.5k kms or so, give me your ID, I ll  mail
you from my college ID.

This turned out to be so overwhelmingly complicating and disappointing, that I did not take it seriously, after first few spins.
There were other fevers, that didn't give a spin to, like learning to program, building a resume,placements... 
Which I never took seriously, until I bumped in to Quora. Which furthered my apathy for these.
This d follow till I bumped in to pubnixes, I still use Quora, but why I use it, has changed.

  A boat or ship (or frieght train) engaged in the tramp trade is one which does not have a fixed schedule or published ports of call.
  Emacs uses tramp too, beauty of a tool, from what I see lies in,how working concepts of real life 
  can be implemented with it.
  Mentor@emacs is well known for HTPC stuff,but I prefer HaskellTorrent  or aria2 with xargs or for loop or seq.
  I may post a screenshot of my setup some-time.

Most feed readers I knew Greader, feedly, pulse, flipboard .. sucked (for lack of a better word).

Imm takes care of feeds.
It even lets you setup a Google Reader-like on a server.  (I may post the screenshotlater).
It's config requires one to know haskell.
It's one of the best catnip I ve seen to learn a new lang for
A  beginner,other than Emacs thet gets you to play with e-lisp, before you know it.
I mean dangling is way more clear in context of containers & class is way more cclear in context of pkgconfig.
All these run in a privilaged LXC container, namely new-container.
It lets you virtualize OS on linux kernel and works with tramp just like root (C-x C-f /lxc:/u@c:/path).
Emacs is pretty much an OS, this is to keep a distinction b/w nox time & GUI time.
I use similar package for accounting, bal sheet caclulations, not that  I prefer this  over HP-12c..
I even intend to share this container, with friends, but that may take a while, till I set the policies for long.
