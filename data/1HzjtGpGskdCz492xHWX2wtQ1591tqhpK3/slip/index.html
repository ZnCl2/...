    <para>
      Some of us, will remain so for rest of our lives,as we think that we use tools, to our convinience.
      Let's take the tool we knew and used since childhood : a clock!Analog clocks.
      We were and are even incentivized to follow it and be <b>punctual</b>
      And be honest, when did you stop taking the tick of a second's  hand for a second?
      For those who don't know yet, the second hand ticks 8 times a second! (4Hz is 8 semi-oscillations)
      This is literally the most handy and usable tool to most people from all walks of life, that I can think of, 
      Clock runs on a system, that follows some standards and cheats the system, and system[s] based on that system cheats us and
      we "use" clock for years before we notice it. If at all.
      So, clock fools the system -> system[s] fool us .That is the composition in heading.
      We are  worse with other tools , I mean why be <b>pedantic</b> about one tool that we actually use, if we can be space cadet
      about so many tools we may use, one day and babble about it over cokctails and be <b> cool</b>!
      Anyway, this is were my fascination for being pedantic about some tools begins.

    While one can easily do a lazy binary look-up for howtos of making slippers from old jeans,
    slippers are man made inspiration for structural resemblance in engineering  designs.

    Another such example could be how different types of knots inspire different lock designs and
    eventually cryptography.
    It interests me ver much, due to its' connections with knot theory.

    It is certainly more than knowing dead centers TDC vs relative to  or how crankshafts and camshafts@ O/C valve differ in converting rotary motion to linear one
    and vice verse.
