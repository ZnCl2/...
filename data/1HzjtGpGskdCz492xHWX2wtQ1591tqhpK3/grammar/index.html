<para>
  Flow is good (I am even in to irony punctuations), but breaks are imprtant to keep the flow in control, lest the flow stops being good.
  what is breaks in ops and instructions, is [semi]colon in punctuation , interrupts or step to locks in systems
  and agents of modularity in a program, like braces are.
  It helps us map and define necessary relation as and when we need to.

<expara>
  We Indians are perticularly uncomfortable,when it comes to asking for breaks,as it is seen as a sign
  of irregulairty in the trajectory. It raises questions about your commitment, focus, bandwidth.
  Banks hate them, mass recruiters hate them, colleges hate them, I mean who does not.
  Turth remains, breaks usually mean you are not rushing the exit,deal or decision, you give it a thought and may
  be checked for possible errors, before putting a <b>fullstop</b> and are less likely to look back, revise
  (or regret) it every now and then.

  I find the conntotation of moving away , associated with the word Ablative, perticularly interesting.
  It lets the word be used as a feature of/action upon  surgery, polymers, Heating,aviation , rocket engine, X-ray,
  Lasers, coating,nuanced word equivalents across the languages,

  Make no  mistake, my grammar is no good and I sporadically use fly-spell to correct spellings here.But this is where
  grammar and Panini interests me.Hence this page..
