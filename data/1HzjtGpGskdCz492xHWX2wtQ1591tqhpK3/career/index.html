    </br><para>
      Plans can be as much a scheme as with operating parameters,regulations, component schemes, principles and logic, as a TV programme or the  machines, we use everyday.
      We can repair a machine we understand, if it stops working, by cutting it open, identifying the <b>point[s] of problem</b> and fix or repalce it.
      It's not the same with plans in their conventional sense.As unlike plans, these machines are deterministic.Moreover, plans may appear to work
      for a very long time, despite being <b>broken</b> deep down and for most part only their much <b>later cut</b> matters, which is not possible without
      early stages of the plans. 
      We don't know the future, although we are not surprised often.
      Plans in their conventional sense require, no surprises (pleasent or not) i.e. a pureley deterministic scenarios, in order  to work.
      Which can't happen for a suffiently long interval and even short durations, don't kill the possibility of surpirse[s].
      And we just don't have enough information to account or model all probabilities exhaustively.Even that would have been just a model.
      It could have told the likelihood of possible outcomes, but not the upcoming outcome[s].
      But if we know all that can matter for the <b>goal</b> we set or the what we don't know, we can define a confidence interval,which accounts for the probailites we don't have.
      That way we can have some certainity, when we go through the details, identify the point[s] of problem and correcting them, if a plan does not work.
      It is a good motivation to meticulously,painstakingly modularize your plan[s], define the working principle[s],specify the limits and operating parameters and <b>most importantly not</b> 
      settng too many goals, with too many plans.As we have finite resources and limited time to correct.[1]
      It's not entierly practical , but  but more <b>real</b>. Aleternatives can be

    <quote> Setting to many goals and too many plans [B,C ...Z] and setting a meta-goal of maximum number of plans executed and mininum % of goals met, just like a throw of darts. It is opposite of [1] and sort of <b>Stalinist</b>
