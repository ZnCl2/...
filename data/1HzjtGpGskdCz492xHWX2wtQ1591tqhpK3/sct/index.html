      <para>
		  Just like ca<sup>++</sup> ion sensors or inhibtors or enzymes compete for
		  tethering to the binding sites of our protiens for cell signalling and
		  other functions of our body, as or despite the regulations of the genetic code we inherit and mutual affinity
		  (or shortage of it), just like a device tether another device that is connected to
		  network or tower by antenna, cable or something else, we oursleves compete for tethering
		  to the binding sites of various supply-chains and netwroks to stabelize, whereas they are
                  regulated (better or worse) for their own stability.

			 As any living being, I have tehered, untethered, jumped these binding sites,
			 in various names: Institutions, enrollments, community, market,job, house,
			 relationaships, transcations,trades .. list goes on, list of their side-effects
			 will be even  longer.
			 I have no intention of mentioning them as they are perticular to me.
			 FWIW, I have once tried to break free of all tethering and just hang
			 loose, off the grid, flow suspended.
			 It was comforting and awkward, until life started
			 menifesting itself in one of its' most rutheless forms I know and it
			 stayed that way, until it didn't..

		  How this can help in figuring the accounting methodology, that can work for a perticular relationship,
		  given the nature of relationship,which in turn can help in minimizing the damage overtime in both.
