    <heading>Updates</heading></br>
   <quote> A few things have changed since I wrote this article. </quote>
</quote>Snapdeal is sold to flipkart. [1]</quote>
<quote>Flipkart is sold to amazon</quote>
   <quote> Housing is sold to Prop-tiger, total funding it raised after all the noise was lees then soon to be revenues of Zomato</quote>
    <quote>Uber lost to DIDI in China.</quote>
    <quote>Ola was written down by Soft-bank, which is speculated to  have put fresh money </quote>>
    <quote>Ola is heard to have  made some new moves with electric vehicles and fresh financing I guess.. </quote>
</br>

  <para>
    Selling and storing merchandise is an inherently low-profit business. JUst like lifestyle busenesses generate revenue, but not at venture scale and hence not fundable.
    Amazon is big because it's #1 cloud computing provider, among many other reasons.
    Alibaba is still valued lower than Aamazon, despite its' high gross earnings.
    Reader may consider the case of wallmart for futher convincing, but that's enough for me.
    </para></br>
<heading>
     Market making startups : X for Y 
</heading></br>
<exheading>  I was just a few lines away from wrapping an alternative to put.io service,but I d rather not .As I ll be making a <b>just</b> a new campign for an old product. It can be exciting to a marketer, not to me </exheading></br>
<para> A wall remains a wall, no matter which color you pick to paint it.Picking one color over another is just branding it differently, <b>without</b> making anything new.
  It can be another <b> sales pitch</b> , sure. One can go a step further and make a graffitti or put few more bricks on top and call it a new kind of wall. It is, but, same wine in new bottle.</para></br>
 </br>
 <heading>On that note even Aadhar (UIADI) is not a new product</heading>
 </br><para>
   Anyone who has worked in a decent office knows that boimetric ID was the way to punch in punch out through electronic lock of the main door,even my previous office in Malad had that.It has
   been that way long before Aadhar was a buzzword.
   A different use case was concieved for the very <b>same</b> machines and BAM ! every pass could be tokenized to gate pass[s], bio IDs of entire country were to be collected in a DB , as if
   entire country is one huge office, which has stalinist overtones if heard in certain contexts. Face of an Indian corporate poster boy was used to add credibility to it and it worked.
   Even I ended up getting my Aadhar a few days ago. It was sad, but avoinding it was not worth all the trouble, thanks to the Indian system!
   </para></br>
 <expara>
    <para>
    A few lines away:
    My transmission-daemon works just fine with my etc/ssl/ & One CP query can fetch ~any movie & one line can fetch any new shows
    I may track on shores, in my ~/Downloads.
    [Tested OK]
    I d rather write a script to scrape magnets from feeds and another to  download from them with libtorrent.
      </para>
      </br>
      
      <pre>
    cd
    cd repo
    sudo python CouchPotatoServer/CouchPotato.py
    #lookup $movie on http://localhost:5050 ;click add.
    #for tv shows
    cd
    sudo python scripts/tv.py
    #all downloads start in http://localhost:9091
    </pre>
 
        
      <para>
      Even better,subscribe the tv/movie rss to newsletter<a href="#nb">&#8618;</a> & config bookmark-cmd as
    <pre>bookmark-cmd ~/box.sh</pre>,where box.sh is:</para>
    <pre>
    #!/bin/bash
    wget  "$1" -O temp.torrent ;
    sudo transmission-cli tmp.torrent; #or transmission-remote - a
    rm tmp.torrent
    </pre>
    <para>
      Now scroll to a show,hit newline key ->u key ->C+b -> newline key (thrice).
      The show will download.
    Disadvantage : no multiple downloads.
</para>
    <pre>
    To share it for FREE(or profit?) with the peers ,who are not in to all this plumbing,I d just ask them to
    http://localhost:43110/1HzjtGpGskdCz492xHWX2wtQ1591tqhpK3/tv.git
    In fact it makes and updates a torrent of the torrents downloaded in my Dropbox,if that is running.
    </pre></br>
    <expara>
      Setting up a torrent-box(for faster dls) is well instructed task.[Tested OK].
      From here its' a few lines plumbing to wrap it all in an executable or web-page.
    </expara></br>
