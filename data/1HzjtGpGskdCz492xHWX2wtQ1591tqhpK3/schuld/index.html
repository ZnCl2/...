<para>
A goal is backed by resources deployed for it and a promise is backed by future, which is unknown.
I ve learned to be explicit about telling that I am not promising, when I state a goal, as most people
pretend to not get it, so that it can work to their advantage, as they hold my

</br><para>
  <ordinal>~10</ordinal> years ago, I d wonder, what does my loc have to do with my ability to make moeny. As an <b> evidence</b> I d been making comaofrtable money wo writing a single loc.
  Fast forward, as of 2018, I wonder; in days or years to come,  if I ask someone, that I could use their private toilet, would they ask me to write some code?
  In public toilet there is fixed cost, in petrol pumps, some weirdo can <b>demand</b> your aadhar card, if he does not like you.

<expara>
  I guess certain government servents will not have to write the code, they will be able to  get a free pass. Just like they <i>can</i> get a free pass in public toilet
  or a petrol pump, even if the service guy does not like them, just like free rides, when a common man has to hitch-hike if some unfortunate emergency strikes.
  Well, good for them

  This is like your nursery days, when you had to sing a rhyme to the visitor for getting a candy later, but you folks did not have to .May be they did not need candies either, but that's secondary.

  Back then, no one would have asked you to fix their radio or TV or bicycle or bike, when you asked them if you could use their private toilet.<b>Not</b> because they were more kind, but because <b>nobody</b> would think
  that any random guy <b>can</b> fix these things.They d fear that a rookie or worse a clueless guy can <b>damage</b> the thing even more.Even the weirdest pseudo in the most capitalist state,would have preferred that you mow
his lawn in exchange, instead of letting you lay your hand on anything that <b>costed</b> him, for them he d spend some more and seek an expert.. as buying does <b> not</b> mean adopting.
  </br> But when it is code, what is there to damage? <b>Anybody can code</b>, just like anybody can dance.
</br>
  This possible universallity of everybody needing and using code and everybody able to write code, makes me draw two corollaries, <b>iff</b> it ever becomes real.

  That code will be in a position to qualify as one of the instrments to enable a transaction. Is is already being simulated over blockchains, but it is yet to be real.But then again,
  <b>what was real</b>, the man month? The quotes of wall street ? Subprime  Mortgage  landing in US back in 08 ? Software / internet bubbles? the News?</quote>
<quote>
  If above becomes real, there will be a non -trivial chance that entire idea of the <b> Money</b> was just a movement or even a  propaganda by some groups of shared interests, may be to have
a nomenclature for pricing, which could translate to the different standard and systems used over the world, may be many more reasons</quote>

  P.S.: I pushed sqlite3 DBs which log my ledgers, both <b><a href="../.fin/current.sqlite3">Current</a> </b> and <b><a href="../.fin/savings.sqlite3">Savings</a> </b>to this server.

  query these , I can log. I don't update it regularly though. It is just addusr,scale, content discovery  and UI away from twitter. </quote>
