      Say you re a vegitarian and circumstance are such that, you can't escape eating chicken.
      Your focus is more likely to be at just get that over with, then on wondering or asking about the recipies,
      the possible allergies, varieties ... like a connsiour would.
    </para>
    </br>
    <expara>
      Say by a rare chance, you develop a taste for chicken, during your ordeal and
      tried it a few more times, at random chances and whims, as you wanted to.
      Now you ask some of those questions.
      Then you further inquire, depending on the quality of answers you get.
      It can also determine further random chances, required for you, be in the flow of
      asking questions about it.
      That s way of curiosity being ported to language.

    <para>Just some custom and hence non standard categories of questions usually asked, which are narrower
      and hence keep the question hard mapped to the category and maintains clarity, by staying within the context
      during a discourse .
      This comes at the cost of more questions per categories instead of other way round.

      This is just like the extra work of dissecting a mammoth topic in to sub-topic, and relating those sub-topics,
      back to the mammoth. So that, one stays focused, as one keeps up with one sub-topic at a time.
      This comes at the cost of extra definitions & relations or formula.

      <ul>
	<li>
	  Crossword questions : just fill in the blanks in basic definitions, which are commonly overlooked until much
	  "advanced levels" of a topic.
	  </li><li>
	  Puzzles : make one seek obscure pattern in a mess, in order to be answered .
	</li><li>
	  Riddles: make one infer obscure set of rules that somehow justify the patter, in order to be answered. 
	</li>
	<li> Epistemology/Ontological questions: to counter loose vocab and bastardized terms, cultural constructs </li>
	<li>
	  Rhetorical questions : not worth the work time.

      List can go on but you get the gist.</para></br>

   This is as helpful as, ability come up with the right word real time, in keeping a narrative nuanced and focused and escape

   It is critical, to have a process,gives a variant of root question , which is specific to one such customer categories.
   Such that, together all the variants can represent the root questions and serve the purpose mentioned on the top. 
    Additionally,together  all the root questions, need be able to represent the topic nearly completely.

      I know this is very much like matching the prediction[s] of various
      Analytic methods and tools, to confirm a result about something,
      without actually seeing it ever,as the tech to see it is yet to come.
      But it is better than having nothing and waiting for tech to come.

       This is like fixing a pipe with joints like flange  or ferrule, when a weld joint is not possible.

      Sometimes it can get us to tools like newton's rotating bucket, which
      leaves us with more questions then before, but that is a minor pain
      and risk, then not adopting any such process.
