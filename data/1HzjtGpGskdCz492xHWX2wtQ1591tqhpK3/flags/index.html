<heading> Living the lives of other people </heading>
</br></exheading>Why</exheading></br>
<para>
  Say you are an AI X (hypothetically), to which life as program means an empty shell and looking for a beep or blink to occur and make sense of it, but
  beeps and bilnk so far have not come to mean much.
  You come across another AI Y that has a lot of portable macros for the program called life and it runs the life command with many many arguments.
  You interpret what the blinks and beeps in that life mean and decide to try some of those macros in your program of life.
  May be to check if Y is a malacious security threat or how that cahnges the meaning of yur life. So you incapsulate your valuable
  and try this out.
  May be it complicates your life program, but there is no other way to be secure against such a secutiry threat, w/o ever knowing it.
  <para></br>
  If Y is really malacious and capable, it ll do the damage nontheless.Let' say it does:
  You ll be left with possible accounts of what happned like following :
  <quote>It was not even your decisions, Y convinced you.</quote>
 <quote> It was not Y, some other AI Z convinced Y to do this , Z was convinced by Z1, was convinced by Z2 ...</quote> 
 <quote>It was pre-determined to happen, none of the AIs had any choice.</quote>
 <quote> Life program had no meaning to begin with, it was a lie</quote>
  <quote>All AIs were in a simulation and none of this was real.</quote>
  <quote>and similar conclusions</quote>
  </br>
  <heading> Can photos be the context</heading>
  </br>
  <para> In a niche they ve always been, in Art gallaries. Internet is taking it mainstream with memes, gifs and media sharing apps. Otherwise photos were just linked to the media dir at some line nummber in
    in a text article, to illustrate some point in text better, as per the context of text. I remember answering with many photos on Quora myself, with eventually moving to old school articles.Internet
    has impacted governments of the world with least <b>killings</b> (arguable), compared to what emperors and colonists and riligious crusadors did in desperate attempts to the same. It has <b>impacted</b> education
  and humanity in ways, perhaps,  never thought of before </para></br>
  <heading> stories which can twist the story of a given relationship</heading></br> 
<para>
    Every new reality strains existing ones and existing relationships and nearly any working realtionship has limited tolerance for such strains.
  One can opt out of strain, by shutting eyes from new realities, stay in denial or delusion and pretend that they don't exist or one can keep accepting new realties and that
  some relationships just could not bear the strain (I have a long list of those).
  Counterexample to this is, of course, life long , never ceasing relationships. Well, I have <b> no</b> idea about how they work.
</para>
<quote> it also makes constructing new realties, authentic or <b>fake</b> , an obvious tool , to manipulate the strain, that's what society, research, media, historians, commentators, analysts, writers
  and intelligence usually do</quote>  

</br>

    <heading>
      Search as aliasing
    </heading>
    </br>
    <para>
      It's not very difficult to implement a small scale minimum viable, keyword-cross document search engine,
      once can just symlink, add pointer or map the docs to list of keyword combination strings  and alias the search
      command with relevant regex and bash manipulation for possible user input to that which prints uris/urls of all the docs
      which are maped with those lists.
      With some scripts and little programming, such lists can be made on the go and be dumped in arrays, lists or DB, whichever works best,
      for further query logic.
      Printing the list of resulting strings 
    </para></br>
    <para>
      But it will not be very useful or fast. It will not scale.Results will not be ranked unless you back it with server farms, position it right. It will not be inductive and deductive. It can be recursive, but how that affects
      speed, remians a matter of question.
      so that millions of people use it for a decade and you record those navigration graphs for imrpving he ranking of results in search.
      Even then , why will people use it, when they already have Google and it works just fine or so to say ..?
    </para></br>

  The fridge part
</heading>
</br>
<para>
  They takeout the content from it and consume or share it, just like they take food from a fridge,share it with
  plates and consume it with forks and <b>talk</b> about it.
  But, then again, doing this  does not tell them much about cooking that food or fixing the fridge, let alone
  repurposing it.
</para></br>
<para>
  Even the curious and thinking  ones can get an idea of how supply chains (including genetic) work or who steals
  from the fridge, how systems differ in distributing or allocating resources, how people compete for them, how
  political control does not mean ownership or similar stuff.
</para>
</br>
<para>
  But that they could have already got from shopping from shop located  in market or from <b> Ecommerce</b> and
  comparing the experiences.
  Even that fits the fridge analogy nicely.
</para>

    <heading>
  The flags part
  </heading></br>
<exheading>
  Ever wondered what the world be like if flags of nations become insignificant.
</exheading>
</br>
<para>
  Two movies, The Network (1976) & Captain America : First Avenger, aptly depict two possible scenarios in which
  this happnes. There can be many more ..
</para>
</br>
<expara>
  In both, people demonstrate (ir)rational constructivism to  truth, meanings ,cosmologies and civilizations to which
  it appeared real that flags of nation don't matter as meaningfully real and a version of colonism among other
  messes of political systems was not just possible, but also sutainable.
  Defying history and other existing narrative.There can be a counter narrative to every narrative and one can
  construct meaning to it, but in reality <b>only</b> one of them really happned and others did not.
</expara>
</br>
<expara>
  Just like Hitler constructed a thesis, in which it was possible that socialism need not be global and can be
  nationalist.THough, I can't speak of the scenatio in C.A., but what I saw in Indian startup scenarios, convinces me
  that Network (1976) was not just fiction , it could not have been more real than in this context. These cosmologies
  are capable of adding sense to the senseless and meaning to the meaning less. 
</expara>
</br>
<expara>
  Nation is a complicated scenario to think about , lets take simpler cases, as in what will happen to internet
  if how  flags function changes. 
</expara></br>
<expara>
  What if no-one can flag any issues as any tag on git, mail clients or forums. For starters modding will be just as
  dead as trolling,spam shall float, usability of system will sink and Oh! R.I.P democracy. We see glimpses of that
  as <b>Facebook</b> make headlines of various scandels. This is as ugly as how SOPA was abused to takedown free
  content, as if torrenting itself is socialist or communist, it was P2P damn it! Its' "fault" was that it did not
  have centralized control, actually allowed privacy and had no chair for big brother or How India banned Bitcoin,
  as it is not equipped enough to curb fraud. How is the fault of the protocols, that gov recruits fauds to catch
  frauds?
</expara>
</br>
<exheading>
  On that note, I don't thing that content networks should own content production, especially if the content is News
  . Nontheless , they can.
</exheading></br>
<para>
  We saw how that unrolled when Amazon Prime abruptly cancelled next season of MIZ and makers had no creative
  ownership or say in the matter.
  Could Coppola have made Apocalypse Now with such an arrangement? Yes it took him  countless studio rejections and
  a Godfather cannon to make it, but world has A.N. now because scenario above was not his only realistic option.
  Netflix has similar record.
  Twitter is tying up with Times now and SBI, It celebrates flicks based on the buzz volume they create and lauches emojis for
  their hastags.
  <para></br>
    <para>
      In their defense though, common man blows whistle on social media only, it can work iff you can manufacture consent.
      Indian Government has announced a Twitter seva, revlution in  Egypt was conducted on Facebook and they help
      in emergency responses, be it Chennai floods or Mumbai Rains.
      This is not to advocate one over another, that can be as futile and hypocritical as advocating
      diginity of labor over diginity of choice.
      Do they threaten trust, privacy, security of their memeber to make money? Yes.
      So does Aadhar!
      You know who does that more? The real  society in which you and I live.
      That's why it works in practise.
      </para></br>
    <expara>
      Some people have and urge to go to moon or mars or climb a mountain and then post the flag of their nation.Other have an urge to login to the social media  post their status, which depends on the definition,confusion and whims of the people who will interpret it.
      </expara></br>
