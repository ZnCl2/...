	  <heading>  practical question[s]</heading></br>
	  <quote>why do we prefer iteration for computing stable fix point[s] of <div lang="latex"> x = x +
	      \frac{1}{x}</div> , but recursion for computing <div lang = "latex"> \sqrt{x}</div></quote>
	  <quote> ++ If x is complex in <div lang="latex"> x = x + \frac{1}{x}</div>, you can model fluid flow and transport phenomena with this euqation. (I am in to BLT and not TP) </quote>
	  </br><heading> Hollowness of equivalence </heading>
	  </br><para>later</para></br>
	  <quote>The Curry-ward correspondence implies that  types can be constructed that express arbitrarily complex mathematical properties.</quote>
	  <quote> If the user can supply a constructive proof that a type is inhabited (i.e., that a value of that type exists) then a compiler can check the proof and convert it into executable computer code that computes the value by carrying out the construction.</quote>
	  <quote> The proof checking feature makes dependently typed languages closely related to proof assistants. The code-generation aspect provides a powerful approach to formal program verification and proof-carrying code, since the code is derived directly from a mechanically verified mathematical proof.</quote>
	  
	  </br><heading>Coding Interviews & </heading></br>
	  <quote> Interns@startups : Even if you get them, double check if they are worth the time and effort</quote>
	  <quote>Entry level@ SM company: You mention the problems you are try to solve, they don't ask how,
	    they ask which functions and classes , not tools you use.
	    May be because they like to think about classes or OOP are more useful to the problems which are
	    relevant to them .
	  </quote>
	  <quote>Entry level@L company : They slap you with a coding excercise on something like codility even if you
	    apply for growth team. It is reasonable to some extent, as you need to code, even to get the <b>news</b>
	    right </quote>
	  <quote> Sr level @ small Co : You mention the advance concepts you ve been exploring and they ll ask you
	    to write pseudo code and may sabotage you with that as a base. </quote>
	  <exheading> Summary</exheading></br>
	  <para>Just because someone is listening, that does not mean s/he is your audience, perticularly in
	    professional scenario,odds are that s/he is judging. An interview is not sales, even a sales is not sales, in that way.It works  better to keep you best cards and points which show your capability or your trajectory,
	    to yourself, until and iff it is obvious that they are relevant. </para>
</br><pre> But if you are in a rush or it means that much to you; hustle, make money, throw parties and bore
  your guests with this.
  Can't do that,write on Internet about it or start a youtube channel.
  Can't do even that, find shaken people who d crawl to any hole and bore them , even better call it something that
  sounds nice and charge them for it, once they are back to their feet. 
  </pre>

	  <heading> Approach</heading></br>
<para>
So long as learning to code from OS <a href="../mw">was</a> concerned, writing custom dot files as I needed helped most.
 Even for understanding the nuances of perticular languages , e.g. use-package package for DOTemacs has helped me see the point[s] of
elisp or writing DOTmbsyncrc helped me in seeing why Python needed classes to talk to database for moving objects..
When it comes to recursive routines as they come in FP , I resort to circuits for representi them. 
</para>    
</br>
<expara>
On that note, I learned about classes and hence modules or frameworks, as I was writing callable bash files for a web service in Bash, nat telnet fellshort,but as I  like bash and wrote DOTashrc for it.
Calling them recursively (or not) was a matter of of understanding.

	  <exheading> The part I actually like </exheading> </br>
<expara>
  
  I am more in to analyzing DFA of a regexp for evil inputs or
  using cantor's diagonal argument to show that one can't write a program to
  spit (0,1) or halting problem, to show that there can't be a general program to
  detect errors in a given piece of c++ code or axioms for correctness be it Turing tape
  or relational algebra.
  As practical example ; I ll write regex string of package in apt remove command , instead of bash wildcards, so that it can ,say, tell 23 from 24
  as it looks up older versions of the package to be removed .
</expara>

<expara>
  If I have to find divisors, I d rather focus on combinatorics modulo,
  congruence, peano axioms,then writing a script.

  <div lang="latex">  {*} </div> is Kleene star .
  This becomes inetersting if you consider Kleene's second recursion theorem.
