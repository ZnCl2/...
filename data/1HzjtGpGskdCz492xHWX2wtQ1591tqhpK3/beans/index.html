  Jack And Jill
  fu$k up at the hill
  To fetch a pail of water
  So the beans spill
  Comes Vacuum to fill
  It can only hurt after !

  They ve <b>shared</b> the <b>event</b> private to them,in their private network, by a service run by a privately owned company, which is accountable to it's shareholders, public and state.
  How is it seen, now!

  <b> Event</b> : beans spilled.
  <b>Domain : between</b> Jack and Jill 
  Report it!
  Why?
  It has not just happned between Jack and Jill, it has happned <b> among </b> us.
  What are those beans worth?
  Question is , what are Jack an Jill worth?
  Their network is fairy  responsive.They must be something.
  But it is just beans?
  Today.Tomorrow, it can be their guts spilled.
  <b>Status</b> Event reported, as per the <b> Public</b> reporting structure and norms.
  Now there are layers and layers of <b>causation</b>.
  One must have caused the beans to spill and other must  have bore the effects. 
  Ask them who was who?
  <b> Status </b> Interrogation begins.
  They are not sure.
  Ask them to devour the drama and media.
  Now the narrative has Jack's version and Jill's version.
  Interpretaors pick which version to subtantiate and which to refute and come up with theories accordingly, ranging from god, to solar winds, to marxism,to fascism,  to slavery, to  calculus..
  <b>Status</b> Jury is still out, with all the tropes, constructing votes ...

<quote>There comes a point in crisis , almost always, when most of your friends will not appear any different from
  agents of your everyday supply chain and chaos, from hawker to hooker, to trader, to mechanic, to house help, to salesman,
  to the con, who d not pick your call once he s stuck it up on your arse.Yeah that's what it comes down to and
  most of what you romanticized , until crisis open your eyes, if at all</quote>
