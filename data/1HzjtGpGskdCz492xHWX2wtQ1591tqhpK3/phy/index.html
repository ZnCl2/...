  I still belive that, vedios, numericals,tools  and <a href="../sim">simulations</a>illustrate  physics
  better than text (esp PDFs) does.
  But I did not start a physics youtube channel and I am unlikely to, I quit teaching it for IITJEE
  ~ a decade ago. My workshop is sometime away from holding open hours

  FWIW, this is one page on the few topics I stil relate to, as they are still useful to my work
  or are the real math of the fancy term in the ever elusive job market (e.g. hamiltonian mechanics
  for KKT in  ML or linearity of expectations to finance

  Yaw, pitch and roll

  First thing that comes to mind as I think of rotation, is the newtonian bucket paradox in relativity, which
  tells us that there is no relational model of motion.
  That said, just like equivalent coordinate systems  which are casewise convinient , there are equivalent models
  of mechanics and they don't have to e relativistic, e.g. hamiltonian and lagrangian.
  Let us see how they simplify the topics in heading.
