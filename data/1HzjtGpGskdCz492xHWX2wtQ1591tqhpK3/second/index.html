    <para>
      When one implies, that one is peristent, it usually indicates that one is more persistent
      than the (less favorable) situation at hand, rather than in absolute sense of the term.
      In other words, it means, that situtaion is more temporary than one's plans.

	Unless it is seasonal, temporariness of the situation is, but an assumption.
	Which may or may not be true.
      </quote>
      <expara>
	If true, this implies volatility and makes it risky to bet on the situation.
	ALso, Changed situation does not have to be anymore favorable.
	Which makes the consequence of such persitence unpredictable.
	Even if one is executing a strategy that adapts to the situation real time.
	(assuming that there is such a thing).Induction suggests, that persistence
	is unlikely to bring different outcomes, in further instances.
	(Parlay) betting on such persistence is mostly uneconomic or even toxic and certainly risky

      Anyway, I began with teaching physics in some prep-classes, for a couple of years.
      It did not do much good except teaching me a thing or two, about addressing the amateures, if not
      engaging them.
      Thus when Pluto was popped out the category "planets",I too furthered in to amateurism, by signing up for a 5 year college program in technology.
      Those 5 years had no buzz about PLuto though!
      In a year or so I d had enough of amateurism and my need to manage projects was not that hidden.
      Traction was fine and Let's just say, that was not a good time or place for growth of orginal service and products.
      That, with my personal position,inadequacies and shortcomings, made it, sort of, blow in my face,
      in next couple of years.
      That made me begin with DIY and resolving or reducing dependencies and I got stuck many times,
      but without having to stop since then.

      Say,being in to science, I have a science task, as basic as to  enforce units of  using a
      type system, such that that my program detects units mismatch as per dimensional analyses.
      </para>
    What choices do I make?</br>
    <exapara>
      VHDL is an option too niche. That is not to say I d not opt for it. </br>
      Another way is to define units as classes [a], with instances[b] taking on unit values,
      and set up the arithmetic operator overloading [c] such that each type[d] would only
      interact with other types in its inheritance hierarchy [e].
      Now that ll not compile, if units mismatch and I mean that in a good way.
      It has 5 basic concepts and I need illustrate them > 5 times each to be clear

      So where were you on setting up my ~/.numerics ~/.scical dirs again?

	<para>
	  Don't follow protestent work ethic, so nothing against hedge funds.
	  More Proletarian than Bourgeoisie
	  Not quite there as an Aristocrat of the working class.
	  Part beatnik, so not quite a Republican.
	  I am an Indian, anyway.
	  Neither shy nor moitivated to trade or buy stocks.
	  I eat & dress according to taste and day and not as per class.
	  I mean, I must ve travelled half the country on midnight runs.

	  My priorities
	  </heading></br>
	    <para>
	      For me, as of now,  prorities mean what matters and what doesn't?
	      Which is nearly all there is to the much hyped time-management.
	      
	      Knowing that, means correcting the world-view till it's working (read knowing the
	      world better) , a broader concern that is not going away ,not matter how you go turbo.
	      That is in addition
	      to handeling the transitions, which come in the process.
	      As I see, it is more than finding some landscapes to hang your metaphorical hats.
	    </para>
	    <expara>
	      Of course, the top priority remains, to set the foot in some scene, where
	      moving it means changing something.Else, all this is just a hogwash.
	      I mean the money has to move, whether the thought does or not.

      We think of nouns, as we need to paint the hope, disappointments and whatever such things
      are inside us. People and places are not exception to this, they are just colors to the
      painting.
      I prefer B & W era.

	Any expectation in this context will be as reasonable, as expecting a stranger to be
	any better than the people you already know, just becuase you don't know him already.
	Depending on if boredom can be counted as a reason.
	It may be different near the other end of spectrum. But the question remains,
	is it worth traversing the spectrum?

      I know it, by examples that the policy of agreeeing to agree is not the way out of it.
      More often than not, it worsens the chances.Also, calrity is a matter of taste.
      And agreing to agree just becomes more difficult ones you adopt to such tastes.
      What worked for me is to figure my way out of these breadcum trails.
      Hence not speculating or expecting about it and telling these people to suite themselves.
      That has to be there, before I pitch a thing to em,if ever.

      Example #1
      
      Say you want to learn about a vast topic like culture and conduct in Japan.
      Strategy games are nothing like real war strategies and it is one of the many pieces of the topic.
      
      One way is to get at the slices of it by finding the series whichare rich in research,vocab,insights,
      opinions and portrayal of the topic, within their context.
      Do thos lazy binary lookups about the keys you find interesting on somewhere like Quora.
      Pick the pieces and put them on an empty map.
      Start connecting & relating them, till you are satisfied with your grasp on the topic.
      Write about it someplace, which motivates you to revise it.

  I can make an educated guess to why  libertarian care about gold standard
  or why liberals
  <quote>tend to be protective about social outcasts. </quote>
  <quote> hate banks </quote>
  </br>
  More importantly, I can tell, which of them are straw-man argument and when.
  
  What particularly interests me is : <br>
  Why is there a need or role of a stable political system in facilitating the experiments people do or take part in.</br>
  What is it about a political system, that drives congressional apology to something stupid it did or executive orders from
  that apology.</br>
  Weirdest type of governments, that ever existed.

  Controversial maps (esp trade routes and borders),century of humiliation (China),sick man of Europe,economic backwaters throughout

  I can make a shallow guess at why a regexp may not work for HTML, by comparing
  their grammar in terms of Chomsky hierarchy's, w/o delving in to Chomsky.
  Other than, how linguistic isolation affected Italy's competitive edge in leather(?) industry.
