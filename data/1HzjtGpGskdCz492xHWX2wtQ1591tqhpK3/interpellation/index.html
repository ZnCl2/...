    Say n people witness an incident.
    Who has the (copy)rights to document it?
    Who has the right to report it ?
    Who has the right to be reported?
    Who has the right to distribute or publish it ?
    The people who conducted the event?
    The people who watched it?
    Police? Media? State? People of the state?INstitutions of the state? Libraries? or the Internet which is yet to be neutral and balanced in what trends on it?
    How does the state being a democracy or a republic or  a capitalist one or a socialist one or a communist one affetcs that?
    Should it.

  <para>
    If industry, movements and institutions can influence what  we vouch our energies on and post-modernist ads and consumerist societies can influence what
    we spend our resulting money on , it is fairly evident that other economic and political systems must be influencing what we believe and doubt, i.e.
    in ~ any given situation, whether to step forward or to step back, i.e. at a given moment, to be a pawn or a bishop or another piece, i.e. to be more or
    less <b>safe</b>, i.e. to have to buy or bear the <b>risks</b> system tells you to .
    Now, given that most of us don't belive that system cares about what happnes to us, should not we resists these influences and be in-charges
    of our own safety, of course the way things work, does not favor it. Cost the money is interrupts and downtimes, for instance, and that of ignoring money is
    paralyses .. but should not we be trying to have a say in how safe we ought to be.For starters, one may consider taking little steps towards having a well founded
    tricky to mess with reasoning. It has it's own risks,history tells that people have built boudries from houses, to jails to iron curtain with it. Sometimes with and
    sometimes without materials. But it is the best gamble one has .

<pre> Does it solve a problem? <b>No</b>
  Does it still  matter? Yes .
  Sometimes you have to be safe in order to solve a problem
  Other times you jus have to be safe.

  This is not to ignore the possibility that an isolated section of society can function without being exploitative,
  pompouse, fake and diplomitic within and struggling with unfounded issues and theories which explain them  .
  So that it's members don't have to talk dark, sacrastic, satirical, in order to appear witty and investigative.

The single  maxim above sufficed to summarize the  he socio-political system, political system and hence drivers of administration and Governance in the custom of Adat Perpatih society of Indonasia, 
before the jkkk administration was founded there in 1961.This place has also seen the impact of the  Berkeley Mafia  .
A well defined, well founded  system of governance with clear assumptions, logic and axioms, with least contradictions is important to people and bad governance subjects the people to bad risks.

<expara>
This is not to say that such simplicity ensures that something is good or that I blindly admire everything in the custom society of Indonasia, but having born in India [1] , in a
middle class Hindu family, which was based in an upper class colony, I realize the value of such simplicity in this context and even conditionally prefer it to the strategies implied and correponded in 
the prefigurative ideologies, which inlfunced Indian society across the layers.I mean, the idea of <i>interpellation</i> is unlikely to be more obvious anywhere else, given that majority here can't tell
political control from ownership and government is formed with the vote of Majority.

Although prefigurative politcs has led to somee cool ideas be it workers controlled factory like Fasinpat or Free Breakfast for Children Program or Community land trust no profit no tax & dual ownership, run by
a board of directors [3].
