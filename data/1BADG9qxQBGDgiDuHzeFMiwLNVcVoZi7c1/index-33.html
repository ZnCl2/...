            <p>For almost 15 years Makewaves provided a unique safe space for children to publish their work on the web. For the first time pupils' work went beyond the walls of the school. They learnt new skills and confidence through self-publishing and the stories that they shared inspired us all. </p>
            <p>Makewaves’ groundbreaking work was recognised with a BETT Innovation Award in 2004 and at its peak the site had over 5,000 schools and 85,000 young people. It received BETT awards again in 2012 and 2016 with another innovation award based on the pioneering work for recognising children’s skills with Open Badges. </p>
            <p>We want to say a huge thank you to all the Teachers on Makewaves, for their unwavering commitment to celebrating and sharing the creativity happening in their classrooms - often having to find space in between the core curriculum to make this happen. And to all the young people who have thrown themselves into creating and sharing their work. Their stories and creativity have driven our efforts since the beginning. Lastly to the team of dedicated software developers, designers, educators and agents for change who went above and beyond to build the Makewaves story. We can all be proud of the journey we’ve been on and impact we’ve had together. </p>
            <p>Although Makewaves’ time has now passed, we continue to explore new ways to help people of all ages to use new technology creatively to develop their skills and connect with others.</p>
            <p>If you would like to keep up with what we’re working on now do <a href="http://info.digitalme.co.uk/subscribe?hs_preview=bbWhuCOL-5769665832">join our newsletter</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/digitalme_">follow us</a>.</p>
