But RAR files are not allowed. \n\nWell, you may search for the list of the allowed file extensions somewhere in the JS code and add the rar extension. I guess it should work.\n\nAnother forum with the uploading feature: http://127.0.0.1:43110/14Famoc8KJoS5T9WCSbzxGAmA6TfXcdSPD/\n\n> How to add functions that allow RAR file upload on a forum site ? \n\nNo idea. If you have no skills to mess with JS, the simplest solution is uploading files to http://127.0.0.1:43110/1CiXRY9ATZSoZqBzwMfXEMsKtPRt2aQoF2/ and posting links on the forum.",
