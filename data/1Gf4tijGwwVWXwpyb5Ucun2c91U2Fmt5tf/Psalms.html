      <h1>Psalms</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the
    wicked,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor stand on the path of sinners,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] but his delight is in Yahweh’s law.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">On his law he meditates day and night.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that produces its fruit in its season,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whose leaf also does not wither.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Whatever he does shall prosper.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The wicked are not so,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but are like the chaff which the wind drives
      away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the way of the wicked shall perish.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Why do the nations rage,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the peoples plot a vain thing?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The kings of the earth take a stand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the rulers take counsel together,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">against Yahweh, and against his Anointed, saying,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] “Let’s break their bonds apart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and cast their cords from us.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He who sits in the heavens will laugh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The Lord will have them in derision.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Then he will speak to them in his anger,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and terrify them in his wrath:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] “Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] I will tell of the decree.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh said to me, “You are my son.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Today I have become your father.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your
      inheritance,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the uttermost parts of the earth for your
      possession.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] You shall break them with a rod of iron.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s
      vessel.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Now therefore be wise, you kings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Be instructed, you judges of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Serve Yahweh with fear,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and rejoice with trembling.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Give sincere homage to the Son, lest he be angry, and you
      perish on the way,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for his wrath will soon be kindled.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased!<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Many are those who rise up against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Many there are who say of my soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“There is no help for him in God.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I cry to Yahweh with my voice,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he answers me out of his holy hill.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I laid myself down and slept.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who have set themselves against me on every side.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Arise, Yahweh!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Save me, my God!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For you have struck all of my enemies on the
      cheek bone.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have broken the teeth of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Salvation belongs to Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your blessing be on your people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Give me relief from my distress.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into
      dishonor?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is
      godly:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh will hear when I call to him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Stand in awe, and don’t sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Search your own heart on your bed, and be still.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Offer the sacrifices of righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Put your trust in Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Many say, “Who will show us any good?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] You have put gladness in my heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">more than when their grain and their new wine are
      increased.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you, Yahweh alone, make me live in safety.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Give ear to my words, Yahweh.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Consider my meditation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for to you do I pray.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Yahweh, in the morning you shall hear my voice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the morning I will lay my requests before you,
      and will watch expectantly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Evil can’t live with you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The arrogant shall not stand in your sight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You hate all workers of iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] You will destroy those who speak lies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I
      will come into your house.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence
      of you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my
      enemies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Make your way straight before my face.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For there is no faithfulness in their mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their heart is destruction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their throat is an open tomb.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They flatter with their tongue.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Hold them guilty, God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let them fall by their own counsels;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Thrust them out in the multitude of their
      transgressions,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for they have rebelled against you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let them always shout for joy, because you defend
      them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let them also who love your name be joyful in
      you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For you will bless the righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh, you will surround him with favor as with
      a shield.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 6</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your anger,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither discipline me in your wrath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] My soul is also in great anguish.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">But you, Yahweh—how long?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and save me for your loving kindness’ sake.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For in death there is no memory of you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In Sheol, who shall give you thanks?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I am weary with my groaning.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Every night I flood my bed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I drench my couch with my tears.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] My eye wastes away because of grief.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It grows old because of all my adversaries.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Yahweh has heard my supplication.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh accepts my prayer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced
      suddenly.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 7</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver
      me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] lest they tear apart my soul like a lion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">ripping it in pieces, while there is no one to
      deliver.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Yahweh, my God, if I have done this,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">if there is iniquity in my hands,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">(yes, if I have delivered him who without cause
      was my adversary),</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, let him tread my life down to the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and lay my glory in the dust.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Arise, Yahweh, in your anger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Lift up yourself against the rage of my
      adversaries.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Let the congregation of the peoples surround you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Rule over them on high.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and to my integrity that is in me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but establish the righteous;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">their minds and hearts are searched by the
      righteous God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] My shield is with God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who saves the upright in heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] God is a righteous judge,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, a God who has indignation every day.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] If a man doesn’t relent, he will sharpen his sword;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he has bent and strung his bow.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He has also prepared for himself the instruments of
      death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He makes ready his flaming arrows.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Behold, he travails with iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, he has conceived mischief,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and brought out falsehood.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He has dug a hole,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and has fallen into the pit which he made.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] The trouble he causes shall return to his own head.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His violence shall come down on the crown of his
      own head.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his
      righteousness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most
      High.</span><br>
    <br>

    <center>Chapter 8</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the
    earth,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">who has set your glory above the heavens!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] From the lips of babes and infants you have established
      strength,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because of your adversaries, that you might
      silence the enemy and the avenger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the moon and the stars, which you have ordained;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] what is man, that you think of him?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">What is the son of man, that you care for him?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For you have made him a little lower than God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and crowned him with glory and honor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] You make him ruler over the works of your hands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have put all things under his feet:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] All sheep and cattle,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, and the animals of the field,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The birds of the sky, the fish of the sea,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and whatever passes through the paths of the
      seas.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Yahweh, our Lord,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">how majestic is your name in all the earth!</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 9</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will tell of all your marvelous works.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I will be glad and rejoice in you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] When my enemies turn back,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they stumble and perish in your presence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For you have maintained my just cause.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You sit on the throne judging righteously.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] You have rebuked the nations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have destroyed the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have blotted out their name forever and ever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The very memory of the cities which you have
      overthrown has perished.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But Yahweh reigns forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has prepared his throne for judgment.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He will judge the world in righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will administer judgment to the peoples in
      uprightness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a high tower in times of trouble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Those who know your name will put their trust in you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek
      you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in Zion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and declare among the people what he has done.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For he who avenges blood remembers them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He doesn’t forget the cry of the afflicted.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Have mercy on me, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">See my affliction by those who hate me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and lift me up from the gates of death;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] that I may show all of your praise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the gates of the daughter of Zion, I will
      rejoice in your salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the net which they hid, their own foot is

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Yahweh has made himself known.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has executed judgment.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The wicked is snared by the work of his own
      hands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Meditation. Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even all the nations that forget God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] For the needy shall not always be forgotten,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor the hope of the poor perish forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Arise, Yahweh! Don’t let man prevail.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let the nations be judged in your sight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Put them in fear, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let the nations know that they are only men.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Why do you stand far off, Yahweh?<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are caught in the schemes that they devise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He blesses the greedy, and condemns Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The wicked, in the pride of his face,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">has no room in his thoughts for God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] His ways are prosperous at all times.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is haughty, and your laws are far from his
      sight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For generations I shall have no trouble.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He lies in wait near the villages.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">From ambushes, he murders the innocent.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He lies in wait to catch the helpless.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He catches the helpless, when he draws him in his
      net.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The helpless are crushed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They collapse.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They fall under his strength.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] He says in his heart, “God has forgotten.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He hides his face.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will never see it.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Arise, Yahweh!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">God, lift up your hand!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t forget the helpless.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Why does the wicked person condemn God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into
      account?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] But you do see trouble and grief.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You consider it to take it into your hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You help the victim and the fatherless.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Break the arm of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness
      until you find none.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Yahweh is King forever and ever!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The nations will perish out of his land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will prepare their heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will cause your ear to hear,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] to judge the fatherless and the oppressed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.</span><br>

    <br>

    <center>Chapter 11</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] In Yahweh, I take refuge.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to
      your mountain!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For, behold, the wicked bend their bows.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They set their arrows on the strings,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] If the foundations are destroyed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">what can the righteous do?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Yahweh is in his holy temple.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh is on his throne in heaven.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His eyes observe.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His eyes examine the children of men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Yahweh examines the righteous,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the wicked and him who loves violence his
      soul hates.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] On the wicked he will rain blazing coals;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the
      portion of their cup.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For Yahweh is righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He loves righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The upright shall see his face.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">For the faithful fail from among the children of
      men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Everyone lies to his neighbor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They speak with flattering lips, and with a
      double heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the tongue that boasts,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Our lips are our own.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who is lord over us?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] “Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the
      groaning of the needy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will now arise,” says Yahweh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“I will set him in safety from those who malign
      him.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Yahweh’s words are flawless words,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified
      seven times.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] You will keep them, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will preserve them from this generation
      forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The wicked walk on every side,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when what is vile is exalted among the sons of
      men.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] How long, Yahweh?<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Will you forget me forever?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">How long will you hide your face from me?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] How long shall I take counsel in my soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">having sorrow in my heart every day?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">How long shall my enemy triumph over me?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him”;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] But I trust in your loving kindness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My heart rejoices in your salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I will sing to Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because he has been good to me.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”<br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are corrupt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They have done abominable works.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is no one who does good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to see if there were any who understood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who sought after God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] They have all gone aside.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They have together become corrupt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is no one who does good, no, not one.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who eat up my people as they eat bread,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t call on Yahweh?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] There they were in great fear,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for God is in the generation of the righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] You frustrate the plan of the poor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because Yahweh is his refuge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be

    <span class="line indent0">Who shall live on your holy hill?</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">and speaks truth in his heart;</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He who doesn’t slander with his tongue,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor does evil to his friend,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor casts slurs against his fellow man;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] In whose eyes a vile man is despised,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but who honors those who fear Yahweh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and
      doesn’t change;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor take a bribe against the innocent.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who does these things shall never be shaken.</span><br>

    <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Preserve me, God, for in you do I take refuge.<br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] My soul, you have said to Yahweh, “You are my Lord.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Apart from you I have no good thing.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] As for the saints who are in the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they are the excellent ones in whom is all my
      delight.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to
      another god.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor take their names on my lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You made my lot secure.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, I have a good inheritance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] I will bless Yahweh, who has given me counsel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] I have set Yahweh always before me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be
      moved.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My body shall also dwell in safety.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For you will not leave my soul in Sheol,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will you allow your holy one to see
      corruption.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] You will show me the path of life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In your presence is fullness of joy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In your right hand there are pleasures forever

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Hear, Yahweh, my righteous plea;<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Give ear to my prayer, that doesn’t go out of
      deceitful lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Let my sentence come out of your presence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let your eyes look on equity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] You have proved my heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have visited me in the night.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have tried me, and found nothing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] As for the works of men, by the word of your lips,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] My steps have held fast to your paths.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My feet have not slipped.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I have called on you, for you will answer me, God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Turn your ear to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Hear my speech.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Show your marvelous loving kindness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">you who save those who take refuge by your right
      hand from their enemies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Keep me as the apple of your eye.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Hide me under the shadow of your wings,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] from the wicked who oppress me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my deadly enemies, who surround me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] They close up their callous hearts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">With their mouth they speak proudly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They have now surrounded us in our steps.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Arise, Yahweh, confront him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Cast him down.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] from men by your hand, Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from men of the world, whose portion is in this
      life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You fill the belly of your cherished ones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your sons have plenty,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they store up wealth for their children.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing
      your form.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I love you, Yahweh, my strength.<br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I am saved from my enemies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The cords of death surrounded me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The cords of Sheol were around me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The snares of death came on me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] In my distress I called on Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and cried to my God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He heard my voice out of his temple.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My cry before him came into his ears.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Then the earth shook and trembled.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The foundations also of the mountains quaked and
      were shaken,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because he was angry.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Smoke went out of his nostrils.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Consuming fire came out of his mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Coals were kindled by it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He bowed the heavens also, and came down.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Thick darkness was under his feet.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He rode on a cherub, and flew.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around
      him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">hailstones and coals of fire.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Yahweh also thundered in the sky.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The Most High uttered his voice:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">hailstones and coals of fire.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] He sent out his arrows, and scattered them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, great lightning bolts, and routed them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Then the channels of waters appeared.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The foundations of the world were laid bare at
      your rebuke, Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He sent from on high.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He took me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He drew me out of many waters.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He delivered me from my strong enemy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from those who hated me; for they were too mighty
      for me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] They came on me in the day of my calamity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but Yahweh was my support.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] He brought me out also into a large place.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">According to the cleanness of my hands has he
      recompensed me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] For I have kept the ways of Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] For all his ordinances were before me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I didn’t put away his statutes from me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] I was also blameless with him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I kept myself from my iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my
      righteousness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">according to the cleanness of my hands in his
      eyesight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">With the perfect man, you will show yourself
      perfect.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] With the pure, you will show yourself pure.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] For you will save the afflicted people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the haughty eyes you will bring down.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] For you will light my lamp, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My God will light up my darkness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] For by you, I advance through a troop.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">By my God, I leap over a wall.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] As for God, his way is perfect.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh’s word is tried.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is a shield to all those who take refuge in
      him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] For who is God, except Yahweh?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who is a rock, besides our God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way
      perfect?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] He makes my feet like deer’s feet,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and sets me on my high places.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] He teaches my hands to war,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] You have also given me the shield of your salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your right hand sustains me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your gentleness has made me great.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] You have enlarged my steps under me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My feet have not slipped.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Neither will I turn again until they are
      consumed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] I will strike them through, so that they will not be able
      to rise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They shall fall under my feet.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] For you have armed me with strength to the battle.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have subdued under me those who rose up
      against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that I might cut off those who hate me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] They cried, but there was no one to save;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even to Yahweh, but he didn’t answer them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I cast them out as the mire of the streets.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] You have delivered me from the strivings of the people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have made me the head of the nations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] The foreigners shall fade away,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and shall come trembling out of their close
      places.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Exalted be the God of my salvation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] even the God who executes vengeance for me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and subdues peoples under me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] He rescues me from my enemies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up
      against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You deliver me from the violent man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the
      nations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will sing praises to your name.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] He gives great deliverance to his king,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and shows loving kindness to his anointed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to David and to his seed, forever more.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The heavens declare the glory of God.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">The expanse shows his handiwork.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Day after day they pour out speech,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and night after night they display knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] There is no speech nor language,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">where their voice is not heard.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Their voice has gone out through all the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">their words to the end of the world.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In them he has set a tent for the sun,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] His going out is from the end of the heavens,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his circuit to its ends;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is nothing hidden from its heat.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Yahweh’s law is perfect, restoring the soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh’s testimony is sure, making wise the
      simple.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Yahweh’s precepts are right, rejoicing the heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh’s commandment is pure, enlightening the
      eyes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh’s ordinances are true, and righteous
      altogether.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much
      fine gold;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">sweeter also than honey and the extract of the
      honeycomb.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Moreover by them is your servant warned.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In keeping them there is great reward.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Who can discern his errors?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Forgive me from hidden errors.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let them not have dominion over me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Then I will be upright.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will be blameless and innocent of great
      transgression.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">be acceptable in your sight,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on
      high,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] send you help from the sanctuary,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">grant you support from Zion,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] remember all your offerings,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] May He grant you your heart’s desire,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] We will triumph in your salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the name of our God, we will set up our

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will answer him from his holy heaven,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with the saving strength of his right hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Some trust in chariots, and some in horses,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but we trust the name of Yahweh our God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] They are bowed down and fallen,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Save, Yahweh!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let the King answer us when we call!</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">How greatly he rejoices in your salvation!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] You have given him his heart’s desire,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have not withheld the request of his lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For you meet him with the blessings of goodness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You set a crown of fine gold on his head.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He asked life of you, you gave it to him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even length of days forever and ever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] His glory is great in your salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You lay honor and majesty on him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For you make him most blessed forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You make him glad with joy in your presence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For the king trusts in Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Through the loving kindness of the Most High, he
      shall not be moved.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Your hand will find out all of your enemies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your right hand will find out those who hate you.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your

    <span class="line indent0">The fire shall devour them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] You will destroy their descendants from the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">their posterity from among the children of men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For they intended evil against you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They plotted evil against you which cannot
      succeed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For you will make them turn their back,</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Why are you so far from helping me, and from the
      words of my groaning?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don’t answer;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the night season, and am not silent.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] But you are holy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">you who inhabit the praises of Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Our fathers trusted in you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They trusted, and you delivered them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] They cried to you, and were delivered.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They trusted in you, and were not disappointed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] But I am a worm, and no man;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a reproach of men, and despised by the people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] All those who see me mock me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They insult me with their lips. They shake their
      heads, saying,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] “He trusts in Yahweh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">let him deliver him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let him rescue him, since he delights in him.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] But you brought me out of the womb.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You made me trust at my mother’s breasts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I was thrown on you from my mother’s womb.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You are my God since my mother bore me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Don’t be far from me, for trouble is near.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For there is no one to help.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Many bulls have surrounded me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] They open their mouths wide against me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">lions tearing prey and roaring.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I am poured out like water.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All my bones are out of joint.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My heart is like wax;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">it is melted within me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] My strength is dried up like a potsherd.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have brought me into the dust of death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For dogs have surrounded me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A company of evildoers have enclosed me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They have pierced my hands and feet.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] I can count all of my bones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They look and stare at me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] They divide my garments among them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They cast lots for my clothing.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] But don’t be far off, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You are my help: hurry to help me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Deliver my soul from the sword,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my precious life from the power of the dog.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Save me from the lion’s mouth!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, from the horns of the wild oxen, you have
      answered me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] I will declare your name to my brothers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the midst of the assembly, I will praise you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] You who fear Yahweh, praise him!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All you descendants of Jacob, glorify him!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of
      Israel!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of
      the afflicted,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Neither has he hidden his face from him;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but when he cried to him, he heard.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Of you comes my praise in the great assembly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will pay my vows before those who fear him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] The humble shall eat and be satisfied.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They shall praise Yahweh who seek after him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let your hearts live forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to
      Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All the relatives of the nations shall worship

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] For the kingdom is Yahweh’s.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Don’t let my enemies triumph over me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Yes, no one who waits for you shall be shamed.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Remember me according to your loving kindness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for your goodness’ sake, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Good and upright is Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">therefore he will instruct sinners in the way.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He will guide the humble in justice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will teach the humble his way.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] All the paths of Yahweh are loving kindness and truth</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Oh keep my soul, and deliver me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let me not be disappointed, for I take refuge in
      you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Try my heart and my mind.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">neither will I go in with hypocrites.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I hate the assembly of evildoers,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I will wash my hands in innocence,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Don’t gather my soul with sinners,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] in whose hands is wickedness,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Redeem me, and be merciful to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] My foot stands in an even place.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Yahweh is my light and my salvation.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Whom shall I fear?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh is the strength of my life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Of whom shall I be afraid?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] When evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled
      and fell.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Though an army should encamp against me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my heart shall not fear.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Though war should rise against me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even then I will be confident.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] One thing I have asked of Yahweh, that I will seek after,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that I may dwell in Yahweh’s house all the days
      of my life,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to see Yahweh’s beauty,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and to inquire in his temple.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his
      pavilion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the covert of his tabernacle he will hide me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will lift me up on a rock.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh.</span><br>
    <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Hear, Yahweh, when I cry with my voice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Have mercy also on me, and answer me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] When you said, “Seek my face,”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my heart said to you, “I will seek your face,
      Yahweh.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Don’t hide your face from me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t put your servant away in anger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have been my help.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t abandon me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither forsake me, God of my salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] When my father and my mother forsake me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">then Yahweh will take me up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Teach me your way, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Lead me in a straight path, because of my
      enemies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Don’t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for false witnesses have risen up against me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">such as breathe out cruelty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] I am still confident of this:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of
      the living.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh, be my helper.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] You have turned my mourning into dancing for me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me
      with gladness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] To the end that my heart may sing praise to you, and not
      be silent.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh my God, I will give thanks to you forever!</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] In you, Yahweh, I take refuge.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let me never be disappointed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Deliver me in your righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Bow down your ear to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Deliver me speedily.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Be to me a strong rock,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a house of defense to save me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For you are my rock and my fortress,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">therefore for your name’s sake lead me and guide
      me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for
      me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you are my stronghold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Into your hand I commend my spirit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You redeem me, Yahweh, God of truth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I hate those who regard lying vanities,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but I trust in Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you have seen my affliction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have known my soul in adversities.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have set my feet in a large place.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am in distress.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My eye, my soul, and my body waste away with
      grief.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For my life is spent with sorrow,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my years with sighing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My strength fails because of my iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My bones are wasted away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly
      contemptible to my neighbors,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A fear to my acquaintances.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Those who saw me on the street fled from me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I am like broken pottery.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] For I have heard the slander of many, terror on every
      side,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">while they conspire together against me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they plot to take away my life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] But I trust in you, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I said, “You are my God.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] My times are in your hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from
      those who persecute me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Make your face to shine on your servant.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Save me in your loving kindness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Let me not be disappointed, Yahweh, for I have called on
      you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let the wicked be disappointed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let them be silent in Sheol.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Let the lying lips be mute,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which speak against the righteous insolently,
      with pride and contempt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Oh how great is your goodness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which you have laid up for those who fear you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which you have worked for those who take refuge
      in you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">before the sons of men!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] In the shelter of your presence you will hide them from
      the plotting of man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will keep them secretly in a dwelling away
      from the strife of tongues.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Praise be to Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he has shown me his marvelous loving kindness
      in a strong city.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] As for me, I said in my haste, “I am cut off from before
      your eyes.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Nevertheless you heard the voice of my petitions
      when I cried to you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Oh love Yahweh, all you his saints!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh preserves the faithful,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and fully recompenses him who behaves arrogantly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Be strong, and let your heart take courage,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">all you who hope in Yahweh.</span><br>
    <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Blessed is he whose disobedience is forgiven,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">whose sin is covered.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn’t impute iniquity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in whose spirit there is no deceit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my
      groaning all day long.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For day and night your hand was heavy on me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My strength was sapped in the heat of summer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I acknowledged my sin to you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I didn’t hide my iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I said, I will confess my transgressions to
      Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time
      when you may be found.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall
      not reach to him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] You are my hiding place.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will preserve me from trouble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will surround me with songs of deliverance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you
      shall go.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will counsel you with my eye on you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Don’t be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no
      understanding,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else
      they will not come near to you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Many sorrows come to the wicked,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts
      in Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 33</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Rejoice in Yahweh, you righteous!<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Praise is fitting for the upright.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Sing to him a new song.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Play skillfully with a shout of joy!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For Yahweh’s word is right.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All his work is done in faithfulness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] He loves righteousness and justice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The earth is full of the loving kindness of
      Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] By Yahweh’s word, the heavens were made;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">all their army by the breath of his mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He lays up the deeps in storehouses.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Let all the earth fear Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe
      of him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For he spoke, and it was done.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He commanded, and it stood firm.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no
      effect.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The counsel of Yahweh stands fast forever,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the people whom he has chosen for his own
      inheritance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Yahweh looks from heaven.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He sees all the sons of men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the
      inhabitants of the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] he who fashions all of their hearts;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he considers all of their works.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] There is no king saved by the multitude of an army.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] A horse is a vain thing for safety,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither does he deliver any by his great power.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Behold, Yahweh’s eye is on those who fear him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">on those who hope in his loving kindness;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] to deliver their soul from death,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to keep them alive in famine.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Our soul has waited for Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is our help and our shield.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] For our heart rejoices in him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because we have trusted in his holy name.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Let your loving kindness be on us, Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">since we have hoped in you.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 34</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I will bless Yahweh at all times.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">His praise will always be in my mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] My soul shall boast in Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The humble shall hear of it, and be glad.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Oh magnify Yahweh with me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let us exalt his name together.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I sought Yahweh, and he answered me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and delivered me from all my fears.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] They looked to him, and were radiant.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their faces shall never be covered with shame.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] This poor man cried, and Yahweh heard him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and saved him out of all his troubles.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Yahweh’s angel encamps around those who fear him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and delivers them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Oh fear Yahweh, you his saints,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for there is no lack with those who fear him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but those who seek Yahweh shall not lack any good
      thing.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Come, you children, listen to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will teach you the fear of Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Who is someone who desires life,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and loves many days, that he may see good?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Keep your tongue from evil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your lips from speaking lies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Depart from evil, and do good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">seek peace, and pursue it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Yahweh’s eyes are toward the righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His ears listen to their cry.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Yahweh’s face is against those who do evil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to cut off their memory from the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The righteous cry, and Yahweh hears,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and delivers them out of all their troubles.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and saves those who have a crushed spirit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Many are the afflictions of the righteous,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but Yahweh delivers him out of them all.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] He protects all of his bones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Not one of them is broken.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Evil shall kill the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Those who hate the righteous shall be condemned.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">None of those who take refuge in him shall be
      condemned.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Contend, Yahweh, with those who contend with me.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Fight against those who fight against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Take hold of shield and buckler,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and stand up for my help.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Tell my soul, “I am your salvation.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and
      brought to dishonor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let those who plot my ruin be turned back and
      confounded.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Let them be as chaff before the wind,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh’s angel driving them on.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Let their way be dark and slippery,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh’s angel pursuing them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for
      me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Let destruction come on him unawares.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let his net that he has hidden catch himself.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let him fall into that destruction.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] My soul shall be joyful in Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It shall rejoice in his salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] All my bones shall say, “Yahweh, who is like you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who delivers the poor from him who is too strong
      for him;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, the poor and the needy from him who robs
      him?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Unrighteous witnesses rise up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They ask me about things that I don’t know about.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] They reward me evil for good,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to the bereaving of my soul.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was
      sackcloth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I afflicted my soul with fasting.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My prayer returned into my own bosom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my
      brother.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his
      mother.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] But in my adversity, they rejoiced, and gathered
      themselves together.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The attackers gathered themselves together
      against me, and I didn’t know it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They tore at me, and didn’t cease.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Like the profane mockers in feasts,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they gnashed their teeth at me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Lord, how long will you look on?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Rescue my soul from their destruction,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my precious life from the lions.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] I will give you thanks in the great assembly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will praise you among many people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Don’t let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice
      over me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither let those who hate me without a cause
      wink their eyes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] For they don’t speak peace,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but they devise deceitful words against those who
      are quiet in the land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They said, “Aha! Aha! Our eye has seen it!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] You have seen it, Yahweh. Don’t keep silent.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Lord, don’t be far from me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Wake up! Rise up to defend me, my God!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My Lord, contend for me!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Vindicate me, Yahweh my God, according to your
      righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t let them gloat over me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Don’t let them say in their heart, “Aha! That’s the way
      we want it!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t let them say, “We have swallowed him up!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Let them be disappointed and confounded together who
      rejoice at my calamity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who
      magnify themselves against me.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Let them shout for joy and be glad, who favor my
      righteous cause.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, let them say continually, “Yahweh be
      magnified,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who has pleasure in the prosperity of his
      servant!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about
      your praise all day long.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] An oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the
    wicked:<br>
    <span class="line indent0">“There is no fear of God before his eyes.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For he flatters himself in his own eyes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">too much to detect and hate his sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has ceased to be wise and to do good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He plots iniquity on his bed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He sets himself in a way that is not good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He doesn’t abhor evil.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Your righteousness is like the mountains of God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your judgments are like a great deep.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh, you preserve man and animal.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] How precious is your loving kindness, God!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The children of men take refuge under the shadow
      of your wings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of
      your house.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will make them drink of the river of your
      pleasures.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For with you is the spring of life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In your light shall we see light.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your righteousness to the upright in heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Don’t let the foot of pride come against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t let the hand of the wicked drive me away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] There the workers of iniquity are fallen.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are thrust down, and shall not be able to
      rise.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 37</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Don’t fret because of evildoers,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither be envious against those who work
      unrighteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and wither like the green herb.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Trust in Yahweh, and do good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Also delight yourself in Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he will give you the desires of your heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Commit your way to Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Trust also in him, and he will do this:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] he will make your righteousness go out as the light,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your justice as the noon day sun.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t fret because of him who prospers in his
      way,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because of the man who makes wicked plots happen.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Cease from anger, and forsake wrath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t fret, it leads only to evildoing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For evildoers shall be cut off,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but those who wait for Yahweh shall inherit the
      land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, though you look for his place, he isn’t
      there.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] But the humble shall inherit the land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and shall delight themselves in the abundance of
      peace.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The wicked plots against the just,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and gnashes at him with his teeth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The Lord will laugh at him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he sees that his day is coming.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their
      bow,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to cast down the poor and needy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to kill those who are upright on the path.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Their sword shall enter into their own heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their bows shall be broken.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Better is a little that the righteous has,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than the abundance of many wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but Yahweh upholds the righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Yahweh knows the days of the perfect.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their inheritance shall be forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] But the wicked shall perish.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of
      the fields.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will vanish—</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">vanish like smoke.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] The wicked borrow, and don’t pay back,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the righteous give generously.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] A man’s goings are established by Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He delights in his way.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Though he stumble, he shall not fall,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for Yahweh holds him up with his hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] I have been young, and now am old,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor his children begging for bread.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] All day long he deals graciously, and lends.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His seed is blessed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Depart from evil, and do good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Live securely forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] For Yahweh loves justice,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and doesn’t forsake his saints.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are preserved forever,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] The righteous shall inherit the land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and live in it forever.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His tongue speaks justice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] The law of his God is in his heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">None of his steps shall slide.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] The wicked watches the righteous,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and seeks to kill him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] Yahweh will not leave him in his hand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor condemn him when he is judged.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he will exalt you to inherit the land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] I have seen the wicked in great power,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">spreading himself like a green tree in its native
      soil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] But he passed away, and behold, he was not.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] Mark the perfect man, and see the upright,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for there is a future for the man of peace.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The future of the wicked shall be cut off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] Yahweh helps them, and rescues them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He rescues them from the wicked, and saves them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Because they have taken refuge in him.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your wrath,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For your arrows have pierced me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your hand presses hard on me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] There is no soundness in my flesh because of your
      indignation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither is there any health in my bones because
      of my sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For my iniquities have gone over my head.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] My wounds are loathsome and corrupt,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because of my foolishness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I am pained and bowed down greatly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I go mourning all day long.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For my waist is filled with burning.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is no soundness in my flesh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] I am faint and severely bruised.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my
      heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Lord, all my desire is before you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My groaning is not hidden from you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] My heart throbs.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My strength fails me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My kinsmen stand far away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] They also who seek after my life lay snares.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and meditate deceits all day long.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] But I, as a deaf man, don’t hear.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I am as a mute man who doesn’t open his mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Yes, I am as a man who doesn’t hear,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in whose mouth are no reproofs.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] For in you, Yahweh, do I hope.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will answer, Lord my God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For I said, “Don’t let them gloat over me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For I am ready to fall.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My pain is continually before me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] For I will declare my iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will be sorry for my sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] But my enemies are vigorous and many.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Those who hate me without reason are numerous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] They who also render evil for good are adversaries to me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because I follow what is good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Don’t forsake me, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My God, don’t be far from me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Hurry to help me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Lord, my salvation.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 39</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I said, “I will watch my ways, so that I don’t sin with my
    tongue.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the
      wicked is before me.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I was mute with silence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I held my peace, even from good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My sorrow was stirred.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] My heart was hot within me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">While I meditated, the fire burned:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I spoke with my tongue:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] “Yahweh, show me my end,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">what is the measure of my days.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let me know how frail I am.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Behold, you have made my days hand breadths.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My lifetime is as nothing before you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Surely every man stands as a breath.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] “Surely every man walks like a shadow.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Surely they busy themselves in vain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He heaps up, and doesn’t know who shall gather.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Now, Lord, what do I wait for?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My hope is in you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Deliver me from all my transgressions.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t make me the reproach of the foolish.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] I was mute.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I didn’t open my mouth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because you did it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Remove your scourge away from me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I am overcome by the blow of your hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You consume his wealth like a moth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Surely every man is but a breath.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] “Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and give ear to my cry.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t be silent at my tears.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For I am a stranger with you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a foreigner, as all my fathers were.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">before I go away, and exist no more.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 40</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I waited patiently for Yahweh.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">He turned to me, and heard my cry.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He brought me up also out of a horrible pit,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">out of the miry clay.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He set my feet on a rock,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and gave me a firm place to stand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in
      Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and doesn’t respect the proud, nor such as turn
      aside to lies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Many, Yahweh, my God, are the wonderful works which you
      have done,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your thoughts which are toward us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They can’t be declared back to you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If I would declare and speak of them, they are
      more than can be numbered.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have opened my ears.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have not required burnt offering and sin
      offering.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Then I said, “Behold, I have come.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It is written about me in the book in the scroll.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] I delight to do your will, my God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, your law is within my heart.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great
      assembly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Behold, I will not seal my lips, Yahweh, you
      know.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have declared your faithfulness and your
      salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have not concealed your loving kindness and
      your truth from the great assembly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Don’t withhold your tender mercies from me, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let your loving kindness and your truth
      continually preserve me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For innumerable evils have surrounded me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not
      able to look up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are more than the hairs of my head.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My heart has failed me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Be pleased, Yahweh, to deliver me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Hurry to help me, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek
      after my soul to destroy it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let them be turned backward and brought to
      dishonor who delight in my hurt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell
      me, “Aha! Aha!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let such as love your salvation say continually,
      “Let Yahweh be exalted!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] But I am poor and needy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">May the Lord think about me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You are my help and my deliverer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t delay, my God.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Blessed is he who considers the poor.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Yahweh will preserve him, and keep him alive.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He shall be blessed on the earth,</span><br>

      enemies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and restore him from his bed of illness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I said, “Yahweh, have mercy on me!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Heal me, for I have sinned against you.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] My enemies speak evil against me:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“When will he die, and his name perish?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His heart gathers iniquity to itself.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When he goes abroad, he tells it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] All who hate me whisper together against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They imagine the worst for me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] “An evil disease”, they say, “has afflicted him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Now that he lies he shall rise up no more.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who ate bread with me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">has lifted up his heel against me.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me, and raise me up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that I may repay them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] By this I know that you delight in me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because my enemy doesn’t triumph over me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] As for me, you uphold me in my integrity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and set me in your presence forever.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from everlasting and to everlasting!</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] We have heard with our ears, God;<br>

    <span class="line indent0">in the days of old.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] You drove out the nations with your hand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but you planted them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You afflicted the peoples,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but you spread them abroad.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own
      sword,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither did their own arm save them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but your right hand, and your arm, and the light
      of your face,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because you were favorable to them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] You are my King, God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Command victories for Jacob!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Through you, will we push down our adversaries.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But you have saved us from our adversaries,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have shamed those who hate us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] In God we have made our boast all day long,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t go out with our armies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] You make us turn back from the adversary.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Those who hate us take plunder for themselves.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] You have made us like sheep for food,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have scattered us among the nations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] You sell your people for nothing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have gained nothing from their sale.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] You make us a reproach to our neighbors,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a scoffing and a derision to those who are around
      us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] You make us a byword among the nations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a shaking of the head among the peoples.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] All day long my dishonor is before me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and shame covers my face,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] At the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because of the enemy and the avenger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] All this has come on us,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet have we not forgotten you,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0">neither have our steps strayed from your path,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and covered us with the shadow of death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] If we have forgotten the name of our God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or spread out our hands to a strange god;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] won’t God search this out?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For he knows the secrets of the heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Wake up!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Why do you sleep, Lord?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Arise!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t reject us forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Why do you hide your face,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and forget our affliction and our oppression?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] For our soul is bowed down to the dust.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Our body clings to the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Rise up to help us.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] You are the most excellent of the sons of men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Grace has anointed your lips,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">therefore God has blessed you forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Strap your sword on your thigh, mighty one:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your splendor and your majesty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth,

    <span class="line indent0">Let your right hand display awesome deeds.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Your arrows are sharp.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The nations fall under you, with arrows in the

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Your throne, God, is forever and ever.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have

    <span class="line indent0">Her clothing is interwoven with gold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] She shall be led to the king in embroidered work.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They shall enter into the king’s palace.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Your sons will take the place of your fathers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You shall make them princes in all the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] I will make your name to be remembered in all
      generations.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">He is a great King over all the earth.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] They saw it, then they were amazed.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">They hurried away.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] both low and high,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I will incline my ear to a proverb.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Those who trust in their wealth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and boast in the multitude of their riches—</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] none of them can by any means redeem his brother,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] For the redemption of their life is costly,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Their inward thought is that their houses will endure
      forever,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">They name their lands after themselves.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] But man, despite his riches, doesn’t endure.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is like the animals that perish.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For when he dies he shall carry nothing away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His glory shall not descend after him.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Though while he lived he blessed his soul—</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">It is very stormy around him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He calls to the heavens above,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] “Gather my saints together to me,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For every animal of the forest is mine,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the livestock on a thousand hills.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I know all the birds of the mountains.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The wild animals of the field are mine.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">“What right do you have to declare my statutes,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] You have done these things, and I kept silent.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You thought that I was just like you.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies

    <span class="line indent0">You have no pleasure in burnt offering.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] There they were in great fear, where no fear was,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for God has scattered the bones of him who
      encamps against you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have put them to shame,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because God has rejected them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When God brings back his people from captivity,</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Save me, God, by your name.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Vindicate me in your might.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Hear my prayer, God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Listen to the words of my mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For strangers have risen up against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Violent men have sought after my soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They haven’t set God before them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Behold, God is my helper.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The Lord is the one who sustains my soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] He will repay the evil to my enemies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Destroy them in your truth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will give thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it
      is good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For he has delivered me out of all trouble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My eye has seen triumph over my enemies.</span><br>
    <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Listen to my prayer, God.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t hide yourself from my supplication.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Attend to me, and answer me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I am restless in my complaint, and moan,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Because of the voice of the enemy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Because of the oppression of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For they bring suffering on me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In anger they hold a grudge against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] My heart is severely pained within me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The terrors of death have fallen on me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Fearfulness and trembling have come on me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Horror has overwhelmed me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I said, “Oh that I had wings like a dove!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Then I would fly away, and be at rest.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Behold, then I would wander far off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I would lodge in the wilderness.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] “I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and
      storm.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Day and night they prowl around on its walls.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Malice and abuse are also within her.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Destructive forces are within her.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Threats and lies don’t depart from her streets.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For it was not an enemy who insulted me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">then I could have endured it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself
      up against me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">then I would have hidden myself from him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] But it was you, a man like me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my companion, and my familiar friend.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] We took sweet fellowship together.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We walked in God’s house with company.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Let death come suddenly on them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let them go down alive into Sheol.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For wickedness is in their dwelling, in their
      midst.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] As for me, I will call on God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh will save me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in
      distress.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will hear my voice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was
      against me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">although there are many who oppose me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] God, who is enthroned forever,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">will hear, and answer them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0">They never change,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who don’t fear God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] He raises his hands against his friends.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has violated his covenant.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] His mouth was smooth as butter,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but his heart was war.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His words were softer than oil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet they were drawn swords.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Cast your burden on Yahweh, and he will sustain you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will never allow the righteous to be moved.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of
      destruction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out
      half their days,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">In anger cast down the peoples, God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] You number my wanderings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You put my tears into your bottle.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] In God, I will praise his word.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In Yahweh, I will praise his word.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I have put my trust in God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not be afraid.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Be exalted, God, above the heavens!</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] No, in your heart you plot injustice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You measure out the violence of your hands in the

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] The wicked go astray from the womb.</span><br>

      Lord our shield.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Consume them in wrath.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] At evening let them return.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let them howl like a dog, and go around the city.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] They shall wander up and down for food,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and wait all night if they aren’t satisfied.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">For you have been my high tower,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] You have shown your people hard things.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Give us help against the adversary,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Listen to my prayer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] From the end of the earth, I will call to you, when my

    <span class="line indent0">Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For you have been a refuge for me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a strong tower from the enemy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I will dwell in your tent forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">You have given me the heritage of those who fear
      your name.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] You will prolong the king’s life;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his years shall be for generations.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] My soul rests in God alone.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">My salvation is from him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress—</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will never be greatly shaken.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">would all of you throw him down,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They delight in lies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They bless with their mouth, but they curse
      inwardly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] My soul, wait in silence for God alone,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for my expectation is from him.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not be shaken.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] With God is my salvation and my honor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in
      God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Trust in him at all times, you people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Pour out your heart before him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">God is a refuge for us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Surely men of low degree are just a breath,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and men of high degree are a lie.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the balances they will go up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are together lighter than a breath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Don’t trust in oppression.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t become vain in robbery.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If riches increase,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">don’t set your heart on them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Because your loving kindness is better than life,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">I will lift up my hands in your name.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] You brought us into prison.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You laid a burden on our backs.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] I cried to him with my mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He was extolled with my tongue.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] If I cherished sin in my heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the Lord wouldn’t have listened.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">her feathers with shining gold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] When the Almighty scattered kings in her,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">it snowed on Zalmon.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The mountains of Bashan are rugged.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Why do you look in envy, you rugged mountains,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">at the mountain where God chooses to reign?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, Yahweh will dwell there forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands
      of thousands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The Lord is among them, from Sinai, into the
      sanctuary.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] You have ascended on high.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have led away captives.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have received gifts among men,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, among the rebellious also, that Yah God
      might dwell there.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burdens,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even the God who is our salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] God is to us a God of deliverance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">To Yahweh, the Lord, belongs escape from death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] But God will strike through the head of his enemies,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues
      in his guiltiness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] The Lord said, “I will bring you again from Bashan,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will bring you again from the depths of the
      sea;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] That you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that the tongues of your dogs may have their
      portion from your enemies.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] They have seen your processions, God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even the processions of my God, my King, into the
      sanctuary.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] The singers went before, the minstrels followed after,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the midst of the ladies playing with
      tambourines,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] “Bless God in the congregations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even the Lord in the assembly of Israel!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] There is little Benjamin, their ruler,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the princes of Judah, their council,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of
      Naphtali.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Your God has commanded your strength.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Strengthen, God, that which you have done for us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Because of your temple at Jerusalem,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">kings shall bring presents to you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of
      the peoples.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Being humbled, may it bring bars of silver.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Scatter the nations that delight in war.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Princes shall come out of Egypt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to
      God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Sing praises to the Lord!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] To him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of
      old;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">behold, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Ascribe strength to God!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His excellency is over Israel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his strength is in the skies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] You are awesome, God, in your sanctuaries.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The God of Israel gives strength and power to his

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Save me, God,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the waters have come up to my neck!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have come into deep waters, where the floods
      overflow me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I am weary with my crying.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My throat is dry.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My eyes fail, looking for my God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs
      of my head.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies
      wrongfully, are mighty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have to restore what I didn’t take away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] God, you know my foolishness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My sins aren’t hidden from you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Don’t let those who wait for you be shamed through me,
      Lord Yahweh of Armies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t let those who seek you be brought to
      dishonor through me, God of Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Because for your sake, I have borne reproach.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Shame has covered my face.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] I have become a stranger to my brothers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">an alien to my mother’s children.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For the zeal of your house consumes me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The reproaches of those who reproach you have
      fallen on me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] When I wept and I fasted,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that was to my reproach.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] When I made sackcloth my clothing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I became a byword to them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Those who sit in the gate talk about me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I am the song of the drunkards.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an
      acceptable time.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">God, in the abundance of your loving kindness,
      answer me in the truth of your salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Deliver me out of the mire, and don’t let me sink.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and
      out of the deep waters.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Don’t let the flood waters overwhelm me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither let the deep swallow me up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t let the pit shut its mouth on me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving kindness is good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">According to the multitude of your tender
      mercies, turn to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Don’t hide your face from your servant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for I am in distress.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Answer me speedily!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Draw near to my soul, and redeem it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Ransom me because of my enemies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My adversaries are all before you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I looked for some to take pity, but there was
      none;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for comforters, but I found none.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] They also gave me gall for my food.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Let their table before them become a snare.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">May it become a retribution and a trap.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can’t see.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let their backs be continually bent.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Pour out your indignation on them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Let their habitation be desolate.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let no one dwell in their tents.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] For they persecute him whom you have wounded.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have
      hurt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Charge them with crime upon crime.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t let them come into your righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Let them be blotted out of the book of life,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and not be written with the righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] But I am in pain and distress.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let your salvation, God, protect me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] I will praise the name of God with a song,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] It will please Yahweh better than an ox,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or a bull that has horns and hoofs.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] The humble have seen it, and are glad.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You who seek after God, let your heart live.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] For Yahweh hears the needy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and doesn’t despise his captive people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Let heaven and earth praise him;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the seas, and everything that moves therein!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They shall settle there, and own it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] The children also of his servants shall inherit it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Those who love his name shall dwell therein.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Turn your ear to me, and save me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Give the command to save me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you are my rock and my fortress.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my confidence from my youth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I have relied on you from the womb.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You are he who took me out of my mother’s womb.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Don’t forsake me when my strength fails.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0">and will add to all of your praise.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">the poor, who has no helper.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He will have pity on the poor and needy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will save the souls of the needy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their blood will be precious in his sight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] They shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
      Sheba.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Men shall pray for him continually.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They shall bless him all day long.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Abundance of grain shall be throughout the land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Its fruit sways like Lebanon.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let it flourish, thriving like the grass of the
      field.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] His name endures forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His name continues as long as the sun.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Men shall be blessed by him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All nations will call him blessed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of Israel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who alone does marvelous deeds.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Blessed be his glorious name forever!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let the whole earth be filled with his glory!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Amen and amen.</span><br>
    <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Surely God is good to Israel,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">to those who are pure in heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] But as for me, my feet were almost gone.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My steps had nearly slipped.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For I was envious of the arrogant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For there are no struggles in their death,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but their strength is firm.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] They are free from burdens of men,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither are they plagued like other men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Violence covers them like a garment.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Their eyes bulge with fat.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their minds pass the limits of conceit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] They scoff and speak with malice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In arrogance, they threaten oppression.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] They have set their mouth in the heavens.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their tongue walks through the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Therefore their people return to them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they drink up waters of abundance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They say, “How does God know?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Is there knowledge in the Most High?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Behold, these are the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Being always at ease, they increase in riches.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and washed my hands in innocence,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For all day long have I been plagued,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and punished every morning.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] If I had said, “I will speak thus”;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">behold, I would have betrayed the generation of
      your children.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] When I tried to understand this,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">it was too painful for me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Until I entered God’s sanctuary,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and considered their latter end.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Surely you set them in slippery places.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You throw them down to destruction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] How they are suddenly destroyed!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are completely swept away with terrors.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] As a dream when one wakes up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so, Lord, when you awake, you will despise their
      fantasies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] For my soul was grieved.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I was embittered in my heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] I was so senseless and ignorant.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I was a brute beast before you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Nevertheless, I am continually with you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have held my right hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] You will guide me with your counsel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and afterward receive me to glory.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Whom do I have in heaven?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is no one on earth whom I desire besides
      you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] My flesh and my heart fails,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but God is the strength of my heart and my
      portion forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful
      to you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] But it is good for me to come close to God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that I may tell of all your works.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 74</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] God, why have you rejected us forever?<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of
      your pasture?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your
      inheritance;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Mount Zion, in which you have lived.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">all the evil that the enemy has done in the
      sanctuary.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Your adversaries have roared in the midst of your
      assembly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They have set up their standards as signs.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] They behaved like men wielding axes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">cutting through a thicket of trees.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and
      hammers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They have burned your sanctuary to the ground.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They have profaned the dwelling place of your
      Name.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] They said in their heart, “We will crush them completely.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They have burned up all the places in the land
      where God was worshiped.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] We see no miraculous signs.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is no longer any prophet,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither is there among us anyone who knows how
      long.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] How long, God, shall the adversary reproach?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Take it out of your pocket and consume them!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Yet God is my King of old,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">working salvation in the midst of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] You divided the sea by your strength.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the
      waters.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You gave him as food to people and desert
      creatures.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] You opened up spring and stream.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You dried up mighty rivers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] The day is yours, the night is also yours.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have prepared the light and the sun.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] You have set all the boundaries of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have made summer and winter.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Foolish people have blasphemed your name.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Don’t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t forget the life of your poor forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Honor your covenant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for haunts of violence fill the dark places of
      the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let the poor and needy praise your name.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Arise, God! Plead your own cause.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Don’t forget the voice of your adversaries.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The tumult of those who rise up against you
      ascends continually.</span><br>
    <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] We give thanks to you, God.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">We give thanks, for your Name is near.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Men tell about your wondrous works.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] When I choose the appointed time,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will judge blamelessly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] The earth and all its inhabitants quake.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I firmly hold its pillars.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Don’t lift up your horn on high.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t speak with a stiff neck.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For neither from the east, nor from the west,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But God is the judge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He puts down one, and lifts up another.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">full of foaming wine mixed with spices.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He pours it out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it
      to its very dregs.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] But I will declare this forever:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted
      up.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] In Judah, God is known.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">His name is great in Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] His tabernacle is also in Salem;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His dwelling place in Zion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of
      war.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Glorious are you, and excellent,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">more than mountains of game.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Valiant men lie plundered,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they have slept their last sleep.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">None of the men of war can lift their hands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] At your rebuke, God of Jacob,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">both chariot and horse are cast into a deep
      sleep.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] You, even you, are to be feared.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] You pronounced judgment from heaven.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The earth feared, and was silent,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] when God arose to judgment,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to save all the afflicted ones of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Surely the wrath of man praises you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The survivors of your wrath are restrained.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Make vows to Yahweh your God, and fulfill them!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him
      who is to be feared.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] He will cut off the spirit of princes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is feared by the kings of the earth.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] My cry goes to God!<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Indeed, I cry to God for help,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and for him to listen to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My hand was stretched out in the night, and
      didn’t get tired.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My soul refused to be comforted.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I remember God, and I groan.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] You hold my eyelids open.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I am so troubled that I can’t speak.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I have considered the days of old,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the years of ancient times.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I remember my song in the night.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I consider in my own heart;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my spirit diligently inquires:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] “Will the Lord reject us forever?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Will he be favorable no more?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Has his loving kindness vanished forever?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Does his promise fail for generations?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Has God forgotten to be gracious?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Then I thought, “I will appeal to this:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the years of the right hand of the Most High.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I will remember Yah’s deeds;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for I will remember your wonders of old.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I will also meditate on all your work,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and consider your doings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">What god is great like God?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] You are the God who does wonders.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have made your strength known among the
      peoples.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] You have redeemed your people with your arm,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the sons of Jacob and Joseph.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] The waters saw you, God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The waters saw you, and they writhed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The depths also convulsed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The clouds poured out water.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The skies resounded with thunder.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your arrows also flashed around.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The lightnings lit up the world.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The earth trembled and shook.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Your way was through the sea;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your paths through the great waters.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your footsteps were not known.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] You led your people like a flock,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">and our fathers have told us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] We will not hide them from their children,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">telling to the generation to come the praises of
      Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his strength, and his wondrous works that he has
      done.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For he established a testimony in Jacob,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and appointed a teaching in Israel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which he commanded our fathers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that they should make them known to their
      children;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] that the generation to come might know, even the children
      who should be born;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who should arise and tell their children,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] that they might set their hope in God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and not forget the works of God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but keep his commandments,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] and might not be as their fathers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a stubborn and rebellious generation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">turned back in the day of battle.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] They didn’t keep God’s covenant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and refused to walk in his law.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They forgot his doings,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his wondrous works that he had shown them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He made the waters stand as a heap.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and all night with a light of fire.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He split rocks in the wilderness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and gave them drink abundantly as out of the
      depths.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He brought streams also out of the rock,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and caused waters to run down like rivers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Yet they still went on to sin against him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] They tempted God in their heart</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">by asking food according to their desire.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Yes, they spoke against God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They said, “Can God prepare a table in the
      wilderness?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and streams overflowed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Can he give bread also?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Will he provide flesh for his people?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A fire was kindled against Jacob,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">anger also went up against Israel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] because they didn’t believe in God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and didn’t trust in his salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Yet he commanded the skies above,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and opened the doors of heaven.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] He rained down manna on them to eat,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and gave them food from the sky.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Man ate the bread of angels.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He sent them food to the full.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">By his power he guided the south wind.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] He rained also flesh on them as the dust;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">winged birds as the sand of the seas.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] He let them fall in the midst of their camp,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">around their habitations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] So they ate, and were well filled.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He gave them their own desire.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] They didn’t turn from their cravings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their food was yet in their mouths,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] when the anger of God went up against them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">killed some of their fattest,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and struck down the young men of Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] For all this they still sinned,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their years in terror.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] When he killed them, then they inquired after him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They returned and sought God earnestly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] They remembered that God was their rock,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the Most High God, their redeemer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] But they flattered him with their mouth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and lied to him with their tongue.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] For their heart was not right with him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither were they faithful in his covenant.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t
      destroy them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, many times he turned his anger away,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and didn’t stir up all his wrath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] He remembered that they were but flesh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and grieved him in the desert!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] They turned again and tempted God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] They didn’t remember his hand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor the day when he redeemed them from the
      adversary;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] how he set his signs in Egypt,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his wonders in the field of Zoan,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] he turned their rivers into blood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their streams, so that they could not drink.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and frogs, which destroyed them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] He gave also their increase to the caterpillar,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their labor to the locust.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] He destroyed their vines with hail,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">their sycamore fig trees with frost.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] He gave over their livestock also to the hail,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">wrath, indignation, and trouble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a band of angels of evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] He made a path for his anger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He didn’t spare their soul from death,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but gave their life over to the pestilence,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[51] and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[52] But he led out his own people like sheep,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[53] He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[54] He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[55] He also drove out the nations before them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">allotted them for an inheritance by line,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their
      tents.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[56] Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and didn’t keep his testimonies;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[57] but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their
      fathers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[58] For they provoked him to anger with their high places,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and moved him to jealousy with their engraved
      images.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[59] When God heard this, he was angry,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and greatly abhorred Israel;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[60] So that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the tent which he placed among men;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[61] and delivered his strength into captivity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his glory into the adversary’s hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[62] He also gave his people over to the sword,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and was angry with his inheritance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[63] Fire devoured their young men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their virgins had no wedding song.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[64] Their priests fell by the sword,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their widows couldn’t weep.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[65] Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[66] He struck his adversaries backward.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He put them to a perpetual reproach.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[67] Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[68] But chose the tribe of Judah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Mount Zion which he loved.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[69] He built his sanctuary like the heights,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like the earth which he has established forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[70] He also chose David his servant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and took him from the sheepfolds;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[71] from following the ewes that have their young,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his
      people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Israel, his inheritance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[72] So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of
      his heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] God, the nations have come into your inheritance.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">They have defiled your holy temple.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be
      food for the birds of the sky,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the flesh of your saints to the animals of the
      earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There was no one to bury them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] We have become a reproach to our neighbors,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a scoffing and derision to those who are around
      us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] How long, Yahweh?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Will you be angry forever?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Will your jealousy burn like fire?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For they have devoured Jacob,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and destroyed his homeland.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let your tender mercies speedily meet us,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for we are in desperate need.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s
      sake.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let it be known among the nations, before our
      eyes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being
      poured out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">According to the greatness of your power,
      preserve those who are sentenced to death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">their reproach with which they have reproached
      you, Lord.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] So we, your people and sheep of your pasture,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">will give you thanks forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We will praise you forever, to all generations.</span><br>

      your people?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] You have fed them with the bread of tears,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and given them tears to drink in large measure.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] You make us a source of contention to our neighbors.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] You brought a vine out of Egypt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You drove out the nations, and planted it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] You cleared the ground for it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It took deep root, and filled the land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The mountains were covered with its shadow.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Its boughs were like God’s cedars.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] It sent out its branches to the sea,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Its shoots to the River.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Why have you broken down its walls,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The boar out of the wood ravages it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The wild animals of the field feed on it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this
      vine,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] the stock which your right hand planted,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the branch that you made strong for yourself.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] It’s burned with fire.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] There shall be no strange god in you,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I am Yahweh, your God,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Israel desired none of me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that they might walk in their own counsels.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Oh that my people would listen to me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that Israel would walk in my ways!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I would soon subdue their enemies,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and turn my hand against their adversaries.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their punishment would last forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] But he would have also fed them with the finest of the

    <span class="line indent0">While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Your fierce wrath has gone over me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your terrors have cut me off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] They came around me like water all day long.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They completely engulfed me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] You have put lover and friend far from me,</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I will sing of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">With my mouth, I will make known your
      faithfulness to all generations.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I indeed declare, “Love stands firm forever.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] “I have made a covenant with my chosen one,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like
      Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] You rule the pride of the sea.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When its waves rise up, you calm them.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have scattered your enemies with your mighty

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] You have a mighty arm.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your hand is strong, and your right hand is
      exalted.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your

    <span class="line indent0">Loving kindness and truth go before your face.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] In your name they rejoice all day.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In your righteousness, they are exalted.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For you are the glory of their strength.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In your favor, our horn will be exalted.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] I have found David, my servant.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] He will call to me, ‘You are my Father,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] I will also appoint him my firstborn,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the highest of the kings of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] I will keep my loving kindness for him forever more.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My covenant will stand firm with him.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] If his children forsake my law,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t walk in my ordinances;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] if they break my statutes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t keep my commandments;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] then I will punish their sin with the rod,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their iniquity with stripes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] But I will not completely take my loving kindness from

    <span class="line indent0">nor allow my faithfulness to fail.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] I will not break my covenant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor alter what my lips have uttered.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] Once have I sworn by my holiness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not lie to David.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] His seed will endure forever,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] It will be established forever like the moon,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the faithful witness in the sky.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] But you have rejected and spurned.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have been angry with your anointed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] You have renounced the covenant of your servant.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have defiled his crown in the dust.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] You have broken down all his hedges.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have brought his strongholds to ruin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] All who pass by the way rob him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has become a reproach to his neighbors.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have made all of his enemies rejoice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and haven’t supported him in battle.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] You have ended his splendor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and thrown his throne down to the ground.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] You have shortened the days of his youth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have covered him with shame.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Will you hide yourself forever?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Will your wrath burn like fire?</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which you swore to David in your faithfulness?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Lord, you have been our dwelling place for all generations.<br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Before the mountains were born,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">before you had formed the earth and the world,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even from everlasting to everlasting, you are
      God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] You turn man to destruction, saying,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Return, you children of men.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday
      when it is past,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like a watch in the night.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] You sweep them away as they sleep.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the morning they sprout like new grass.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] In the morning it sprouts and springs up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">By evening, it is withered and dry.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For we are consumed in your anger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We are troubled in your wrath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] You have set our iniquities before you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">our secret sins in the light of your presence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For all our days have passed away in your wrath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We bring our years to an end as a sigh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The days of our years are seventy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or even by reason of strength eighty years;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet their pride is but labor and sorrow,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for it passes quickly, and we fly away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Who knows the power of your anger,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your wrath according to the fear that is due to
      you?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] So teach us to number our days,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that we may gain a heart of wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Relent, Yahweh!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">How long?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Have compassion on your servants!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for as many years as we have seen evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Let your work appear to your servants;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your glory to their children.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">establish the work of our hands for us;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, establish the work of our hands.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and from the deadly pestilence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He will cover you with his feathers.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0">nor of the arrow that flies by day;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] A thousand may fall at your side,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">but it will not come near you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] You will only look with your eyes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and see the recompense of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Because you have made Yahweh your refuge,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] no evil shall happen to you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For he will put his angels in charge of you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to guard you in all your ways.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] They will bear you up in their hands,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so that you won’t dash your foot against a stone.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] You will tread on the lion and cobra.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will trample the young lion and the serpent
      underfoot.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0">I will set him on high, because he has known my
      name.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He will call on me, and I will answer him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will be with him in trouble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will deliver him, and honor him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] I will satisfy him with long life,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will triumph in the works of your hands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] How great are your works, Yahweh!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your thoughts are very deep.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For, behold, your enemies, Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for, behold, your enemies shall perish.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All the evildoers will be scattered.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Rise up, you judge of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Pay back the proud what they deserve.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Yahweh, how long will the wicked,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">how long will the wicked triumph?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] They pour out arrogant words.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All the evildoers boast.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] They break your people in pieces, Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and afflict your heritage.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] They kill the widow and the alien,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and murder the fatherless.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They say, “Yah will not see,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Consider, you senseless among the people;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">you fools, when will you be wise?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He who implanted the ear, won’t he hear?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who formed the eye, won’t he see?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He who disciplines the nations, won’t he punish?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who teaches man knows.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Yahweh knows the thoughts of man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that they are futile.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and teach out of your law;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] that you may give him rest from the days of adversity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">until the pit is dug for the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For Yahweh won’t reject his people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will he forsake his inheritance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] For judgment will return to righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All the upright in heart shall follow it.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Unless Yahweh had been my help,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my soul would have soon lived in silence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] When I said, “My foot is slipping!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your loving kindness, Yahweh, held me up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] In the multitude of my thoughts within me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your comforts delight my soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which brings about mischief by statute?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] They gather themselves together against the soul of the
      righteous,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and condemn the innocent blood.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] But Yahweh has been my high tower,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my God, the rock of my refuge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] He has brought on them their own iniquity,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] In his hand are the deep places of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The heights of the mountains are also his.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The sea is his, and he made it.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Forty long years I was grieved with that generation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and said, “It is a people that errs in their

    <span class="line indent0">They have not known my ways.”</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For I have eaten ashes like bread,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and mixed my drink with tears,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Because of your indignation and your wrath,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you have taken me up, and thrown me away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] My days are like a long shadow.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have withered like grass.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] But you, Yahweh, will remain forever;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your renown endures to all generations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] You will arise and have mercy on Zion;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for it is time to have pity on her.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, the set time has come.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For your servants take pleasure in her stones,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have pity on her dust.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] So the nations will fear Yahweh’s name;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">all the kings of the earth your glory.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For Yahweh has built up Zion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has appeared in his glory.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He has responded to the prayer of the destitute,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and has not despised their prayer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] This will be written for the generation to come.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A people which will be created will praise Yah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">From heaven, Yahweh saw the earth;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] to hear the groans of the prisoner;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to free those who are condemned to death;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] that men may declare Yahweh’s name in Zion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his praise in Jerusalem;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] when the peoples are gathered together,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the kingdoms, to serve Yahweh.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] He weakened my strength along the course.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He shortened my days.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] I said, “My God, don’t take me away in the midst of my
      days.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your years are throughout all generations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The heavens are the work of your hands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] They will perish, but you will endure.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will change them like a cloak, and they will
      be changed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] But you are the same.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your years will have no end.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] The children of your servants will continue.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their seed will be established before you.”</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Praise Yahweh, my soul!<br>
    <span class="line indent0">All that is within me, praise his holy name!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Praise Yahweh, my soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t forget all his benefits;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] who forgives all your sins;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who heals all your diseases;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] who redeems your life from destruction;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who crowns you with loving kindness and tender

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] who satisfies your desire with good things,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Yahweh executes righteous acts,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and justice for all who are oppressed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] He made known his ways to Moses,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his deeds to the children of Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Yahweh is merciful and gracious,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He will not always accuse;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will he stay angry forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He has not dealt with us according to our sins,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor repaid us for our iniquities.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For as the heavens are high above the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so great is his loving kindness toward those who
      fear him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] As far as the east is from the west,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so far has he removed our transgressions from us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Like a father has compassion on his children,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so Yahweh has compassion on those who fear him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For he knows how we are made.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He remembers that we are dust.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] As for man, his days are like grass.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For the wind passes over it, and it is gone.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Its place remembers it no more.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] But Yahweh’s loving kindness is from everlasting to
      everlasting with those who fear him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his righteousness to children’s children;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0">to those who remember to obey his precepts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Bless Yahweh, my soul.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh, my God, you are very great.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You are clothed with honor and majesty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He covers himself with light as with a garment.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He lays the beams of his rooms in the waters.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He makes the clouds his chariot.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He walks on the wings of the wind.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He makes his messengers winds;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his servants flames of fire.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] He laid the foundations of the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that it should not be moved forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] You covered it with the deep as with a cloak.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The waters stood above the mountains.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] At your rebuke they fled.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">At the voice of your thunder they hurried away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The mountains rose,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the valleys sank down,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to the place which you had assigned to them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] You have set a boundary that they may not pass over;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that they don’t turn again to cover the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He sends springs into the valleys.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They run among the mountains.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They give drink to every animal of the field.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The wild donkeys quench their thirst.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The birds of the sky nest by them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They sing among the branches.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He waters the mountains from his rooms.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] He causes the grass to grow for the livestock,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and plants for man to cultivate,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that he may produce food out of the earth:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] wine that makes glad the heart of man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">oil to make his face to shine,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and bread that strengthens man’s heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Yahweh’s trees are well watered,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] where the birds make their nests.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The stork makes its home in the fir trees.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] The high mountains are for the wild goats.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] He appointed the moon for seasons.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The sun knows when to set.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] You make darkness, and it is night,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in which all the animals of the forest prowl.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] The young lions roar after their prey,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and seek their food from God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] The sun rises, and they steal away,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and lay down in their dens.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Man goes out to his work,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to his labor until the evening.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Yahweh, how many are your works!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In wisdom have you made them all.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The earth is full of your riches.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] There is the sea, great and wide,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in which are innumerable living things,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">both small and large animals.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] There the ships go,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and leviathan, whom you formed to play there.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] These all wait for you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that you may give them their food in due season.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] You give to them; they gather.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You open your hand; they are satisfied with good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] You hide your face: they are troubled;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">you take away their breath: they die, and return
      to the dust.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] You send out your Spirit and they are created.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You renew the face of the ground.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Let Yahweh rejoice in his works.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] He looks at the earth, and it trembles.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He touches the mountains, and they smoke.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will sing praise to my God while I have any

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He has remembered his covenant forever,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the word which he commanded to a thousand
      generations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] the covenant which he made with Abraham,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his oath to Isaac,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to Israel for an everlasting covenant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the lot of your inheritance”;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] when they were but a few men in number,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, very few, and foreigners in it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] They went about from nation to nation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from one kingdom to another people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] He allowed no one to do them wrong.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] “Don’t touch my anointed ones!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Do my prophets no harm!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He called for a famine on the land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He destroyed the food supplies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He sent a man before them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Joseph was sold for a slave.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] They bruised his feet with shackles.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His neck was locked in irons,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] until the time that his word happened,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Yahweh’s word proved him true.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] The king sent and freed him;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] He made him lord of his house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and ruler of all of his possessions;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] to discipline his princes at his pleasure,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and to teach his elders wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Israel also came into Egypt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Jacob lived in the land of Ham.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] He increased his people greatly,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and made them stronger than their adversaries.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] He turned their heart to hate his people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to conspire against his servants.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] He sent Moses, his servant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Aaron, whom he had chosen.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] They performed miracles among them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and wonders in the land of Ham.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] He sent darkness, and made it dark.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They didn’t rebel against his words.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] He turned their waters into blood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and killed their fish.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Their land swarmed with frogs,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even in the rooms of their kings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] He spoke, and swarms of flies came,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and lice in all their borders.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] He gave them hail for rain,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with lightning in their land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] He struck their vines and also their fig trees,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and shattered the trees of their country.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] He spoke, and the locusts came,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the grasshoppers, without number,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] ate up every plant in their land;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and ate up the fruit of their ground.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] He struck also all the firstborn in their land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the first fruits of all their manhood.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] He brought them out with silver and gold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There was not one feeble person among his tribes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] Egypt was glad when they departed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the fear of them had fallen on them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] He spread a cloud for a covering,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">fire to give light in the night.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] They asked, and he brought quails,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] He opened the rock, and waters gushed out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They ran as a river in the dry places.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] For he remembered his holy word,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Abraham, his servant.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] He brought his people out with joy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his chosen with singing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] He gave them the lands of the nations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They took the labor of the peoples in possession,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] that they might keep his statutes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and observe his laws.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Praise Yah!</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 106</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Praise Yahweh!<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for his loving kindness endures forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or fully declare all his praise?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Blessed are those who keep justice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Blessed is one who does what is right at all
      times.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your
      people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Visit me with your salvation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] that I may see the prosperity of your chosen,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that I may rejoice in the gladness of your
      nation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that I may glory with your inheritance.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] We have sinned with our fathers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We have committed iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We have done wickedly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving
      kindnesses,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red
      Sea.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that he might make his mighty power known.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so he led them through the depths, as through a
      desert.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The waters covered their adversaries.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There was not one of them left.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Then they believed his words.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They sang his praise.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] They soon forgot his works.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They didn’t wait for his counsel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] but gave in to craving in the desert,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and tested God in the wasteland.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He gave them their request,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but sent leanness into their soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] They envied Moses also in the camp,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Aaron, Yahweh’s saint.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and covered the company of Abiram.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] A fire was kindled in their company.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The flame burned up the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] They made a calf in Horeb,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and worshiped a molten image.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Thus they exchanged their glory</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for an image of a bull that eats grass.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] They forgot God, their Savior,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who had done great things in Egypt,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Wondrous works in the land of Ham,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and awesome things by the Red Sea.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Therefore he said that he would destroy them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in
      the breach,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t
      destroy them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Yes, they despised the pleasant land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They didn’t believe his word,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] but murmured in their tents,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and didn’t listen to Yahweh’s voice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Therefore he swore to them</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] that he would overthrow their seed among the nations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and scatter them in the lands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] They joined themselves also to Baal Peor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The plague broke in on them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so the plague was stopped.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] That was credited to him for righteousness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for all generations to come.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] because they were rebellious against his spirit,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he spoke rashly with his lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] They didn’t destroy the peoples,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as Yahweh commanded them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] but mixed themselves with the nations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and learned their works.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] They served their idols,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which became a snare to them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to
      demons.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] They shed innocent blood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even the blood of their sons and of their
      daughters,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The land was polluted with blood.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] Thus were they defiled with their works,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and prostituted themselves in their deeds.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He abhorred his inheritance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] He gave them into the hand of the nations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Those who hated them ruled over them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] Their enemies also oppressed them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They were brought into subjection under their
      hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] Many times he delivered them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but they were rebellious in their counsel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and were brought low in their iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] Nevertheless he regarded their distress,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when he heard their cry.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] He remembered for them his covenant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and repented according to the multitude of his
      loving kindnesses.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] He made them also to be pitied</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">by all those who carried them captive.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] Save us, Yahweh, our God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">gather us from among the nations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to give thanks to your holy name,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to triumph in your praise!</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from everlasting even to everlasting!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let all the people say, “Amen.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Praise Yah!</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 107</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Give thanks to Yahweh,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he is good,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for his loving kindness endures forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whom he has redeemed from the hand of the
      adversary,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] And gathered out of the lands,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from the east and from the west,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from the north and from the south.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They found no city to live in.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Hungry and thirsty,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">their soul fainted in them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he delivered them out of their distresses,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] he led them also by a straight way,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that they might go to a city to live in.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For he satisfies the longing soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He fills the hungry soul with good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">being bound in affliction and iron,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] because they rebelled against the words of God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and condemned the counsel of the Most High.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Therefore he brought down their heart with labor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They fell down, and there was no one to help.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he saved them out of their distresses.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and broke away their chains.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For he has broken the gates of brass,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and cut through bars of iron.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and because of their iniquities.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Their soul abhors all kinds of food.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They draw near to the gates of death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he saves them out of their distresses.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] He sends his word, and heals them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and delivers them from their graves.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and declare his works with singing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Those who go down to the sea in ships,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who do business in great waters;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] These see Yahweh’s works,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his wonders in the deep.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] For he commands, and raises the stormy wind,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which lifts up its waves.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the
      depths.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their soul melts away because of trouble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and are at their wits’ end.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he brings them out of their distress.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] He makes the storm a calm,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so that its waves are still.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Then they are glad because it is calm,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so he brings them to their desired haven.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for his wonderful works for the children of men!</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and praise him in the seat of the elders.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] He turns rivers into a desert,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">water springs into a thirsty ground,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] and a fruitful land into a salt waste,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] He turns a desert into a pool of water,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a dry land into water springs.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] There he makes the hungry live,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that they may prepare a city to live in,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] sow fields, plant vineyards,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and reap the fruits of increase.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied
      greatly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He doesn’t allow their livestock to decrease.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] Again, they are diminished and bowed down</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] He pours contempt on princes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and increases their families like a flock.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] The upright will see it, and be glad.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All the wicked will shut their mouths.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will consider the loving kindnesses of
      Yahweh.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] My heart is steadfast, God.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will sing and I will make music with my soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Wake up, harp and lyre!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will wake up the dawn.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] God of my praise, don’t remain silent,<br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth
      of deceit against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and fought against me without a cause.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] In return for my love, they are my adversaries;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but I am in prayer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] They have rewarded me evil for good,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and hatred for my love.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Set a wicked man over him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let an adversary stand at his right hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] When he is judged, let him come out guilty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let his prayer be turned into sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Let his days be few.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let another take his office.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Let his children be fatherless,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his wife a widow.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Let his children be wandering beggars.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let them be sought from their ruins.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Let the creditor seize all that he has.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Let there be no one to extend kindness to him,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Let them be before Yahweh continually,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that he may cut off their memory from the earth;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] because he didn’t remember to show kindness,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">the broken in heart, to kill them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He didn’t delight in blessing, and it was far
      from him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It came into his inward parts like water,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like oil into his bones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers

    <span class="line indent0">for the belt that is always around him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh,</span><br>

    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0">because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] for I am poor and needy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My heart is wounded within me.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] They may curse, but you bless.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When they arise, they will be shamed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but your servant shall rejoice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Yes, I will praise him among the multitude.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I believed, therefore I said,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“I was greatly afflicted.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I said in my haste,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“All men are liars.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] What will I give to Yahweh for all his benefits toward
      me?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] I will take the cup of salvation, and call on Yahweh’s
      name.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I will pay my vows to Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, in the presence of all his people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Precious in the sight of Yahweh is the death of his
      saints.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Yahweh, truly I am your servant.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I am your servant, the son of your handmaid.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have freed me from my chains.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will call on Yahweh’s name.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] I will pay my vows to Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, in the presence of all his people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] in the courts of Yahweh’s house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in your midst, Jerusalem.</span><br>

    <center>Chapter 117</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Praise Yahweh, all you nations!<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Extol him, all you peoples!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For his loving kindness is great toward us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh’s faithfulness endures forever.</span><br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">for his loving kindness endures forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Let Israel now say</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that his loving kindness endures forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Let the house of Aaron now say</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that his loving kindness endures forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Now let those who fear Yahweh say</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that his loving kindness endures forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Out of my distress, I called on Yah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yah answered me with freedom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Yahweh is on my side. I will not be afraid.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">What can man do to me?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Yahweh is on my side among those who help me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Therefore I will look in triumph at those who
      hate me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] It is better to take refuge in Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than to put confidence in man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] It is better to take refuge in Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than to put confidence in princes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] All the nations surrounded me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but in Yahweh’s name, I cut them off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In Yahweh’s name I indeed cut them off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] They surrounded me like bees.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are quenched like the burning thorns.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In Yahweh’s name I cut them off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] You pushed me back hard, to make me fall,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but Yahweh helped me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Yah is my strength and song.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has become my salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of
      the righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] The right hand of Yahweh is exalted!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] I will not die, but live,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and declare Yah’s works.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Yah has punished me severely,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he has not given me over to death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Open to me the gates of righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will enter into them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will give thanks to Yah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] This is the gate of Yahweh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the righteous will enter into it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have become my salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] The stone which the builders rejected has become the head
      of the corner.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] This is Yahweh’s doing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It is marvelous in our eyes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] This is the day that Yahweh has made.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We will rejoice and be glad in it!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Save us now, we beg you, Yahweh!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh, we beg you, send prosperity now.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Blessed is he who comes in Yahweh’s name!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We have blessed you out of Yahweh’s house.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Yahweh is God, and he has given us light.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns
      of the altar.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] You are my God, and I will give thanks to you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You are my God, I will exalt you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] My help comes from Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who made heaven and earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He will not allow your foot to be moved.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who keeps you will not slumber.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Behold, he who keeps Israel</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">will neither slumber nor sleep.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Yahweh is your keeper.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The sun will not harm you by day,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor the moon by night.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Yahweh will keep you from all evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will keep your soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from this time forward, and forever more.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I was glad when they said to me,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Let’s go to Yahweh’s house!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact
      together;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] where the tribes go up, even Yah’s tribes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">according to an ordinance for Israel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to give thanks to Yahweh’s name.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For there are set thrones for judgment,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the thrones of David’s house.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Those who love you will prosper.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Peace be within your walls,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and prosperity within your palaces.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] For my brothers’ and companions’ sakes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will now say, “Peace be within you.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will seek your good.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 123</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] To you I do lift up my eyes,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">you who sit in the heavens.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their
      master,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her
      mistress;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so our eyes look to Yahweh, our God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">until he has mercy on us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for we have endured much contempt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those
      who are at ease,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with the contempt of the proud.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 124</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">let Israel now say,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when men rose up against us;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] then they would have swallowed us up alive,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when their wrath was kindled against us;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] then the waters would have overwhelmed us,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the stream would have gone over our soul;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Blessed be Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s
      snare.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The snare is broken, and we have escaped.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Our help is in Yahweh’s name,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who made heaven and earth.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 125</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">which can’t be moved, but remains forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] As the mountains surround Jerusalem,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so Yahweh surrounds his people from this time
      forward and forever more.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For the scepter of wickedness won’t remain over the
      allotment of the righteous;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so that the righteous won’t use their hands to do
      evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to those who are upright in their hearts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of
      iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Peace be on Israel.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 126</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">we were like those who dream.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Then our mouth was filled with laughter,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and our tongue with singing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Then they said among the nations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Yahweh has done great things for them.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Yahweh has done great things for us,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and we are glad.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like the streams in the Negev.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">will certainly come again with joy, carrying his
      sheaves.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 127</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Unless Yahweh builds the house,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">they labor in vain who build it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Unless Yahweh watches over the city,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the watchman guards it in vain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] It is vain for you to rise up early,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to stay up late,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">eating the bread of toil;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he gives sleep to his loved ones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The fruit of the womb is his reward.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so are the children of youth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They won’t be disappointed when they speak with
      their enemies in the gate.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 128</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">who walks in his ways.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For you will eat the labor of your hands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will be happy, and it will be well with you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Your wife will be as a fruitful vine,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the innermost parts of your house;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your children like olive plants,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">around your table.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Behold, thus is the man blessed who fears Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] May Yahweh bless you out of Zion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the
      days of your life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Yes, may you see your children’s children.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Peace be upon Israel.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 129</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let Israel now say,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] many times they have afflicted me from my youth up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet they have not prevailed against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] The plowers plowed on my back.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They made their furrows long.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Yahweh is righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Let them be disappointed and turned backward,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">all those who hate Zion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Let them be as the grass on the housetops,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which withers before it grows up;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Neither do those who go by say,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“The blessing of Yahweh be on you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We bless you in Yahweh’s name.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 130</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Out of the depths I have cried to you, Yahweh.<br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Lord, hear my voice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my
      petitions.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] If you, Yah, kept a record of sins,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Lord, who could stand?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] But there is forgiveness with you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">therefore you are feared.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I wait for Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My soul waits.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I hope in his word.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the
      morning;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">more than watchmen for the morning.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Israel, hope in Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for with Yahweh there is loving kindness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">With him is abundant redemption.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He will redeem Israel from all their sins.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 131</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Yahweh, my heart isn’t haughty, nor my eyes lofty;<br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor do I concern myself with great matters,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or things too wonderful for me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like a weaned child with his mother,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like a weaned child is my soul within me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Israel, hope in Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from this time forward and forever more.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 132</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction,<br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] how he swore to Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] “Surely I will not come into the structure of my house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor go up into my bed;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I will not give sleep to my eyes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or slumber to my eyelids;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] until I find out a place for Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We found it in the field of Jaar:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] “We will go into his dwelling place.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We will worship at his footstool.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">you, and the ark of your strength.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Let your priest be clothed with righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let your saints shout for joy!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For your servant David’s sake,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">don’t turn away the face of your anointed one.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Yahweh has sworn to David in truth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will not turn from it:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“I will set the fruit of your body on your
      throne.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] If your children will keep my covenant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my testimony that I will teach them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">their children also will sit on your throne
      forever more.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] For Yahweh has chosen Zion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has desired it for his habitation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] “This is my resting place forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Here I will live, for I have desired it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] I will abundantly bless her provision.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will satisfy her poor with bread.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Her priests I will also clothe with salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Her saints will shout aloud for joy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] There I will make the horn of David to bud.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] I will clothe his enemies with shame,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but on himself, his crown will be resplendent.”</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] It is like the precious oil on the head,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">your renown, Yahweh, throughout all generations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0">and have compassion on his servants.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The idols of the nations are silver and gold,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the work of men’s hands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] They have mouths, but they can’t speak.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They have eyes, but they can’t see.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] They have ears, but they can’t hear;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither is there any breath in their mouths.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] House of Israel, praise Yahweh!</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] On the willows in its midst,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">we hung up our harps.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] How can we sing Yahweh’s song in a foreign land?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] If I forget you, Jerusalem,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">let my right hand forget its skill.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don’t

    <span class="line indent0">if I don’t prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the day of Jerusalem;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who said, “Raze it!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Raze it even to its foundation!”</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I will bow down toward your holy temple,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">for you have exalted your Name and your Word

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] In the day that I called, you answered me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You encouraged me with strength in my soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for they have heard the words of your mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Yes, they will sing of the ways of Yahweh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for great is Yahweh’s glory.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For though Yahweh is high, yet he looks after the lowly;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the proud, he knows from afar.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will stretch out your hand against the wrath
      of my enemies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your right hand will save me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your loving kindness, Yahweh, endures forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t forsake the works of your own hands.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Yahweh, you have searched me,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">and you know me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] You know my sitting down and my rising up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You perceive my thoughts from afar.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] You search out my path and my lying down,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and are acquainted with all my ways.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For there is not a word on my tongue,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but, behold, Yahweh, you know it altogether.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] You hem me in behind and before.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You laid your hand on me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] This knowledge is beyond me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It’s lofty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I can’t attain it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Where could I go from your Spirit?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Or where could I flee from your presence?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] If I ascend up into heaven, you are there.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] If I take the wings of the dawn,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Even there your hand will lead me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your right hand will hold me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] If I say, “Surely the darkness will overwhelm me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the light around me will be night”;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] even the darkness doesn’t hide from you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the night shines as the day.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The darkness is like light to you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] For you formed my inmost being.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You knit me together in my mother’s womb.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I will give thanks to you,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Your works are wonderful.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My soul knows that very well.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] My frame wasn’t hidden from you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when I was made in secret,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">woven together in the depths of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Your eyes saw my body.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In your book they were all written,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the days that were ordained for me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when as yet there were none of them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] How precious to me are your thoughts, God!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">How vast is their sum!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] If I would count them, they are more in number than the

    <span class="line indent0">When I wake up, I am still with you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] If only you, God, would kill the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] For they speak against you wickedly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your enemies take your name in vain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Yahweh, don’t I hate those who hate you?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Am I not grieved with those who rise up against
      you?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] I hate them with perfect hatred.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They have become my enemies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Search me, God, and know my heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Try me, and know my thoughts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] See if there is any wicked way in me,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] those who devise mischief in their hearts.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my salvation,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Yahweh, don’t grant the desires of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t let their evil plans succeed, or they will
      become proud.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] As for the head of those who surround me,</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Hear my prayer, Yahweh.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Listen to my petitions.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve
