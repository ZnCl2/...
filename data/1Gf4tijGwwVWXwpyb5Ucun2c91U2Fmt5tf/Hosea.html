      <h1>Hosea</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Yahweh’s word that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the
    days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days
    of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] When Yahweh spoke at first by Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea,
    “Go, take for yourself a wife of prostitution and children of
    unfaithfulness; for the land commits great adultery, forsaking Yahweh.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she
    conceived, and bore him a son. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Yahweh said to him, “Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little
    while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will
    cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] It will happen in that day that I will break the bow of
    Israel in the valley of Jezreel.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] She conceived again, and bore a daughter. <br>
    <br>
    Then he said to him, “Call her name Lo-Ruhamah; for I will no longer have
    mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any way pardon them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save
    them by Yahweh their God, and will not save them by bow, sword, battle,
    horses, or horsemen.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bore
    a son. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He said, “Call his name Lo-Ammi; for you are not my people,
    and I will not be yours.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the
    sand of the sea, which can’t be measured nor numbered; and it will come to
    pass that, in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’
    they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be
    gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up
    from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] “Say to your brothers, ‘My people!’ <br>
    <span class="line indent0">and to your sisters, ‘My loved one!’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Contend with your mother!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Contend, for she is not my wife,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither am I her husband;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and let her put away her prostitution from her
      face,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and her adulteries from between her breasts;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Lest I strip her naked,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and make her bare as in the day that she was
      born,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and make her like a wilderness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and set her like a dry land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and kill her with thirst.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for they are children of unfaithfulness;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For their mother has played the prostitute.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She who conceived them has done shamefully;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for she said, ‘I will go after my lovers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who give me my bread and my water,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my wool and my flax,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my oil and my drink.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Therefore behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will build a wall against her,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that she can’t find her way.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] She will follow after her lovers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but she won’t overtake them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and she will seek them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but won’t find them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my
      first husband;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for then was it better with me than now.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] For she did not know that I gave her the grain, the new
      wine, and the oil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they
      used for Baal.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Therefore I will take back my grain in its time,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and my new wine in its season,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will pluck away my wool and my flax which
      should have covered her nakedness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her
      lovers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and no one will deliver her out of my hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I will also cause all her celebrations to cease:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all
      her solemn assemblies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">about which she has said, ‘These are my wages
      that my lovers have given me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will make them a forest,’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the animals of the field shall eat them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] I will visit on her the days of the Baals,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to which she burned incense,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when she decked herself with her earrings and her
      jewels,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and went after her lovers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and forgot me,” says Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] “Therefore behold, I will allure her,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and bring her into the wilderness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and speak tenderly to her.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] I will give her vineyards from there,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the valley of Achor for a door of hope;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and she will respond there,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as in the days of her youth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and as in the day when she came up out of the
      land of Egypt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] It will be in that day,” says Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“that you will call me ‘my husband,’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and no longer call me ‘my master.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her
      mouth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will no longer be mentioned by name.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] In that day I will make a covenant for them with the
      animals of the field,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and with the birds of the sky,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and with the creeping things of the ground.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle
      out of the land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will make them lie down safely.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] I will betroth you to me forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness,
      in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and you shall know Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] It will happen in that day, I will respond,” says Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“I will respond to the heavens,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will respond to the earth;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new
      wine, and the oil;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will respond to Jezreel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] I will sow her to me in the earth;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained
      mercy;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will tell those who were not my people,
      ‘You are my people;’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will say, ‘My God!’”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Yahweh said to me, “Go again, love a woman loved by another,
    and an adulteress, even as Yahweh loves the children of Israel, though they
    turn to other gods, and love cakes of raisins.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and
    a homer and a half of barley.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I said to her, “You shall stay with me many days. You shall
    not play the prostitute, and you shall not be with any other man. I will
    also be so toward you.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For the children of Israel shall live many days without
    king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without sacred stone,
    and without ephod or idols.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Afterward the children of Israel shall return, and seek
    Yahweh their God, and David their king, and shall come with trembling to
    Yahweh and to his blessings in the last days. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Hear Yahweh’s word, you children of Israel; <br>
    <span class="line indent0">for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants
      of the land:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Indeed there is no truth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor goodness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor knowledge of God in the land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing
      adultery;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes
      bloodshed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Therefore the land will mourn,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and everyone who dwells therein will waste away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">all living things in her,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even the animals of the field and the birds of
      the sky;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, the fish of the sea also die.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] “Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man
      accuse; For your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] You will stumble in the day,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the prophet will also stumble with you in the
      night;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will destroy your mother.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also
      reject you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that you may be no priest to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Because you have forgotten your God’s law,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will also forget your children.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will change their glory into shame.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] They feed on the sin of my people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and set their heart on their iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] It will be, like people, like priest;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will punish them for their ways,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will repay them for their deeds.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] They will eat, and not have enough.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will play the prostitute, and will not
      increase;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because they have abandoned giving to Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] My people consult with their wooden idol,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and answer to a stick of wood.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them
      astray,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they have been unfaithful to their God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and
      poplars and terebinths,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because its shade is good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Therefore your daughters play the prostitute,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your brides commit adultery.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I will not punish your daughters when they play the
      prostitute,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor your brides when they commit adultery;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because the men consort with prostitutes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so the people without understanding will come to
      ruin.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] “Though you, Israel, play the prostitute,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet don’t let Judah offend;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t come to Gilgal,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither go up to Beth Aven,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor swear, ‘As Yahweh lives.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a
      stubborn heifer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Then how will Yahweh feed them like a lamb in a
      meadow.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Ephraim is joined to idols.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Leave him alone!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Their drink has become sour.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They play the prostitute continually.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Her rulers dearly love their shameful way.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] The wind has wrapped her up in its wings;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they shall be disappointed because of their
      sacrifices.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] “Listen to this, you priests! <br>
    <span class="line indent0">Listen, house of Israel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and give ear, house of the king!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For the judgment is against you;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you have been a snare at Mizpah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a net spread on Tabor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The rebels are deep in slaughter;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but I discipline all of them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I know Ephraim,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Israel is not hidden from me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Israel is defiled.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Their deeds won’t allow them to turn to their God;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the spirit of prostitution is within them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they don’t know Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The pride of Israel testifies to his face.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in
      their iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Judah also will stumble with them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] They will go with their flocks and with their herds to
      seek Yahweh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but they won’t find him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has withdrawn himself from them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They are unfaithful to Yahweh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for they have borne illegitimate children.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Now the new moon will devour them with their
      fields.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] “Blow the cornet in Gibeah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the trumpet in Ramah!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you,
      Benjamin!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known
      that which will surely be.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The princes of Judah are like those who remove a
      landmark.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will pour out my wrath on them like water.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Ephraim is oppressed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he is crushed in judgment;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Because he is intent in his pursuit of idols.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and to the house of Judah like rottenness.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] “When Ephraim saw his sickness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Judah his wound,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Then Ephraim went to Assyria,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and sent to king Jareb:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he is not able to heal you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will he cure you of your wound.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For I will be to Ephraim like a lion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and like a young lion to the house of Judah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I myself will tear in pieces and go away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will carry off, and there will be no one to
      deliver.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] I will go and return to my place,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">until they acknowledge their offense,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and seek my face.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 6</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] “Come, and let us return to Yahweh; <br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he has torn us to pieces,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he will heal us;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he has injured us,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he will bind up our wounds.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] After two days he will revive us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">On the third day he will raise us up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and we will live before him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Let us acknowledge Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let us press on to know Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">As surely as the sun rises,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh will appear.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will come to us like the rain,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">For your love is like a morning cloud,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and like the dew that disappears early.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Therefore I have cut them to pieces with the prophets;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I killed them with the words of my mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your judgments are like a flash of lightning.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the knowledge of God more than burnt
      offerings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But they, like Adam, have broken the covenant.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They were unfaithful to me, there.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">it is stained with blood.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] As gangs of robbers wait to ambush a man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so the company of priests murder on the path
      toward Shechem,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">committing shameful crimes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is prostitution in Ephraim.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Israel is defiled.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] “Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you,</span><br>

    <center>Chapter 7</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] When I would heal Israel, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">also the wickedness of Samaria;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for they commit falsehood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the thief enters in,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the gang of robbers ravages outside.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] They don’t consider in their hearts that I remember all
      their wickedness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Now their own deeds have engulfed them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are before my face.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] They make the king glad with their wickedness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the princes with their lies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] They are all adulterers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are burning like an oven that the baker
      stops stirring,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from the kneading of the dough, until it is
      leavened.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick
      with the heat of wine.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He joined his hand with mockers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For they have prepared their heart like an oven,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">while they lie in wait.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their baker sleeps all the night.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the morning it burns as a flaming fire.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They are all hot as an oven,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and devour their judges.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All their kings have fallen.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is no one among them who calls to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Ephraim, he mixes himself among the nations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Ephraim is a pancake not turned over.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Strangers have devoured his strength,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he doesn’t realize it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Indeed, gray hairs are here and there on him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he doesn’t realize it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The pride of Israel testifies to his face;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet they haven’t returned to Yahweh their God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor sought him, for all this.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] “Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without
      understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They call to Egypt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They go to Assyria.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] When they go, I will spread my net on them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will bring them down like the birds of the sky.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will chastise them, as their congregation has
      heard.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Woe to them!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For they have wandered from me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Destruction to them!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For they have trespassed against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Though I would redeem them,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] They haven’t cried to me with their heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but they howl on their beds.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They assemble themselves for grain and new wine.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They turn away from me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Though I have taught and strengthened their arms,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet they plot evil against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] They return, but not to the Most High.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are like a faulty bow.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage
      of their tongue.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] “Put the trumpet to your lips! <br>
    <span class="line indent0">Something like an eagle is over Yahweh’s house,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] They cry to me, ‘My God, we Israel acknowledge you!’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Israel has cast off that which is good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The enemy will pursue him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] They have set up kings, but not by me.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For this is even from Israel!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The workman made it, and it is no God;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">indeed, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in

    <span class="line indent0">He has no standing grain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The stalk will yield no head.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If it does yield, strangers will swallow it up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Israel is swallowed up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Now they are among the nations like a worthless
      thing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For they have gone up to Assyria,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like a wild donkey wandering alone.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Ephraim has hired lovers for himself.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] But although they sold themselves among the nations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will now gather them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they begin to waste away because of the
      oppression of the king of mighty ones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they became for him altars for sinning.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I wrote for him the many things of my law;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but they were regarded as a strange thing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] As for the sacrifices of my offerings,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they sacrifice flesh and eat it;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">But Yahweh doesn’t accept them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Now he will remember their iniquity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and punish their sins.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will return to Egypt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Judah has multiplied fortified cities;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but I will send a fire on his cities,</span><br>

    <center>Chapter 9</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Don’t rejoice, Israel, to jubilation like the nations; <br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you were unfaithful to your God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You love the wages of a prostitute at every grain
      threshing floor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The threshing floor and the wine press won’t feed them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the new wine will fail her.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] They won’t dwell in Yahweh’s land;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but Ephraim will return to Egypt,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] They won’t pour out wine offerings to Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will they be pleasing to him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread
      of mourners;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">all who eat of it will be polluted;</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">and in the day of the feast of Yahweh?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For, behold, they have gone away from destruction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Egypt will gather them up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Memphis will bury them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Nettles will possess their pleasant things of

    <span class="line indent0">Thorns will be in their tents.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The days of visitation have come.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The days of reckoning have come.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the man who is inspired to be insane,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because of the abundance of your sins,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and because your hostility is great.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A fowler’s snare is on all of his paths,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and hostility in the house of his God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] They have deeply corrupted themselves,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as in the days of Gibeah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will remember their iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will punish them for their sins.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig
      tree at its first season;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated
      themselves to the shameful thing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and became abominable like that which they loved.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There will be no birth, no one with child, and no
      conception.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Though they bring up their children,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall
      be left.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant
      place;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but Ephraim will bring out his children to the
      murderer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Give them—Yahweh what will you give?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] “All their wickedness is in Gilgal;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for there I hated them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will
      drive them out of my house!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will love them no more.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All their princes are rebels.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Ephraim is struck.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their root has dried up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will bear no fruit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Even though they give birth, yet I will kill the
      beloved ones of their womb.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] My God will cast them away, because they did not listen
      to him;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will be wanderers among the nations.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Israel is a luxuriant vine that produces his fruit. <br>
    <span class="line indent0">According to the abundance of his fruit he has
      multiplied his altars.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">As their land has prospered, they have adorned
      their sacred stones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Their heart is divided.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Now they will be found guilty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will demolish their altars.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will destroy their sacred stones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Surely now they will say, “We have no king; for we don’t
      fear Yahweh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the king, what can he do for us?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] They make promises, swearing falsely in making covenants.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Therefore judgment springs up like poisonous
      weeds in the furrows of the field.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The inhabitants of Samaria will be in terror for the
      calves of Beth Aven;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for its people will mourn over it,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Along with its priests who rejoiced over it,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for its glory, because it has departed from it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] It also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a
      great king.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Ephraim will receive shame,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">like a twig on the water.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be
      destroyed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The thorn and the thistle will come up on their
      altars.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will tell the mountains, “Cover us!” and the

    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] “Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There they remained.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The battle against the children of iniquity
      doesn’t overtake them in Gibeah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] When it is my desire, I will chastise them;</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">I will set a rider on Ephraim.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Judah will plow.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Jacob will break his clods.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">reap according to kindness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Break up your fallow ground;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for it is time to seek Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">until he comes and rains righteousness on you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] You have plowed wickedness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have reaped iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have eaten the fruit of lies,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you trusted in your way, in the multitude of
      your mighty men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Therefore a battle roar will arise among your people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and all your fortresses will be destroyed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of
      battle.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The mother was dashed in pieces with her

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] So Bethel will do to you because of your great

    <span class="line indent0">and will destroy the bars of their gates,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will put an end to their plans.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] My people are determined to turn from me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Though they call to the Most High,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he certainly won’t exalt them.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] “How can I give you up, Ephraim?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">How can I hand you over, Israel?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">How can I make you like Admah?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">How can I make you like Zeboiim?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My heart is turned within me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my compassion is aroused.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] I will not execute the fierceness of my anger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not return to destroy Ephraim:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in your
      midst;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will not come in wrath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] They will walk after Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who will roar like a lion;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he will roar, and the children will come
      trembling from the west.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and like a dove out of the land of Assyria;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will settle them in their houses,” says
      Yahweh.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the house of Israel with deceit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Judah still strays from God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and is unfaithful to the Holy One.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 12</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Ephraim feeds on wind, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">and chases the east wind.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He continually multiplies lies and desolation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They make a covenant with Assyria,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and oil is carried into Egypt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Yahweh also has a controversy with Judah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will punish Jacob according to his ways;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">according to his deeds he will repay him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] In the womb he took his brother by the heel;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and in his manhood he contended with God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Indeed, he struggled with the angel, and prevailed;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he wept, and made supplication to him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He found him at Bethel, and there he spoke with
      us,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] even Yahweh, the God of Armies;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh is his name of renown!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Therefore turn to your God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Keep kindness and justice,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and wait continually for your God.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] A merchant has dishonest scales in his hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He loves to defraud.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Ephraim said, “Surely I have become rich,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have found myself wealth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In all my wealth they won’t find in me any
      iniquity that is sin.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] “But I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will yet again make you dwell in tents,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as in the days of the solemn feast.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I have also spoken to the prophets,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I have multiplied visions;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and by the ministry of the prophets I have used
      parables.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] If Gilead is wicked,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">surely they are worthless.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Indeed, their altars are like heaps in the
      furrows of the field.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Jacob fled into the country of Aram,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Israel served to get a wife,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and for a wife he tended flocks and herds.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] By a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up out of Egypt,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and by a prophet he was preserved.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Ephraim has bitterly provoked anger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Therefore his blood will be left on him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his Lord will repay his contempt.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 13</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling. <br>
    <span class="line indent0">He exalted himself in Israel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but when he became guilty in Baal, he died.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Now they sin more and more,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have made themselves molten images of their
      silver,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even idols according to their own understanding,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">all of them the work of the craftsmen.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They say of them, ‘They offer human sacrifice and
      kiss the calves.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Therefore they will be like the morning mist,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and like the dew that passes away early,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind
      out of the threshing floor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and like the smoke out of the chimney.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] “Yet I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and you shall acknowledge no god but me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and besides me there is no savior.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I knew you in the wilderness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the land of great drought.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] According to their pasture, so were they filled;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they were filled, and their heart was exalted.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Therefore they have forgotten me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Therefore I am like a lion to them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Like a leopard, I will lurk by the path.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will tear the covering of their heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There I will devour them like a lioness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The wild animal will tear them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] You are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">against your help.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Where is your king now, that he may save you in all your
      cities?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">And your judges, of whom you said, ‘Give me a
      king and princes?’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I have given you a king in my anger,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have taken him away in my wrath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The guilt of Ephraim is stored up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His sin is stored up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The sorrows of a travailing woman will come on him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is an unwise son;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for when it is time, he doesn’t come to the
      opening of the womb.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I will ransom them from the power of Sheol.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will redeem them from death!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Death, where are your plagues?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Sheol, where is your destruction?</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Compassion will be hidden from my eyes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Though he is fruitful among his brothers, an east wind
      will come,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the breath of Yahweh coming up from the
      wilderness;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his spring will become dry,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his fountain will be dried up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will plunder the storehouse of treasure.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Samaria will bear her guilt;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for she has rebelled against her God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will fall by the sword.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their infants will be dashed in pieces,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their pregnant women will be ripped open.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 14</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Israel, return to Yahweh your God;<br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you have fallen because of your sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Take words with you, and return to Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Tell him, “Forgive all our sins,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and accept that which is good:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so we offer our lips like bulls.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Assyria can’t save us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We won’t ride on horses;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will we say any more to the work of our
      hands, ‘Our gods!’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for in you the fatherless finds mercy.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] “I will heal their waywardness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will love them freely;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for my anger is turned away from him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I will be like the dew to Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will blossom like the lily,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and send down his roots like Lebanon.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] His branches will spread,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his beauty will be like the olive tree,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his fragrance like Lebanon.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Men will dwell in his shade.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will revive like the grain,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and blossom like the vine.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I answer, and will take care of him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I am like a green fir tree;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from me your fruit is found.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Who is wise, that he may understand these things?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who is prudent, that he may know them?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For the ways of Yahweh are right,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the righteous walk in them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">But the rebellious stumble in them.</span><br>
