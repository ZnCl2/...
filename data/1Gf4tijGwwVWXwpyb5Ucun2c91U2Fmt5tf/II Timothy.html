      <h1>II Timothy</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God,
    according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from
    God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure
    conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be
    filled with joy;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you;
    which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I
    am persuaded, in you also. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the
    gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love,
    and self-control.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor
    of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the
    power of God,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not
    according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which
    was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior,
    Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light
    through the Good News.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a
    teacher of the Gentiles.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For this cause I also suffer these things. <br>
    <br>
    Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am
    persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him
    against that day. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from
    me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] That good thing which was committed to you, guard through
    the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from
    me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for
    he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found
    me<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that
    day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that
    is in Christ Jesus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The things which you have heard from me among many
    witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others
    also.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of
    Christ Jesus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life,
    that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned
    unless he has competed by the rules.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of
    the crops.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding
    in all things. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of
    David, according to my Good News,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a
    criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake,
    that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with
    eternal glory.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] This saying is faithful: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“For if we died with him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">we will also live with him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] If we endure,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">we will also reign with him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If we deny him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he also will deny us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] If we are faithless,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he remains faithful.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He can’t deny himself.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of
    the Lord, that they don’t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting
    of those who hear. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a
    workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in
    ungodliness,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is
    Hymenaeus and Philetus;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the
    resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] However God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal,
    “The Lord knows those who are his,”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=II+Timothy+2%3A19"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> and, “Let every one who names the name
    of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and
    of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for
    dishonor.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a
    vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared
    for every good work. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith,
    love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that
    they generate strife.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards
    all, able to teach, patient,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God
    may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare,
    having been taken captive by him to his will. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will
    come.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful,
    arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without
    self-control, fierce, not lovers of good,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather
    than lovers of God;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power.
    Turn away from these, also.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For some of these are people who creep into houses, and take
    captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of
    the truth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also
    oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith, are
    rejected.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be
    evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith,
    patience, love, steadfastness,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to
    me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord
    delivered me out of them all.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will
    suffer persecution.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse,
    deceiving and being deceived.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] But you remain in the things which you have learned and
    have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are
    able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for
    teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped
    for every good work. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus
    Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his
    Kingdom:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season;
    reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For the time will come when they will not listen to the
    sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves
    teachers after their own lusts;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside
    to fables.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work
    of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure
    has come.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I
    have kept the faith.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of
    righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that
    day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Be diligent to come to me soon,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and
    went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you,
    for he is useful to me for service.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you
    come, and the books, especially the parchments.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord
    will repay him according to his works,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our
    words. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left
    me. May it not be held against them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through
    me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might
    hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will
    preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever.
    Amen. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at
    Miletus sick.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as
    do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with
    you. Amen. <br>
