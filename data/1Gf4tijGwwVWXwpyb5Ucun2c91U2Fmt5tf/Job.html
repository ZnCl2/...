      <h1>Job</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That
    man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from
    evil.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three
    thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and
    a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the
    children of the east.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on
    his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to
    drink with them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their
    course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning,
    and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job
    said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their
    hearts.” Job did so continually. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves
    before Yahweh, Satan also came among them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” <br>
    <br>
    Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the
    earth, and from walking up and down in it.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job?
    For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man,
    one who fears God, and turns away from evil.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Does Job fear God for
    nothing?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house,
    and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his
    hands, and his substance is increased in the land.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has,
    and he will renounce you to your face.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your
    power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.” <br>
    <br>
    So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were
    eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] that there came a messenger to Job, and said, “The oxen
    were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they
    have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have
    escaped to tell you.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] While he was still speaking, there also came another, and
    said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep
    and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] While he was still speaking, there came also another, and
    said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and
    have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the
    sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] While he was still speaking, there came also another, and
    said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their
    eldest brother’s house,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness,
    and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and
    they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and
    fell down on the ground, and worshiped.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked
    shall I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be
    Yahweh’s name.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] In all this, Job did not sin, nor charge God with
    wrongdoing. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Again, on the day when the God’s sons came to present
    themselves before Yahweh, Satan came also among them to present himself
    before Yahweh.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” <br>
    <br>
    Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth,
    and from walking up and down in it.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job?
    For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man,
    one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his
    integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.”
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all
    that a man has he will give for his life.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his
    flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only
    spare his life.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck
    Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and
    he sat among the ashes.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your
    integrity? Renounce God, and die.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women
    would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we
    not receive evil?” <br>
    <br>
    In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that
    had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite,
    Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment
    together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t
    recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his
    robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and
    seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief
    was very great. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his
    birth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Job answered: <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] “Let the day perish in which I was born,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Let that day be darkness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t let God from above seek for it,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither let the light shine on it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their
      own.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let a cloud dwell on it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let all that makes black the day terrify it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let it not rejoice among the days of the year.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let it not come into the number of the months.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Behold, let that night be barren.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let no joyful voice come therein.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Let them curse it who curse the day,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Let the stars of its twilight be dark.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let it look for light, but have none,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] “Why didn’t I die from the womb?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother
      bore me?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Why did the knees receive me?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Or why the breast, that I should nurse?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] For now should I have lain down and been quiet.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I should have slept, then I would have been at
      rest,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] with kings and counselors of the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who built up waste places for themselves;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] or with princes who had gold,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who filled their houses with silver:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as infants who never saw light.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] There the wicked cease from troubling.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There the weary are at rest.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] There the prisoners are at ease together.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] The small and the great are there.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The servant is free from his master.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] “Why is light given to him who is in misery,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">life to the bitter in soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Who long for death, but it doesn’t come;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] who rejoice exceedingly,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and are glad, when they can find the grave?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whom God has hedged in?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] For my sighing comes before I eat.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My groanings are poured out like water.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] For the thing which I fear comes on me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">That which I am afraid of comes to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I
      rest;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but trouble comes.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be
      grieved?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">But who can withhold himself from speaking?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Behold, you have instructed many,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">you have strengthened the weak hands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Your words have supported him who was falling,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have made firm the feeble knees.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] But now it has come to you, and you faint.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It touches you, and you are troubled.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Isn’t your piety your confidence?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope?</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] “Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Or where were the upright cut off?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and sow trouble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">reap the same.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] By the breath of God they perish.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">By the blast of his anger are they consumed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The roaring of the lion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the voice of the fierce lion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The old lion perishes for lack of prey.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] “Now a thing was secretly brought to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My ear received a whisper of it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] In thoughts from the visions of the night,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when deep sleep falls on men,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] fear came on me, and trembling,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which made all my bones shake.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Then a spirit passed before my face.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The hair of my flesh stood up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A form was before my eyes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] ‘Shall mortal man be more just than God?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Behold, he puts no trust in his servants.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He charges his angels with error.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whose foundation is in the dust,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who are crushed before the moth!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Between morning and evening they are destroyed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They perish forever without any regarding it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They die, and that without wisdom.’</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] “Call now; is there any who will answer you?<br>
    <span class="line indent0">To which of the holy ones will you turn?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For resentment kills the foolish man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and jealousy kills the simple.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I have seen the foolish taking root,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] His children are far from safety.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are crushed in the gate.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Neither is there any to deliver them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] whose harvest the hungry eats up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and take it even out of the thorns.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The snare gapes for their substance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For affliction doesn’t come out of the dust,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither does trouble spring out of the ground;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] but man is born to trouble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as the sparks fly upward.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] “But as for me, I would seek God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I would commit my cause to God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] who does great things that can’t be fathomed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">marvelous things without number;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] who gives rain on the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and sends waters on the fields;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] so that he sets up on high those who are low,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">those who mourn are exalted to safety.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] He frustrates the devices of the crafty,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">So that their hands can’t perform their
      enterprise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He takes the wise in their own craftiness;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] They meet with darkness in the day time,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and grope at noonday as in the night.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] But he saves from the sword of their mouth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] So the poor has hope,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and injustice shuts her mouth.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] “Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Therefore do not despise the chastening of the
      Almighty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] For he wounds, and binds up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He injures, and his hands make whole.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] He will deliver you in six troubles;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, in seven no evil shall touch you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] In famine he will redeem you from death;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in war, from the power of the sword.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither shall you be afraid of destruction when
      it comes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] At destruction and famine you shall laugh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the
      earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] For you shall be allied with the stones of the field.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The animals of the field shall be at peace with
      you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] You shall know that your tent is in peace.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You shall visit your fold, and shall miss
      nothing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] You shall know also that your seed shall be great,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your offspring as the grass of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] You shall come to your grave in a full age,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like a shock of grain comes in its season.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Look this, we have searched it, so it is.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Hear it, and know it for your good.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 6</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then Job answered, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Oh that my anguish were weighed,</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Shouldn’t the multitude of words be answered?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Should a man full of talk be justified?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Should your boastings make men hold their peace?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When you mock, shall no man make you ashamed?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For you say, ‘My doctrine is pure.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I am clean in your eyes.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] But oh that God would speak,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and open his lips against you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] that he would show you the secrets of wisdom!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For true wisdom has two sides.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Know therefore that God exacts of you less than
      your iniquity deserves.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] “Can you fathom the mystery of God?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] They are high as heaven. What can you do?</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] If he passes by, or confines,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or convenes a court, then who can oppose him?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For he knows false men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn’t

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] “If you set your heart aright,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">stretch out your hands toward him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t let unrighteousness dwell in your tents.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Yes, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear:</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Life shall be clearer than the noonday.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Though there is darkness, it shall be as the
      morning.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] You shall be secure, because there is hope.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, you shall search, and shall take your rest
      in safety.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Also you shall lie down, and no one shall make you
      afraid.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, many shall court your favor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] But the eyes of the wicked shall fail.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They shall have no way to flee.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit.”</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">The just, the blameless man is a joke.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and fill himself with the east wind?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Should he reason with unprofitable talk,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or with speeches with which he can do no good?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Yes, you do away with fear,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and hinder devotion before God.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then Job answered, <br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I also could speak as you do.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If your soul were in my soul’s place,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But now, God, you have surely worn me out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have made desolate all my company.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and plead against me my reproach;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] know now that God has subverted me,</span><br>

    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] “Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I cry for help, but there is no justice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He has walled up my way so that I can’t pass,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and has set darkness in my paths.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He has stripped me of my glory,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and taken the crown from my head.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My hope he has plucked up like a tree.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] He has also kindled his wrath against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He counts me among his adversaries.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] His troops come on together,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">build a siege ramp against me,</span><br>

    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] “He has put my brothers far from me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] My relatives have gone away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My familiar friends have forgotten me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Those who dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] My breath is offensive to my wife.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I am loathsome to the children of my own mother.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Even young children despise me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If I arise, they speak against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] All my familiar friends abhor me.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] “Have pity on me, have pity on me, you my friends;</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the end, he will stand upon the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] After my skin is destroyed,</span><br>

    <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“My heart is consumed within me.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then Zophar the Naamathite answered, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even by reason of my haste that is in me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">and his head reach to the clouds,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] yet he shall perish forever like his own dung.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Those who have seen him shall say, ‘Where is he?’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, he shall be chased away like a vision of the
      night.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The eye which saw him shall see him no more,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither shall his place any more see him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] His children shall seek the favor of the poor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His hands shall give back his wealth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] His bones are full of his youth,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] though he spare it, and will not let it go,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but keep it still within his mouth;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] yet his food in his bowels is turned.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It is cobra venom within him.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up

    <span class="line indent0">God will cast them out of his belly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He shall suck cobra venom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The viper’s tongue shall kill him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He shall not look at the rivers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the flowing streams of honey and butter.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] That for which he labored he shall restore, and shall not
      swallow it down.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">According to the substance that he has gotten, he
      shall not rejoice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor.</span><br>

    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] “Because he knew no quietness within him,</span><br>

      delights.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] There was nothing left that he didn’t devour,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress shall

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the

    <span class="line indent0">Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Is it for your piety that he reproves you,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Isn’t your wickedness great?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Neither is there any end to your iniquities.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] You haven’t given water to the weary to drink,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Thereby good shall come to you.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Please receive instruction from his mouth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and lay up his words in your heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Lay your treasure in the dust,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] The Almighty will be your treasure,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and precious silver to you.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then Job answered, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Even today my complaint is rebellious.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Oh that I knew where I might find him!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">That I might come even to his seat!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I would set my cause in order before him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and fill my mouth with arguments.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I would know the words which he would answer me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and understand what he would tell me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">No, but he would listen to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] There the upright might reason with him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so I should be delivered forever from my judge.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] “If I go east, he is not there;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">if west, I can’t find him;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He works to the north, but I can’t see him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He turns south, but I can’t catch a glimpse of
      him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] But he knows the way that I take.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When he has tried me, I shall come out like gold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] My foot has held fast to his steps.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have kept his way, and not turned aside.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I haven’t gone back from the commandment of his lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have treasured up the words of his mouth more
      than my necessary food.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">What his soul desires, even that he does.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For he performs that which is appointed for me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Many such things are with him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Therefore I am terrified at his presence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When I consider, I am afraid of him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For God has made my heart faint.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The Almighty has terrified me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Because I was not cut off before the darkness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither did he cover the thick darkness from my

    <span class="line indent0">Why don’t those who know him see his days?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] There are people who remove the landmarks.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They violently take away flocks, and feed them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] They drive away the donkey of the fatherless,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] They turn the needy out of the way.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The poor of the earth all hide themselves.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they go out to their work, seeking diligently for
      food.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The wilderness yields them bread for their

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] They cut their provender in the field.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They glean the vineyard of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They lie all night naked without clothing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have no covering in the cold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] They are wet with the showers of the mountains,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] There are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and take a pledge of the poor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] So that they go around naked without clothing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Being hungry, they carry the sheaves.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They make oil within the walls of these men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They tread wine presses, and suffer thirst.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] From out of the populous city, men groan.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The murderer rises with the light.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He kills the poor and needy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the night he is like a thief.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">saying, ‘No eye shall see me.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He disguises his face.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] In the dark they dig through houses.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They shut themselves up in the daytime.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They don’t know the light.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For the morning is to all of them like thick darkness,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">He rises up who has no assurance of life.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, they are brought low, they are taken out of
      the way as all others,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Dominion and fear are with him.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] How then can man be just with God?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Or how can he who is born of a woman be clean?</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">How have you saved the arm that has no strength!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] How have you counseled him who has no wisdom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and plentifully declared sound knowledge!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] To whom have you uttered words?</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Sheol is naked before God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Abaddon has no covering.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] He stretches out the north over empty space,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and hangs the earth on nothing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He binds up the waters in his thick clouds,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the cloud is not burst under them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He encloses the face of his throne,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and spreads his cloud on it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and to the confines of light and darkness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The pillars of heaven tremble</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and are astonished at his rebuke.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] He stirs up the sea with his power,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] By his Spirit the heavens are garnished.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His hand has pierced the swift serpent.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Job again took up his parable, and said, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “As God lives, who has taken away my right,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] (For the length of my life is still in me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the spirit of God is in my nostrils);</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither shall my tongue utter deceit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Far be it from me that I should justify you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Until I die I will not put away my integrity from
      me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] “Let my enemy be as the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let him who rises up against me be as the

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off,
      when God takes away his life?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Will he delight himself in the Almighty,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and call on God at all times?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I will teach you about the hand of God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">That which is with the Almighty will I not

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] “This is the portion of a wicked man with God,</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] The east wind carries him away, and he departs.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It sweeps him out of his place.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] For it hurls at him, and does not spare,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as he flees away from his hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Men shall clap their hands at him,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The deep says, ‘It isn’t in me.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The sea says, ‘It isn’t with me.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] It can’t be gotten for gold,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither shall silver be weighed for its price.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] It can’t be valued with the gold of Ophir,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Gold and glass can’t equal it,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine
      gold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Where then does wisdom come from?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Where is the place of understanding?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and kept close from the birds of the sky.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] For he looks to the ends of the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and sees under the whole sky.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] He establishes the force of the wind.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, he measures out the waters by measure.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] When he made a decree for the rain,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a way for the lightning of the thunder;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] then he saw it, and declared it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He established it, yes, and searched it out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] To man he said,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">To depart from evil is understanding.’”</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Job again took up his parable, and said, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Oh that I were as in the months of old,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as in the days when God watched over me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] when his lamp shone on my head,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and by his light I walked through darkness,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] when the Almighty was yet with me,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] when I went out to the city gate,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when I prepared my seat in the street.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The young men saw me and hid themselves.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The aged rose up and stood.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The princes refrained from talking,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The voice of the nobles was hushed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their tongue stuck to the roof of their

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and when the eye saw me, it commended me:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Because I delivered the poor who cried,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the fatherless also, who had no one to help
      him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I put on righteousness, and it clothed me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My justice was as a robe and a diadem.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] I was eyes to the blind,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and feet to the lame.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] I was a father to the needy.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">and plucked the prey out of his teeth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Then I said, ‘I shall die in my own house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I shall number my days as the sand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] My root is spread out to the waters.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] After my words they didn’t speak again.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My speech fell on them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] They waited for me as for the rain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] I smiled on them when they had no confidence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They didn’t reject the light of my face.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] If my land cries out against me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and its furrows weep together;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] if I have eaten its fruits without money,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or have caused its owners to lose their life,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] let briers grow instead of wheat,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and stinkweed instead of barley.”</span><br>
    <br>
    The words of Job are ended. <br>

    <center>Chapter 32</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was
    righteous in his own eyes.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of
    the family of Ram, was kindled against Job. His wrath was kindled because he
    justified himself rather than God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends,
    because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were
    elder than he.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of
    these three men, his wrath was kindled. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“I am young, and you are very old;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Therefore I held back, and didn’t dare show you
      my opinion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] I said, ‘Days should speak,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and multitude of years should teach wisdom.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] But there is a spirit in man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the breath of the Almighty gives them
      understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] It is not the great who are wise,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor the aged who understand justice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Therefore I said, ‘Listen to me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I also will show my opinion.’</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] “Behold, I waited for your words,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I listened for your reasoning,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">while you searched out what to say.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Yes, I gave you my full attention,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but there was no one who convinced Job,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or who answered his words, among you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">God may refute him, not man;’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] for he has not directed his words against me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will I answer him with your speeches.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] “They are amazed. They answer no more.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They don’t have a word to say.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Shall I wait, because they don’t speak,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because they stand still, and answer no more?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] I also will answer my part,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I also will show my opinion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] For I am full of words.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The spirit within me constrains me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like new wineskins it is ready to burst.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] I will speak, that I may be refreshed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will open my lips and answer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Please don’t let me respect any man’s person,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will I give flattering titles to any man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] For I don’t know how to give flattering titles;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or else my Maker would soon take me away.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] “However, Job, please hear my speech,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">and listen to all my words.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] See now, I have opened my mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My tongue has spoken in my mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">That which my lips know they shall speak

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] If you can, answer me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Set your words in order before me, and stand up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Behold, I am toward God even as you are.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I am also formed out of the clay.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid,</span><br>

    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] “Surely you have spoken in my hearing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have heard the voice of your words, saying,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] ‘I am clean, without disobedience.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Behold, he finds occasions against me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He counts me for his enemy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] He puts my feet in the stocks.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He marks all my paths.’</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] “Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for God is greater than man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Why do you strive against him,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For God speaks once,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes twice, though man pays no attention.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] In a dream, in a vision of the night,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when deep sleep falls on men,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in slumbering on the bed;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Then he opens the ears of men,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and seals their instruction,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] That he may withdraw man from his purpose,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and hide pride from man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] He keeps back his soul from the pit,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his life from perishing by the sword.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] He is chastened also with pain on his bed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with continual strife in his bones;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] So that his life abhors bread,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his soul dainty food.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] His flesh is so consumed away, that it can’t be seen.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His bones that were not seen stick out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Yes, his soul draws near to the pit,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his life to the destroyers.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] “If there is beside him an angel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">an interpreter, one among a thousand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to show to man what is right for him;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] then God is gracious to him, and says,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘Deliver him from going down to the pit,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have found a ransom.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He returns to the days of his youth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] He prays to God, and he is favorable to him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so that he sees his face with joy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He restores to man his righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] He sings before men, and says,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was
      right,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and it didn’t profit me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit.</span><br>

    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] “Behold, God works all these things,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] to bring back his soul from the pit,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Mark well, Job, and listen to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Hold your peace, and I will speak.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] If you have anything to say, answer me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Speak, for I desire to justify you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] If not, listen to me.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Moreover Elihu answered, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Hear my words, you wise men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For the ear tries words,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as the palate tastes food.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Let us choose for us that which is right.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let us know among ourselves what is good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For Job has said, ‘I am righteous,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">God has taken away my right:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My wound is incurable, though I am without
      disobedience.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] What man is like Job,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who drinks scorn like water,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and walks with wicked men?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that he should delight himself with God.’</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] “Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from the Almighty, that he should commit
      iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For the work of a man he will render to him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and cause every man to find according to his
      ways.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Yes surely, God will not do wickedly,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Who put him in charge of the earth?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or who has appointed him over the whole world?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] If he set his heart on himself,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If he gathered to himself his spirit and his
      breath,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] all flesh would perish together,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and man would turn again to dust.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] “If now you have understanding, hear this.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Listen to the voice of my words.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Shall even one who hates justice govern?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Will you condemn him who is righteous and
      mighty?—</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Who says to a king, ‘Vile!’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Who doesn’t respect the persons of princes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor respects the rich more than the poor;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for they all are the work of his hands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] In a moment they die, even at midnight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The people are shaken and pass away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The mighty are taken away without a hand.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] “For his eyes are on the ways of a man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He sees all his goings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">where the workers of iniquity may hide
      themselves.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] For he doesn’t need to consider a man further,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that he should go before God in judgment.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and sets others in their place.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He overturns them in the night, so that they are
      destroyed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] He strikes them as wicked men</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the open sight of others;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] because they turned aside from following him,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He heard the cry of the afflicted.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When he hides his face, who then can see him?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Alike whether to a nation, or to a man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] that the godless man may not reign,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that there be no one to ensnare the people.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] “For has any said to God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] Teach me that which I don’t see.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse
      it?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For you must choose, and not I.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Therefore speak what you know.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Men of understanding will tell me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, every wise man who hears me:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] ‘Job speaks without knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His words are without wisdom.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] I wish that Job were tried to the end,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because of his answering like wicked men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] For he adds rebellion to his sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He claps his hands among us,</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Moreover Elihu answered, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Do you think this to be your right,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than
      God’s,’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] That you ask, ‘What advantage will it be to you?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">What profit shall I have, more than if I had
      sinned?’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I will answer you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your companions with you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Look to the heavens, and see.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">See the skies, which are higher than you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If your transgressions are multiplied, what do
      you do to him?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] If you are righteous, what do you give him?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Or what does he receive from your hand?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your righteousness may profit a son of man.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] “By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out.</span><br>

      mighty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who gives songs in the night,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] who teaches us more than the animals of the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] There they cry, but no one gives answer,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because of the pride of evil men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Surely God will not hear an empty cry,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will the Almighty regard it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] How much less when you say you don’t see him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The cause is before him, and you wait for him!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] But now, because he has not visited in his anger,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither does he greatly regard arrogance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he multiplies words without knowledge.”</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Elihu also continued, and said, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Bear with me a little, and I will show you;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for I still have something to say on God’s
      behalf.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I will get my knowledge from afar,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For truly my words are not false.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] “Behold, God is mighty, and doesn’t despise anyone.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is mighty in strength of understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] He doesn’t preserve the life of the wicked,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but gives to the afflicted their right.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] He doesn’t withdraw his eyes from the righteous,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but with kings on the throne,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he sets them forever, and they are exalted.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] If they are bound in fetters,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and are taken in the cords of afflictions,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] then he shows them their work,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their transgressions, that they have behaved
      themselves proudly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He also opens their ears to instruction,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and commands that they return from iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] If they listen and serve him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they shall spend their days in prosperity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their years in pleasures.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] But if they don’t listen, they shall perish by the sword;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they shall die without knowledge.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] “But those who are godless in heart lay up anger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They don’t cry for help when he binds them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] They die in youth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their life perishes among the unclean.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He delivers the afflicted by their affliction,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and opens their ear in oppression.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Yes, he would have allured you out of distress,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">into a broad place, where there is no
      restriction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">That which is set on your table would be full of
      fatness.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] “But you are full of the judgment of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Judgment and justice take hold of you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Don’t let riches entice you to wrath,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither let the great size of a bribe turn you
      aside.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Would your wealth sustain you in distress,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or all the might of your strength?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Don’t desire the night,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when people are cut off in their place.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Take heed, don’t regard iniquity;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you have chosen this rather than affliction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Behold, God is exalted in his power.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who is a teacher like him?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Who has prescribed his way for him?</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] All men have looked on it.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Behold, God is great, and we don’t know him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The number of his years is unsearchable.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] For he draws up the drops of water,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which distill in rain from his vapor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Which the skies pour down</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">He gives food in abundance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] He covers his hands with the lightning,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and commands it to strike the mark.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] Its noise tells about him,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">He does great things, which we can’t comprehend.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The range of the mountains is his pasture,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He searches after every green thing.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] “Will the wild ox be content to serve you?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Or will he stay by your feeding trough?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Or will he till the valleys after you?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Will you trust him, because his strength is great?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Or will you leave to him your labor?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your

    <span class="line indent0">but are they the feathers and plumage of love?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For she leaves her eggs on the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">warms them in the dust,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] and forgets that the foot may crush them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or that the wild animal may trample them.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were

    <span class="line indent0">Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] because God has deprived her of wisdom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither has he imparted to her understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] When she lifts up herself on high,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">she scorns the horse and his rider.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] “Have you given the horse might?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Have you made him to leap as a locust?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The glory of his snorting is awesome.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He goes out to meet the armed men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither does he turn back from the sword.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] The quiver rattles against him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the flashing spear and the javelin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither does he stand still at the sound of the
      trumpet.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, ‘Aha!’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He smells the battle afar off,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] “Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and makes his nest on high?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] On the cliff he dwells, and makes his home,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">on the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] From there he spies out the prey.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His eyes see it afar off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] His young ones also suck up blood.</span><br>

    <br>
    <center>Chapter 40</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Moreover Yahweh answered Job, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who argues with God, let him answer it.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Then Job answered Yahweh, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] “Behold, I am of small account. What shall I answer you?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I lay my hand on my mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I have spoken once, and I will not answer;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] “Now brace yourself like a man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will question you, and you will answer me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Will you even annul my judgment?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Or do you have an arm like God?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Can you thunder with a voice like him?</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] “Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Array yourself with honor and majesty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Pour out the fury of your anger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Crush the wicked in their place.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Hide them in the dust together.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Bind their faces in the hidden place.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Then I will also admit to you</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that your own right hand can save you.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] “See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He eats grass as an ox.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Look now, his strength is in his thighs.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His force is in the muscles of his belly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He moves his tail like a cedar.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The sinews of his thighs are knit together.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] His bones are like tubes of brass.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His limbs are like bars of iron.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] He is the chief of the ways of God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who made him gives him his sword.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Surely the mountains produce food for him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">where all the animals of the field play.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] He lies under the lotus trees,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the covert of the reed, and the marsh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] The lotuses cover him with their shade.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The willows of the brook surround him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to
      his mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Shall any take him when he is on the watch,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">or pierce his jaw through with a hook?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Will he make many petitions to you,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Who has first given to me, that I should repay him?</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">shut up together with a close seal.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] One is so near to another,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that no air can come between them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] They are joined one to another.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] His sneezing flashes out light.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Out of his mouth go burning torches.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Sparks of fire leap out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Out of his nostrils a smoke goes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] His breath kindles coals.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A flame goes out of his mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] There is strength in his neck.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Terror dances before him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] The flakes of his flesh are joined together.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are firm on him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They can’t be moved.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] His heart is as firm as a stone,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, firm as the lower millstone.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They retreat before his thrashing.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] If one attacks him with the sword, it can’t prevail;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] He counts iron as straw;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and brass as rotten wood.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] The arrow can’t make him flee.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Sling stones are like chaff to him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Clubs are counted as stubble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] His undersides are like sharp potsherds,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing
      sledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] He makes the deep to boil like a pot.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] He makes a path shine after him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">One would think the deep had white hair.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] On earth there is not his equal,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that is made without fear.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] He sees everything that is high.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is king over all the sons of pride.”</span><br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 42</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then Job answered Yahweh, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “I know that you can do all things,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and that no purpose of yours can be restrained.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without
      knowledge?’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">therefore I have uttered that which I did not
      understand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] You said, ‘Listen, now, and I will speak;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will question you, and you will answer me.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but now my eye sees you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Therefore I abhor myself,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and repent in dust and ashes.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job,
    Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you, and
    against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is
    right, as my servant Job has.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven
    rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt
    offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that
    I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me
    the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar
    the Naamathite went, and did what Yahweh commanded them, and Yahweh accepted
    Job. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Yahweh turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his
    friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Then came there to him all his brothers, and all his
    sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate
    bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning
    all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece
    of money, and everyone a ring of gold. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his
    beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand
    yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He had also seven sons and three daughters.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of
    the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the
    daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their
    brothers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his
    sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] So Job died, being old and full of days. <br>
