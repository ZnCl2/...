      <h1>Habakkuk</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The oracle which Habakkuk the prophet saw.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Yahweh, how long will I cry, and you will not hear? I cry
    out to you “Violence!” and will you not save?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Why do you show me iniquity, and look at perversity? For
    destruction and violence are before me. There is strife, and contention
    rises up.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails;
    for the wicked surround the righteous; therefore justice comes out
    perverted. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] “Look among the nations, watch, and wonder marvelously; for
    I am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it is
    told you.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty
    nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling
    places that are not theirs.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They are feared and dreaded. Their judgment and their
    dignity proceed from themselves.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more
    fierce than the evening wolves. Their horsemen press proudly on. Yes, their
    horsemen come from afar. They fly as an eagle that hurries to devour.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] All of them come for violence. Their hordes face the desert.
    He gathers prisoners like sand.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Yes, he scoffs at kings, and princes are a derision to him.
    He laughs at every stronghold, for he builds up an earthen ramp, and takes
    it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Then he sweeps by like the wind, and goes on. He is indeed
    guilty, whose strength is his god.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Aren’t you from everlasting, Yahweh my God, my Holy One? We
    will not die. Yahweh, you have appointed him for judgment. You, Rock, have
    established him to punish.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] You who have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot
    look on perversity, why do you tolerate those who deal treacherously, and
    keep silent when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than
    he,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] and make men like the fish of the sea, like the creeping
    things, that have no ruler over them?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He takes up all of them with the hook. He catches them in
    his net, and gathers them in his dragnet. Therefore he rejoices and is glad.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to
    his dragnet, because by them his life is luxurious, and his food is good.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Will he therefore continually empty his net, and kill the
    nations without mercy? <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I will stand at my watch, and set myself on the ramparts,
    and will look out to see what he will say to me, and what I will answer
    concerning my complaint. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Yahweh answered me, “Write the vision, and make it plain on
    tablets, that he who runs may read it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hurries
    toward the end, and won’t prove false. Though it takes time, wait for it;
    because it will surely come. It won’t delay.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Behold, his soul is puffed up. It is not upright in him, but
    the righteous will live by his faith.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Yes, moreover, wine is treacherous. A haughty man who
    doesn’t stay at home, who enlarges his desire as Sheol, and he is like
    death, and can’t be satisfied, but gathers to himself all nations, and heaps
    to himself all peoples.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Won’t all these take up a parable against him, and a
    taunting proverb against him, and say, ‘Woe to him who increases that which
    is not his, and who enriches himself by extortion! How long?’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Won’t your debtors rise up suddenly, and wake up those who
    make you tremble, and you will be their victim?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of
    the peoples will plunder you, because of men’s blood, and for the violence
    done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may
    set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] You have devised shame to your house, by cutting off many
    peoples, and have sinned against your soul.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of
    the woodwork will answer it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a
    city by iniquity!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Behold, isn’t it of Yahweh of Armies that the peoples labor
    for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Yahweh’s
    glory, as the waters cover the sea. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] “Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink, pouring your
    inflaming wine until they are drunk, so that you may gaze at their naked
    bodies!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] You are filled with shame, and not glory. You will also
    drink, and be exposed! The cup of Yahweh’s right hand will come around to
    you, and disgrace will cover your glory.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and
    the destruction of the animals, which made them afraid; because of men’s
    blood, and for the violence done to the land, to every city and to those who
    dwell in them. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] “What value does the engraved image have, that its maker
    has engraved it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who
    fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Woe to him who says to the wood, ‘Awake!’ or to the mute
    stone, ‘Arise!’ Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and
    silver, and there is no breath at all in its midst.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] But Yahweh is in his holy temple. Let all the earth be
    silent before him!” <br>
    <br>

    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] A prayer of Habakkuk, the prophet, set to victorious music.
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Yahweh, I have heard of your fame.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I stand in awe of your deeds, Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Renew your work in the midst of the years.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the midst of the years make it known.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In wrath, you remember mercy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] God came from Teman,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the Holy One from Mount Paran.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0">His glory covered the heavens,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his praise filled the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] His splendor is like the sunrise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Rays shine from his hand, where his power is
      hidden.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Plague went before him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and pestilence followed his feet.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] He stood, and shook the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He looked, and made the nations tremble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The ancient mountains were crumbled.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The age-old hills collapsed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His ways are eternal.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The dwellings of the land of Midian trembled.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Was Yahweh displeased with the rivers?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Was your anger against the rivers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or your wrath against the sea,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that you rode on your horses,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">on your chariots of salvation?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] You uncovered your bow.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You called for your sworn arrows.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You split the earth with rivers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The mountains saw you, and were afraid.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The storm of waters passed by.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The deep roared and lifted up its hands on high.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The sun and moon stood still in the sky,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">at the light of your arrows as they went,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">at the shining of your glittering spear.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] You marched through the land in wrath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You threshed the nations in anger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] You went out for the salvation of your people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the salvation of your anointed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You crushed the head of the land of wickedness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You stripped them head to foot.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Selah.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] You pierced the heads of his warriors with their own
      spears.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They came as a whirlwind to scatter me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">gloating as if to devour the wretched in secret.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] You trampled the sea with your horses,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">churning mighty waters.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] I heard, and my body trembled.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My lips quivered at the voice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble in
      my place,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because I must wait quietly for the day of
      trouble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the coming up of the people who invade us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For though the fig tree doesn’t flourish,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor fruit be in the vines;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the labor of the olive fails,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the fields yield no food;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the flocks are cut off from the fold,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and there is no herd in the stalls:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] yet I will rejoice in Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Yahweh, the Lord, is my strength.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He makes my feet like deer’s feet,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and enables me to go in high places.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
