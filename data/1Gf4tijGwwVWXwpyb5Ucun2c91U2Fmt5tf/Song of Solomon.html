      <h1>Song of Solomon</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s. Beloved <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for your love is better than wine.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Your oils have a pleasing fragrance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your name is oil poured out,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">therefore the virgins love you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Take me away with you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let us hurry.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The king has brought me into his rooms.</span><br>
    <br>
    Friends <br>
    <span class="line indent0">We will be glad and rejoice in you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We will praise your love more than wine!</span><br>
    <br>
    Beloved <br>
    <span class="line indent0">They are right to love you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I am dark, but lovely,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">you daughters of Jerusalem,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like Kedar’s tents,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like Solomon’s curtains.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Don’t stare at me because I am dark,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because the sun has scorched me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My mother’s sons were angry with me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They made me keeper of the vineyards.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I haven’t kept my own vineyard.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Tell me, you whom my soul loves,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">where you graze your flock,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">where you rest them at noon;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For why should I be as one who is veiled</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">beside the flocks of your companions?</span><br>
    <br>
    Lover <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] If you don’t know, most beautiful among women,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">follow the tracks of the sheep.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Graze your young goats beside the shepherds’
      tents.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] I have compared you, my love,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your neck with strings of jewels.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] We will make you earrings of gold,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with studs of silver.</span><br>
    <br>
    Beloved <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] While the king sat at his table,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my perfume spread its fragrance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that lies between my breasts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from the vineyards of En Gedi.</span><br>
    <br>
    Lover <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Behold, you are beautiful, my love.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Behold, you are beautiful.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your eyes are doves.</span><br>
    <br>
    Beloved <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and our couch is verdant.</span><br>
    <br>
    Lover <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The beams of our house are cedars.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Our rafters are firs.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I am a rose of Sharon,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">a lily of the valleys.</span><br>
    <br>
    Lover <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] As a lily among thorns,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is my love among the daughters.</span><br>
    <br>
    Beloved <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is my beloved among the sons.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I sat down under his shadow with great delight,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his fruit was sweet to my taste.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He brought me to the banquet hall.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His banner over me is love.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Strengthen me with raisins,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">refresh me with apples;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For I am faint with love.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] His left hand is under my head.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His right hand embraces me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">by the roes, or by the hinds of the field,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that you not stir up, nor awaken love,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">until it so desires.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The voice of my beloved!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Behold, he comes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">leaping on the mountains,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">skipping on the hills.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] My beloved is like a roe or a young deer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Behold, he stands behind our wall!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He looks in at the windows.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He glances through the lattice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] My beloved spoke, and said to me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come
      away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For, behold, the winter is past.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The rain is over and gone.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The flowers appear on the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The time of the singing has come,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our
      land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The fig tree ripens her green figs.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The vines are in blossom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They give out their fragrance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Arise, my love, my beautiful one,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and come away.”</span><br>
    <br>
    Lover <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] My dove in the clefts of the rock,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the hiding places of the mountainside,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let me see your face.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let me hear your voice;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Catch for us the foxes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the little foxes that plunder the vineyards;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for our vineyards are in blossom.</span><br>
    <br>
    Beloved <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] My beloved is mine, and I am his.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He browses among the lilies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">turn, my beloved,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and be like a roe or a young deer on the
      mountains of Bether.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] By night on my bed, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">I sought him whom my soul loves.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I sought him, but I didn’t find him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I will get up now, and go about the city;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the streets and in the squares I will seek him
      whom my soul loves.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I sought him, but I didn’t find him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] The watchmen who go about the city found me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I had scarcely passed from them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when I found him whom my soul loves.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I held him, and would not let him go,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">until I had brought him into my mother’s house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">into the room of her who conceived me.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">by the roes, or by the hinds of the field,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that you not stir up, nor awaken love,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">until it so desires.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars
      of smoke,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with all spices of the merchant?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Sixty mighty men are around it,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of the mighty men of Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] They all handle the sword, and are expert in war.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Every man has his sword on his thigh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because of fear in the night.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] King Solomon made himself a carriage</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of the wood of Lebanon.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He made its pillars of silver,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">its bottom of gold, its seat of purple,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">its midst being paved with love,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from the daughters of Jerusalem.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Go out, you daughters of Zion, and see king Solomon,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with the crown with which his mother has crowned
      him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the day of his weddings,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the day of the gladness of his heart.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Behold, you are beautiful, my love. <br>
    <span class="line indent0">Behold, you are beautiful.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your eyes are doves behind your veil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your hair is as a flock of goats,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that descend from Mount Gilead.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which have come up from the washing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">where every one of them has twins.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">None is bereaved among them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Your lips are like scarlet thread.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your mouth is lovely.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate
      behind your veil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Your neck is like David’s tower built for an armory,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whereon a thousand shields hang,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">all the shields of the mighty men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Your two breasts are like two fawns</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that are twins of a roe,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which feed among the lilies.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will go to the mountain of myrrh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to the hill of frankincense.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] You are all beautiful, my love.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is no spot in you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with me from Lebanon.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Look from the top of Amana,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from the top of Senir and Hermon,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from the lions’ dens,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from the mountains of the leopards.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with one chain of your neck.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">How much better is your love than wine!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The fragrance of your perfumes than all kinds of
      spices!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Honey and milk are under your tongue.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The smell of your garments is like the smell of
      Lebanon.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] A locked up garden is my sister, my bride;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a locked up spring,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a sealed fountain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious
      fruits:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">henna with spikenard plants,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] spikenard and saffron,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense
      tree;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] a fountain of gardens,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a well of living waters,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">flowing streams from Lebanon.</span><br>
    <br>
    Beloved <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Awake, north wind; and come, you south!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Blow on my garden, that its spices may flow out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let my beloved come into his garden,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and taste his precious fruits.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have drunk my wine with my milk.</span><br>
    <br>
    Friends <br>
    <span class="line indent0">Eat, friends!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.</span><br>
    <br>
    Beloved <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I was asleep, but my heart was awake.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It is the voice of my beloved who knocks:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my
      undefiled;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for my head is filled with dew,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and my hair with the dampness of the night.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My heart pounded for him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I rose up to open for my beloved.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My hands dripped with myrrh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my fingers with liquid myrrh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">on the handles of the lock.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I opened to my beloved;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but my beloved left; and had gone away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My heart went out when he spoke.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I looked for him, but I didn’t find him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I called him, but he didn’t answer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The watchmen who go about the city found me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They beat me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They bruised me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from
      me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If you find my beloved,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that you tell him that I am faint with love.</span><br>
    <br>
    Friends <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] How is your beloved better than another beloved,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">you fairest among women?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">How is your beloved better than another beloved,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that you do so adjure us?</span><br>
    <br>
    Beloved <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] My beloved is white and ruddy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The best among ten thousand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] His head is like the purest gold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His hair is bushy, black as a raven.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">washed with milk, mounted like jewels.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of
      perfumes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His body is like ivory work overlaid with
      sapphires.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of
      fine gold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the
      cedars.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] His mouth is sweetness;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, he is altogether lovely.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">This is my beloved, and this is my friend,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">daughters of Jerusalem.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 6</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Where has your beloved gone, you fairest among women?<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek
      him with you?</span><br>
    <br>
    Beloved <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] My beloved has gone down to his garden,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to the beds of spices,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He browses among the lilies,</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">lovely as Jerusalem,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">awesome as an army with banners.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Turn away your eyes from me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for they have overcome me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your hair is like a flock of goats,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that lie along the side of Gilead.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Your teeth are like a flock of ewes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which have come up from the washing;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of which every one has twins;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">no one is bereaved among them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your
      veil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] There are sixty queens, eighty concubines,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and virgins without number.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] My dove, my perfect one, is unique.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She is her mother’s only daughter.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She is the favorite one of her who bore her.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The daughters saw her, and called her blessed;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the queens and the concubines, and they praised
      her.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Who is she who looks out as the morning,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">beautiful as the moon,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">clear as the sun,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and awesome as an army with banners?</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I went down into the nut tree grove,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to see the green plants of the valley,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to see whether the vine budded,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the pomegranates were in flower.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Without realizing it,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my desire set me with my royal people’s chariots.</span><br>
    <br>
    Friends <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Return, return, Shulammite!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Return, return, that we may gaze at you.</span><br>
    <br>
    Lover <br>
    <span class="line indent0">Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as at the dance of Mahanaim?</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 7</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] How beautiful are your feet in sandals, prince’s daughter! <br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your rounded thighs are like jewels,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the work of the hands of a skillful workman.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Your body is like a round goblet,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">no mixed wine is wanting.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your waist is like a heap of wheat,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">set about with lilies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Your two breasts are like two fawns,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that are twins of a roe.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Your neck is like an ivory tower.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the
      gate of Bathrabbim.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which
      looks toward Damascus.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Your head on you is like Carmel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The hair of your head like purple.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The king is held captive in its tresses.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] How beautiful and how pleasant you are,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">love, for delights!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] This, your stature, is like a palm tree,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your breasts like its fruit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] I said, “I will climb up into the palm tree.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will take hold of its fruit.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the smell of your breath like apples,</span><br>
    <br>
    Beloved <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Your mouth like the best wine,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that goes down smoothly for my beloved,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I am my beloved’s.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His desire is toward me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Come, my beloved, let us go out into the field.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let us lodge in the villages.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Let’s go early up to the vineyards.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let’s see whether the vine has budded,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">its blossom is open,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the pomegranates are in flower.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There I will give you my love.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The mandrakes produce fragrance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">At our doors are all kinds of precious fruits,
      new and old,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which I have stored up for you, my beloved.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 8</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Oh that you were like my brother, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">who nursed from the breasts of my mother!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If I found you outside, I would kiss you;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, and no one would despise me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I would lead you, bringing you into my mother’s house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who would instruct me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I would have you drink spiced wine,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of the juice of my pomegranate.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] His left hand would be under my head.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His right hand would embrace me.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that you not stir up, nor awaken love,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">until it so desires.</span><br>
    <br>
    Friends <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Who is this who comes up from the wilderness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">leaning on her beloved?</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0">Under the apple tree I aroused you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There your mother conceived you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There she was in labor and bore you.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Set me as a seal on your heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as a seal on your arm;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for love is strong as death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Its flashes are flashes of fire,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a very flame of Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Many waters can’t quench love,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither can floods drown it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If a man would give all the wealth of his house
      for love,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he would be utterly scorned.</span><br>
    <br>
    Friends <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] We have a little sister.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She has no breasts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">What shall we do for our sister</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the day when she is to be spoken for?</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] If she is a wall,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">we will build on her a turret of silver.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">if she is a door,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">we will enclose her with boards of cedar.</span><br>
    <br>
    Beloved <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I am a wall, and my breasts like towers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">then I was in his eyes like one who found peace.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He leased out the vineyard to keepers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver
      for its fruit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] My own vineyard is before me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The thousand are for you, Solomon;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">two hundred for those who tend its fruit.</span><br>
    <br>
    Lover <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">let me hear your voice!</span><br>
    <br>
    Beloved <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Come away, my beloved!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the
      mountains of spices!</span><br>
