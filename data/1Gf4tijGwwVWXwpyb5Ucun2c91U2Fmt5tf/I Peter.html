      <h1>I Peter</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen ones who
    are living as foreigners in the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
    Asia, and Bithynia,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in
    sanctification of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ and be
    sprinkled with his blood: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
    according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope
    through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesn’t
    fade away, reserved in Heaven for you,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a
    salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while,
    if need be, you have been put to grief in various trials,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than
    gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result
    in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ—<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] whom not having known you love; in whom, though now you
    don’t see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and
    full of glory—<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your
    souls.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched
    diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of
    Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings of
    Christ, and the glories that would follow them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to
    you, they ministered these things, which now have been announced to you
    through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out
    from heaven; which things angels desire to look into. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Therefore prepare your minds for action, be sober and set
    your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation
    of Jesus Christ—<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves
    according to your former lusts as in your ignorance,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also
    be holy in all of your behavior;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] because it is written, “You shall be holy; for I am holy.”<a
      href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=I+Peter+1%3A16"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] If you call on him as Father, who without respect of
    persons judges according to each man’s work, pass the time of your living as
    foreigners here in reverent fear:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible
    things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from
    your fathers,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] but with precious blood, as of a faultless and pure lamb,
    the blood of Christ;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the
    world, but was revealed at the end of times for your sake,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] who through him are believers in God, who raised him from
    the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to
    the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection, love one
    another from the heart fervently:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
    incorruptible, through the word of God, which lives and remains forever.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] For, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“All flesh is like grass,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and all of man’s glory like the flower in the
      grass.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The grass withers, and its flower falls;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] but the Lord’s word endures forever.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=I+Peter+1%3A25"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This is the word of Good News which was preached to you. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit,
    hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] as newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word, that
    with it you may grow,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] coming to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but
    chosen by God, precious.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual
    house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable
    to God through Jesus Christ.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Because it is contained in Scripture, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone,
      chosen, and precious:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who believes in him will not be disappointed.”<a
        href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=2&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=I+Peter+2%3A6"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For you who believe therefore is the honor, but for those
    who are disobedient, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“The stone which the builders rejected,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">has become the chief cornerstone,”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=I+Peter+2%3A7"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] and, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense.”<a
        href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=I+Peter+2%3A8"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were
    appointed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy
    nation, a people for God’s own possession, that you may proclaim the
    excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] who in time past were no people, but now are God’s people,
    who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain
    from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which
    they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they
    see, glorify God in the day of visitation.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for
    the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers
    and for praise to those who do well.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] For this is the will of God, that by well-doing you should
    put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of
    wickedness, but as bondservants of God. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the
    king.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear;
    not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering
    unjustly, because of conscience toward God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure
    beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is
    commendable with God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered
    for us, leaving you an example, that you should follow his steps,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] who did not sin, “neither was deceit found in his mouth.”<a
      href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=I+Peter+2%3A22"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Who, when he was cursed, didn’t curse back. When he
    suffered, didn’t threaten, but committed himself to him who judges
    righteously;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree,
    that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose stripes
    you were healed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] For you were going astray like sheep; but now have returned
    to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] In the same way, wives, be in subjection to your own
    husbands; so that, even if any don’t obey the Word, they may be won by the
    behavior of their wives without a word;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] seeing your pure behavior in fear.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding
    the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on fine clothing;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] but in the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible
    adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God very
    precious.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For this is how the holy women before, who hoped in God also
    adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children
    you now are, if you do well, and are not put in fear by any terror. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] You husbands, in the same way, live with your wives
    according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman, as to the weaker vessel,
    as being also joint heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers may not be
    hindered. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Finally, be all like-minded, compassionate, loving as
    brothers, tender hearted, courteous,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] not rendering evil for evil, or insult for insult; but
    instead blessing; knowing that to this were you called, that you may inherit
    a blessing.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“He who would love life,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and see good days,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">let him keep his tongue from evil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his lips from speaking deceit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Let him turn away from evil, and do good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his ears open to their prayer;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the face of the Lord is against those who do
      evil.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=I+Peter+3%3A12"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Now who is he who will harm you, if you become imitators of
    that which is good?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you
    are blessed. “Don’t fear what they fear, neither be troubled.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=I+Peter+3%3A14"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and always be
    ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the
    hope that is in you, with humility and fear:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] having a good conscience; that, while you are spoken
    against as evildoers, they may be disappointed who curse your good way of
    life in Christ.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For it is better, if it is God’s will, that you suffer for
    doing well than for doing evil.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous
    for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God; being put to death in
    the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] in which he also went and preached to the spirits in
    prison,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] who before were disobedient, when God waited patiently in
    the days of Noah, while the ship was being built. In it, few, that is, eight
    souls, were saved through water.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you—not the
    putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience
    toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven,
    angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm
    yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has
    ceased from sin;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the
    flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For we have spent enough of our past time doing the desire
    of the Gentiles, and having walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges,
    orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] They think it is strange that you don’t run with them into
    the same excess of riot, blaspheming:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] who will give account to him who is ready to judge the
    living and the dead.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead,
    that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh, but live as to God in
    the spirit.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But the end of all things is near. Therefore be of sound
    mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] And above all things be earnest in your love among
    yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] As each has received a gift, employ it in serving one
    another, as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] If anyone speaks, let it be as it were the very words of
    God. If anyone serves, let it be as of the strength which God supplies, that
    in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the
    glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Beloved, don’t be astonished at the fiery trial which has
    come upon you, to test you, as though a strange thing happened to you.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] But because you are partakers of Christ’s sufferings,
    rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with
    exceeding joy.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are
    blessed; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. On their part
    he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an
    evil doer, or a meddler in other men’s matters.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him
    not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this matter.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For the time has come for judgment to begin with the
    household of God. If it begins first with us, what will happen to those who
    don’t obey the Good News of God?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] “If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will
    happen to the ungodly and the sinner?”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=I+Peter+4%3A18"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of
    God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a
    witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory
    that will be revealed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the
    oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, not for dishonest gain,
    but willingly;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] neither as lording it over those entrusted to you, but
    making yourselves examples to the flock.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the
    crown of glory that doesn’t fade away. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes,
    all of you clothe yourselves with humility, to subject yourselves to one
    another; for “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=I+Peter+5%3A5"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God,
    that he may exalt you in due time;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary,
    the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your
    brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] But may the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal
    glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, perfect,
    establish, strengthen, and settle you.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] To him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him,
    I have written to you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the
    true grace of God in which you stand.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets
    you; and so does Mark, my son.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all
    who are in Christ Jesus. Amen. <br>
