      <h1>Matthew</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
    the son of Abraham.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father
    of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez
    became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Ram became the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the
    father of Nahshon. Nahshon became the father of Salmon.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the
    father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Jesse became the father of King David. David became the
    father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Solomon became the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the
    father of Abijah. Abijah became the father of Asa.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the
    father of Joram. Joram became the father of Uzziah.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Uzziah became the father of Jotham. Jotham became the father
    of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the
    father of Amon. Amon became the father of Josiah.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at
    the time of the exile to Babylon.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of
    Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the
    father of Eliakim. Eliakim became the father of Azor.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Azor became the father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of
    Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Eliud became the father of Eleazar. Eleazar became the
    father of Matthan. Matthan became the father of Jacob.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary,
    from whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
    generations; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and
    from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this; for after his
    mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was
    found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing
    to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of
    the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be
    afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in
    her is of the Holy Spirit.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] She shall give birth to a son. You shall call his name
    Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which
    was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] “Behold, the virgin shall be with child,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and shall give birth to a son.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They shall call his name Immanuel”;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+1%3A23"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the
    Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to
    her firstborn son. He named him Jesus. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
    King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his
    star in the east, and have come to worship him.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem
    with him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the
    people, he asked them where the Christ would be born.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is
    written through the prophet, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] ‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">are in no way least among the princes of Judah:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for out of you shall come a governor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+2%3A6"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from
    them exactly what time the star appeared.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search
    diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so
    that I also may come and worship him.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the
    star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood
    over where the young child was.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly
    great joy.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary,
    his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures,
    they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Being warned in a dream that they shouldn’t return to
    Herod, they went back to their own country another way. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord
    appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise and take the young child and
    his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod
    will seek the young child to destroy him.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] He arose and took the young child and his mother by night,
    and departed into Egypt,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be
    fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of
    Egypt I called my son.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+2%3A15"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men,
    was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children who
    were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old
    and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise
    men.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was
    fulfilled, saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] “A voice was heard in Ramah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">lamentation, weeping and great mourning,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Rachel weeping for her children;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">she wouldn’t be comforted,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because they are no more.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+2%3A18"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord
    appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into
    the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child’s life are dead.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came
    into the land of Israel.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in
    the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a
    dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might
    be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a
    Nazarene.” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the
    wilderness of Judea, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet,
    saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“The voice of one crying in the wilderness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">make ready the way of the Lord.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Make his paths straight.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+3%3A3"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Now John himself wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a
    leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region
    around the Jordan went out to him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] They were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their
    sins.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming
    for his baptism, he said to them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you
    to flee from the wrath to come?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Don’t think to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’
    for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these
    stones. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] “Even now the ax lies at the root of the trees. Therefore
    every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down, and cast into the
    fire.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who
    comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He
    will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly
    cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the
    chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be
    baptized by him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] But John would have hindered him, saying, “I need to be
    baptized by you, and you come to me?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] But Jesus, answering, said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all
      righteousness.”</span> Then he allowed him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the
    water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God
    descending as a dove, and coming on him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is my
    beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to
    be tempted by the devil.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
    hungry afterward.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of
    God, command that these stones become bread.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] But he answered, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “It is
      written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that
      proceeds out of the mouth of God.’”</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+4%3A4"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on
    the pinnacle of the temple,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself
    down, for it is written, ‘He will put his angels in charge of you.’ and, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘On their hands they will bear you up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so that you don’t dash your foot against a
      stone.’”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+4%3A6"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Again, it
      is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord, your God.’”</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+4%3A7"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain,
    and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He said to him, “I will give you all of these things, if you
    will fall down and worship me.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Then Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Get
      behind me,</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Satan! For it is written,
      ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”</span>
    <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=2&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+4%3A10"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served
    him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he
    withdrew into Galilee.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is
    by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah
    the prophet, saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] “The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Galilee of the Gentiles,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] the people who sat in darkness saw a great light,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to those who sat in the region and shadow of
      death,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to them light has dawned.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+4%3A16"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon,
    who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea;
    for they were fishermen.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Come after
      me, and I will make you fishers for men.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] They immediately left their nets and followed him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the
    son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father,
    mending their nets. He called them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] They immediately left the boat and their father, and
    followed him. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their
    synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every
    disease and every sickness among the people.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] The report about him went out into all Syria. They brought
    to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments,
    possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea
    and from beyond the Jordan followed him. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he
    had sat down, his disciples came to him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He opened his mouth and taught them, saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Blessed are the poor in

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] When Jesus had finished saying these things, the multitudes
    were astonished at his teaching,<br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 8</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying,
    “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, <span
      class="wordsOfJesus"> “I want to. Be made clean.”</span> Immediately his
    leprosy was cleansed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “See that
      you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift
      that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking
    him,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] and saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed,
    grievously tormented.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I will come
      and heal him.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to
    come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For I am also a man under authority, having under myself
    soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and
    he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who
    followed, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t
      found so great a faith, not even in Israel. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I tell you that many will come
      from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and
      Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> but the children of the
      Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping
      and gnashing of teeth.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Jesus said to the centurion, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.”</span> His
    servant was healed in that hour. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s
    mother lying sick with a fever.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and
    served him. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with
    demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah
    the prophet, saying: “He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+8%3A17"><small><sup

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] A scribe came, and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you
    wherever you go.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The foxes

      nowhere to lay his head.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first
    to go and bury my father.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] But Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Follow
      me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that
    the boat was covered with the waves, but he was asleep.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] They came to him, and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord!
    We are dying!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Why are you
      fearful, O you of little faith?” </span> Then he got up, rebuked the wind
    and the sea, and there was a great calm. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] The men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that
    even the wind and the sea obey him?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] When he came to the other side, into the country of the
    Gergesenes, two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the
    tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Behold, they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with
    you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from
    them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] The demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, permit
    us to go away into the herd of pigs.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Go!”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of
    pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and
    told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with
    demons.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw
    him, they begged that he would depart from their borders. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 9</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] He entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his
    own city.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying
    on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man
    blasphemes.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Why do you think evil in your hearts? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For which is easier, to say,
      ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Get up, and walk?’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But that you may know that the
      Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...”</span> (then he said
    to the paralytic), <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Get up, and take up your
      mat, and go up to your house.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] He arose and departed to his house.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified
    God, who had given such authority to men. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew
    sitting at the tax collection office. He said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Follow me.”</span> He got up and followed him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] As he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and
    sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, “Why
    does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] When Jesus heard it, he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are
      sick do. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But you go and learn what this
      means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+9%3A13"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><span class="wordsOfJesus"> for I came
      not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      ”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Then John’s disciples came to him, saying, “Why do we and
    the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don’t fast?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Can the
      friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them?
      But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them,
      and then they will fast. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> No one puts a piece of
      unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the
      garment, and a worse hole is made. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Neither do people put new wine
      into old wine skins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be
      spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wine
      skins, and both are preserved.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came
    and worshiped him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your
    hand on her, and she will live.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years
    came behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] for she said within herself, “If I just touch his garment,
    I will be made well.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Daughter, cheer up! Your faith has made you well.”</span> And the woman
    was made well from that hour. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] When Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute
    players, and the crowd in noisy disorder,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Make room,
      because the girl isn’t dead, but sleeping.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    They were ridiculing him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] But when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by
    the hand, and the girl arose.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] The report of this went out into all that land.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] As Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him,
    calling out and saying, “Have mercy on us, son of David!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him.
    Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Do you believe that I am
      able to do this?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    They told him, “Yes, Lord.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Then he touched their eyes, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “According to your faith be it done to you.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly commanded them,
    saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “See that no one knows about this.”</span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that
    land. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon
    possessed was brought to him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The
    multitudes marveled, saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in
    Israel!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] But the Pharisees said, “By the prince of the demons, he
    casts out demons.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching
    in their synagogues, and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing
    every disease and every sickness among the people.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with
    compassion for them, because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep
    without a shepherd.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] Then he said to his disciples, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Pray therefore that the Lord
      of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 10</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them
    authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease
    and every sickness.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first,
    Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee;
    John, his brother;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector;
    James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called Thaddaeus;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Simon the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed
    him. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Jesus sent these twelve out, and commanded them, saying, <span
      class="wordsOfJesus"> “Don’t go among the Gentiles, and don’t enter into
      any city of the Samaritans. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Rather, go to the lost sheep of
      the house of Israel. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> As you go, preach, saying, ‘The
      Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Heal the sick, cleanse the
      lepers</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> , and cast out demons. Freely
      you received, so freely give. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Don’t take any gold, nor
      silver, nor brass in your money belts. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Take no bag for your journey,
      neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his
      food. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Into whatever city or village
      you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> As you enter into the
      household, greet it. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If the household is worthy,
      let your peace come on it, but if it isn’t worthy, let your peace return
      to you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Whoever doesn’t receive you,
      nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake off
      the dust from your feet. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Most certainly I tell you, it
      will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
      judgment than for that city.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Behold, I send you out as
      sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless
      as doves. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But beware of men: for they
      will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge
      you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Yes, and you will be brought
      before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the
      nations. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But when they deliver you up,
      don’t be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in
      that hour what you will say. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For it is not you who speak,
      but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Brother will deliver up
      brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against
      parents, and cause them to be put to death. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> You will be hated by all men
      for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But when they persecute you in
      this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I tell you, you will not
      have gone through the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man has come.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “A disciple is not above his
      teacher, nor a servant above his lord. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> It is enough for the disciple
      that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have
      called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his
      household! </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Therefore don’t be afraid of
      them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden
      that will not be known. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> What I tell you in the
      darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear,
      proclaim on the housetops. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Don’t be afraid of those who
      kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is
      able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Aren’t two sparrows sold for

    <center>Chapter 11</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] When Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he
    departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Now when John heard in the prison the works of Christ, he
    sent two of his disciples<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] and said to him, “Are you he who comes, or should we look
    for another?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Jesus answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Go and
      tell John the things which you hear and see: </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> the blind receive their sight,
      the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+11%3A5"><small><sup

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Blessed is he who finds no
      occasion for stumbling in me.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] As these went their way, Jesus began to say to the
    multitudes concerning John, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “What did you go
      out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But what did you go out to see?
      A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in king’s
      houses. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But why did you go out? To see
      a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For this is he, of whom it is
      written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Most certainly I tell you,
      among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than
      John the Baptizer; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater
      than he. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> From the days of John the
      Baptizer until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the
      violent take it by force.</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For all the prophets and the

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If you are willing to receive

      him hear.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But to what shall I compare
      this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call

      for you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned for you, and you didn’t lament.’

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For John came neither eating
      nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The Son of Man came eating and
      drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend
      of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by her children.</span>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> ”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his
    mighty works had been done, because they didn’t repent.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to
      you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon
      which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and
      ashes. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But I tell you, it will be
      more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> You, Capernaum, who are
      exalted to heaven, you will go down to Hades. </span> <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it
      would have remained until this day. </span> <br>

      more tolerable for the land of Sodom, on the day of judgment, than for
      you.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] At that time, Jesus answered, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things
      from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Yes, Father, for so it was
      well-pleasing in your sight. </span> <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Come to me, all you who labor

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the
    grain fields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain
    and to eat.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, “Behold,
    your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] But he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Haven’t
      you read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him;
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> how he entered into God’s
      house, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat,
      neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests?</span> <a

      than the temple is here. </span> <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For the Son of Man is Lord of
      the Sabbath.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He departed there, and went into their synagogue.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] And behold there was a man with a withered hand. They asked
    him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?” that they might accuse him.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “What man is
      there among you, who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on
      the Sabbath day, won’t he grab on to it, and lift it out? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Of how much more value then is
      a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day.”</span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Then he told the man, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Stretch
      out your hand.”</span> He stretched it out; and it was restored whole,
    just like the other.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] But the Pharisees went out, and conspired against him, how
    they might destroy him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there. Great
    multitudes followed him; and he healed them all,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] and commanded them that they should not make him known:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah
    the prophet, saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0">He won’t quench a smoking flax,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">until he leads justice to victory.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought
    to him and he healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] All the multitudes were amazed, and said, “Can this be the
    son of David?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “This man does
    not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every
      city or house divided against itself will not stand. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If Satan casts out Satan, he
      is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If I by Beelzebul cast out
      demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be
      your judges. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But if I by the Spirit of God
      cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Or how can one enter into the
      house of the strong man, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the
      strong man? Then he will plunder his house.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He who is not with me is
      against me, and he who doesn’t gather with me, scatters. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Therefore I tell you, every
      sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the
      Spirit will not be forgiven men. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Whoever speaks a word against
      the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the
      Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that
      which is to come.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Either make the tree good,
      and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; for
      the tree is known by its fruit. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> You offspring of vipers, how
      can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the
      heart, the mouth speaks. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The good man out of his good
      treasure brings out good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure</span>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> brings out evil things. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I tell you that every idle
      word that men speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For by your words you will be
      justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered,
    “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] But he answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “An evil
      and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given it
      but the sign of Jonah the prophet. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For as Jonah was three days
      and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be
      three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The men of Nineveh will stand
      up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for they
      repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, someone greater than Jonah
      is here. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The queen of the south will
      rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for she
      came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold,
      someone greater than Solomon is here. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But the unclean spirit, when
      he is gone out of the man, passes through waterless places, seeking rest,
      and doesn’t find it. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Then he says, ‘I will return
      into my house from which I came out,’ and when he has come back, he finds
      it empty, swept, and put in order. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Then he goes, and takes with
      himself seven other spirits more evil than he is, and they enter in and
      dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even
      so will it be also to this evil generation.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his
    mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] One said to him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers
    stand outside, seeking to speak to you.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] But he answered him who spoke to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] He stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said,
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Behold, my mother and my brothers! </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For whoever does the will of
      my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.”</span>

    <br>
    <center>Chapter 13</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the
    seaside.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a
    boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Behold, a farmer went out to sow. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> As he sowed, some seeds fell by
      the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Others fell on rocky ground,
      where they didn’t have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because
      they had no depth of earth. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When the sun had risen, they
      were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Others fell among thorns. The
      thorns grew up and choked them. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Others fell on good soil, and
      yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some
      thirty. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He who has ears to hear, let
      him hear.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The disciples came, and said to him, “Why do you speak to
    them in parables?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] He answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “To you it
      is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not
      given to them. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For whoever has, to him will
      be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever doesn’t have, from him
      will be taken away even that which he has. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Therefore I speak to them in
      parables, because seeing they don’t see, and hearing, they don’t hear,
      neither do they understand. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> In them the prophecy of Isaiah
      is fulfilled, which says, </span> <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> ‘By hearing you will

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But blessed are your eyes,
      for they see; and your ears, for they hear. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For most certainly I tell you
      that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you
      see, and didn’t see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and
      didn’t hear them.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Hear, then, the parable of
      the farmer. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When anyone hears the word of
      the Kingdom, and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches
      away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the
      roadside. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> What was sown on the rocky
      places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives
      it; </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> yet he has no root in himself,
      but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of
      the word, immediately he stumbles. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> What was sown among the
      thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the
      deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> What was sown on the good
      ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most
      certainly bears fruit, and produces, some one hundred times as much, some
      sixty, and some thirty.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] He set another parable before them, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field, </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> but while people slept, his
      enemy came and sowed darnel weeds </span> <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      also among the wheat, and went away. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But when the blade sprang up
      and produced fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The servants of the
      householder came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your
      field? Where did this darnel come from?’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He said to them, ‘An enemy
      has done this.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go
      and gather them up?’ </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But he said, ‘No, lest
      perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with
      them. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Let both grow together until
      the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, “First,
      gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but
      gather the wheat into my barn.”’”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] He set another parable before them, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took,
      and sowed in his field; </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> which indeed is smaller than
      all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes
      a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] He spoke another parable to them. <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three
      measures</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> of meal, until it was all
      leavened.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes;
    and without a parable, he didn’t speak to them,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the
    prophet, saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“I will open my mouth in parables;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will utter things hidden from the foundation of
      the world.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+13%3A35"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the
    house. His disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the
    darnel weeds of the field.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] He answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He who sows
      the good seed is the Son of Man, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> the field is the world; and
      the good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds
      are the children of the evil one. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The enemy who sowed them is
      the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> As therefore the darnel weeds
      are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this
      age. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The Son of Man will send out
      his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause
      stumbling, and those who do iniquity, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and will cast them into the
      furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Then the righteous will shine
      like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let
      him hear.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Again, the Kingdom of Heaven
      is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his
      joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Again, the Kingdom of Heaven
      is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> who having found one pearl of
      great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Again, the Kingdom of Heaven
      is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of
      every kind, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> which, when it was filled,
      they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into
      containers, but the bad they threw away. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> So will it be in the end of
      the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the
      righteous, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and will cast them into the
      furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.”</span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[51] Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Have you
      understood all these things?” </span> <br>
    <br>
    They answered him, “Yes, Lord.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[52] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Therefore
      every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like
      a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old
      things.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[53] When Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from
    there.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[54] Coming into his own country, he taught them in their
    synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get
    this wisdom, and these mighty works?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[55] Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother called
    Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[56] Aren’t all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man
    get all of these things?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[57] They were offended by him. <br>
    <br>
    But Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “A prophet is not
      without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[58] He didn’t do many mighty works there because of their
    unbelief. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 14</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning
    Jesus,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptizer. He is
    risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him
    in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For John said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have
    her.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] When he would have put him to death, he feared the
    multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias
    danced among them and pleased Herod.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she
    should ask.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] She, being prompted by her mother, said, “Give me here on a
    platter the head of John the Baptizer.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of
    those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] His head was brought on a platter, and given to the young
    lady: and she brought it to her mother.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] His disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and
    they went and told Jesus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a
    boat, to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed
    him on foot from the cities. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had
    compassion on them, and healed their sick.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying,
    “This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes
    away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] But Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “They
      don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] They told him, “We only have here five loaves and two
    fish.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] He said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Bring them here to
      me.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and
    he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he
    blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave
    to the multitudes.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets
    full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women
    and children. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and
    to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the
    mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed
    by the waves, for the wind was contrary.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them,
    walking on the sea.<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=2&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+14%3A25"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
    troubled, saying, “It’s a ghost!” and they cried out for fear.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Cheer up! It is I! </span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Don’t be
      afraid.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command
    me to come to you on the waters.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] He said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Come!”</span> <br>
    <br>
    Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid,
    and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him,
    and said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “You of little faith, why did
      you doubt?”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying,
    “You are truly the Son of God!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] When they had crossed over, they came to the land of
    Gennesaret.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] When the people of that place recognized him, they sent
    into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe
    of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 15</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem,
    saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders?
    For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Why do you
      also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For God commanded, ‘Honor your
      father and your mother,’</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+15%3A4"><small><sup

          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But you say, ‘Whoever may tell
      his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten
      from me is a gift devoted to God,” </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> he shall not honor his father
      or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your
      tradition. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> And in vain do they worship

            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He summoned the multitude, and said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Hear, and understand. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> That which enters into the
      mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth,
      this defiles the man.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Then the disciples came, and said to him, “Do you know that
    the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] But he answered, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Every plant
      which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Leave them alone. They are
      blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall
      into a pit.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] So Jesus said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Do you also
      still not understand? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Don’t you understand that
      whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the
      body? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But the things which proceed
      out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For out of the heart come evil
      thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and
      blasphemies. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> These are the things which
      defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of
    Tyre and Sidon.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and
    cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is
    severely possessed by a demon!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] But he answered her not a word. <br>
    <br>
    His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries
    after us.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] But he answered, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I wasn’t
      sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] But he answered, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “It is not
      appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs
    which fall from their masters’ table.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Then Jesus answered her, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.”</span>
    And her daughter was healed from that hour. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee;
    and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame,
    blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He
    healed them,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute
    speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and blind seeing—and they glorified
    the God of Israel. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] Jesus summoned his disciples and said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now
      three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away
      fasting, or they might faint on the way.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] The disciples said to him, “Where should we get so many
    loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “How many
      loaves do you have?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks
    and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the
    multitudes.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets
    full of the broken pieces that were left over.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and
    children.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and
    came into the borders of Magdala. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 16</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him
    to show them a sign from heaven.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] But he answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “When it
      is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’ </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> In the morning, ‘It will be
      foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You
      know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can’t discern the
      signs of the times! </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> An evil and adulterous
      generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it,
      except the sign of the prophet Jonah.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    He left them, and departed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to
    take bread.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Take heed
      and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They reasoned among themselves, saying, “We brought no
    bread.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Jesus, perceiving it, said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, ‘because you
      have brought no bread?’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Don’t you yet perceive, neither
      remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you
      took up? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Nor the seven loaves for the
      four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> How is it that you don’t
      perceive that I didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the
      yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Then they understood that he didn’t tell them to beware of
    the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he
    asked his disciples, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Who do men say
      that I, the Son of Man, am?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] They said, “Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and
    others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But who do
      you say that I am?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the
    living God.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Jesus answered him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Blessed
      are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to
      you, but my Father who is in heaven. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I also tell you that you are
      Peter,</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and on this rock </span> <span
      class="wordsOfJesus"> I will build my assembly, and the gates of Hades</span>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> will not prevail against it. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I will give to you the keys of
      the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound
      in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in
      heaven.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no
    one that he was Jesus the Christ.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he
    must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests,
    and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far
    be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] But he turned, and said to Peter, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not
      setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.”</span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Then Jesus said to his disciples, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
      cross, and follow me. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For whoever desires to save
      his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will
      find it. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For what will it profit a man,
      if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what will a man
      give in exchange for his life? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For the Son of Man will come
      in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to
      everyone according to his deeds. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Most certainly I tell you,
      there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they
      see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 17</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John
    his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the
    sun, and his garments became as white as the light.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Peter answered, and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us
    to be here. If you want, let’s make three tents here: one for you, one for
    Moses, and one for Elijah.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud
    overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is
    my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and
    were very afraid.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Jesus came and touched them and said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Get up, and don’t be afraid.” </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded
    them, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Don’t tell anyone what you saw,
      until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] His disciples asked him, saying, “Then why do the scribes
    say that Elijah must come first?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Jesus answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Elijah
      indeed comes first, and will restore all things, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> but I tell you that Elijah has
      come already, and they didn’t recognize him, but did to him whatever they
      wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John
    the Baptizer. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] When they came to the multitude, a man came to him,
    kneeling down to him, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] “Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and
    suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the
    water.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure
    him.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Jesus answered, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Faithless and
      perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear
      with you? Bring him here to me.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy
    was cured from that hour. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, “Why
    weren’t we able to cast it out?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Because of
      your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain
      of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’
      and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But this kind doesn’t go out
      except by prayer and fasting.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, <span

    <br>
    They were exceedingly sorry.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the
    didrachma coins came to Peter, and said, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the
    didrachma?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] He said, “Yes.” <br>
    <br>
    When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive
      toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Peter said to him, “From strangers.” <br>
    <br>
    Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Therefore the children are

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But, lest we cause them to

    <center>Chapter 18</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then
    is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in their
    midst,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] and said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Most certainly I
      tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no
      way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Whoever therefore humbles
      himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of
      Heaven. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Whoever receives one such
      little child in my name receives me, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> but whoever causes one of these
      little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him that
      a huge millstone should be hung around his neck, and that he should be
      sunk in the depths of the sea. </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Woe to the world because of
      occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to
      that person through whom the occasion comes! </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If your hand or your foot
      causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for
      you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or
      two feet to be cast into the eternal fire. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If your eye causes you to
      stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter
      into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the
      Gehenna</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> of fire. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> See that you don’t despise one
      of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always
      see the face of my Father who is in heaven. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For the Son of Man came to
      save that which was lost.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “What do you think? If a man
      has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn’t he leave the
      ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray? </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If he finds it, most certainly
      I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have
      not gone astray. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Even so it is not the will of
      your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “If your brother sins against
      you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to
      you, you have gained back your brother. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But if he doesn’t listen, take
      one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses
      every word may be established.</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+18%3A16"><small><sup

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If he refuses to listen to
      them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also,
      let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Most certainly I tell you,
      whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and
      whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Again, assuredly I tell you,
      that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will
      ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For where two or three are
      gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord, how often shall my
    brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I don’t
      tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Therefore the Kingdom of
      Heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his
      servants. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When he had begun to
      reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But because he couldn’t pay,
      his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all
      that he had, and payment to be made. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The servant therefore fell
      down and kneeled before him, saying, ‘Lord, have patience with me, and I
      will repay you all!’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The lord of that servant,
      being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But that servant went out,
      and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii,</span>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat,
      saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “So his fellow servant fell
      down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I
      will repay you!’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He would not, but went and
      cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> So when his fellow servants
      saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their
      lord all that was done. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Then his lord called him in,
      and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because
      you begged me. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Shouldn’t you also have had
      mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> His lord was angry, and
      delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to
      him. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> So my heavenly Father will
      also do to you, if you don’t each forgive your brother from your hearts
      for his misdeeds.”</span> <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] When Jesus had finished these words, he departed from
    Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Pharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, “Is it
    lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He answered, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Haven’t you read
      that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,</span>
    <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A4"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and said, ‘For this cause a man
      shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two
      shall become one flesh?’</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A5"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> So that they are no more two,
      but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don’t let man tear
      apart.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They asked him, “Why then did Moses command us to give her a
    bill of divorce, and divorce her?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Moses,
      because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives,
      but from the beginning it has not been so. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I tell you that whoever
      divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another,
      commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits
      adultery.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] His disciples said to him, “If this is the case of the man
    with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] But he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Not all
      men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For there are eunuchs who were
      born that way from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were
      made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for
      the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake. He who is able to receive it, let him
      receive it.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Then little children were brought to him, that he should
    lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] But Jesus said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Allow the
      little children, and don’t forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of
      Heaven belongs to ones like these.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He laid his hands on them, and departed from there. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Behold, one came to him and said, “Good teacher, what good
    thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Why do you
      call me good?</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> No one is good but one,
      that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”
    </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] He said to him, “Which ones?” <br>
    <br>
    Jesus said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “‘You shall not murder.’ ‘You shall
      not commit adultery.’ ‘You shall not steal.’ ‘You shall not offer false
      testimony.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> ‘Honor your father and

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] The young man said to him, “All these things I have
    observed from my youth. What do I still lack?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “If you
      want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you
      will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sad,
    for he was one who had great possessions.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Jesus said to his disciples, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Most certainly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of
      Heaven with difficulty. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Again I tell you, it is easier
      for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter
      into the Kingdom of God.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly
    astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Looking at them, Jesus said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Then Peter answered, “Behold, we have left everything, and
    followed you. What then will we have?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Most
      certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration
      when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit
      on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Everyone who has left houses,
      or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or
      lands, for my name’s sake, will receive one hundred times, and will
      inherit eternal life. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But many will be last who are
      first; and first who are last. </span> <br>

    <center>Chapter 20</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “For the Kingdom of Heaven is
      like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the
      morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When he had agreed with the
      laborers for a denarius</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> a day, he sent
      them into his vineyard. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He went out about the third
      hour,</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and saw others standing idle in
      the marketplace. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> To them he said, ‘You also go
      into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they went
      their way. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Again he went out about the
      sixth and the ninth hour,</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and did
      likewise. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> About the eleventh hour</span>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> he went out, and found others standing idle. He
      said to them, ‘Why do you stand here all day idle?’ </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “They said to him, ‘Because no
      one has hired us.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He said to them, ‘You also go into the
      vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When evening had come, the lord
      of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their
      wages, beginning from the last to the first.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “When those who were hired at
      about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When the first came, they
      supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a
      denarius. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When they received it, they
      murmured against the master of the household, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> saying, ‘These last have spent
      one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of
      the day and the scorching heat!’ </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But he answered one of them,
      ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn’t you agree with me for a denarius?
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Take that which is yours, and
      go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you.
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Isn’t it lawful for me to do
      what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?’ </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> So the last will be first, and
      the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve
    disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Behold, we are going up to
      Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and
      scribes, and they will condemn him to death, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and will hand him over to the
      Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will be
      raised up.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her
    sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] He said to her, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “What do you
      want?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    She said to him, “Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your
    right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] But Jesus answered, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “You don’t
      know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to
      drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    They said to him, “We are able.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “You will
      indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized
      with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give;
      but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two
    brothers. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] But Jesus summoned them, and said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their
      great ones exercise authority over them. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> It shall not be so among you,
      but whoever desires to become great among you shall be</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      your servant. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Whoever desires to be first
      among you shall be your bondservant, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> even as the Son of Man came
      not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for
      many.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed
    him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard
    that Jesus was passing by, cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of
    David!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should
    be quiet, but they cried out even more, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of
    David!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] Jesus stood still, and called them, and asked, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “What do you want me to do for you?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] They told him, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and
    immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 21</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] When they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethsphage, to
    the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] saying to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Go into the
      village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied,
      and a colt with her. Untie them, and bring them to me. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If anyone says anything to you,
      you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and immediately he will send them.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
    spoken through the prophet, saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] “Tell the daughter of Zion,</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes
    on them; and he sat on them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road.
    Others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The multitudes who went before him, and who followed kept
    shouting, “Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name
    of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!” <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=2&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+21%3A9"><small><sup

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] When he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred
    up, saying, “Who is this?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The multitudes said, “This is the prophet, Jesus, from
    Nazareth of Galilee.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Jesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of
    those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’
    tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “It is
      written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+21%3A13"><small><sup

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he
    healed them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the
    wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the temple
    and saying, “Hosanna to the son of David!” they were indignant,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] and said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?” <br>
    <br>
    Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Yes. Did you never read,
      ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?’”</span>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and
    lodged there.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was
    hungry.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found
    nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Let
      there be no fruit from you forever!” </span> <br>
    <br>
    Immediately the fig tree withered away.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “How did
    the fig tree immediately wither away?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Jesus answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Most
      certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and don’t doubt, you will not
      only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain,
      ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it would be done. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> All things, whatever you ask
      in prayer, believing, you will receive.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the
    elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what
    authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Jesus answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I also
      will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you
      by what authority I do these things. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The baptism of John, where was
      it from? From heaven or from men?” </span> <br>
    <br>
    They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will
    ask us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the multitude, for all
    hold John as a prophet.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] They answered Jesus, and said, “We don’t know.” <br>
    <br>
    He also said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Neither will I tell you
      by what authority I do these things. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But what do you think? A man
      had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, ‘Son, go work today in
      my vineyard.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He answered, ‘I will not,’ but
      afterward he changed his mind, and went. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He came to the second, and
      said the same thing. He answered, ‘I go, sir,’ but he didn’t go. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Which of the two did the will
      of his father?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    They said to him, “The first.” <br>
    Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Most certainly I tell you
      that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into the Kingdom
      of God before you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For John came to you in the
      way of righteousness, and you didn’t believe him, but the tax collectors
      and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, you didn’t even repent
      afterward, that you might believe him. </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Hear another parable. There
      was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a
      hedge about it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased it out to
      farmers, and went into another country. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When the season for the fruit
      drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The farmers took his servants,
      beat one, killed another, and stoned another. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Again, he sent other servants
      more than the first: and they treated them the same way. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But afterward he sent to them
      his son, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But the farmers, when they saw
      the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him,
      and seize his inheritance.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> So they took him, and threw
      him out of the vineyard, and killed him. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When therefore the lord of the
      vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] They told him, “He will miserably destroy those miserable
    men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the
    fruit in its season.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Did you
      never read in the Scriptures, </span> <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> ‘The stone which the
        builders rejected,</span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> the same was made the
        head of the corner.</span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> This was from the
        Lord.</span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> It is marvelous in

    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Therefore I tell you, the
      Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation
      producing its fruit. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He who falls on this stone
      will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it will fall, it will scatter
      him as dust.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his
    parables, they perceived that he spoke about them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes,
    because they considered him to be a prophet. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 22</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The Kingdom of Heaven is like
      a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and sent out his servants to
      call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not
      come. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Again he sent out other
      servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “Behold, I have prepared my
      dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready.
      Come to the marriage feast!”’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But they made light of it, and
      went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise, </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and the rest grabbed his
      servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When the king heard that, he
      was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned
      their city.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Then he said to his servants,
      ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren’t worthy. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Go therefore to the
      intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the
      marriage feast.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Those servants went out into
      the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and
      good. The wedding was filled with guests. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But when the king came in to
      see the guests, he saw there a man who didn’t have on wedding clothing, </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and he said to him, ‘Friend,
      how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?’ He was speechless.
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Then the king said to the
      servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the
      outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.’
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For many are called, but few
      chosen.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might
    entrap him in his talk.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians,
    saying, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in
    truth, no matter whom you teach, for you aren’t partial to anyone.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay
    taxes to Caesar, or not?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Why do you test me, you hypocrites? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Show me the tax money.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    They brought to him a denarius. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] He asked them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Whose is this
      image and inscription?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] They said to him, “Caesar’s.” <br>
    <br>
    Then he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Give therefore to Caesar
      the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went
    away. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no
    resurrection) came to him. They asked him,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies, having no
    children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed for his
    brother.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married
    and died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] In the same way, the second also, and the third, to the
    seventh.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] After them all, the woman died.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of
    the seven? For they all had her.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] But Jesus answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “You
      are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For in the resurrection they
      neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God’s angels in
      heaven. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But concerning the
      resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read that which was spoken to you by
      God, saying, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> ‘I am the God of Abraham, and
      the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?’</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+22%3A32"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><span class="wordsOfJesus"> God is not
      the God of the dead, but of the living.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his
    teaching.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the
    Sadducees, gathered themselves together.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “‘You shall
      love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with
      all your mind.’</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+22%3A37"><small><sup

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> This is the first and great
      commandment. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> A second likewise is this,
      ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+22%3A39"><small><sup

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The whole law and the prophets
      depend on these two commandments.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked
    them a question,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “What do you think of
      the Christ? Whose son is he?” </span> <br>
    <br>
    They said to him, “Of David.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “How then
      does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,</span> <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> ‘The Lord said to my Lord,</span>

    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “If then David calls him Lord,
      how is he his son?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] No one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man
    dare ask him any more questions from that day forward. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 23</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The scribes and the
      Pharisees sat on Moses’ seat. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> All things therefore whatever
      they tell you to observe, observe and do, but don’t do their works; for

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For they bind heavy burdens
      that are grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they
      themselves will not lift a finger to help them. </span> <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Jesus went out from the temple,
      and was going on his way. His disciples came to him to show him the
      buildings of the temple. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But he answered them, “You see
      all of these things, don’t you? Most certainly I tell you, there will not
      be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him
    privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of
    your coming, and of the end of the age?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Jesus answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Be
      careful that no one leads you astray. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For many will come in my name,
      saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will lead many astray. </span> <br>

      nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues,

      beginning of birth pains. </span> <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Then many will stumble, and
      will deliver up one another, and will hate one another. </span> <br>

      arise, and will lead many astray. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Because iniquity will be
      multiplied, the love of many will grow cold. </span> <br>

    expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] But when his disciples saw this, they were indignant,
    saying, “Why this waste?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given
    to the poor.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Why do you trouble the woman? Because she has done a good work for me. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For you always have the poor
      with you; but you don’t always have me. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For in pouring this ointment
      on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Most certainly I tell you,
      wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman
      has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went
    to the chief priests,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] and said, “What are you willing to give me, that I should
    deliver him to you?” They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] From that time he sought opportunity to betray him. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples
    came to Jesus, saying to him, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to
    eat the Passover?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] He said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Go into the city to
      a certain person, and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is at hand. I
      will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.”’”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they
    prepared the Passover.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table
    with the twelve disciples.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] As they were eating, he said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him,
    “It isn’t me, is it, Lord?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] He answered, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He who dipped
      his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The Son of Man goes, even as
      it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is
      betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Judas, who betrayed him, answered, “It isn’t me, is it,
    Rabbi?” <br>
    <br>
    He said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “You said it.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it,
    and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Take, eat; this is my body.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, <span
      class="wordsOfJesus"> “All of you drink it, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> for this is my blood of the
      new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But I tell you that I will not
      drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink
      it anew with you in my Father’s Kingdom.” </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of
    Olives. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Then Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “All
      of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written,
      ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be
      scattered.’</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+26%3A31"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But after I am raised up, I
      will go before you into Galilee.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] But Peter answered him, “Even if all will be made to
    stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Most
      certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny
      me three times.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not
    deny you.” All of the disciples also said likewise. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and
    said to his disciples, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Sit here, while I go
      there and pray.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
    began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] Then he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “My soul
      is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed,
    saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “My Father, if it is possible, let this
      cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you
      desire.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said
    to Peter, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “What, couldn’t you watch with me for
      one hour? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Watch and pray, that you don’t
      enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
      weak.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, <span
      class="wordsOfJesus"> “My Father, if this cup can’t pass away from me
      unless I drink it, your desire be done.” </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were
    heavy.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time,
    saying the same words.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the
      Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Arise, let’s be going. Behold,
      he who betrays me is at hand.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the
    twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the
    chief priest and elders of the people.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever
    I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, “Hail, Rabbi!” and
    kissed him. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Friend,
      why are you here?”</span> Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took
    him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[51] Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his
    hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and
    struck off his ear.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[52] Then Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Put
      your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die
      by the sword. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[53] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Or do you think that I
      couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve
      legions of angels? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[54] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> How then would the Scriptures
      be fulfilled that it must be so?” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[55] In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me?
      I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[56] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But all this has happened,
      that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    Then all the disciples left him, and fled.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[57] Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high
    priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[58] But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the
    high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[59] Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council
    sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[60] and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came
    forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[61] and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple
    of God, and to build it in three days.’” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[62] The high priest stood up, and said to him, “Have you no
    answer? What is this that these testify against you?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[63] But Jesus held his peace. The high priest answered him, “I
    adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ,
    the Son of God.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[64] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “You have
      said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man
      sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[65] Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, “He has
    spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have
    heard his blasphemy.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[66] What do you think?” <br>
    <br>
    They answered, “He is worthy of death!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[67] Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists,
    and some slapped him,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[68] saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[69] Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came
    to him, saying, “You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[70] But he denied it before them all, saying, “I don’t know
    what you are talking about.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[71] When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him,
    and said to those who were there, “This man also was with Jesus of
    Nazareth.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[72] Again he denied it with an oath, “I don’t know the man.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[73] After a little while those who stood by came and said to
    Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[74] Then he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know the
    man!” <br>
    <br>
    Immediately the rooster crowed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[75] Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, <span
      class="wordsOfJesus"> “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three
      times.”</span> He went out and wept bitterly. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 27</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the
    elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up
    to Pontius Pilate, the governor.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was
    condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the
    chief priests and elders,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] saying, “I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.” <br>
    <br>
    But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and
    departed. He went away and hanged himself.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, “It’s
    not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them,
    to bury strangers in.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Therefore that field was called “The Field of Blood” to this
    day.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was
    fulfilled, saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“They took the thirty pieces of silver,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the price of him upon whom a price had been set,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whom some of the children of Israel priced,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] and they gave them for the potter’s field,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as the Lord commanded me.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+27%3A10"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked
    him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?” <br>
    <br>
    Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “So you say.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he
    answered nothing.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things
    they testify against you?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the
    governor marveled greatly.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to
    the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to
    them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is
    called Christ?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to
    him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have
    suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the
    multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] But the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you
    want me to release to you?” <br>
    <br>
    They said, “Barabbas!” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus, who is
    called Christ?” <br>
    <br>
    They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] But the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?” <br>
    <br>
    But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but
    rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands
    before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous
    person. You see to it.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] All the people answered, “May his blood be on us, and on
    our children!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and
    delivered to be crucified.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the
    Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and
    a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him,
    saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the
    head.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] When they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him,
    and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by
    name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] They came to a place called “Golgotha”, that is to say,
    “The place of a skull.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he
    had tasted it, he would not drink.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing
    among them, casting lots,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] and they sat and watched him there.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] They set up over his head the accusation against him
    written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his
    right hand and one on the left.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] and saying, “You who destroy the temple, and build it in
    three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the
    cross!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes,
    the Pharisees, and the elders, said,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] “He saved others, but he can’t save himself. If he is the
    King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in
    him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him;
    for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him
    the same reproach. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the
    land until the ninth hour.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Eli, Eli, lima</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      sabachthani?” </span> That is, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “My God, my
      God, why have you forsaken me?”</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=2&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Matthew+27%3A46"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said,
    “This man is calling Elijah.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled
    it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes
    to save him.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his
    spirit.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[51] Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top
    to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[52] The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who
    had fallen asleep were raised;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[53] and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they
    entered into the holy city and appeared to many.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[54] Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching
    Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared
    exceedingly, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[55] Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed
    Jesus from Galilee, serving him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[56] Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James
    and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[57] When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named
    Joseph, who himself was also Jesus’ disciple came.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[58] This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. Then
    Pilate commanded the body to be given up.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[59] Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen
    cloth,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[60] and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in
    the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[61] Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting
    opposite the tomb.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[62] Now on the next day, which was the day after the
    Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together
    to Pilate,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[63] saying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he
    was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[64] Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the
    third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and
    tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be
    worse than the first.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[65] Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as
    secure as you can.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[66] So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure,
    sealing the stone. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 28</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day
    of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the
    Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the
    door, and sat on it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as
    snow.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know
    that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come,
    see the place where the Lord was lying.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the
    dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’
    Behold, I have told you.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy,
    and ran to bring his disciples word.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,
    saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Rejoice!”</span> <br>
    <br>
    They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Then Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers </span> <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came
    into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken
    counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] saying, “Say that his disciples came by night, and stole
    him away while we slept.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him
    and make you free of worry.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] So they took the money and did as they were told. This
    saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain
    where Jesus had sent them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some
    doubted.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Go,</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
      Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> teaching them to observe all
      things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end
      of the age.”</span> Amen. <br>
