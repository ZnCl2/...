      <h1>Amos</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa,
    which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in
    the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the
    earthquake.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He said: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Yahweh will roar from Zion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and utter his voice from Jerusalem;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the pastures of the shepherds will mourn,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the top of Carmel will wither.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Thus says Yahweh: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“For three transgressions of Damascus, yes, for
      four,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not turn away its punishment;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because they have threshed Gilead with threshing
      instruments of iron;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and it will devour the palaces of Ben Hadad.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I will break the bar of Damascus,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of
      Aven,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and him who holds the scepter from the house of
      Eden;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the people of Syria shall go into captivity
      to Kir,”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    says Yahweh. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Thus says Yahweh: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“For three transgressions of Gaza, yes, for four,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not turn away its punishment;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because they carried away captive the whole
      community,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to deliver them up to Edom;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and it will devour its palaces.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will turn my hand against Ekron;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the remnant of the Philistines will perish,”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    says the Lord Yahweh. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Thus says Yahweh: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“For three transgressions of Tyre, yes, for four,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not turn away its punishment;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because they delivered up the whole community to
      Edom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and didn’t remember the brotherly covenant;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and it will devour its palaces.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Thus says Yahweh: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“For three transgressions of Edom, yes, for four,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not turn away its punishment;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because he pursued his brother with the sword,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and cast off all pity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his anger raged continually,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he kept his wrath forever;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] but I will send a fire on Teman,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and it will devour the palaces of Bozrah.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Thus says Yahweh: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“For three transgressions of the children of
      Ammon, yes, for four,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not turn away its punishment;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because they have ripped open the pregnant women
      of Gilead,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that they may enlarge their border.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and it will devour its palaces,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with shouting in the day of battle,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with a storm in the day of the whirlwind;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] and their king will go into captivity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he and his princes together,”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    says Yahweh. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Thus says Yahweh: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not turn away its punishment;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because he burned the bones of the king of Edom
      into lime;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] but I will send a fire on Moab,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and
      with the sound of the trumpet;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] and I will cut off the judge from their midst,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will kill all its princes with him,”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    says Yahweh. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Thus says Yahweh: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for
      four,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not turn away its punishment;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because they have rejected Yahweh’s law,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have not kept his statutes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their lies have led them astray,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">after which their fathers walked;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] But I will send a fire on Judah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Thus says Yahweh: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for
      four,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not turn away its punishment;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because they have sold the righteous for silver,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the needy for a pair of shoes;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the
      poor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and deny justice to the oppressed;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a man and his father use the same maiden, to
      profane my holy name;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes
      taken in pledge;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and in the house of their God they drink the wine
      of those who have been fined.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whose height was like the height of the cedars,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he was strong as the oaks;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet I destroyed his fruit from above,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his roots from beneath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and led you forty years in the wilderness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to possess the land of the Amorite.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I raised up some of your sons for prophets,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and some of your young men for Nazirites.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Isn’t this true,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">you children of Israel?” says Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] “But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and commanded the prophets, saying, ‘Don’t
      prophesy!’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Behold, I will crush you in your place,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as a cart crushes that is full of grain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Flight will perish from the swift;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the strong won’t strengthen his force;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither shall the mighty deliver himself;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] neither shall he stand who handles the bow;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he who is swift of foot won’t escape;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither shall he who rides the horse deliver
      himself;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] and he who is courageous among the mighty will flee away
      naked on that day,”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    says Yahweh. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you, children
    of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of
    Egypt, saying: <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Therefore I will punish you for all of your
      sins.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Do two walk together,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">unless they have agreed?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Will a lion roar in the thicket,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when he has no prey?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Does a young lion cry out of his den,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">if he has caught nothing?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Can a bird fall in a trap on the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">where no snare is set for him?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Does a snare spring up from the ground,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when there is nothing to catch?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Does the trumpet alarm sound in a city,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">without the people being afraid?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Does evil happen to a city,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Yahweh hasn’t done it?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Surely the Lord Yahweh will do nothing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">unless he reveals his secret to his servants the
      prophets.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The lion has roared.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who will not fear?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The Lord Yahweh has spoken.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who can but prophesy?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and in the palaces in the land of Egypt,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and say, “Assemble yourselves on the mountains of
      Samaria,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and see what unrest is in her,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and what oppression is among them.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] “Indeed they don’t know to do right,” says Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Who hoard plunder and loot in their palaces.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“An adversary will overrun the land;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he will pull down your strongholds,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your fortresses will be plundered.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Thus says Yahweh: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the
      lion two legs,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or a piece of an ear,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so shall the children of Israel be rescued who
      sit in Samaria on the corner of a couch,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and on the silken cushions of a bed.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] “Listen, and testify against the house of Jacob,” says the
    Lord Yahweh, the God of Armies. <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] “For in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel
      on him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will also visit the altars of Bethel;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the horns of the altar will be cut off,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and fall to the ground.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] I will strike the winter house with the summer house;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the houses of ivory will perish,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the great houses will have an end,”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    says Yahweh. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Listen to this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on the
    mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who tell
    their husbands, “Bring us drinks!” <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The Lord Yahweh has sworn by his holiness that behold,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“The days shall come on you that they will take
      you away with hooks,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the last of you with fish hooks.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] You will go out at the breaks in the wall,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">everyone straight before her;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and you will cast yourselves into Harmon,” says
      Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] “Go to Bethel, and sin;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to Gilgal, and sin more.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Bring your sacrifices every morning,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your tithes every three days,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is
      leavened,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and proclaim free will offerings and brag about
      them:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for this pleases you, you children of Israel,”
      says the Lord Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] “I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your
      cities,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and lack of bread in every town;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] “I also have withheld the rain from you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when there were yet three months to the harvest;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I caused it to rain on one city,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and caused it not to rain on another city.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">One place was rained on,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the piece where it didn’t rain withered.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] So two or three cities staggered to one city to drink
      water,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and were not satisfied:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] “I struck you with blight and mildew many times in your
      gardens and your vineyards;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your fig trees and your olive trees have the
      swarming locust devoured:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] “I sent plagues among you like I did Egypt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have slain your young men with the sword,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have carried away your horses;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I filled your nostrils with the stench of
      your camp,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] “I have overthrown some of you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and you were like a burning stick plucked out of
      the fire;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] “Therefore thus will I do to you, Israel;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because I will do this to you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">prepare to meet your God, Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] For, behold, he who forms the mountains,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and creates the wind,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and declares to man what is his thought;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who makes the morning darkness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and treads on the high places of the earth:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh, the God of Armies, is his name.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Listen to this word which I take up for a lamentation over
    you, O house of Israel. <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “The virgin of Israel has fallen;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She shall rise no more.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She is cast down on her land;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">there is no one to raise her up.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For thus says the Lord Yahweh: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“The city that went out a thousand shall have a
      hundred left,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and that which went out one hundred shall have
      ten left to the house of Israel.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For thus says Yahweh to the house of Israel: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Seek me, and you will live;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] but don’t seek Bethel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor enter into Gilgal,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t pass to Beersheba:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Bethel shall come to nothing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Seek Yahweh, and you will live;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">lest he break out like fire in the house of
      Joseph,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and it devour, and there be no one to quench it
      in Bethel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] You who turn justice to wormwood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and cast down righteousness to the earth:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and turns the shadow of death into the morning,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and makes the day dark with night;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who calls for the waters of the sea,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and pours them out on the surface of the earth,
      Yahweh is his name,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] who brings sudden destruction on the strong,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so that destruction comes on the fortress.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] They hate him who reproves in the gate,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they abhor him who speaks blamelessly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Therefore, because you trample on the poor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and take taxes from him of wheat:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have built houses of cut stone,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but you will not dwell in them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You have planted pleasant vineyards,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but you shall not drink their wine.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For I know how many your offenses,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and how great are your sins—</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">you who afflict the just,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who take a bribe,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and who turn aside the needy in the courts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for it is an evil time.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Seek good, and not evil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that you may live;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and so Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be with
      you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as you say.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Hate evil, love good,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and establish justice in the courts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It may be that Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be
      gracious to the remnant of Joseph.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the Lord: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Wailing will be in all the broad ways;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will say in all the streets, ‘Alas!
      Alas!’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will call the farmer to mourning,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and those who are skillful in lamentation to
      wailing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] In all vineyards there will be wailing;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for I will pass through your midst,” says Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] “Woe to you who desire the day of Yahweh!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Why do you long for the day of Yahweh?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It is darkness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and not light.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] As if a man fled from a lion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a bear met him;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Or he went into the house and leaned his hand on
      the wall,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a snake bit him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Won’t the day of Yahweh be darkness, and not light?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Even very dark, and no brightness in it?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] I hate, I despise your feasts,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I can’t stand your solemn assemblies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal
      offerings,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not accept them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will I regard the peace offerings of your
      fat animals.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Take away from me the noise of your songs!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not listen to the music of your harps.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] But let justice roll on like rivers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and righteousness like a mighty stream.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] “Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the
    wilderness forty years, house of Israel?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] You also carried the tent of your king and the shrine of
    your images, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond
    Damascus,” says Yahweh, whose name is the God of Armies. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 6</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Woe to those who are at ease in Zion, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">and to those who are secure on the mountain of
      Samaria,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the notable men of the chief of the nations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to whom the house of Israel come!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Go to Calneh, and see;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and from there go to Hamath the great;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">then go down to Gath of the Philistines.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">are they better than these kingdoms?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or is their border greater than your border?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Those who put far away the evil day,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and cause the seat of violence to come near;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Who lie on beds of ivory,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and stretch themselves on their couches,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and eat the lambs out of the flock,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] who strum on the strings of a harp;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who invent for themselves instruments of music,
      like David;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] who drink wine in bowls,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and anoint themselves with the best oils;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but they are not grieved for the affliction of
      Joseph.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Therefore they will now go captive with the first who go
      captive;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the feasting and lounging will end.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] “The Lord Yahweh has sworn by himself,” says Yahweh, the
      God of Armies:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“I abhor the pride of Jacob,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and detest his fortresses.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Therefore I will deliver up the city with all
      that is in it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] It will happen, if there remain ten men in one house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that they shall die.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] “When a man’s relative carries him, even he who burns him,
    to bring bodies out of the house, and asks him who is in the innermost parts
    of the house, ‘Is there yet any with you?’ And he says, ‘No;’ then he will
    say, ‘Hush! Indeed we must not mention Yahweh’s name.’ <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] “For, behold, Yahweh commands, and the great house will
      be smashed to pieces,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the little house into bits.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Do horses run on the rocky crags?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Does one plow there with oxen?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">But you have turned justice into poison,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] you who rejoice in a thing of nothing, who say,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘Haven’t we taken for ourselves horns by our own
      strength?’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, house
      of Israel,”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">says Yahweh, the God of Armies;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“and they will afflict you from the entrance of
      Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 7</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: and behold, he formed
    locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and
    behold, it was the latter growth after the king’s harvest.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] When they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then
    I said, “Lord Yahweh, forgive, I beg you! How could Jacob stand? For he is
    small.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Yahweh relented concerning this. “It shall not be,” says
    Yahweh. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me and behold, the Lord Yahweh
    called for judgment by fire; and it dried up the great deep, and would have
    devoured the land.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Then I said, “Lord Yahweh, stop, I beg you! How could Jacob
    stand? For he is small.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Yahweh relented concerning this. “This also shall not be,”
    says the Lord Yahweh. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Thus he showed me and behold, the Lord stood beside a wall
    made by a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Yahweh said to me, “Amos, what do you see?” <br>
    <br>
    I said, “A plumb line.” <br>
    Then the Lord said, “Behold, I will set a plumb line in the midst of my
    people Israel. I will not again pass by them any more.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The high places of Isaac will be desolate, the sanctuaries
    of Israel will be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam
    with the sword.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of
    Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of
    Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For Amos says, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel
    shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Amaziah also said to Amos, “You seer, go, flee away into
    the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] but don’t prophesy again any more at Bethel; for it is the
    king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I was no prophet, neither was
    I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a farmer of sycamore figs;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] and Yahweh took me from following the flock, and Yahweh
    said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Now therefore listen to Yahweh’s word: ‘You say, Don’t
    prophesy against Israel, and don’t preach against the house of Isaac.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Therefore thus says Yahweh: ‘Your wife shall be a
    prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the
    sword, and your land shall be divided by line; and you yourself shall die in
    a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of
    his land.’” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 8</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: behold, a basket of summer
    fruit. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He said, “Amos, what do you see?” <br>
    <br>
    I said, “A basket of summer fruit.” <br>
    Then Yahweh said to me, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“The end has come on my people Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will not again pass by them any more.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] The songs of the temple will be wailings in that day,”
      says the Lord Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“The dead bodies will be many. In every place
      they will throw them out with silence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Hear this, you who desire to swallow up the needy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and cause the poor of the land to fail,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Saying, ‘When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell
      grain?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">And the Sabbath, that we may market wheat,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">making the ephah small, and the shekel large,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] that we may buy the poor for silver,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the needy for a pair of shoes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and sell the sweepings with the wheat?’”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Yahweh has sworn by the pride of Jacob,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Surely I will never forget any of their works.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Won’t the land tremble for this,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and everyone mourn who dwells in it?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, it will rise up wholly like the River;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and it will be stirred up and sink again, like
      the River of Egypt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] It will happen in that day,” says the Lord Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“that I will cause the sun to go down at noon,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will darken the earth in the clear day.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I will turn your feasts into mourning,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and all your songs into lamentation;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will make you wear sackcloth on all your
      bodies,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and baldness on every head.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will make it like the mourning for an only son,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and its end like a bitter day.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Behold, the days come,” says the Lord Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“that I will send a famine in the land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">not a famine of bread,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor a thirst for water,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but of hearing Yahweh’s words.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] They will wander from sea to sea,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and from the north even to the east;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they will run back and forth to seek Yahweh’s
      word,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will not find it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] In that day the beautiful virgins</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the young men will faint for thirst.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Those who swear by the sin of Samaria,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and say, ‘As your god, Dan, lives;’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives;’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they will fall, and never rise up again.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 9</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said,
    “Strike the tops of the pillars, that the thresholds may shake; and break
    them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will kill the last of them
    with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not
    one of them escape.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Though they dig into Sheol, there my hand will take them;
    and though they climb up to heaven, there I will bring them down.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will
    search and take them out there; and though they be hidden from my sight in
    the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent, and it will bite
    them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Though they go into captivity before their enemies, there I
    will command the sword, and it will kill them. I will set my eyes on them
    for evil, and not for good.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, is he who touches the land
    and it melts, and all who dwell in it will mourn; and it will rise up wholly
    like the River, and will sink again, like the River of Egypt.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] It is he who builds his rooms in the heavens, and has
    founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for the waters of the sea, and
    pours them out on the surface of the earth; Yahweh is his name.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me,
    children of Israel?” says Yahweh. “Haven’t I brought up Israel out of the
    land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Behold, the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful
    kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth; except
    that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” says Yahweh.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] “For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of
    Israel among all the nations, as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet not the
    least kernel will fall on the earth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who
    say, ‘Evil won’t overtake nor meet us.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] In that day I will raise up the tent of David who is
    fallen, and close up its breaches, and I will raise up its ruins, and I will
    build it as in the days of old;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the
    nations who are called by my name,” says Yahweh who does this. <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“that the plowman shall overtake the reaper,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the one treading grapes him who sows seed;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and sweet wine will drip from the mountains,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and flow from the hills.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I will bring my people Israel back from captivity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will rebuild the ruined cities, and
      inhabit them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will plant vineyards, and drink wine
      from them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They shall also make gardens,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and eat their fruit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] I will plant them on their land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will no more be plucked up out of their
      land which I have given them,”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">says Yahweh your God.</span><br>
