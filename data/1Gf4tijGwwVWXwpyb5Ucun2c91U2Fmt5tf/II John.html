      <h1>II John</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love
    in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be
    with us forever:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the
    Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and
    love. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children
    walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new
    commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one
    another.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] This is love, that we should walk according to his
    commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning,
    that you should walk in it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who
    don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and
    the Antichrist.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we
    have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of
    Christ, doesn’t have God. He who remains in the teaching, the same has both
    the Father and the Son.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] If anyone comes to you, and doesn’t bring this teaching,
    don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so
    with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face,
    that our joy may be made full.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen. <br>
