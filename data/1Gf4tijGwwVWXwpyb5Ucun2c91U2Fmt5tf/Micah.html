      <h1>Micah</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Yahweh’s word that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days
    of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning
    Samaria and Jerusalem. <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Hear, you peoples, all of you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Listen, O earth, and all that is therein:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and let the Lord Yahweh be witness against you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the Lord from his holy temple.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For, behold, Yahweh comes out of his place,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will come down and tread on the high places
      of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The mountains melt under him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the valleys split apart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like wax before the fire,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like waters that are poured down a steep place.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] “All this is for the disobedience of Jacob,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and for the sins of the house of Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">What is the disobedience of Jacob?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Isn’t it Samaria?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">And what are the high places of Judah?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Aren’t they Jerusalem?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the
      field,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like places for planting vineyards;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will pour down its stones into the valley,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will uncover its foundations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] All her idols will be beaten to pieces,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and all her temple gifts will be burned with
      fire,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and all her images I will destroy;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered
      them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and to the hire of a prostitute shall they
      return.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] For this I will lament and wail;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will go stripped and naked;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will howl like the jackals,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and moan like the daughters of owls.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For her wounds are incurable;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for it has come even to Judah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It reaches to the gate of my people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even to Jerusalem.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Don’t tell it in Gath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t weep at all.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">At Beth Ophrah I have rolled myself in the dust.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The inhabitant of Zaanan won’t come out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his
      protection.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because evil has come down from Yahweh to the
      gate of Jerusalem.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Harness the chariot to the swift steed, inhabitant of
      Lachish.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of
      Zion;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For the transgressions of Israel were found in
      you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to
      the kings of Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] I will yet bring to you, inhabitant of Mareshah.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who is the glory of Israel will come to
      Adullam.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Shave your heads,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and cut off your hair for the children of your
      delight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Enlarge your baldness like the vulture;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for they have gone into captivity from you!</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Woe to those who devise iniquity<br>
    <span class="line indent0">and work evil on their beds!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When the morning is light, they practice it,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because it is in the power of their hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] They covet fields, and seize them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and houses, and take them away:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they oppress a man and his house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even a man and his heritage.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Therefore thus says Yahweh:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Behold, I am planning against these people a
      disaster,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from which you will not remove your necks,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will you walk haughtily;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for it is an evil time.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] In that day they will take up a parable against you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘We are utterly ruined!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My people’s possession is divided up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields
      to traitors!’”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot
      in Yahweh’s assembly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] “Don’t prophesy!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They prophesy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Don’t prophesy about these things.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Disgrace won’t overtake us.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Shall it be said, O house of Jacob:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Are these his doings?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t my words do good to him who walks
      blamelessly?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] But lately my people have risen up as an enemy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You strip the robe and clothing from those who
      pass by without a care, returning from battle.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant
      houses;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from their young children you take away my
      blessing forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Arise, and depart!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For this is not your resting place,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because of uncleanness that destroys,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even with a grievous destruction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong
      drink”;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he would be the prophet of this people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will surely gather the remnant of Israel;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as a flock in the midst of their pasture;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they will swarm with people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He who breaks open the way goes up before them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They break through the gate, and go out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">And their king passes on before them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with Yahweh at their head.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I said, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Please listen, you heads of Jacob,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and rulers of the house of Israel:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Isn’t it for you to know justice?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] You who hate the good,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and love the evil;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who tear off their skin,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their flesh from off their bones;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] who also eat the flesh of my people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and flay their skin from off them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and break their bones,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and chop them in pieces, as for the pot,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and as flesh within the cauldron.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Then they will cry to Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he will not answer them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, he will hide his face from them at that
      time,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because they made their deeds evil.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who lead my people
    astray; for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, “Peace!” and whoever
    doesn’t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him: <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] “Therefore night is over you, with no vision,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and it is dark to you, that you may not divine;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the sun will go down on the prophets,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the day will be black over them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The seers shall be disappointed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the diviners confounded.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, they shall all cover their lips;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for there is no answer from God.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] But as for me, I am full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and of judgment, and of might,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to declare to Jacob his disobedience,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and to Israel his sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and rulers of the house of Israel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who abhor justice,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and pervert all equity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] They build up Zion with blood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Jerusalem with iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Her leaders judge for bribes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and her priests teach for a price,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet they lean on Yahweh, and say,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Isn’t Yahweh in the midst of us?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">No disaster will come on us.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the mountain of the temple like the high
      places of a forest.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] But in the latter days,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh’s
      temple will be established on the top of the mountains,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and it will be exalted above the hills;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and peoples will stream to it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Many nations will go and say,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Come, and let us go up to the mountain of
      Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and to the house of the God of Jacob;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he will teach us of his ways,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and we will walk in his paths.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For the law will go out of Zion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] and he will judge between many peoples,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will decide concerning strong nations afar
      off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will beat their swords into plowshares,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their spears into pruning hooks.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Nation will not lift up sword against nation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will they learn war any more.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] But they will sit every man under his vine and under his
      fig tree;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and no one will make them afraid:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods; <br>
    <span class="line indent0">but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God
      forever and ever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] “In that day,” says Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“I will assemble that which is lame,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will gather that which is driven away,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and that which I have afflicted;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] and I will make that which was lame a remnant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and that which was cast far off a strong nation:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion
      from then on, even forever.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to you it will come,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, the former dominion will come,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Now why do you cry out aloud?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Is there no king in you?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Has your counselor perished,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman
      in travail?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like a woman in travail;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for now you will go out of the city,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will dwell in the field,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will come even to Babylon.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There you will be rescued.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of
      your enemies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Let her be defiled,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and let our eye gloat over Zion.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] But they don’t know the thoughts of Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither do they understand his counsel;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the
      threshing floor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for I will make your horn iron,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will make your hoofs brass;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and you will beat in pieces many peoples:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will devote their gain to Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their substance to the Lord of the whole
      earth.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now you shall gather yourself in troops,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">daughter of troops.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has laid siege against us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will strike the judge of Israel with a rod
      on the cheek.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">being small among the clans of Judah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">out of you one will come out to me that is to be
      ruler in Israel;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whose goings out are from of old, from ancient
      times.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who
      is in labor gives birth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Then the rest of his brothers will return to the
      children of Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the strength of
      Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will live, for then he will be great to
      the ends of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and when he marches through our fortresses,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">then we will raise against him seven shepherds,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and eight leaders of men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the land of Nimrod in its gates.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will deliver us from the Assyrian,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when he invades our land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and when he marches within our border.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like dew from Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like showers on the grass,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that don’t wait for man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor wait for the sons of men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the midst of many peoples,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like a lion among the animals of the forest,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like a young lion among the flocks of sheep;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who, if he goes through, treads down and tears in
      pieces,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and there is no one to deliver.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and let all of your enemies be cut off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] “It will happen in that day”, says Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“that I will cut off your horses out of your
      midst,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will destroy your chariots.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I will cut off the cities of your land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will tear down all your strongholds.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I will destroy witchcraft from your hand;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and you shall have no soothsayers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars out
      of your midst;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and you shall no more worship the work of your
      hands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I will uproot your Asherah poles out of your midst;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will destroy your cities.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] I will execute vengeance in anger,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and wrath on the nations that didn’t listen.”</span><br>
    <br>

    <center>Chapter 6</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Listen now to what Yahweh says: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Arise, plead your case before the mountains,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and let the hills hear what you have to say.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Hear, you mountains, Yahweh’s controversy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and you enduring foundations of the earth;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for Yahweh has a controversy with his people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he will contend with Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] My people, what have I done to you?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">How have I burdened you?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Answer me!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and redeemed you out of the house of bondage.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from
      Shittim to Gilgal,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that you may know the righteous acts of Yahweh.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] How shall I come before Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and bow myself before the exalted God?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with calves a year old?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">With tens of thousands of rivers of oil?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He has shown you, O man, what is good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">What does Yahweh require of you, but to act
      justly,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Yahweh’s voice calls to the city,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and wisdom sees your name:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Listen to the rod,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he who appointed it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the
      wicked,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a short ephah that is accursed?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Shall I be pure with dishonest scales,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and with a bag of deceitful weights?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Her rich men are full of violence,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">her inhabitants speak lies,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their tongue is deceitful in their speech.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have made you desolate because of your sins.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] You shall eat, but not be satisfied.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your humiliation will be in your midst.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will store up, but not save;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and that which you save I will give up to the
      sword.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] You will sow, but won’t reap.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You will tread the olives, but won’t anoint
      yourself with oil;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and crush grapes, but won’t drink the wine.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For the statutes of Omri are kept,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and all the works of the house of Ahab.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You walk in their counsels,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that I may make you a ruin,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and her inhabitants a hissing;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">And you will bear the reproach of my people.”</span><br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <center>Chapter 7</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Misery is mine!<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer
      fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is no cluster of grapes to eat.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My soul desires to eat the early fig.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The godly man has perished out of the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and there is no one upright among men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They all lie in wait for blood;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">every man hunts his brother with a net.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The ruler and judge ask for a bribe;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the powerful man dictates the evil desire of
      his soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Thus they conspire together.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The best of them is like a brier.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The day of your watchmen,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even your visitation, has come;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">now is the time of their confusion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Don’t trust in a neighbor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t put confidence in a friend.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">With the woman lying in your embrace,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">be careful of the words of your mouth!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For the son dishonors the father,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the daughter rises up against her mother,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But as for me, I will look to Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will wait for the God of my salvation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My God will hear me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When I fall, I will arise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to
      me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] I will bear the indignation of Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because I have sinned against him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">until he pleads my case, and executes judgment
      for me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will bring me out to the light.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will see his righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Then my enemy will see it,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and shame will cover her who said to me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">where is Yahweh your God?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Then my enemy will see me and will cover her
      shame.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the
      streets.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] A day to build your walls—</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In that day, he will extend your boundary.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the
      cities of Egypt,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and from Egypt even to the River,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and from sea to sea,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and mountain to mountain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell
      therein,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the fruit of their doings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Shepherd your people with your staff,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the flock of your heritage,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who dwell by themselves in a forest,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the midst of fertile pasture land, let them
      feed;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] “As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will show them marvelous things.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will lay their hand on their mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their ears will be deaf.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] They will lick the dust like a serpent.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Like crawling things of the earth they shall come
      trembling out of their dens.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will come with fear to Yahweh our God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will be afraid because of you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and passes over the disobedience of the remnant
      of his heritage?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He doesn’t retain his anger forever,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because he delights in loving kindness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] He will again have compassion on us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will tread our iniquities under foot;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and you will cast all their sins into the depths
      of the sea.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] You will give truth to Jacob,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and mercy to Abraham,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of
      old.</span><br>
