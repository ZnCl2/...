      <h1>I Timothy</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the
    commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace,
    from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at
    Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different
    doctrine,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies,
    which cause disputes, rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith—<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart
    and a good conscience and sincere faith;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned
    aside to vain talking;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand
    neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man,
    but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the
    unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for
    man slayers,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for
    slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to
    the sound doctrine;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God,
    which was committed to my trust.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord,
    because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and
    insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in
    unbelief.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and
    love which is in Christ Jesus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that
    Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first,
    Jesus Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who
    were going to believe in him for eternal life.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who
    alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] This instruction I commit to you, my child Timothy,
    according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may
    wage the good warfare;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] holding faith and a good conscience; which some having
    thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to
    Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers,
    intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] for kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead a
    tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our
    Savior;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] who desires all people to be saved and come to full
    knowledge of the truth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men,
    the man Christ Jesus,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in its
    own times;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am
    telling the truth in Christ, not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith
    and truth. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting
    up holy hands without anger and doubting.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent
    clothing, with modesty and propriety; not just with braided hair, gold,
    pearls, or expensive clothing;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] but (which becomes women professing godliness) with good
    works.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] But I don’t permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise
    authority over a man, but to be in quietness.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] For Adam was first formed, then Eve.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has
    fallen into disobedience;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they
    continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] This is a faithful saying: if a man seeks the office of an
    overseer, he desires a good work.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband
    of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but
    gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] one who rules his own house well, having children in
    subjection with all reverence;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] (but if a man doesn’t know how to rule his own house, how
    will he take care of the assembly of God?)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the
    same condemnation as the devil.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are
    outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Servants, in the same way, must be reverent, not
    double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Let them also first be tested; then let them serve if they
    are blameless.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not
    slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Let servants be husbands of one wife, ruling their children
    and their own houses well.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] For those who have served well gain for themselves a good
    standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to
    behave themselves in God’s house, which is the assembly of the living God,
    the pillar and ground of the truth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">God was revealed in the flesh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">justified in the spirit,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">seen by angels,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">preached among the nations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">believed on in the world,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and received up in glory.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will
    fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines
    of demons,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in
    their own conscience as with a hot iron;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods
    which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and
    know the truth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be
    rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a
    good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of
    the good doctrine which you have followed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But refuse profane and old wives’ fables. Exercise yourself
    toward godliness.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value
    in all things, having the promise of the life which is now, and of that
    which is to come.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because
    we have set our trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men,
    especially of those who believe.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Command and teach these things. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those
    who believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and
    in purity.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation, and
    to teaching.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Don’t neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to
    you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Be diligent in these things. Give yourself wholly to them,
    that your progress may be revealed to all.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Pay attention to yourself, and to your teaching. Continue
    in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who
    hear you. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Don’t rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the
    younger men as brothers;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all
    purity.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Honor widows who are widows indeed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them
    learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to repay their
    parents, for this is acceptable in the sight of God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope
    set on God, and continues in petitions and prayers night and day.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she
    lives.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Also command these things, that they may be without
    reproach.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] But if anyone doesn’t provide for his own, and especially
    his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old,
    having been the wife of one man,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] being approved by good works, if she has brought up
    children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the
    saints’ feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently
    followed every good work. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton
    against Christ, they desire to marry;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] having condemnation, because they have rejected their first
    pledge.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house
    to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things
    which they ought not.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear
    children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for
    insulting.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] For already some have turned aside after Satan.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them
    relieve them, and don’t let the assembly be burdened; that it might relieve
    those who are widows indeed. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double
    honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle the ox when
    it treads out the grain.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=I+Timothy+5%3A18"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> And, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The
      laborer is worthy of his wages.”</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=2&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=I+Timothy+5%3A18"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Don’t receive an accusation against an elder, except at the
    word of two or three witnesses.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest
    also may be in fear.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] I command you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and
    the chosen angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing
    nothing by partiality.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in
    other men’s sins. Keep yourself pure.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine
    for your stomach’s sake and your frequent infirmities. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Some men’s sins are evident, preceding them to judgment,
    and some also follow later.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] In the same way also there are good works that are obvious,
    and those that are otherwise can’t be hidden. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 6</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their
    own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not
    be blasphemed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them,
    because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those who
    partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these
    things. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and doesn’t consent
    to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine
    which is according to godliness,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with
    arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife,
    insulting, evil suspicions,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute
    of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw
    yourself from such. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] But godliness with contentment is great gain.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly
    can’t carry anything out.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] But having food and clothing, we will be content with that.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] But those who are determined to be rich fall into a
    temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men
    in ruin and destruction.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some
    have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced
    themselves through with many sorrows. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after
    righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and gentleness.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold of the eternal life
    to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight
    of many witnesses.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] I command you before God, who gives life to all things, and
    before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified the good
    confession,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless,
    until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and
    only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable
    light; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and eternal
    power. Amen. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Charge those who are rich in this present world that they
    not be haughty, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on
    the living God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that
    they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against
    the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Timothy, guard that which is committed to you, turning away
    from the empty chatter and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so
    called;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] which some professing have erred concerning the faith.
    Grace be with you. Amen. <br>
    <br>
