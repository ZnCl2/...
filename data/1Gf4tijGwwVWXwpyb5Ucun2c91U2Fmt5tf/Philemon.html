      <h1>Philemon</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,
    to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and
    to the assembly in your house:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord
    Jesus Christ. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward
    the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in
    the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the
    hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command
    you that which is appropriate,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul,
    the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in
    my chains, Onesimus, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and
    to me.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my
    own heart,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he
    might serve me in my chains for the Good News.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that
    your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a
    while, that you would have him forever,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved
    brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and
    in the Lord. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would
    receive me.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put
    that to my account.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not
    to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh
    my heart in the Lord.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you,
    knowing that you will do even beyond what I say. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through
    your prayers I will be restored to you. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow
    workers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
    Amen. <br>
