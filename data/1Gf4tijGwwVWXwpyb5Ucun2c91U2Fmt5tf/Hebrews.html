      <h1>Hebrews</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the
    prophets at many times and in various ways,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom
    he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his
    substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by
    himself purified us of our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty
    on high;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] having become so much better than the angels, as he has
    inherited a more excellent name than they have.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For to which of the angels did he say at any time, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“You are my Son.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Today have I become your father?”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+1%3A5"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    and again, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“I will be to him a Father,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he will be to me a Son?”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=2&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+1%3A5"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] When he again brings in the firstborn into the world he
    says, “Let all the angels of God worship him.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Of the angels he says, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Who makes his angels winds,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his servants a flame of fire.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+1%3A7"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] But of the Son he says, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your
      Kingdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">therefore God, your God, has anointed you with
      the oil of gladness above your fellows.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+1%3A9"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] And, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation
      of the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The heavens are the works of your hands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They will perish, but you continue.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They all will grow old like a garment does.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] You will roll them up like a mantle,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will be changed;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but you are the same.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your years will not fail.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+1%3A12"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] But which of the angels has he told at any time, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Sit at my right hand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">until I make your enemies the footstool of your
      feet?”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+1%3A13"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Aren’t they all serving spirits, sent out to do service for
    the sake of those who will inherit salvation? <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things
    that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and
    every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation—which
    at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by
    those who heard;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by
    various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his
    own will?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For he didn’t subject the world to come, of which we speak,
    to angels.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] But one has somewhere testified, saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“What is man, that you think of him?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Or the son of man, that you care for him?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] You made him a little lower than the angels.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You crowned him with glory and honor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] You have put all things in subjection under his feet.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+2%3A8"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not
    subject to him. But now we don’t see all things subjected to him, yet.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] But we see him who has been made a little lower than the
    angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and
    honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For it became him, for whom are all things, and through
    whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author
    of their salvation perfect through sufferings.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are
    all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“I will declare your name to my brothers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the midst of the congregation I will sing your
      praise.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+2%3A12"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Again, “I will put my trust in him.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+2%3A13"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> Again, “Behold, here I am with the
    children whom God has given me.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=2&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+2%3A13"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he
    also himself in the same way partook of the same, that through death he
    might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] and might deliver all of them who through fear of death
    were all their lifetime subject to bondage.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For most certainly, he doesn’t give help to angels, but he
    gives help to the seed of Abraham.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like
    his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in
    things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is
    able to help those who are tempted. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling,
    consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses
    in all his house.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses,
    because he who built the house has more honor than the house.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For every house is built by someone; but he who built all
    things is God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for
    a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house
    we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to
    the end.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Today if you will hear his voice,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like as in the day of the trial in the
      wilderness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] where your fathers tested me by proving me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and saw my works for forty years.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Therefore I was displeased with that generation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and said, ‘They always err in their heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but they didn’t know my ways;’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] as I swore in my wrath,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘They will not enter into my rest.’”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+3%3A11"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you
    an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called
    “today”; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the
    beginning of our confidence firm to the end:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] while it is said, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Today if you will hear his voice,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.”<a
        href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+3%3A15"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For who, when they heard, rebelled? No, didn’t all those
    who came out of Egypt by Moses?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with
    those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his
    rest, but to those who were disobedient?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] We see that they were not able to enter in because of
    unbelief. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should
    seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as
    they also did, but the word they heard didn’t profit them, because it wasn’t
    mixed with faith by those who heard.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he
    has said, “As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest”;<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A3"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> although the works were finished from
    the foundation of the world.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, “God
    rested on the seventh day from all his works”;<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A4"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] and in this place again, “They will not enter into my rest.”<a
      href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A5"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein,
    and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in
    because of disobedience,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David
    so long a time afterward (just as has been said), <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Today if you will hear his voice,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">don’t harden your hearts.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A7"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken
    afterward of another day.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of
    God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For he who has entered into his rest has himself also
    rested from his works, as God did from his.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest,
    lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than
    any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit,
    of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and
    intentions of the heart. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all
    things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him to whom we must give
    an account.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the
    heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] For we don’t have a high priest who can’t be touched with
    the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted
    like we are, yet without sin.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of
    grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of
    need. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] For every high priest, being taken from among men, is
    appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts
    and sacrifices for sins.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant
    and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the
    people, as well as for himself.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God,
    just like Aaron was.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] So also Christ didn’t glorify himself to be made a high
    priest, but it was he who said to him, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“You are my Son.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Today I have become your father.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+5%3A5"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] As he says also in another place, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“You are a priest forever,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">after the order of Melchizedek.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+5%3A6"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and
    petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from
    death, and having been heard for his godly fear,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things
    which he suffered.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey
    him the author of eternal salvation,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret,
    seeing you have become dull of hearing.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For although by this time you should be teachers, you again
    need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the
    oracles of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the
    word of righteousness, for he is a baby.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] But solid food is for those who are full grown, who by
    reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 6</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of
    Christ, let us press on to perfection—not laying again a foundation of
    repentance from dead works, of faith toward God,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of
    resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] This will we do, if God permits.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of
    the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age
    to come,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to
    repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put
    him to open shame.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on
    it, and produces a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled,
    receives blessing from God;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near
    being cursed, whose end is to be burned. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and
    things that accompany salvation, even though we speak like this.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and
    the labor of love which you showed toward his name, in that you served the
    saints, and still do serve them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence
    to the fullness of hope even to the end,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] that you won’t be sluggish, but imitators of those who
    through faith and patience inherited the promises.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could
    swear by no one greater, he swore by himself,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] saying, “Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying
    I will multiply you.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A14"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every dispute
    of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly
    to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with
    an oath;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for
    God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to
    take hold of the hope set before us.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both
    sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a
    high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 7</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most
    High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed
    him,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being
    first, by interpretation, king of righteousness, and then also king of
    Salem, which is king of peace;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] without father, without mother, without genealogy, having
    neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God),
    remains a priest continually.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham,
    the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best plunder.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s
    office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law,
    that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of
    Abraham,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted
    tithes from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the
    greater.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives
    tithes of whom it is testified that he lives.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives
    tithes, has paid tithes,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek
    met him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Now if there were perfection through the Levitical
    priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what further
    need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek,
    and not be called after the order of Aaron?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a
    change made also in the law.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] For he of whom these things are said belongs to another
    tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah,
    about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness
    of Melchizedek there arises another priest,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly
    commandment, but after the power of an endless life:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] for it is testified, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“You are a priest forever,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">according to the order of Melchizedek.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+7%3A17"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment
    because of its weakness and uselessness<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] (for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a
    better hope, through which we draw near to God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an
    oath<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] (for they indeed have been made priests without an oath),
    but he with an oath by him that says of him, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“The Lord swore and will not change his mind,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘You are a priest forever,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">according to the order of Melchizedek.’”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+7%3A21"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] By so much, Jesus has become the collateral of a better
    covenant.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are
    hindered from continuing by death.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood
    unchangeable.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those
    who draw near to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make
    intercession for them. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] For such a high priest was fitting for us: holy, guiltless,
    undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] who doesn’t need, like those high priests, to offer up
    sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the
    people. For he did this once for all, when he offered up himself.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness,
    but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a Son forever who
    has been perfected. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 8</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is
    this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the
    throne of the Majesty in the heavens,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle,
    which the Lord pitched, not man.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and
    sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have
    something to offer.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all,
    seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as
    Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he
    said, “See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was
    shown to you on the mountain.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A5"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so
    much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better
    promises has been given as law.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place
    would have been sought for a second.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] For finding fault with them, he said, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Behold, the days come”, says the Lord,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“that I will make a new covenant with the house
      of Israel and with the house of Judah;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] not according to the covenant that I made with their
      fathers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the day that I took them by the hand to lead
      them out of the land of Egypt;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for they didn’t continue in my covenant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I disregarded them,” says the Lord.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house
      of Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">After those days,” says the Lord;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“I will put my laws into their mind,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will also write them on their heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will be their God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will be my people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They will not teach every man his fellow citizen,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and every man his brother, saying, ‘Know the
      Lord,’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for all will know me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from their least to their greatest.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no
      more.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A12"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] In that he says, “A new covenant”, he has made the first
    old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing
    away. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 9</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now indeed even the first covenant had ordinances of divine
    service, and an earthly sanctuary.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For a tabernacle was prepared. In the first part were the
    lamp stand, the table, and the show bread; which is called the Holy Place.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the
    Holy of Holies,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the
    covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding
    the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat,
    of which things we can’t speak now in detail.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go
    in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year,
    not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the
    people.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the
    Holy Place wasn’t yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still
    standing;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] which is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and
    sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of
    making the worshiper perfect;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] being only (with meats and drinks and various washings)
    fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good
    things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with
    hands, that is to say, not of this creation,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through
    his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained
    eternal redemption.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a
    heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of
    the flesh:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the
    eternal Spirit offered himself without defect to God, cleanse your
    conscience from dead works to serve the living God?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since
    a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were
    under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the
    promise of the eternal inheritance.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For where a last will and testament is, there must of
    necessity be the death of him who made it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For a will is in force where there has been death, for it
    is never in force while he who made it lives.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated
    without blood.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all
    the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the
    goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book
    itself and all the people,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which God has
    commanded you.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+9%3A20"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of
    the ministry in the same way with the blood.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with
    blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in
    the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things
    themselves with better sacrifices than these.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] For Christ hasn’t entered into holy places made with hands,
    which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear
    in the presence of God for us;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high
    priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of
    the world. But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put
    away sin by the sacrifice of himself.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after
    this, judgment,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins
    of many, <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+9%3A28"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> will appear a second time, without sin,
    to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 10</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the
    very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year,
    which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Or else wouldn’t they have ceased to be offered, because the
    worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness
    of sins?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] But in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats
    should take away sins.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but you prepared a body for me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and
      sacrifices for sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the
      book it is written of me)</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to do your will, O God.’”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A7"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Previously saying, “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt
    offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn’t desire, neither had pleasure in
    them” (those which are offered according to the law),<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] then he has said, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He
    takes away the first, that he may establish the second,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] by which will we have been sanctified through the offering
    of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often
    offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever,
    sat down on the right hand of God;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] from that time waiting until his enemies are made the
    footstool of his feet.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are
    being sanctified.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] “This is the covenant that I will make with them:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘After those days,’ says the Lord,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘I will put my laws on their heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will also write them on their mind;’”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A16"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    then he says, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] “I will remember their sins and their iniquities no
      more.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A17"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering
    for sin.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy
    place by the blood of Jesus,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way,
    through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] and having a great priest over God’s house,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] let’s draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith,
    having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body
    washed with pure water,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] let us hold fast the confession of our hope without
    wavering; for he who promised is faithful. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good
    works,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of
    some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as you see the Day
    approaching.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] For if we sin willfully after we have received the
    knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a
    fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] A man who disregards Moses’ law dies without compassion on
    the word of two or three witnesses.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] How much worse punishment, do you think, will he be judged
    worthy of, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the
    blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has
    insulted the Spirit of grace?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] For we know him who said, “Vengeance belongs to me,” says
    the Lord, “I will repay.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A30"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> Again, “The Lord will judge his
    people.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=2&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A30"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
    God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] But remember the former days, in which, after you were
    enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions;
    and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and
    joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have
    for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] Therefore don’t throw away your boldness, which has a great
    reward.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] For you need endurance so that, having done the will of
    God, you may receive the promise. <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] “In a very little while,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he who comes will come, and will not wait.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] But the righteous will live by faith.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in
      him.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A38"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but
    of those who have faith to the saving of the soul. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 11</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things
    not seen.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For by this, the elders obtained testimony.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] By faith, we understand that the universe has been framed by
    the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which
    are visible.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice
    than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was
    righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he,
    being dead, still speaks.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] By faith, Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn’t see
    death, and he was not found, because God translated him. For he has had
    testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing
    to God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him,
    for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a
    rewarder of those who seek him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen,
    moved with godly fear, prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through
    which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is
    according to faith.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to
    the place which he was to receive for an inheritance. He went out, not
    knowing where he went.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in
    a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with
    him of the same promise.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose
    builder and maker is God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] By faith, even Sarah herself received power to conceive,
    and she bore a child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful
    who had promised.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and
    as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one
    man, and him as good as dead.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] These all died in faith, not having received the promises,
    but having seen them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that
    they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For those who say such things make it clear that they are
    seeking a country of their own.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which
    they went out, they would have had enough time to return.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly
    one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he
    has prepared a city for them. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he
    who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] even he to whom it was said, “In Isaac will your seed be
    called”; <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A18"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead.
    Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning
    things to come.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the
    sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of
    the departure of the children of Israel; and gave instructions concerning
    his bones.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three
    months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and
    they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called
    the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] choosing rather to share ill treatment with God’s people,
    than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
    treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king;
    for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the
    blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land.
    When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had
    been encircled for seven days.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] By faith, Rahab the prostitute, didn’t perish with those
    who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] What more shall I say? For the time would fail me if I told
    of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out
    righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A33"><small><sup

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] Women received their dead by resurrection.<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A35"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> Others were tortured, not accepting
    their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover
    by bonds and imprisonment.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] They were stoned.<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A37"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> They were sawn apart. They were
    tempted. They were slain with the sword.<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=2&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A37"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> They went around in sheep skins and in
    goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] (of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts,
    mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] These all, having had testimony given to them through their
    faith, didn’t receive the promise,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] God having provided some better thing concerning us, so
    that apart from us they should not be made perfect. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 12</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great
    a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily
    entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for
    the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and
    has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For consider him who has endured such contradiction of
    sinners against himself, that you don’t grow weary, fainting in your souls.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with
    you as with children, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“My son, don’t take lightly the chastening of the
      Lord,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor faint when you are reproved by him;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For whom the Lord loves, he chastens,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and scourges every son whom he receives.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A6"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] It is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as
    with children, for what son is there whom his father doesn’t discipline?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] But if you are without discipline, of which all have been
    made partakers, then are you illegitimate, and not children.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us,
    and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the
    Father of spirits, and live?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good
    to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but
    grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to
    those who have been exercised thereby.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble
    knees, <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A12"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] and make straight paths for your feet,<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A13"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> so that which is lame may not be
    dislocated, but rather be healed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification
    without which no man will see the Lord,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of
    the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and
    many be defiled by it;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] lest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane
    person, like Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit
    the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind
    though he sought it diligently with tears.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched,
    and that burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, storm,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those
    who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] for they could not stand that which was commanded, “If even
    an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned”;<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=2&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A20"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] and so fearful was the appearance that Moses said, “I am
    terrified and trembling.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A21"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the
    living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable multitudes of angels,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who
    are enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men
    made perfect,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant,<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A24"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> and to the blood of sprinkling that
    speaks better than that of Abel. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] See that you don’t refuse him who speaks. For if they
    didn’t escape when they refused him who warned on the earth, how much more
    will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] whose voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised,
    saying, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the
    heavens.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A26"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] This phrase, “Yet once more”, signifies the removing of
    those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those
    things which are not shaken may remain.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Therefore, receiving a Kingdom that can’t be shaken, let us
    have grace, through which we serve God acceptably, with reverence and awe,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] for our God is a consuming fire.<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A29"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 13</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Let brotherly love continue.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Don’t forget to show hospitality to strangers, for in doing
    so, some have entertained angels without knowing it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Remember those who are in bonds, as bound with them; and
    those who are ill-treated, since you are also in the body.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the bed be
    undefiled: but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Be free from the love of money, content with such things as
    you have, for he has said, “I will in no way leave you, neither will I in
    any way forsake you.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A5"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] So that with good courage we say, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“The Lord is my helper. I will not fear.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">What can man do to me?”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A6"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Remember your leaders, men who spoke to you the word of God,
    and considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Don’t be carried away by various and strange teachings, for
    it is good that the heart be established by grace, not by food, through
    which those who were so occupied were not benefited. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] We have an altar from which those who serve the holy
    tabernacle have no right to eat.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought
    into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned
    outside of the camp.<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A11"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people
    through his own blood, suffered outside of the gate.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Let us therefore go out to him outside of the camp, bearing
    his reproach.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For we don’t have here an enduring city, but we seek that
    which is to come.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Through him, then, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to
    God <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A15"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> continually, that is, the fruit of lips
    which proclaim allegiance to his name.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] But don’t forget to be doing good and sharing, for with
    such sacrifices God is well pleased. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch on
    behalf of your souls, as those who will give account, that they may do this
    with joy, and not with groaning, for that would be unprofitable for you. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good
    conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] I strongly urge you to do this, that I may be restored to
    you sooner. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead
    the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, our
    Lord Jesus,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] make you complete in every good work to do his will,
    working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus
    Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] But I exhort you, brothers, endure the word of exhortation,
    for I have written to you in few words.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Know that our brother Timothy has been freed, with whom, if
    he comes shortly, I will see you.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. The Italians
    greet you.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Grace be with you all. Amen. <br>
