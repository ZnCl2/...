      <h1>II Peter</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those
    who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our
    God and Savior, Jesus Christ:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God
    and of Jesus our Lord,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things
    that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called
    us by his own glory and virtue;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] by which he has granted to us his precious and exceedingly
    great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine
    nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all
    diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence,
    knowledge;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control
    patience; and in patience godliness;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly
    affection, love.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to
    be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For he who lacks these things is blind, seeing only what is
    near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Therefore, brothers, be more diligent to make your calling
    and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never stumble.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For thus you will be richly supplied with the entrance into
    the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Therefore I will not be negligent to remind you of these
    things, though you know them, and are established in the present truth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] I think it right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you
    up by reminding you;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] knowing that the putting off of my tent comes swiftly, even
    as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Yes, I will make every effort that you may always be able
    to remember these things even after my departure.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we
    made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were
    eyewitnesses of his majesty.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when
    the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son, in
    whom I am well pleased.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=II+Peter+1%3A17"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] We heard this voice come out of heaven when we were with
    him on the holy mountain. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] We have the more sure word of prophecy; and you do well
    that you heed it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns,
    and the morning star arises in your hearts:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of
    private interpretation.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but holy men
    of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] But false prophets also arose among the people, as false
    teachers will also be among you, who will secretly bring in destructive
    heresies, denying even the Master who bought them, bringing on themselves
    swift destruction.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Many will follow their immoral ways, and as a result, the
    way of the truth will be maligned.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] In covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words:
    whose sentence now from of old doesn’t linger, and their destruction will
    not slumber.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] For if God didn’t spare angels when they sinned, but cast
    them down to Tartarus, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be
    reserved for judgment;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] and didn’t spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with
    seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood on the
    world of the ungodly;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes,
    condemned them to destruction, having made them an example to those who
    would live ungodly;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] and delivered righteous Lot, who was very distressed by the
    lustful life of the wicked<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] (for that righteous man dwelling among them, was tormented
    in his righteous soul from day to day with seeing and hearing lawless
    deeds):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation
    and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of
    defilement, and despise authority. Daring, self-willed, they are not afraid
    to speak evil of dignitaries;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] whereas angels, though greater in might and power, don’t
    bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] But these, as unreasoning creatures, born natural animals
    to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil in matters about which they are
    ignorant, will in their destroying surely be destroyed,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] receiving the wages of unrighteousness; people who count it
    pleasure to revel in the daytime, spots and defects, reveling in their
    deceit while they feast with you;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] having eyes full of adultery, and who can’t cease from sin;
    enticing unsettled souls; having a heart trained in greed; children of
    cursing;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed
    the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wrongdoing;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] but he was rebuked for his own disobedience. A mute donkey
    spoke with a man’s voice and stopped the madness of the prophet.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] These are wells without water, clouds driven by a storm;
    for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] For, uttering great swelling words of emptiness, they
    entice in the lusts of the flesh, by licentiousness, those who are indeed
    escaping from those who live in error;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] promising them liberty, while they themselves are
    bondservants of corruption; for a man is brought into bondage by whoever
    overcomes him. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world
    through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again
    entangled in it and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than
    the first.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] For it would be better for them not to have known the way
    of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy
    commandment delivered to them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] But it has happened to them according to the true proverb,
    “The dog turns to his own vomit again,”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=II+Peter+2%3A22"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> and “the sow that has washed to
    wallowing in the mire.” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] This is now, beloved, the second letter that I have written
    to you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding you;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] that you should remember the words which were spoken before
    by the holy prophets, and the commandments of us, the apostles of the Lord
    and Savior:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] knowing this first, that in the last days mockers will come,
    walking after their own lusts,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] and saying, “Where is the promise of his coming? For, from
    the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from
    the beginning of the creation.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from
    of old, and an earth formed out of water and amid water, by the word of God;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] by which means the world that then was, being overflowed
    with water, perished.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same
    word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of
    judgment and destruction of ungodly men.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] But don’t forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is
    with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some count
    slowness; but is patient with us, not wishing that any should perish, but
    that all should come to repentance.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night;
    in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements
    will be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are in
    it will be burned up.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Therefore since all these things will be destroyed like
    this, what kind of people ought you to be in holy living and godliness,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of
    God, which will cause the burning heavens to be dissolved, and the elements
    will melt with fervent heat?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and
    a new earth, in which righteousness dwells. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for these things,
    be diligent to be found in peace, without defect and blameless in his sight.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; even as our
    beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to
    you;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] as also in all of his letters, speaking in them of these
    things. In those, there are some things that are hard to understand, which
    the ignorant and unsettled twist, as they also do to the other Scriptures,
    to their own destruction.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] You therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand,
    beware, lest being carried away with the error of the wicked, you fall from
    your own steadfastness.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
    Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and forever. Amen. <br>
