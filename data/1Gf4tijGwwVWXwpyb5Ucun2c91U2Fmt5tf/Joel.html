      <h1>Joel</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Yahweh’s word that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel. <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Hear this, you elders,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">And listen, all you inhabitants of the land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Has this ever happened in your days,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or in the days of your fathers?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Tell your children about it,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have your children tell their children,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their children, another generation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] What the swarming locust has left, the great locust has
      eaten.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">What the great locust has left, the grasshopper
      has eaten.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">What the grasshopper has left, the caterpillar
      has eaten.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the
      sweet wine;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for it is cut off from your mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For a nation has come up on my land, strong, and without
      number.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His teeth are the teeth of a lion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he has the fangs of a lioness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] He has laid my vine waste,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and stripped my fig tree.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has stripped its bark, and thrown it away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Its branches are made white.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband
      of her youth!</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from
    Yahweh’s house. <br>
    <span class="line indent0">The priests, Yahweh’s ministers, mourn.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The field is laid waste.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The land mourns, for the grain is destroyed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The new wine has dried up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the oil languishes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Be confounded, you farmers!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Wail, you vineyard keepers;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the wheat and for the barley;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the harvest of the field has perished.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The vine has dried up, and the fig tree withered;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the
      apple tree,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even all of the trees of the field are withered;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for joy has withered away from the sons of men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Wail, you ministers of the altar.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers
      of my God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the meal offering and the drink offering are
      withheld from your God’s house.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Sanctify a fast.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Call a solemn assembly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Gather the elders,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and all the inhabitants of the land, to the house
      of Yahweh, your God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and cry to Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Alas for the day!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For the day of Yahweh is at hand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and it will come as destruction from the
      Almighty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Isn’t the food cut off before our eyes;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">joy and gladness from the house of our God?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The seeds rot under their clods.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The granaries are laid desolate.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The barns are broken down, for the grain has
      withered.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] How the animals groan!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The herds of livestock are perplexed, because
      they have no pasture.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Yahweh, I cry to you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For the fire has devoured the pastures of the
      wilderness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the flame has burned all the trees of the
      field.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Yes, the animals of the field pant to you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the water brooks have dried up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">And the fire has devoured the pastures of the
      wilderness.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Blow the trumpet in Zion,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">and sound an alarm in my holy mountain!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the day of Yahweh comes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for it is close at hand:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] A day of darkness and gloominess,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a day of clouds and thick darkness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">As the dawn spreading on the mountains,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a great and strong people;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">there has never been the like,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will there be any more after them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even to the years of many generations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] A fire devours before them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and behind them, a flame burns.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The land is as the garden of Eden before them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and behind them, a desolate wilderness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, and no one has escaped them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Their appearance is as the appearance of horses,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and as horsemen, so do they run.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do
      they leap,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like the noise of a flame of fire that devours
      the stubble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as a strong people set in battle array.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] At their presence the peoples are in anguish.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All faces have grown pale.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They run like mighty men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They climb the wall like warriors.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They each march in his line, and they don’t
      swerve off course.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Neither does one jostle another;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they march everyone in his path,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they burst through the defenses,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t break ranks.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] They rush on the city.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They run on the wall.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They climb up into the houses.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They enter in at the windows like thieves.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The earth quakes before them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The heavens tremble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The sun and the moon are darkened,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the stars withdraw their shining.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Yahweh thunders his voice before his army;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for his forces are very great;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he is strong who obeys his command;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and who can endure it?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] “Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your
      heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and with fasting, and with weeping, and with
      mourning.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Tear your heart, and not your garments,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and turn to Yahweh, your God;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he is gracious and merciful,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and relents from sending calamity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Who knows? He may turn and relent,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and leave a blessing behind him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even a meal offering and a drink offering to
      Yahweh, your God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Blow the trumpet in Zion!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Sanctify a fast.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Call a solemn assembly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Gather the people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Sanctify the assembly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Assemble the elders.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Gather the children, and those who nurse from
      breasts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let the bridegroom go out of his room,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the bride out of her room.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between
      the porch and the altar,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t give your heritage to reproach,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that the nations should rule over them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Why should they say among the peoples,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘Where is their God?’”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Then Yahweh was jealous for his land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">And had pity on his people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Yahweh answered his people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Behold, I will send you grain, new wine, and
      oil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and you will be satisfied with them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will no more make you a reproach among the
      nations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] But I will remove the northern army far away from you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will drive it into a barren and desolate
      land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">its front into the eastern sea,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and its back into the western sea;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and its stench will come up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and its bad smell will rise.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Surely he has done great things.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Land, don’t be afraid.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great
      things.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the pastures of the wilderness spring up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the tree bears its fruit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] “Be glad then, you children of Zion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and rejoice in Yahweh, your God;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he gives you the former rain in just measure,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he causes the rain to come down for you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the former rain and the latter rain,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as before.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] The threshing floors will be full of wheat,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust
      has eaten,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the great locust, the grasshopper, and the
      caterpillar,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my great army, which I sent among you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] You will have plenty to eat, and be satisfied,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will praise the name of Yahweh, your God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who has dealt wondrously with you;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and my people will never again be disappointed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] You will know that I am in the midst of Israel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and that I am Yahweh, your God, and there is no
      one else;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and my people will never again be disappointed.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] “It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit
      on all flesh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your old men will dream dreams.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your young men will see visions.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those
      days,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will pour out my Spirit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] The sun will be turned into darkness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the moon into blood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">before the great and terrible day of Yahweh
      comes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh’s name
      shall be saved;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be
      those who escape,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as Yahweh has said,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] “For, behold, in those days,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">and in that time,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when I restore the fortunes of Judah and
      Jerusalem,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I will gather all nations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will bring them down into the valley of
      Jehoshaphat;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will execute judgment on them there for my
      people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have
      scattered among the nations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They have divided my land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] and have cast lots for my people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have given a boy for a prostitute,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] “Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre, and Sidon,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and all the regions of Philistia?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Will you repay me?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">And if you repay me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment
      on your own head.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Because you have taken my silver and my gold,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and have carried my finest treasures into your
      temples,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] and have sold the children of Judah and the children of
      Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that you may remove them far from their border.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you
      have sold them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will return your repayment on your own head;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the
      hands of the children of Judah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will sell them to the men of Sheba,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to a faraway nation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for Yahweh has spoken it.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Proclaim this among the nations:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Prepare for war!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Stir up the mighty men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let all the warriors draw near.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let them come up.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Beat your plowshares into swords, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your pruning hooks into spears.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and gather yourselves together.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Cause your mighty ones to come down there,
      Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] “Let the nations arouse themselves,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding
      nations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Put in the sickle;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the harvest is ripe.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Come, tread, for the wine press is full,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the vats overflow, for their wickedness is
      great.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For the day of Yahweh is near, in the valley of
      decision.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The sun and the moon are darkened,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the stars withdraw their shining.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Yahweh will roar from Zion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and thunder from Jerusalem;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the heavens and the earth will shake;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a stronghold to the children of Israel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] “So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Then Jerusalem will be holy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and no strangers will pass through her any more.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] It will happen in that day,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that the mountains will drop down sweet wine,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the hills will flow with milk,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a fountain will flow out from Yahweh’s house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will water the valley of Shittim.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Egypt will be a desolation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the violence done to the children of Judah,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because they have shed innocent blood in their
      land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] But Judah will be inhabited forever,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] I will cleanse their blood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that I have not cleansed:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for Yahweh dwells in Zion.”</span><br>
