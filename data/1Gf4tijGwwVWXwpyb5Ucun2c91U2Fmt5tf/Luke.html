      <h1>Luke</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative
    concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and
    servants of the word delivered them to us,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all
    things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent
    Theophilus;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] that you might know the certainty concerning the things in
    which you were instructed. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain
    priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of
    the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in
    all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and
    they both were well advanced in years.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Now while he executed the priest’s office before God in the
    order of his division,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was
    to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at
    the hour of incense. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right
    side of the altar of incense.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon
    him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] But the angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zacharias,
    because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you
    a son, and you shall call his name John.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at
    his birth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will
    drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even
    from his mother’s womb.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord,
    their God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah,
    ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’ and the disobedient to
    the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this?
    For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the
    presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good
    news.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the
    day that these things will happen, because you didn’t believe my words,
    which will be fulfilled in their proper time.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled
    that he delayed in the temple.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they
    perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs
    to them, and remained mute.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] When the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to
    his house.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she
    hid herself five months, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] “Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he
    looked at me, to take away my reproach among men.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God
    to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was
    Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, you highly
    favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the
    saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, for you have
    found favor with God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and give birth to a
    son, and will call his name ‘Jesus.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most
    High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There
    will be no end to his Kingdom.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, seeing I am a
    virgin?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come on you,
    and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy
    one who is born from you will be called the Son of God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son
    in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] For everything spoken by God is possible.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] Mary said, “Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me
    according to your word.” <br>
    <br>
    The angel departed from her.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country
    with haste, into a city of Judah,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted
    Elizabeth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in
    her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] She called out with a loud voice, and said, “Blessed are
    you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come
    to me?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my
    ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a
    fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] Mary said, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“My soul magnifies the Lord.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] for he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For behold, from now on, all generations will
      call me blessed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] For he who is mighty has done great things for me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Holy is his name.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] His mercy is for generations of generations on those who
      fear him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[51] He has shown strength with his arm.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has scattered the proud in the imagination of
      their hearts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[52] He has put down princes from their thrones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">And has exalted the lowly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[53] He has filled the hungry with good things.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has sent the rich away empty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[54] He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might
      remember mercy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[55] As he spoke to our fathers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to Abraham and his seed forever.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[56] Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned
    to her house.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[57] Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was
    fulfilled, and she gave birth to a son.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[58] Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had
    magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with her.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[59] On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child; and
    they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[60] His mother answered, “Not so; but he will be called John.”
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[61] They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who
    is called by this name.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[62] They made signs to his father, what he would have him
    called. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[63] He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, “His name is
    John.” <br>
    <br>
    They all marveled.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[64] His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and
    he spoke, blessing God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[65] Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these
    sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[66] All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying,
    “What then will this child be?” The hand of the Lord was with him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[67] His father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and
    prophesied, saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[68] “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he has visited and worked redemption for his
      people;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[69] and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house
      of his servant David</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[70] (as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have
      been from of old),</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[71] salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who
      hate us;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[72] to show mercy towards our fathers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to remember his holy covenant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[73] the oath which he spoke to Abraham, our father,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[74] to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand
      of our enemies,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">should serve him without fear,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[75] In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of
      our life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[76] And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most
      High,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you will go before the face of the Lord to
      prepare his ways,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[77] to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the
      remission of their sins,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[78] because of the tender mercy of our God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[79] to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of
      death;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to guide our feet into the way of peace.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[80] The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and
    was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus
    that all the world should be enrolled.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was
    governor of Syria.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of
    Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,
    because he was of the house and family of David;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married
    to him as wife, being pregnant. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] While they were there, the day had come for her to give
    birth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in
    bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room
    for them in the inn.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] There were shepherds in the same country staying in the
    field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of
    the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for behold, I
    bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For there is born to you, this day, in the city of David, a
    Savior, who is Christ the Lord.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in
    strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the
    heavenly army praising God, and saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] “Glory to God in the highest,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">on earth peace, good will toward men.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] When the angels went away from them into the sky, the
    shepherds said one to another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem, now, and see this
    thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] They came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and
    the baby was lying in the feeding trough.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which
    was spoken to them about this child.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken
    to them by the shepherds.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her
    heart.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all
    the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the
    child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before he was
    conceived in the womb. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] When the days of their purification according to the law of
    Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to
    the Lord<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] (as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male who
    opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”),<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+2%3A23"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in
    the law of the Lord, “A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+2%3A24"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon.
    This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel,
    and the Holy Spirit was on him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he
    should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] He came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents
    brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to
    the custom of the law,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and
    said, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] “Now you are releasing your servant, Master,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">according to your word, in peace;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] for my eyes have seen your salvation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] a light for revelation to the nations,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the glory of your people Israel.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which
    were spoken concerning him,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother,
    “Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel,
    and for a sign which is spoken against.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the
    thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel,
    of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband
    seven years from her virginity,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who
    didn’t depart from the temple, worshiping with fastings and petitions night
    and day.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord,
    and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] When they had accomplished all things that were according
    to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city,
    Nazareth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] The child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit,
    being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of
    the Passover. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem
    according to the custom of the feast,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were
    returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother
    didn’t know it,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s
    journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] When they didn’t find him, they returned to Jerusalem,
    looking for him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in
    the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them
    questions.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his
    answers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother
    said to him, “Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and
    I were anxiously looking for you.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Why were you
      looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”</span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] They didn’t understand the saying which he spoke to them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[51] And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth. He was
    subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[52] And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor
    with God and men. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
    Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee,
    and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis,
    and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of
    God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the
    baptism of repentance for remission of sins.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the
    prophet, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“The voice of one crying in the wilderness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘Make ready the way of the Lord.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Make his paths straight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Every valley will be filled.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Every mountain and hill will be brought low.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The crooked will become straight,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the rough ways smooth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] All flesh will see God’s salvation.’”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+3%3A6"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be
    baptized by him, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the
    wrath to come?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and don’t
    begin to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father;’ for I tell
    you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees. Every
    tree therefore that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down, and thrown into
    the fire.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The multitudes asked him, “What then must we do?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] He answered them, “He who has two coats, let him give to
    him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to
    him, “Teacher, what must we do?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He said to them, “Collect no more than that which is
    appointed to you.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Soldiers also asked him, saying, “What about us? What must
    we do?” <br>
    <br>
    He said to them, “Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone
    wrongfully. Be content with your wages.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in
    their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] John answered them all, “I indeed baptize you with water,
    but he comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not
    worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse
    his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will
    burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to
    the people,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias,
    his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] added this also to them all, that he shut up John in
    prison.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been
    baptized, and was praying. The sky was opened,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on
    him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying “You are my beloved Son. In you
    I am well pleased.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty
    years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the
    son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum,

    the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the
    son of Elmodam, the son of Er,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] the son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the
    son of Matthat, the son of Levi,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the
    son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha,
    the son of Nathan, the son of David,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son
    of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] the son of Amminadab, the son of Aram, the son of Hezron,
    the son of Perez, the son of Judah,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the
    son of Terah, the son of Nahor,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son
    of Eber, the son of Shelah,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem,
    the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared,
    the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son
    of God. <br>

    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan,
    and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing
    in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command
    this stone to become bread.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Jesus answered him, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “It
      is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of
      God.’”</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+4%3A4"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all
    the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The devil said to him, “I will give you all this authority,
    and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever
    I want.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be
    yours.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Jesus answered him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Get behind
      me Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you
      shall serve him only.’”</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+4%3A8"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the
    temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from
    here,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] for it is written, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘He will put his angels in charge of you, to
      guard you;’</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] and, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">‘On their hands they will bear you up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">lest perhaps you dash your foot against a
      stone.’”<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+4%3A11"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Jesus answering, said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “It has been said, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+4%3A12"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed
    from him until another time. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and
    news about him spread through all the surrounding area.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. He
    entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood
    up to read.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened
    the book, and found the place where it was written, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The Spirit of the Lord is
        on me,</span> </span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> He has sent me to

    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> to deliver those who

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and to proclaim the
        acceptable year of the Lord.”</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+4%3A19"><small><sup
            class="x">*x</sup></small></a></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat
    down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] He began to tell them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Today,
      this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] All testified about him, and wondered at the gracious words
    which proceeded out of his mouth, and they said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Doubtless
      you will tell me this parable, ‘Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have
      heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.’”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] He said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Most certainly I
      tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But truly I tell you, there
      were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up
      three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Elijah was sent to none of
      them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a
      widow. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> There were many lepers in
      Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was
      cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they
    heard these things.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the
    brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off
    the cliff.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] But he, passing through their midst, went his way. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was
    teaching them on the Sabbath day,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was
    with authority.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an
    unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] saying, “Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of
    Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One
    of God!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Be
      silent, and come out of him!” </span> When the demon had thrown him down
    in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] Amazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with
    another, saying, “What is this word? For with authority and power he
    commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] News about him went out into every place of the surrounding
    region. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] He rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s
    house. Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they
    begged him for her.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] He stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her.
    Immediately she rose up and served them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with
    various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of
    them, and healed them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] Demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, “You
    are the Christ, the Son of God!” Rebuking them, he didn’t allow them to
    speak, because they knew that he was the Christ. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited
    place, and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to
    him, so that he wouldn’t go away from them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] But he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I must
      preach the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other cities also. For
      this reason I have been sent.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of
    God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had
    gone out of them, and were washing their nets.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and
    asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the
    multitudes from the boat.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Simon answered him, “Master, we worked all night, and took
    nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of
    fish, and their net was breaking.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they
    should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they
    began to sink.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees,
    saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch
    of fish which they had caught;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were
    partners with Simon. <br>
    <br>
    Jesus said to Simon, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Don’t be afraid. From now
      on you will be catching people alive.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] When they had brought their boats to land, they left
    everything, and followed him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] While he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man
    full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him,
    saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, <span
      class="wordsOfJesus"> “I want to. Be made clean.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    Immediately the leprosy left him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] He commanded him to tell no one, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your
      cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”</span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] But the report concerning him spread much more, and great
    multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their
    infirmities.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] On one of those days, he was teaching; and there were
    Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every
    village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him
    to heal them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they
    sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude,
    they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his
    cot into the midst before Jesus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Seeing their faith, he said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Man, your sins are forgiven you.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who
    is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, <span
      class="wordsOfJesus"> “Why are you reasoning so in your hearts? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Which is easier to say, ‘Your
      sins are forgiven you;’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk?’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But that you may know that the
      Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</span> (he said to the
    paralyzed man), <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I tell you, arise, and take up
      your cot, and go to your house.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which
    he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They
    were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen strange things today.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector
    named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Follow me!”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] He left everything, and rose up and followed him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Levi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a
    great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his
    disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and
    sinners?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Jesus answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Those
      who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I have not come to call the
      righteous, but sinners to repentance.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] They said to him, “Why do John’s disciples often fast and
    pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and
    drink?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Can you make
      the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them? </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But the days will come when
      the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those
      days.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] He also told a parable to them. <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will
      tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> No one puts new wine into old
      wine skins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be
      spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But new wine must be put into
      fresh wine skins, and both are preserved. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> No man having drunk old wine
      immediately desires new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’”</span> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 6</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now on the second Sabbath after the first, he was going
    through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate,
    rubbing them in their hands.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] But some of the Pharisees said to them, “Why do you do that
    which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Jesus, answering them, said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry, he, and those who
      were with him; </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> how he entered into God’s
      house, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were
      with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?”</span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The Son of
      Man is lord of the Sabbath.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the
    synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was
    withered.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he
    would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had
    the withered hand, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Rise up, and stand in the
      middle.”</span> He arose and stood.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Then Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I
      will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do
      harm? To save a life, or to kill?”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He looked around at them all, and said to the man, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Stretch out your hand.”</span> He did, and his hand was restored as sound
    as the other.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another
    about what they might do to Jesus. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] In these days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he
    continued all night in prayer to God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he
    chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother;
    James; John; Philip; Bartholomew;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Simon, who was
    called the Zealot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became
    a traitor.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a
    crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and
    Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to
    be healed of their diseases;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and
    they were being healed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out
    of him and healed them all. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said, <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Blessed are you who
        are poor,</span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> for yours is the

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If you do good to those who do
      good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If you lend to those from whom

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] He spoke a parable to them. <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Can the blind guide the blind? Won’t they both fall into a pit? </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> A disciple is not above his
      teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Why do you see the speck of
      chaff that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is
      in your own eye? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Or how can you tell your
      brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,’
      when you yourself don’t see the beam that is in your own eye? You
      hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see
      clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For there is no good tree that
      produces rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that produces good fruit. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For each tree is known by its
      own fruit. For people don’t gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather
      grapes from a bramble bush. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The good man out of the good
      treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out
      of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out
      of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Why do you call me, ‘Lord,
      Lord,’ and don’t do the things which I say? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Everyone who comes to me, and
      hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He is like a man building a
      house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a
      flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it,
      because it was founded on the rock. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But he who hears, and doesn’t
      do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation,
      against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of
      that house was great.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 7</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people,
    he entered into Capernaum.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] A certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick
    and at the point of death.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the
    Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying,
    “He is worthy for you to do this for him,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the
    house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t
    trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you;
    but say the word, and my servant will be healed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] For I also am a man placed under authority, having under
    myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’
    and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and
    turned and said to the multitude who followed him, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.”</span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the
    servant who had been sick was well. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Soon afterwards, he went to a city called Nain. Many of his
    disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, one
    who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a
    widow. Many people of the city were with her.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said
    to her, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Don’t cry.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood
    still. He said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Young man, I tell you, arise!”</span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him
    to his mother. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, “A
    great prophet has arisen among us!” and, “God has visited his people!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea,
    and in all the surrounding region. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] The disciples of John told him about all these things.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to
    Jesus, saying, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for
    another?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] When the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptizer
    has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he who comes, or should we look for
    another?’” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil
    spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Jesus answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Go and
      tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive
      their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the
      dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Blessed is he who finds no
      occasion for stumbling in me.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] When John’s messengers had departed, he began to tell the
    multitudes about John, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “What did you go out
      into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But what did you go out to
      see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously
      dressed, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But what did you go out to
      see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> This is he of whom it is
      written,</span> <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> ‘Behold, I send my
        messenger before your face,</span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> who will prepare your
        way before you.’</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+7%3A27"><small><sup

    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “For I tell you, among those
      who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the
      Baptizer, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they
    declared God to be just, having been baptized with John’s baptism.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of
    God, not being baptized by him themselves. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “To what then will I liken the
      people of this generation? What are they like? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> They are like children who sit
      in the marketplace, and call one to another, saying, ‘We piped to you, and
      you didn’t dance. We mourned, and you didn’t weep.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For John the Baptizer came
      neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The Son of Man has come eating
      and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a
      friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Wisdom is justified by all her
      children.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He
    entered into the Pharisee’s house, and sat at the table.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew
    that he was reclining in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar
    of ointment.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his
    feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed
    his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said
    to himself, “This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and
    what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] Jesus answered him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Simon, I
      have something to tell you.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    He said, “Teacher, say on.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “A certain lender had two
      debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When they couldn’t pay, he
      forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] Simon answered, “He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the
    most.” <br>
    <br>
    He said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “You have judged correctly.”</span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no
      water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them
      with the hair of her head. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> You gave me no kiss, but she,
      since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> You didn’t anoint my head with
      oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Therefore I tell you, her
      sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little
      is forgiven, the same loves little.” </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] He said to her, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Your sins are
      forgiven.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] Those who sat at the table with him began to say to
    themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] He said to the woman, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Your
      faith has saved you. Go in peace.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 8</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Soon afterwards, he went about through cities and villages,
    preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God. With him were
    the twelve,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and
    infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone
    out;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod’s steward; Susanna;
    and many others; who served them from their possessions.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] When a great multitude came together, and people from every
    city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The farmer went out to sow his
      seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under
      foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Other seed fell on the rock,
      and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Other fell amid the thorns, and
      the thorns grew with it, and choked it. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Other fell into the good
      ground, and grew, and produced one hundred times as much fruit.”</span> As
    he said these things, he called out, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He who
      has ears to hear, let him hear!”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Then his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?”
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “To you it is given
      to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables;
      that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’</span>
    <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+8%3A10"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Now the parable is this: The
      seed is the word of God. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Those along the road are those
      who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart,
      that they may not believe and be saved. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Those on the rock are they
      who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root,
      who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> That which fell among the
      thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they
      are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit
      to maturity. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> That in the good ground, these
      are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it
      tightly, and produces fruit with patience.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “No one, when he has lit a
      lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a
      stand, that those who enter in may see the light. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For nothing is hidden, that
      will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come
      to light. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Be careful therefore how you
      hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn’t have,
      from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not
    come near him for the crowd.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] It was told him by some saying, “Your mother and your
    brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] But he answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “My
      mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Now on one of those days, he entered into a boat, himself
    and his disciples, and he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Let’s
      go over to the other side of the lake.”</span> So they launched out.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down
    on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] They came to him, and awoke him, saying, “Master, master,
    we are dying!” He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water,
    and they ceased, and it was calm.<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+8%3A24"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Where is
      your faith?”</span> Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another,
    “Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they
    obey him?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is
    opposite Galilee. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city
    who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live
    in a house, but in the tombs.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him,
    and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son
    of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of
    the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under
    guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was
    driven by the demon into the desert. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Jesus asked him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “What is your
      name?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] They begged him that he would not command them to go into
    the abyss.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the
    mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those.
    He allowed them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] The demons came out of the man, and entered into the pigs,
    and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled,
    and told it in the city and in the country. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] People went out to see what had happened. They came to
    Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at
    Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by
    demons was healed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes
    asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered
    into the boat, and returned.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him
    that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Return to your house, and
      declare what great things God has done for you.”</span> He went his way,
    proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for
    him. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] When Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they
    were all waiting for him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler
    of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet, and begged him to come into
    his house,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and
    she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had
    spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] came behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and
    immediately the flow of her blood stopped.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] Jesus said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Who touched me?”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes
    press and jostle you, and you say, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> ‘Who touched
      me?’</span> ” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] But Jesus said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Someone did
      touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came
    trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of
    all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed
    immediately.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] He said to her, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Daughter,
      cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s
    house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the
    Teacher.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] But Jesus hearing it, answered him, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[51] When he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter
    in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[52] All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[53] They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[54] But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he
    called, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Child, arise!”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[55] Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He
    commanded that something be given to her to eat.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[56] Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no
    one what had been done. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 9</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] He called the twelve together, and gave them power and
    authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He sent them out to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal
    the sick.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Take nothing
      for your journey—neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither
      have two coats apiece. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Into whatever house you enter,
      stay there, and depart from there. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> As many as don’t receive you,
      when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for
      a testimony against them.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] They departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching
    the Good News, and healing everywhere.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him;
    and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen
    from the dead,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one
    of the old prophets had risen again.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Herod said, “John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I
    hear such things?” He sought to see him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things
    they had done. <br>
    <br>
    He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called
    Bethsaida.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He
    welcomed them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and he cured those
    who needed healing.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said
    to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding
    villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted
    place.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] But he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “You give
      them something to eat.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should
    go and buy food for all these people.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For they were about five thousand men. <br>
    <br>
    He said to his disciples, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Make them sit down
      in groups of about fifty each.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] They did so, and made them all sit down.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to
    the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to
    set before the multitude.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve
    baskets of broken pieces that were left over. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] As he was praying alone, the disciples were with him, and
    he asked them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Who do the multitudes say that
      I am?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] They answered, “‘John the Baptizer,’ but others say,
    ‘Elijah,’ and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But who do
      you say that I am?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    Peter answered, “The Christ of God.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no
    one,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The Son of Man must
      suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and
      scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] He said to all, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “If anyone
      desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross,</span>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and follow me. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For whoever desires to save
      his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the
      same will save it. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For what does it profit a man
      if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self? </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For whoever will be ashamed of
      me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes
      in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But I tell you the truth:
      There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death,
      until they see the Kingdom of God.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] About eight days after these sayings, he took with him
    Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered,
    and his clothing became white and dazzling.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and
    Elijah,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he
    was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with
    sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men
    who stood with him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] As they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus,
    “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you,
    and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed
    them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved
    Son. Listen to him!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were
    silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain,
    a great multitude met him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Teacher,
    I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it
    convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him
    severely.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.”
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] Jesus answered, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Faithless and
      perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring
      your son here.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and
    convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed
    the boy, and gave him back to his father.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] They were all astonished at the majesty of God. <br>
    <br>
    But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to
    his disciples,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Let these words sink into
      your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.”</span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] But they didn’t understand this saying. It was concealed
    from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him
    about this saying. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] There arose an argument among them about which of them was
    the greatest.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a
    little child, and set him by his side,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] and said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Whoever
      receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me
      receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one
      will be great.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] John answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons
    in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow with us.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Don’t
      forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[51] It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be
    taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[52] and sent messengers before his face. They went, and entered
    into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[53] They didn’t receive him, because he was traveling with his
    face set towards Jerusalem.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[54] When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said,
    “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy
    them, just as Elijah did?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[55] But he turned and rebuked them, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “You don’t know of what kind of spirit you are. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[56] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For the Son of Man didn’t come
      to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    They went to another village.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[57] As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want
    to follow you wherever you go, Lord.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[58] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The foxes
      have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no
      place to lay his head.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[59] He said to another, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Follow
      me!”</span> <br>
    <br>
    But he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[60] But Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Leave
      the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the Kingdom of
      God.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[61] Another also said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first
    allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[62] But Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “No
      one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the
      Kingdom of God.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 10</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy
    others, and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place,
    where he was about to come.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Then he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The
      harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to
      the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Go your ways. Behold, I send
      you out as lambs among wolves. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor
      sandals. Greet no one on the way. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Into whatever house you enter,
      first say, ‘Peace be to this house.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If a son of peace is there,
      your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Remain in that same house,
      eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his
      wages. Don’t go from house to house. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Into whatever city you enter,
      and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Heal the sick who are therein,
      and tell them, ‘The Kingdom of God has come near to you.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But into whatever city you
      enter, and they don’t receive you, go out into its streets and say, </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> ‘Even the dust from your city
      that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that
      the Kingdom of God has come near to you.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I tell you, it will be more
      tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to
      you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon
      which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in
      sackcloth and ashes. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But it will be more tolerable
      for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> You, Capernaum, who are
      exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Whoever listens to you listens
      to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me rejects him
      who sent me.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the
    demons are subject to us in your name!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I saw Satan
      having fallen like lightning from heaven. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Behold, I give you authority
      to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy.
      Nothing will in any way hurt you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Nevertheless, don’t rejoice in
      this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are
      written in heaven.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and
    said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven
      and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and
      understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so
      it was well-pleasing in your sight.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Turning to the disciples, he said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows who the
      Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he
      to whomever the Son desires to reveal him.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Turning to the disciples, he said privately, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> for I tell you that many
      prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t see
      them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear them.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying,
    “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] He said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “What is
      written in the law? How do you read it?” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] He answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all
    your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your
    mind;<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+10%3A27"><small><sup

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] He said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “You have
      answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, “Who is
    my neighbor?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Jesus answered, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “A certain man
      was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who
      both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> By chance a certain priest was
      going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> In the same way a Levite also,
      when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But a certain Samaritan, as he
      traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with
      compassion, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> came to him, and bound up his
      wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought
      him to an inn, and took care of him. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> On the next day, when he
      departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to
      him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you
      when I return.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Now which of these three do
      you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] He said, “He who showed mercy on him.” <br>
    <br>
    Then Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Go and do likewise.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] As they went on their way, he entered into a certain
    village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet,
    and heard his word.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came
    up to him, and said, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister left me to serve
    alone? Ask her therefore to help me.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] Jesus answered her, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Martha,
      Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> but one thing is needed. Mary
      has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 11</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] When he finished praying in a certain place, one of his
    disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his
    disciples.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “When you
      pray, say,</span> <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> ‘Our Father in
        heaven,</span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> may your name be kept
        holy.</span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> May your Kingdom
        come.</span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> May your will be done
        on earth, as it is in heaven.</span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Give us day by day our daily
        bread.</span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Forgive us our sins,</span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> for we ourselves also
        forgive everyone who is indebted to us. </span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> Bring us not into
        temptation,</span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> but deliver us from
        the evil one.’”</span> </span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Which of you,
      if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell him, ‘Friend, lend me three
      loaves of bread, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> for a friend of mine has come
      to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and he from within will answer
      and say, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with
      me in bed. I can’t get up and give it to you’? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I tell you, although he will
      not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his
      persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I tell you, keep asking, and
      it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and
      it will be opened to you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For everyone who asks
      receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Which of you fathers, if your
      son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he
      won’t give him a snake instead of a fish, will he? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Or if he asks for an egg, he
      won’t give him a scorpion, will he? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If you then, being evil, know
      how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly
      Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. When the demon
    had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul,
    the prince of the demons.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house
      divided against itself falls. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If Satan also is divided
      against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out
      demons by Beelzebul. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But if I cast out demons by
      Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be
      your judges. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But if I by the finger of God
      cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “When the strong man, fully
      armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But when someone stronger
      attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which
      he trusted, and divides his plunder. </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He that is not with me is
      against me. He who doesn’t gather with me scatters. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The unclean spirit, when he
      has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and
      finding none, he says, ‘I will turn back to my house from which I came
      out.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When he returns, he finds it
      swept and put in order. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Then he goes, and takes seven
      other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there.
      The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] It came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman
    out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, “Blessed is the
    womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] But he said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “On the contrary,
      blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] When the multitudes were gathering together to him, he
    began to say, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “This is an evil generation. It
      seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the
      prophet. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For even as Jonah became a
      sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The Queen of the South will
      rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn
      them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of
      Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The men of Nineveh will stand
      up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they
      repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is
      here.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “No one, when he has lit a
      lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those
      who come in may see the light. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The lamp of the body is the
      eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of
      light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Therefore see whether the
      light that is in you isn’t darkness. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If therefore your whole body
      is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as
      when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] Now as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with
    him. He went in, and sat at the table.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] When the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first
    washed himself before dinner.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] The Lord said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Now you
      Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your
      inward part is full of extortion and wickedness. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> You foolish ones, didn’t he
      who made the outside make the inside also? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But give for gifts to the
      needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean
      to you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But woe to you Pharisees! For
      you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and the love
      of God. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other
      undone. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Woe to you Pharisees! For you
      love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the
      marketplaces. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Woe to you, scribes and
      Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who
      walk over them don’t know it.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] One of the lawyers answered him, “Teacher, in saying this
    you insult us also.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] He said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Woe to you lawyers
      also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you
      yourselves won’t even lift one finger to help carry those burdens. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Woe to you! For you build the
      tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> So you testify and consent to
      the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their
      tombs. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Therefore also the wisdom of
      God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them
      they will kill and persecute, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> that the blood of all the
      prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required
      of this generation; </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[51] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> from the blood of Abel to the
      blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.’
      Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[52] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Woe to you lawyers! For you
      took away the key of knowledge. You didn’t enter in yourselves, and those
      who were entering in, you hindered.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[53] As he said these things to them, the scribes and the
    Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[54] lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in
    something he might say, that they might accuse him. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 12</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered
    together, so much so that they trampled on each other, he began to tell his
    disciples first of all, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Beware of the yeast of
      the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But there is nothing covered
      up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Therefore whatever you have
      said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in
      the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I tell you, my friends, don’t
      be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that
      they can do. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But I will warn you whom you
      should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed, has power to cast into
      Gehenna.</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Yes, I tell you, fear him.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Aren’t five sparrows sold for
      two assaria coins</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> ? Not one of them is
      forgotten by God. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But the very hairs of your head
      are all numbered. Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than
      many sparrows.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I tell you, everyone who
      confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the
      angels of God; </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> but he who denies me in the
      presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Everyone who speaks a word
      against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against
      the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When they bring you before the
      synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don’t be anxious how or what
      you will answer, or what you will say; </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> for the Holy Spirit will teach
      you in that same hour what you must say.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] One of the multitude said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother
    to divide the inheritance with me.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] But he said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Man, who
      made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Beware! Keep
      yourselves from covetousness, for a man’s life doesn’t consist of the
      abundance of the things which he possesses.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He spoke a parable to them, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “The ground of a certain rich man produced abundantly. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He reasoned within himself,
      saying, ‘What will I do, because I don’t have room to store my crops?’ </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He said, ‘This is what I will
      do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will
      store all my grain and my goods. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I will tell my soul, “Soul,
      you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be
      merry.”’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But God said to him, ‘You
      foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you
      have prepared—whose will they be?’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> So is he who lays up treasure
      for himself, and is not rich toward God.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] He said to his disciples, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Therefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for your life, what you will eat,
      nor yet for your body, what you will wear. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Life is more than food, and
      the body is more than clothing. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Consider the ravens: they
      don’t sow, they don’t reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds
      them. How much more valuable are you than birds! </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Which of you by being anxious
      can add a cubit to his height? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If then you aren’t able to do
      even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Consider the lilies, how they
      grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon
      in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But if this is how God clothes
      the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the
      oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Don’t seek what you will eat
      or what you will drink; neither be anxious. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For the nations of the world
      seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these
      things. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But seek God’s Kingdom, and
      all these things will be added to you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Don’t be afraid, little flock,
      for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Sell that which you have, and
      give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don’t grow old,
      a treasure in the heavens that doesn’t fail, where no thief approaches,
      neither moth destroys. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For where your treasure is,
      there will your heart be also. </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Let your waist be dressed and
      your lamps burning. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Be like men watching for their
      lord, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and
      knocks, they may immediately open to him. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Blessed are those servants,
      whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you,
      that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve
      them. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> They will be blessed if he
      comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But know this, that if the
      master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would
      have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Therefore be ready also, for
      the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don’t expect him.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] Peter said to him, “Lord, are you telling this parable to
    us, or to everybody?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] The Lord said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Who then is
      the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household,
      to give them their portion of food at the right times? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Blessed is that servant whom
      his lord will find doing so when he comes. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Truly I tell you, that he will
      set him over all that he has. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But if that servant says in
      his heart, ‘My lord delays his coming,’ and begins to beat the menservants
      and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> then the lord of that servant
      will come in a day when he isn’t expecting him, and in an hour that he
      doesn’t know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the
      unfaithful. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> That servant, who knew his
      lord’s will, and didn’t prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten
      with many stripes, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> but he who didn’t know, and
      did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever
      much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was
      entrusted, of him more will be asked. </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I came to throw fire on the
      earth. I wish it were already kindled. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But I have a baptism to be
      baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished! </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[51] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Do you think that I have come
      to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division. </span>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[52] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For from now on, there will be
      five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[53] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> They will be divided, father
      against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter
      against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and
      daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.” </span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+12%3A53"><small><sup

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[54] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He said to the multitudes
      also, “When you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, ‘A
      shower is coming,’ and so it happens. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[55] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When a south wind blows, you
      say, ‘There will be a scorching heat,’ and it happens. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[56] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> You hypocrites! You know how
      to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that
      you don’t interpret this time? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[57] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Why don’t you judge for
      yourselves what is right? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[58] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For when you are going with
      your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be
      released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge
      deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[59] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I tell you, you will by no
      means get out of there, until you have paid the very last penny.</span> <span

    <br>
    <center>Chapter 13</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now there were some present at the same time who told him
    about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Jesus answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Do you
      think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other
      Galileans, because they suffered such things? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I tell you, no, but unless you
      repent, you will all perish in the same way. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Or those eighteen, on whom the
      tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse
      offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I tell you, no, but, unless you
      repent, you will all perish in the same way.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] He spoke this parable. <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “A
      certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking
      fruit on it, and found none. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He said to the vine dresser,
      ‘Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree,
      and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He answered, ‘Lord, leave it
      alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If it bears fruit, fine; but if
      not, after that, you can cut it down.’”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath
    day.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity
    eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way straighten
    herself up.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, <span
      class="wordsOfJesus"> “Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up
    straight, and glorified God. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus
    had healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, “There are six days in
    which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not
    on the Sabbath day!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Therefore the Lord answered him, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “You hypocrites! Doesn’t each one of you free his ox or his donkey from
      the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away to water? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Ought not this woman, being a
      daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed
      from this bondage on the Sabbath day?” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] As he said these things, all his adversaries were
    disappointed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things
    that were done by him. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] He said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “What is the Kingdom
      of God like? To what shall I compare it? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> It is like a grain of mustard
      seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and became a
      large tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Again he said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “To what shall
      I compare the Kingdom of God? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> It is like yeast, which a
      woman took and hid in three measures </span> <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      of flour, until it was all leavened.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] He went on his way through cities and villages, teaching,
    and traveling on to Jerusalem.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] One said to him, “Lord, are they few who are saved?” <br>
    <br>
    He said to them,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Strive to enter in by the
      narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be
      able. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When once the master of the
      house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside,
      and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us!’ then he will
      answer and tell you, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Then you will begin to say,
      ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’ </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He will say, ‘I tell you, I
      don’t know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of
      iniquity.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> There will be weeping and
      gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the
      prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> They will come from the east,
      west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Behold, there are some who are
      last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be
      last.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] On that same day, some Pharisees came, saying to him, “Get
    out of here, and go away, for Herod wants to kill you.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Go and tell
      that fox, ‘Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow,
      and the third day I complete my mission. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Nevertheless I must go on my
      way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can’t be that a prophet
      perish outside of Jerusalem.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that
      kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I
      wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood
      under her wings, and you refused! </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Behold, your house is left to
      you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, ‘Blessed is
      he who comes in the name of the Lord!’” </span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+13%3A35"><small><sup

    <center>Chapter 14</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] When he went into the house of one of the rulers of the
    Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, they were watching him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees,
    saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] But they were silent. <br>
    <br>
    He took him, and healed him, and let him go.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] He answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Which of
      you, if your son</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> or an ox fell into a
      well, wouldn’t immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] They couldn’t answer him regarding these things. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] He spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he
    noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “When you are invited by anyone
      to a marriage feast, don’t sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone
      more honorable than you might be invited by him, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and he who invited both of you
      would come and tell you, ‘Make room for this person.’ Then you would
      begin, with shame, to take the lowest place. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But when you are invited, go
      and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may
      tell you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be honored in the
      presence of all who sit at the table with you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For everyone who exalts
      himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] He also said to the one who had invited him, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “When you make a dinner or a supper, don’t call your friends, nor your
      brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also
      return the favor, and pay you back. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But when you make a feast, ask
      the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind; </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and you will be blessed,
      because they don’t have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid
      in the resurrection of the righteous.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these
    things, he said to him, “Blessed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of
    God!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] But he said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “A certain
      man made a great supper, and he invited many people. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He sent out his servant at
      supper time to tell those who were invited, ‘Come, for everything is ready
      now.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> They all as one began to make
      excuses.</span> <br>
    <br>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field,
      and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Another said, ‘I have bought
      five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.’</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Another said, ‘I have married
      a wife, and therefore I can’t come.’ </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “That servant came, and told
      his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to
      his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and
      bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The servant said, ‘Lord, it
      is done as you commanded, and there is still room.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The lord said to the servant,
      ‘Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my
      house may be filled. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For I tell you that none of
      those men who were invited will taste of my supper.’”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Now great multitudes were going with him. He turned and
    said to them,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “If anyone comes to me, and
      doesn’t disregard</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> his own father,
      mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also,
      he can’t be my disciple. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Whoever doesn’t bear his own
      cross, and come after me, can’t be my disciple. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For which of you, desiring to
      build a tower, doesn’t first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has
      enough to complete it? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Or perhaps, when he has laid a
      foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock
      him, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> saying, ‘This man began to
      build, and wasn’t able to finish.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Or what king, as he goes to
      encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider
      whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him
      with twenty thousand? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Or else, while the other is
      yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace.
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> So therefore whoever of you
      who doesn’t renounce all that he has, he can’t be my disciple. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Salt is good, but if the salt
      becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> It is fit neither for the soil
      nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let
      him hear.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 15</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to
    him to hear him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, “This man
    welcomes sinners, and eats with them.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He told them this parable.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Which of you men, if you had
      one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn’t leave the ninety-nine in
      the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it? </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When he has found it, he
      carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When he comes home, he calls
      together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me,
      for I have found my sheep which was lost!’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I tell you that even so there
      will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over
      ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Or what woman, if she had ten
      drachma</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> coins, if she lost one drachma
      coin, wouldn’t light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until
      she found it? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When she has found it, she
      calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I
      have found the drachma which I had lost.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Even so, I tell you, there is
      joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] He said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “A certain man had
      two sons. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The younger of them said to
      his father, ‘Father, give me my share of your property.’ He divided his
      livelihood between them. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Not many days after, the
      younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country.
      There he wasted his property with riotous living. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When he had spent all of it,
      there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He went and joined himself to
      one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to
      feed pigs. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He wanted to fill his belly
      with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But when he came to himself he
      said, ‘How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough to spare,
      and I’m dying with hunger! </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I will get up and go to my
      father, and will tell him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in
      your sight. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I am no more worthy to be
      called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.”’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He arose, and came to his
      father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved
      with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The son said to him, ‘Father,
      I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to
      be called your son.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But the father said to his
      servants, ‘Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his
      hand, and shoes on his feet. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Bring the fattened calf, kill
      it, and let us eat, and celebrate; </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> for this, my son, was dead,
      and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’ They began to celebrate.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Now his elder son was in the
      field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He called one of the servants
      to him, and asked what was going on. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He said to him, ‘Your brother
      has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has
      received him back safe and healthy.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But he was angry, and would
      not go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But he answered his father,
      ‘Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a
      commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate
      with my friends. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But when this, your son, came,
      who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened
      calf for him.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He said to him, ‘Son, you are
      always with me, and all that is mine is yours. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But it was appropriate to
      celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive
      again. He was lost, and is found.’”</span> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 16</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] He also said to his disciples, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “There was a certain rich man who had a manager. An accusation was made to
      him that this man was wasting his possessions. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He called him, and said to him,
      ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your
      management, for you can no longer be manager.’ </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The manager said within
      himself, ‘What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the
      management position from me? I don’t have strength to dig. I am ashamed to
      beg. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I know what I will do, so that
      when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.’
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Calling each one of his lord’s
      debtors to him, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe to my lord?’ </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He said, ‘A hundred batosof
      oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write
      fifty.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Then he said to another, ‘How
      much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A hundred corsof wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take
      your bill, and write eighty.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “His lord commended the
      dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this
      world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I tell you, make for yourselves
      friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may
      receive you into the eternal tents. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He who is faithful in a very
      little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is
      also dishonest in much. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If therefore you have not been
      faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true
      riches? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If you have not been faithful
      in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own? </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> No servant can serve two
      masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he
      will hold to one, and despise the other. You aren’t able to serve God and
      Mammon.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all
    these things, and they scoffed at him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “You are
      those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your
      hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight
      of God. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The law and the prophets were
      until John. From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is
      preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But it is easier for heaven
      and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to
      fall. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Everyone who divorces his
      wife, and marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is
      divorced from a husband commits adultery. </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Now there was a certain rich
      man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every
      day. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> A certain beggar, named
      Lazarus, was laid at his gate, full of sores, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and desiring to be fed with
      the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. Yes, even the dogs came
      and licked his sores. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The beggar died, and he was
      carried away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died, and
      was buried. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> In Hades, he lifted up his
      eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus at his bosom.
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He cried and said, ‘Father
      Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of
      his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this
      flame.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But Abraham said, ‘Son,
      remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and
      Lazarus, in the same way, bad things. But now here he is comforted and you
      are in anguish. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Besides all this, between us
      and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here
      to you are not able, and that no one may cross over from there to us.’</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He said, ‘I ask you
      therefore, father, that you would send him to my father’s house; </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> for I have five brothers, that
      he may testify to them, so they won’t also come into this place of
      torment.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But Abraham said to him,
      ‘They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He said, ‘No, father Abraham,
      but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He said to him, ‘If they
      don’t listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if
      one rises from the dead.’”</span> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 17</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] He said to the disciples, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “It
      is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him
      through whom they come! </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> It would be better for him if a
      millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea,
      rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Be careful. If your brother
      sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If he sins against you seven
      times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall
      forgive him.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The Lord said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “If you had
      faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, ‘Be
      uprooted, and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But who is there among you,
      having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes in
      from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down at the table,’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and will not rather tell him,
      ‘Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat
      and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink’? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Does he thank that servant
      because he did the things that were commanded? I think not. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Even so you also, when you
      have done all the things that are commanded you, say, ‘We are unworthy
      servants. We have done our duty.’” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] As he was on his way to Jerusalem, he was passing along the
    borders of Samaria and Galilee.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] As he entered into a certain village, ten men who were
    lepers met him, who stood at a distance.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] They lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have
    mercy on us!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] When he saw them, he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Go and show yourselves to the priests.”</span> As they went, they were
    cleansed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,
    glorifying God with a loud voice.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He fell on his face at Jesus’ feet, giving him thanks; and
    he was a Samaritan.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Jesus answered, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Weren’t the
      ten cleansed? But where are the nine? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Were there none found who
      returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Then he said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Get up,
      and go your way. Your faith has healed you.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would
    come, he answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The Kingdom of God
      doesn’t come with observation; </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> neither will they say, ‘Look,
      here!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] He said to the disciples, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The
      days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of
      Man, and you will not see it. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> They will tell you, ‘Look,
      here!’ or ‘Look, there!’ Don’t go away, nor follow after them, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> for as the lightning, when it
      flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under
      the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But first, he must suffer many
      things and be rejected by this generation. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> As it was in the days of Noah,
      even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> They ate, they drank, they
      married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into
      the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Likewise, even as it was in
      the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they
      planted, they built; </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> but in the day that Lot went
      out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them
      all. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> It will be the same way in the
      day that the Son of Man is revealed. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> In that day, he who will be on
      the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them
      away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Remember Lot’s wife! </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Whoever seeks to save his life
      loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I tell you, in that night
      there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other
      will be left. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> There will be two grinding
      grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] They, answering, asked him, “Where, Lord?” <br>
    <br>
    He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Where the body is, there will
      the vultures also be gathered together.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 18</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray,
    and not give up,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “There was a judge in a
      certain city who didn’t fear God, and didn’t respect man. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> A widow was in that city, and
      she often came to him, saying, ‘Defend me from my adversary!’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He wouldn’t for a while, but
      afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God, nor respect man,
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> yet because this widow bothers
      me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual
      coming.’”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The Lord said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Listen to what
      the unrighteous judge says. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Won’t God avenge his chosen
      ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises
      patience with them? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I tell you that he will avenge
      them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith
      on the earth?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He spoke also this parable to certain people who were
    convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Two men went up into the
      temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The Pharisee stood and prayed
      to himself like this: ‘God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of
      men, extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax
      collector. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I fast twice a week. I give
      tithes of all that I get.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But the tax collector,
      standing far away, wouldn’t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his
      breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I tell you, this man went down
      to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts
      himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might
    touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Jesus summoned them, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Allow the little children to come to me, and don’t hinder them, for the
      Kingdom of God belongs to such as these. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Most certainly, I tell you,
      whoever doesn’t receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in
      no way enter into it.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] A certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Teacher, what
    shall I do to inherit eternal life?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Jesus asked him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Why do you
      call me good? No one is good, except one—God. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> You know the commandments:
      ‘Don’t commit adultery,’ ‘Don’t murder,’ ‘Don’t steal,’ ‘Don’t give false
      testimony,’ ‘Honor your father and your mother.’”</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+18%3A20"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] He said, “I have observed all these things from my youth
    up.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] When Jesus heard these things, he said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to
      the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he
    was very rich. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of
      God! </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For it is easier for a camel
      to enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the
      Kingdom of God.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] But he said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The things which
      are impossible with men are possible with God.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Peter said, “Look, we have left everything, and followed
    you.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Most
      certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or
      brothers, or parents, or children, for the Kingdom of God’s sake, </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> who will not receive many
      times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] He took the twelve aside, and said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written
      through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For he will be delivered up to
      the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> They will scourge and kill
      him. On the third day, he will rise again.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] They understood none of these things. This saying was
    hidden from them, and they didn’t understand the things that were said.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] As he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the
    road, begging.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] He cried out, “Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet;
    but he cried out all the more, “You son of David, have mercy on me!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him.
    When he had come near, he asked him,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “What do you want me to do?”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    He said, “Lord, that I may see again.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Receive
      your sight. Your faith has healed you.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] Immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
    glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 19</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] He entered and was passing through Jericho.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] There was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax
    collector, and he was rich.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He was trying to see who Jesus was, and couldn’t because of
    the crowd, because he was short.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see
    him, for he was to pass that way.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and
    said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down,
      for today I must stay at your house.” </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, “He has gone in
    to lodge with a man who is a sinner.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, half of
    my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of
    anyone, I restore four times as much.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Today,
      salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For the Son of Man came to
      seek and to save that which was lost.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable,
    because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the Kingdom of God
    would be revealed immediately.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] He said therefore, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “A certain
      nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to
      return. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He called ten servants of his,
      and gave them ten mina coins, </span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and
      told them, ‘Conduct business until I come.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But his citizens hated him,
      and sent an envoy after him, saying, ‘We don’t want this man to reign over
      us.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “When he had come back again,
      having received the kingdom, he commanded these servants, to whom he had
      given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had
      gained by conducting business. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The first came before him,
      saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He said to him, ‘Well done,
      you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you
      shall have authority over ten cities.’ </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The second came, saying,
      ‘Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.’ </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “So he said to him, ‘And you
      are to be over five cities.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Another came, saying, ‘Lord,
      behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> for I feared you, because you
      are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn’t lay down, and reap
      that which you didn’t sow.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He said to him, ‘Out of your
      own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an
      exacting man, taking up that which I didn’t lay down, and reaping that
      which I didn’t sow. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Then why didn’t you deposit my
      money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?’
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He said to those who stood by,
      ‘Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.’</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “They said to him, ‘Lord, he
      has ten minas!’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> ‘For I tell you that to
      everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who doesn’t have, even
      that which he has will be taken away from him. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But bring those enemies of
      mine who didn’t want me to reign over them here, and kill them before
      me.’”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Having said these things, he went on ahead, going up to
    Jerusalem. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] When he drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany, at the
    mountain that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Go your way into the
      village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt
      tied, whereon no man ever yet sat. Untie it, and bring it. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> If anyone asks you, ‘Why are
      you untying it?’ say to him: ‘The Lord needs it.’”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] Those who were sent went away, and found things just as he
    had told them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them,
    “Why are you untying the colt?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] They said, “The Lord needs it.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] They brought it to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the
    colt, and set Jesus on them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] As he went, they spread their cloaks on the road.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] As he was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of
    Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God
    with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] saying, “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the
    Lord! <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+19%3A38"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> Peace in heaven, and glory in the
    highest!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] Some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him,
    “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] He answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I tell you
      that if these were silent, the stones would cry out.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] When he drew near, he saw the city and wept over it,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “If you, even you, had
      known today the things which belong to your peace! But now, they are
      hidden from your eyes. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For the days will come on you,
      when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem
      you in on every side, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and will dash you and your
      children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on
      another, because you didn’t know the time of your visitation.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] He entered into the temple, and began to drive out those
    who bought and sold in it,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] saying to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “It is
      written, ‘My house is a house of prayer,’ </span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+19%3A46"><small><sup

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] He was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests
    and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] They couldn’t find what they might do, for all the people
    hung on to every word that he said. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 20</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] On one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the
    temple and preaching the Good News, the priests and scribes came to him with
    the elders.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] They asked him, “Tell us: by what authority do you do these
    things? Or who is giving you this authority?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He answered them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I also will
      ask you one question. Tell me: </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> the baptism of John, was it
      from heaven, or from men?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From
    heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, for
    they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They answered that they didn’t know where it was from. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Neither
      will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He began to tell the people this parable. <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “A </span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> man planted a vineyard, and
      rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long
      time. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> At the proper season, he sent
      a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the
      vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He sent yet another servant,
      and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away
      empty. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He sent yet a third, and they
      also wounded him, and threw him out. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The lord of the vineyard said,
      ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him,
      they will respect him.’</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But when the farmers saw him,
      they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s
      kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> They threw him out of the
      vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do
      to them? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He will come and destroy these
      farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    When they heard it, they said, “May it never be!” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] But he looked at them, and said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Then what is this that is written,</span> <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> ‘The stone which the
        builders rejected,</span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> the same was made the
        chief cornerstone?’</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+20%3A17"><small><sup

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Everyone who falls on that
        stone will be broken to pieces, </span> </span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> but it will crush
        whomever it falls on to dust.”</span> </span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on
    him that very hour, but they feared the people—for they knew he had spoken
    this parable against them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] They watched him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be
    righteous, that they might trap him in something he said, so as to deliver
    him up to the power and authority of the governor.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] They asked him, “Teacher, we know that you say and teach
    what is right, and aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, <span
      class="wordsOfJesus"> “Why do you test me? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Show me a denarius. Whose
      image and inscription are on it?” </span> <br>
    <br>
    They answered, “Caesar’s.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Then give to
      Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are
      God’s.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] They weren’t able to trap him in his words before the
    people. They marveled at his answer, and were silent.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Some of the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that
    there is a resurrection.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] They asked him, “Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man’s
    brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the
    wife, and raise up children for his brother.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] There were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife,
    and died childless.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] The second took her as wife, and he died childless.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] The third took her, and likewise the seven all left no
    children, and died.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] Afterward the woman also died.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she
    be? For the seven had her as a wife.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Jesus said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The
      children of this age marry, and are given in marriage. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But those who are considered
      worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither
      marry, nor are given in marriage. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For they can’t die any more,
      for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of
      the resurrection. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But that the dead are raised,
      even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord ‘The God of
      Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ </span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+20%3A37"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Now he is not the God of the
      dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you speak well.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] They didn’t dare to ask him any more questions. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Why do they
      say that the Christ is David’s son? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> David himself says in the book
      of Psalms,</span> <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><span class="wordsOfJesus"> ‘The Lord said to my

    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “David therefore calls him
      Lord, so how is he his son?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Beware of the scribes, who
      like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the
      best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts; </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> who devour widows’ houses, and
      for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater
      condemnation.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 21</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] He looked up, and saw the rich people who were putting their
    gifts into the treasury.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He saw a certain poor widow casting in two small brass
    coins.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Truly I tell you,
      this poor widow put in more than all of them, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> for all these put in gifts for
      God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she
      had to live on.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] As some were talking about the temple and how it was
    decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “As for these things which you
      see, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone on
      another that will not be thrown down.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] They asked him, “Teacher, so when will these things be? What
    is the sign that these things are about to happen?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Watch out that you
      don’t get led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he</span>
    <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+21%3A8"><small><sup

      time is at hand.’ Therefore don’t follow them. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When you hear of wars and
      disturbances, don’t be terrified, for these things must happen first, but
      the end won’t come immediately.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Then he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Nation
      will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> There will be great
      earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be terrors
      and great signs from heaven. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But before all these things,
      they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up

      name’s sake. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> It will turn out as a

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “By your endurance you will
      win your lives.</span> <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But when you see Jerusalem
      surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Then let those who are in
      Judea flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of her depart.
      Let those who are in the country not enter therein. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For these are days of
      vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Woe to those who are pregnant
      and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great
      distress in the land, and wrath to this people. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> They will fall by the edge of
      the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be
      trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are
      fulfilled. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> There will be signs in the
      sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity
      for the roaring of the sea and the waves; </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> men fainting for fear, and for
      expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Then they will see the Son of
      Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But when these things begin to
      happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] He told them a parable. <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “See
      the fig tree, and all the trees. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When they are already budding,
      you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Even so you also, when you see
      these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Most certainly I tell you,
      this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Heaven and earth will pass
      away, but my words will by no means pass away.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “So be careful, or your hearts
      will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life,
      and that day will come on you suddenly. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For it will come like a snare
      on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Therefore be watchful all the
      time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things
      that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple, and every night
    he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] All the people came early in the morning to him in the
    temple to hear him. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 22</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the
    Passover, drew near.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put
    him to death, for they feared the people.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Satan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who
    was numbered with the twelve.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains
    about how he might deliver him to them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] They were glad, and agreed to give him money.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to
    them in the absence of the multitude.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must
    be sacrificed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He sent Peter and John, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Behold, when
      you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will
      meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Tell the master of the house,
      ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the
      Passover with my disciples?”’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He will show you a large,
      furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] They went, found things as he had told them, and they
    prepared the Passover.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve
    apostles.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I have
      earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer, </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> for I tell you, I will no
      longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of
      God.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, <span
      class="wordsOfJesus"> “Take this, and share it among yourselves, </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> for I tell you, I will not
      drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until the Kingdom of God
      comes.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it,
    and gave to them, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “This is my body
      which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But behold, the hand of him
      who betrays me is with me on the table. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> The Son of Man indeed goes, as
      it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] They began to question among themselves, which of them it
    was who would do this thing.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] There arose also a contention among them, which of them was
    considered to be greatest.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The kings of
      the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are
      called ‘benefactors.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But not so with you. But one
      who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who
      is governing, as one who serves. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For who is greater, one who
      sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table?
      But I am in your midst as one who serves. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But you are those who have
      continued with me in my trials. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I confer on you a kingdom,
      even as my Father conferred on me, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> that you may eat and drink at
      my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes
      of Israel.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] The Lord said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Simon, Simon,
      behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat, </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> but I prayed for you, that
      your faith wouldn’t fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish
      your brothers.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] He said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to
    prison and to death!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] He said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I tell you, Peter,
      the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me
      three times.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “When I sent
      you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    They said, “Nothing.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] Then he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “But
      now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever
      has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For I tell you that this which
      is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with
      transgressors.’</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+22%3A37"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For that
      which concerns me has an end.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.” <br>
    <br>
    He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “That is enough.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of
    Olives. His disciples also followed him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] When he was at the place, he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he
    knelt down and prayed,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Father, if you are
      willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be
      done.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became
    like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples,
    and found them sleeping because of grief,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] and said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Why do you
      sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he
    who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to
    Jesus to kiss him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] But Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Judas,
      do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] When those who were around him saw what was about to
    happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] A certain one of them struck the servant of the high
    priest, and cut off his right ear. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[51] But Jesus answered, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Let me at
      least do this”</span> —and he touched his ear, and healed him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[52] Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple,
    and elders, who had come against him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Have you
      come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[53] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> When I was with you in the
      temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is
      your hour, and the power of darkness.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[54] They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the
    high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[55] When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the
    courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[56] A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and
    looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[57] He denied Jesus, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[58] After a little while someone else saw him, and said, “You
    also are one of them!” <br>
    <br>
    But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[59] After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed,
    saying, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[60] But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking
    about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[61] The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered
    the Lord’s word, how he said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Before
      the rooster crows you will deny me three times.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[62] He went out, and wept bitterly. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[63] The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[64] Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and
    asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[65] They spoke many other things against him, insulting him. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[66] As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the
    people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led
    him away into their council, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[67] “If you are the Christ, tell us.” <br>
    <br>
    But he said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “If I tell you, you won’t
      believe, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[68] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and if I ask, you will in no
      way answer me or let me go. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[69] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> From now on, the Son of Man
      will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[70] They all said, “Are you then the Son of God?” <br>
    <br>
    He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “You say it, because I am.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[71] They said, “Why do we need any more witness? For we
    ourselves have heard from his own mouth!” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 23</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The whole company of them rose up and brought him before
    Pilate.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man
    perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he
    himself is Christ, a king.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” <br>
    <br>
    He answered him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “So you say.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find
    no basis for a charge against this man.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching
    throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man
    was a Galilean.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he
    sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he
    had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things
    about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently
    accusing him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him.
    Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very
    day, for before that they were enemies with each other. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and
    the people,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that
    perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you, and found no
    basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you
    accuse him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing
    worthy of death has been done by him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] I will therefore chastise him and release him.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this
    man! Release to us Barabbas!”—<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the
    city, and for murder. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this
    man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise
    him and release him.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might
    be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] He released him who had been thrown into prison for
    insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to
    their will. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene,
    coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] A great multitude of the people followed him, including
    women who also mourned and lamented him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] But Jesus, turning to them, said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and
      for your children. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For behold, the days are
      coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that
      never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’ </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Then they will begin to tell
      the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’</span> <a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Luke+23%3A30"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> For if they do these things in
      the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be
    put to death.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they
    crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on
    the left. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Jesus said, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Father, forgive
      them, for they don’t know what they are doing.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] The people stood watching. The rulers with them also
    scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is
    the Christ of God, his chosen one!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering
    him vinegar,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save
    yourself!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] An inscription was also written over him in letters of
    Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying,
    “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you
    even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our
    deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] He said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into
    your Kingdom.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] Jesus said to him, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Assuredly
      I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the
    whole land until the ninth hour.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn
    in two.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!”</span> Having said this, he
    breathed his last. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,
    saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] All the multitudes that came together to see this, when
    they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him
    from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the
    council, a good and righteous man<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[51] (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from
    Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[52] this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[53] He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid
    him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[54] It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was
    drawing near.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[55] The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed
    after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[56] They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the
    Sabbath they rested according to the commandment. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 24</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and
    some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] They entered in, and didn’t find the Lord Jesus’ body.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] While they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two
    men stood by them in dazzling clothing.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the
    earth. <br>
    <br>
    They said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] He isn’t here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when
    he was still in Galilee,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the
    hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] They remembered his words,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the
    eleven, and to all the rest.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother
    of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn’t
    believe them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking
    in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his
    home, wondering what had happened. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village
    named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] They talked with each other about all of these things which
    had happened.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] While they talked and questioned together, Jesus himself
    came near, and went with them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “What are you
      talking about as you walk, and are sad?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only
    stranger in Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things which have happened there
    in these days?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “What
      things?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    They said to him, “The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a
    prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up
    to be condemned to death, and crucified him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel.
    Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things
    happened.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having
    arrived early at the tomb;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] and when they didn’t find his body, they came saying that
    they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the
    women had said, but they didn’t see him.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Foolish men,
      and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Didn’t the Christ have to
      suffer these things and to enter into his glory?”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he
    explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] They drew near to the village, where they were going, and
    he acted like he would go further. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] They urged him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is almost
    evening, and the day is almost over.” <br>
    <br>
    He went in to stay with them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] When he had sat down at the table with them, he took the
    bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave to them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he
    vanished out of their sight.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] They said one to another, “Weren’t our hearts burning
    within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the
    Scriptures to us?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and
    found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to
    Simon!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] They related the things that happened along the way, and
    how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] As they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them,
    and said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Peace be to you.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[37] But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed
    that they had seen a spirit. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[38] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Why are you
      troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts? </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[39] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> See my hands and my feet, that
      it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn’t have flesh and
      bones, as you see that I have.”</span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[40] When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his
    feet.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[41] While they still didn’t believe for joy, and wondered, he
    said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Do you have anything here to
      eat?”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[42] They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[43] He took them, and ate in front of them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[44] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “This is what
      I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written
      in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be
      fulfilled.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[45] Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the
    Scriptures.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[46] He said to them, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Thus it is
      written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise
      from the dead the third day, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[47] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and that repentance and
      remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations,
      beginning at Jerusalem. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[48] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> You are witnesses of these
      things. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[49] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Behold, I send out the promise
      of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are
      clothed with power from on high.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[50] He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his
    hands, and blessed them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[51] While he blessed them, he withdrew from them, and was
    carried up into heaven.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[52] They worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great
    joy,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[53] and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing
    God. Amen. <br>
