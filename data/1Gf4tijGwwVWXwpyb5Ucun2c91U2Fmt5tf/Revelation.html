      <h1>Revelation</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him
    to show to his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and
    made known by his angel to his servant, John,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] who testified to God’s word, and of the testimony of Jesus
    Christ, about everything that he saw. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the
    prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is at
    hand. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] John, to the seven assemblies that are in Asia: Grace to you
    and peace, from God, who is and who was and who is to come; and from the
    seven Spirits who are before his throne;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn
    of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us,
    and washed us from our sins by his blood;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] and he made us to be a Kingdom, priests<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Revelation+of+John+1%3A6"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> to his God and Father; to him be the
    glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see
    him, including those who pierced him. All the tribes of the earth will mourn
    over him. Even so, Amen. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I am the Alpha and the Omega,</span>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> ”</span> says the Lord God, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] I John, your brother and partner with you in oppression,
    Kingdom, and perseverance in Christ Jesus, was on the isle that is called
    Patmos because of God’s Word and the testimony of Jesus Christ.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind
    me a loud voice, like a trumpet<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      What you see, write in a book and send to the seven assemblies</span> <span
      class="wordsOfJesus"> : to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis,
      Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. Having
    turned, I saw seven golden lamp stands.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] And among the lamp stands was one like a son of man,<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Revelation+of+John+1%3A13"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> clothed with a robe reaching down to
    his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] His head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow.
    His eyes were like a flame of fire.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] His feet were like burnished brass, as if it had been
    refined in a furnace. His voice was like the voice of many waters.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He had seven stars in his right hand. Out of his mouth
    proceeded a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining at its
    brightest.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. <br>
    <br>
    He laid his right hand on me, saying, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Don’t be
      afraid. I am the first and the last, </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and the Living one. I was
      dead, and behold, I am alive forever more. Amen. I have the keys of Death
      and of Hades</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> . </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Write therefore the things
      which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will
      happen hereafter; </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> the mystery of the seven stars
      which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamp stands. The
      seven stars are the angels</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> of the
      seven assemblies. The seven lamp stands are seven assemblies.</span> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “To the angel of the assembly
      in Ephesus write:</span> <br>
    <br>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He who holds the seven stars in his right hand,
      he who walks among the seven golden lamp stands says these things:</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I know your works, and your
      toil and perseverance, and that you can’t tolerate evil men, and have
      tested those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and found
      them false. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> You have perseverance and have
      endured for my name’s sake, and have </span> <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      not grown weary. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But I have this against you,
      that you left your first love. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Remember therefore from where
      you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I am coming to
      you swiftly, and will move your lamp stand out of its place, unless you
      repent. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But this you have, that you
      hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He who has an ear, let him hear
      what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes I will give
      to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of my God.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “To the angel of the assembly
      in Smyrna write:</span> <br>
    <br>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The first and the last, who was dead, and has
      come to life says these things:</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I know your works, oppression,
      and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy of those who say
      they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Don’t be afraid of the things
      which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of
      you into prison, that you may be tested; and you will have oppression for
      ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He who has an ear, let him
      hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. He who overcomes won’t be
      harmed by the second death.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “To the angel of the assembly
      in Pergamum write:</span> <br>
    <br>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “He who has the sharp two-edged sword says these
      things:</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “I know your works and where
      you dwell, where Satan’s throne is. You hold firmly to my name, and didn’t
      deny my faith in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was
      killed among you, where Satan dwells. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But I have a few things
      against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam,
      who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel,
      to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> So you also have some who hold
      to the teaching of the Nicolaitans likewise</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      . </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Repent therefore, or else I am
      coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of
      my mouth. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He who has an ear, let him
      hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes, to him
      I will give of the hidden manna, </span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> and
      I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which
      no one knows but he who receives it.</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “To the angel of the assembly

    <br>
    <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “The Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame
      of fire, and his feet are like burnished brass, says these things:</span>

      faith, service, patient endurance, and that your last works are more than
      the first. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But I have this against you,
      that you tolerate your</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> woman, Jezebel,
      who calls herself a prophetess. She teaches and seduces my servants to
      commit sexual immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I gave her time to repent, but
      she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Behold, I will throw her into
      a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression,
      unless they repent of her works. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I will kill her children with
      Death, and all the assemblies will know that I am he who searches the
      minds and hearts. I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.
    </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But to you I say, to the rest
      who are in Thyatira, as many as don’t have this teaching, who don’t know
      what some call ‘the deep things of Satan,’ to you I say, I am not putting
      any other burden on you. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Nevertheless, hold that which
      you have firmly until I come. </span> <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven,
    and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one
    saying, “Come up here, and I will show you the things which must happen
    after this.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne
    set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a
    rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones
    were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of
    gold on their heads.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders.
    There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the
    seven Spirits of God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar
    to crystal. In the midst of the throne, and around the throne were four
    living creatures full of eyes before and behind.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature
    like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth
    was like a flying eagle.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The four living creatures, each one of them having six
    wings, are full of eyes around and within. They have no rest day and night,
    saying, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is
    and who is to come!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to
    him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the
    throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns
    before the throne, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] “Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One, to receive
    the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because
    of your desire they existed, and were created!” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a
    book written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is
    worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] No one in heaven above, or on the earth, or under the earth,
    was able to open the book, or to look in it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the
    book, or to look in it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] One of the elders said to me, “Don’t weep. Behold, the Lion
    who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome; he who opens
    the book and its seven seals.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living
    creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had
    been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits
    of God, sent out into all the earth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him
    who sat on the throne.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures
    and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a
    harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] They sang a new song, saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“You are worthy to take the book,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and to open its seals:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you were killed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and bought us for God with your blood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] and made us kings and priests to our God,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and we will reign on earth.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels
    around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of
    them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] saying with a loud voice, “Worthy is the Lamb who has been
    killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and
    blessing!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the
    earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying, “To him
    who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the
    glory, and the dominion, forever and ever! Amen!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The four living creatures said, “Amen!” The elders fell
    down and worshiped. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 6</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I
    heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder,
    “Come and see!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] And behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow. A
    crown was given to him, and he came out conquering, and to conquer. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living
    creature saying, “Come!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Another came out, a red horse. To him who sat on it was
    given power to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one
    another. There was given to him a great sword. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living
    creature saying, “Come and see!” And behold, a black horse, and he who sat
    on it had a balance in his hand.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures
    saying, “A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for
    a denarius! Don’t damage the oil and the wine!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living
    creature saying, “Come and see!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] And behold, a pale horse, and he who sat on it, his name was
    Death. Hades followed with him. Authority over one fourth of the earth, to
    kill with the sword, with famine, with death, and by the wild animals of the
    earth was given to him. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar
    the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God, and for the
    testimony of the Lamb which they had.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] They cried with a loud voice, saying, “How long, Master,
    the holy and true, until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell
    on the earth?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] A long white robe was given to each of them. They were told
    that they should rest yet for a while, until their fellow servants and their
    brothers, who would also be killed even as they were, should complete their
    course. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great
    earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole
    moon became as blood.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The stars of the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree
    dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up.
    Every mountain and island were moved out of their places.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The kings of the earth, the princes, the commanding
    officers, the rich, the strong, and every slave and free person, hid
    themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] They told the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us, and
    hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of
    the Lamb,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] for the great day of his wrath has come; and who is able to
    stand?” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 7</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners
    of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would
    blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise, having the seal
    of the living God. He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it
    was given to harm the earth and the sea,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] saying, “Don’t harm the earth, neither the sea, nor the
    trees, until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred
    forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel: <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve
      thousand.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude,
    which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes, peoples,
    and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in
    white robes, with palm branches in their hands.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] They cried with a loud voice, saying, “Salvation be to our
    God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders,
    and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before his
    throne, and worshiped God,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] saying, “Amen! Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving,
    honor, power, and might, be to our God forever and ever! Amen.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] One of the elders answered, saying to me, “These who are
    arrayed in white robes, who are they, and from where did they come?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I told him, “My lord, you know.” <br>
    <br>
    He said to me, “These are those who came out of the great tribulation. They
    washed their robes, and made them white in the Lamb’s blood.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Therefore they are before the throne of God, they serve him
    day and night in his temple. He who sits on the throne will spread his
    tabernacle over them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] They will never be hungry, neither thirsty any more;
    neither will the sun beat on them, nor any heat;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds
    them, and leads them to springs of waters of life. And God will wipe away
    every tear from their eyes.” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 8</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven
    for about half an hour.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven
    trumpets were given to them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden
    censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers
    of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints,
    went up before God out of the angel’s hand.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of
    the altar, and threw it on the earth. There followed thunders, sounds,
    lightnings, and an earthquake. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared
    themselves to sound.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed
    with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. One third of the earth was
    burnt up, and one third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was
    burnt up. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning
    mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea
    died. One third of the ships were destroyed. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the
    sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on
    the springs of the waters.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The name of the star is called “Wormwood.” One third of the
    waters became wormwood. Many people died from the waters, because they were
    made bitter. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was
    struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one
    third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn’t shine for one third of
    it, and the night in the same way.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying
    with a loud voice, “Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because
    of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to
    sound!” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 9</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky which
    had fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the
    pit, like the smoke from a burning furnace. The sun and the air were
    darkened because of the smoke from the pit.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth, and power
    was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the
    earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who
    don’t have God’s seal on their foreheads.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] They were given power not to kill them, but to torment them
    for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it
    strikes a person.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] In those days people will seek death, and will in no way
    find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war.
    On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like
    people’s faces.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like
    those of lions.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound
    of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to
    war.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In
    their tails they have power to harm men for five months.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His
    name in Hebrew is “Abaddon”, but in Greek, he has the name “Apollyon”. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes
    coming after this. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of
    the golden altar which is before God,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet, “Free the
    four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that
    hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill one third of
    mankind.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred
    million. I heard the number of them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on
    them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow;
    and the heads of lions. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by
    the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in
    their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with
    them they harm.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these
    plagues, didn’t repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn’t
    worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of
    stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] They didn’t repent of their murders, nor of their
    sorceries, nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 10</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky, clothed
    with a cloud. A rainbow was on his head. His face was like the sun, and his
    feet like pillars of fire.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He had in his hand a little open book. He set his right foot
    on the sea, and his left on the land.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. When he cried,
    the seven thunders uttered their voices.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] When the seven thunders sounded, I was about to write; but I
    heard a voice from the sky saying, “Seal up the things which the seven
    thunders said, and don’t write them.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land
    lifted up his right hand to the sky,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created
    heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in
    it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there will no longer be
    delay,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he
    is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as he declared to
    his servants, the prophets.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The voice which I heard from heaven, again speaking with me,
    said, “Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands
    on the sea and on the land.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book.
    <br>
    <br>
    He said to me, “Take it, and eat it up. It will make your stomach bitter,
    but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it
    up. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth. When I had eaten it, my stomach
    was made bitter.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They told me, “You must prophesy again over many peoples,
    nations, languages, and kings.” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 11</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] A reed like a rod was given to me. Someone said, “Rise, and
    measure God’s temple, and the altar, and those who worship in it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Leave out the court which is outside of the temple, and
    don’t measure it, for it has been given to the nations. They will tread the
    holy city under foot for forty-two months.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will
    prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] These are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands,
    standing before the Lord of the earth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] If anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their
    mouth and devours their enemies. If anyone desires to harm them, he must be
    killed in this way.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] These have the power to shut up the sky, that it may not
    rain during the days of their prophecy. They have power over the waters, to
    turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as
    they desire.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] When they have finished their testimony, the beast that
    comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them, and
    kill them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city,
    which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was
    crucified.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] From among the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations
    people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will
    not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and they
    will be glad. They will give gifts to one another, because these two
    prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] After the three and a half days, the breath of life from
    God entered into them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell on
    those who saw them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up
    here!” They went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] In that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of
    the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the
    rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe comes
    quickly. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The seventh angel sounded, and great voices in heaven
    followed, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our
    Lord, and of his Christ. He will reign forever and ever!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] The twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before
    God’s throne, fell on their faces and worshiped God,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] saying: “We give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty, the
    one who is and who was; because you have taken your great power, and
    reigned.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] The nations were angry, and your wrath came, as did the
    time for the dead to be judged, and to give your bondservants the prophets,
    their reward, as well as to the saints, and those who fear your name, to the
    small and the great; and to destroy those who destroy the earth.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] God’s temple that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of
    the Lord’s covenant was seen in his temple. Lightnings, sounds, thunders, an
    earthquake, and great hail followed. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 12</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] A great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the
    sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] She was with child. She cried out in pain, laboring to give
    birth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Another sign was seen in heaven. Behold, a great red dragon,
    having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky, and threw
    them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give
    birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all
    the nations with a rod of iron. Her child was caught up to God, and to his
    throne.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place
    prepared by God, that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred
    sixty days. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] There was war in the sky. Michael and his angels made war on
    the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] They didn’t prevail, neither was a place found for him any
    more in heaven.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is
    called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown
    down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, “Now the salvation,
    the power, and the Kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ has
    come; for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them
    before our God day and night.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They overcame him because of the Lamb’s blood, and because
    of the word of their testimony. They didn’t love their life, even to death.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you who dwell in them. Woe
    to the earth and to the sea, because the devil has gone down to you, having
    great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] When the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth,
    he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that
    she might fly into the wilderness to her place, so that she might be
    nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the
    serpent.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman
    like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth
    and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The dragon grew angry with the woman, and went away to make
    war with the rest of her seed, who keep God’s commandments and hold Jesus’
    testimony. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 13</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then I stood on the sand of the sea. I saw a beast coming up
    out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten
    crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were
    like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon
    gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] One of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally.
    His fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled at the beast.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] They worshiped the dragon, because he gave his authority to
    the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast? Who
    is able to make war with him?”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] A mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to
    him. Authority to make war for forty-two months was given to him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] He opened his mouth for blasphemy against God, to blaspheme
    his name, and his dwelling, those who dwell in heaven.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] It was given to him to make war with the saints, and to
    overcome them. Authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation was
    given to him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose
    name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of
    life of the Lamb who has been killed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] If anyone has an ear, let him hear.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] If anyone is to go into captivity, he will go into
    captivity. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, he must be killed. Here
    is the endurance and the faith of the saints. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two
    horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his
    presence. He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first
    beast, whose fatal wound was healed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He performs great signs, even making fire come down out of
    the sky to the earth in the sight of people.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] He deceives my own people who dwell on the earth because of
    the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast; saying to those who
    dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who had the
    sword wound and lived.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] It was given to him to give breath to it, to the image of
    the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many
    as wouldn’t worship the image of the beast to be killed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the
    poor, and the free and the slave, to be given marks on their right hands, or
    on their foreheads;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] and that no one would be able to buy or to sell, unless he
    has that mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Here is wisdom. He who has understanding, let him calculate
    the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is six
    hundred sixty-six. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 14</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with
    him a number, one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name
    of his Father, written on their foreheads.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters,
    and like the sound of a great thunder. The sound which I heard was like that
    of harpists playing on their harps.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four
    living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the one
    hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] These are those who were not defiled with women, for they
    are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These
    were redeemed by Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and to the
    Lamb.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] In their mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I saw an angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal Good
    News to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation,
    tribe, language, and people.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] He said with a loud voice, “Fear the Lord, and give him
    glory; for the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the
    heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Another, a second angel, followed, saying, “Babylon the
    great has fallen, which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the
    wrath of her sexual immorality.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great
    voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on
    his forehead, or on his hand,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which
    is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be tormented with fire
    and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the
    Lamb.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. They
    have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and
    whoever receives the mark of his name.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Here is the patience of the saints, those who keep the
    commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] I heard the voice from heaven saying, “Write, ‘Blessed are
    the dead who die in the Lord from now on.’” <br>
    <br>
    “Yes,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest from their labors; for their
    works follow with them.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I looked, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud one
    sitting like a son of man,<a href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Revelation+of+John+14%3A14"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> having on his head a golden crown, and
    in his hand a sharp sickle.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud
    voice to him who sat on the cloud, “Send your sickle, and reap; for the hour
    to reap has come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth, and
    the earth was reaped. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven. He
    also had a sharp sickle.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power
    over fire, and he called with a great voice to him who had the sharp sickle,
    saying, “Send your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the
    earth, for the earth’s grapes are fully ripe!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered
    the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great wine press of the
    wrath of God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] The wine press was trodden outside of the city, and blood
    came out of the wine press, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as one
    thousand six hundred stadia. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 15</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky: seven
    angels having the seven last plagues, for in them God’s wrath is finished.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and
    those who overcame the beast, his image, and the number of his name,
    standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the
    song of the Lamb, saying, <br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God,
      the Almighty!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Righteous and true are your ways, you King of the
      nations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Who wouldn’t fear you, Lord,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and glorify your name?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For you only are holy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For all the nations will come and worship before
      you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For your righteous acts have been revealed.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] After these things I looked, and the temple of the
    tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The seven angels who had the seven plagues came out, clothed
    with pure, bright linen, and wearing golden sashes around their breasts. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels
    seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and
    from his power. No one was able to enter into the temple, until the seven
    plagues of the seven angels would be finished. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 16</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven
    angels, “Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth!”
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and
    it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the
    beast, and who worshiped his image. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it
    became blood as of a dead man. Every living thing in the sea died. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of
    water, and they became blood.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I heard the angel of the waters saying, “You are righteous,
    who are and who were, you Holy One, because you have judged these things.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For they poured out the blood of the saints and the
    prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. They deserve this.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] I heard the altar saying, “Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true
    and righteous are your judgments.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given
    to him to scorch men with fire.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] People were scorched with great heat, and people blasphemed
    the name of God who has the power over these plagues. They didn’t repent and
    give him glory. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast,
    and his kingdom was darkened. They gnawed their tongues because of the pain,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their
    pains and their sores. They didn’t repent of their works. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the
    Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be prepared for the
    kings that come from the sunrise.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the
    mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean
    spirits, something like frogs;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] for they are spirits of demons, performing signs; which go
    out to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them together for
    the war of that great day of God, the Almighty. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Behold, I come like a thief.
      Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his clothes, so that he doesn’t walk
      naked, and they see his shame.” </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He gathered them together into the place which is called in
    Hebrew, Megiddo. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The seventh poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice
    came out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, “It is done!”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] There were lightnings, sounds, and thunders; and there was
    a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men on the earth, so
    great an earthquake, so mighty.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities
    of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God,
    to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Great hailstones, about the weight of a talent, came down
    out of the sky on people. People blasphemed God because of the plague of the
    hail, for this plague is exceedingly severe. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 17</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and
    spoke with me, saying, “Come here. I will show you the judgment of the great
    prostitute who sits on many waters,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual
    immorality, and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine
    of her sexual immorality.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a
    woman sitting on a scarlet-colored animal, full of blasphemous names, having
    seven heads and ten horns.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with
    gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of
    abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of the earth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] And on her forehead a name was written, “MYSTERY, BABYLON
    THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE
    EARTH.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and
    with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered with
    great amazement.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The angel said to me, “Why do you wonder? I will tell you
    the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the
    seven heads and the ten horns.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about to come
    up out of the abyss and to go into destruction. Those who dwell on the earth
    and whose names have not been written in the book of life from the
    foundation of the world will marvel when they see that the beast was, and is
    not, and shall be present.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven
    mountains, on which the woman sits.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] They are seven kings. Five have fallen, the one is, the
    other has not yet come. When he comes, he must continue a little while.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth,
    and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received
    no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for
    one hour.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] These have one mind, and they give their power and
    authority to the beast.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome
    them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings, and those who are with him
    are called, chosen, and faithful.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He said to me, “The waters which you saw, where the
    prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] The ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate
    the prostitute, and will make her desolate, and will make her naked, and
    will eat her flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind,
    and to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the
    words of God should be accomplished.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over
    the kings of the earth.” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 18</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] After these things, I saw another angel coming down out of
    the sky, having great authority. The earth was illuminated with his glory.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He cried with a mighty voice, saying, “Fallen, fallen is
    Babylon the great, and she has become a habitation of demons, a prison of
    every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of
    her sexual immorality, the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality
    with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her
    luxury.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I heard another voice from heaven, saying, “Come out of her,
    my people, that you have no participation in her sins, and that you don’t
    receive of her plagues,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] for her sins have reached to the sky, and God has remembered
    her iniquities.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Return to her just as she returned, and repay her double as
    she did, and according to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix to her
    double.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] However much she glorified herself, and grew wanton, so much
    give her of torment and mourning. For she says in her heart, ‘I sit a queen,
    and am no widow, and will in no way see mourning.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Therefore in one day her plagues will come: death, mourning,
    and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire; for the Lord God who
    has judged her is strong.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and
    lived wantonly with her, will weep and wail over her, when they look at the
    smoke of her burning,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] standing far away for the fear of her torment, saying,
    ‘Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For your judgment has
    come in one hour.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no
    one buys their merchandise any more;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine
    linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all expensive wood, every vessel of ivory,
    every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] and cinnamon, incense, perfume, frankincense, wine, olive
    oil, fine flour, wheat, sheep, horses, chariots, and people’s bodies and
    souls.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to
    you, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you,
    and you will find them no more at all.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her,
    will stand far away for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, she who was dressed in
    fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones
    and pearls!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For in an hour such great riches are made desolate.’ Every
    ship master, and everyone who sails anywhere, and mariners, and as many as
    gain their living by sea, stood far away,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning,
    saying, ‘What is like the great city?’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] They cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and
    mourning, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had their
    ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her great wealth!’ For in one
    hour is she made desolate. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] “Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints, apostles, and
    prophets; for God has judged your judgment on her.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and
    cast it into the sea, saying, “Thus with violence will Babylon, the great
    city, be thrown down, and will be found no more at all.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] The voice of harpists, minstrels, flute players, and
    trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you. No craftsman, of whatever
    craft, will be found any more at all in you. The sound of a mill will be
    heard no more at all in you.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] The light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you. The
    voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in
    you; for your merchants were the princes of the earth; for with your sorcery
    all the nations were deceived.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] In her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and
    of all who have been slain on the earth.” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 19</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a
    great multitude in heaven, saying, “Hallelujah! Salvation, power, and glory
    belong to our God:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] for true and righteous are his judgments. For he has judged
    the great prostitute, who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality,
    and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] A second said, “Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever and
    ever.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell
    down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, “Amen! Hallelujah!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] A voice came from the throne, saying, “Give praise to our
    God, all you his servants, you who fear him, the small and the great!” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I heard something like the voice of a great multitude, and
    like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunders,
    saying, “Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let us give the
    glory to him. For the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made
    herself ready.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] It was given to her that she would array herself in bright,
    pure, fine linen: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He said to me, “Write, ‘Blessed are those who are invited to
    the marriage supper of the Lamb.’” He said to me, “These are true words of
    God.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I fell down before his feet to worship him. He said to me,
    “Look! Don’t do it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your
    brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of
    Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he
    who sat on it is called Faithful and True. In righteousness he judges and
    makes war.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] His eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head are many
    crowns. He has names written and a name written which no one knows but he
    himself.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood. His name
    is called “The Word of God.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The armies which are in heaven followed him on white
    horses, clothed in white, pure, fine linen.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Out of his mouth proceeds a sharp, double-edged sword, that
    with it he should strike the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod.<a
      href="passagestudy.jsp?action=showNote&amp;type=x&amp;value=1&amp;module=WEB&amp;passage=Revelation+of+John+19%3A15"><small><sup
          class="x">*x</sup></small></a> He treads the wine press of the
    fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written,
    “KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried with a loud
    voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the sky, “Come! Be gathered
    together to the great supper of God,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains,
    the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on
    them, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, and small and great.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their
    armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse, and
    against his army.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] The beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who
    worked the signs in his sight, with which he deceived those who had received
    the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were
    thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] The rest were killed with the sword of him who sat on the
    horse, the sword which came out of his mouth. All the birds were filled with
    their flesh. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 20</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of
    the abyss and a great chain in his hand.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He seized the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil
    and Satan, who deceives the whole inhabited earth, and bound him for a
    thousand years,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] and cast him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over
    him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years
    were finished. After this, he must be freed for a short time.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given
    to them. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of
    Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as didn’t worship the beast nor his
    image, and didn’t receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand. They
    lived, and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The rest of the dead didn’t live until the thousand years
    were finished. This is the first resurrection.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first
    resurrection. Over these, the second death has no power, but they will be
    priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with him one thousand years. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] And after the thousand years, Satan will be released from
    his prison,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the
    four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the
    war; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] They went up over the breadth of the earth, and surrounded
    the camp of the saints, and the beloved city. Fire came down out of heaven
    from God, and devoured them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of
    fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also. They will
    be tormented day and night forever and ever. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I saw a great white throne, and him who sat on it, from
    whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. There was found no place for
    them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before
    the throne, and they opened books. Another book was opened, which is the
    book of life. The dead were judged out of the things which were written in
    the books, according to their works.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades
    gave up the dead who were in them. They were judged, each one according to
    his works.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is
    the second death, the lake of fire.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was
    cast into the lake of fire. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 21</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
    the first earth have passed away, and the sea is no more.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of
    heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying, “Behold, God’s
    dwelling is with people, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his
    people, and God himself will be with them as their God.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes.
    Death will be no more; neither will there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain,
    any more. The first things have passed away.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] He who sits on the throne said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Behold, I am making all things new.”</span> He said, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Write, for these words of God are faithful and true.” </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] He said to me, <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “It is done! I
      am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give freely
      to him who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> He who overcomes, I will give
      him these things. I will be his God, and he will be my son. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> But for the cowardly,
      unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral,
      sorcerers,idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns
      with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were
    loaded with the seven last plagues came, and he spoke with me, saying, “Come
    here. I will show you the wife, the Lamb’s bride.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high
    mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven
    from God,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious
    stone, as if it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at
    the gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are the names of
    the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] On the east were three gates; and on the north three gates;
    and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them
    twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He who spoke with me had for a measure, a golden reed, to
    measure the city, its gates, and its walls.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] The city is square, and its length is as great as its
    breadth. He measured the city with the reed, Twelve thousand twelve stadia.
    Its length, breadth, and height are equal.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits, by the measure
    of a man, that is, of an angel.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] The construction of its wall was jasper. The city was pure
    gold, like pure glass.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] The foundations of the city’s wall were adorned with all
    kinds of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second,
    sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
    chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus;
    the eleventh, jacinth; and the twelfth, amethyst.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each one of the gates
    was made of one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold, like
    transparent glass.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and
    the Lamb, are its temple.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] The city has no need for the sun, neither of the moon, to
    shine, for the very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] The nations will walk in its light. The kings of the earth
    bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Its gates will in no way be shut by day (for there will be
    no night there),<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations
    into it so that they may enter.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] There will in no way enter into it anything profane, or one
    who causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the
    Lamb’s book of life. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 22</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] He showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal,
    proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] in the middle of its street. On this side of the river and
    on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding its
    fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the
    nations.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] There will be no curse any more. The throne of God and of
    the Lamb will be in it, and his servants serve him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] They will see his face, and his name will be on their
    foreheads.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] There will be no night, and they need no lamp light; for the
    Lord God will illuminate them. They will reign forever and ever. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] He said to me, “These words are faithful and true. The Lord
    God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his
    bondservants the things which must happen soon.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Behold, I come quickly.
      Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Now I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When
    I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had
    shown me these things.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He said to me, “See you don’t do it! I am a fellow
    bondservant with you and with your brothers, the prophets, and with those
    who keep the words of this book. Worship God.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] He said to me, “Don’t seal up the words of the prophecy of
    this book, for the time is at hand.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] He who acts unjustly, let him act unjustly still. He who is
    filthy, let him be filthy still. He who is righteous, let him do
    righteousness still. He who is holy, let him be holy still.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> “Behold, I come quickly. My
      reward is with me, to repay to each man according to his work. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I am the Alpha and the Omega,
      the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Blessed are those who do his
      commandments,</span> <span class="wordsOfJesus"> that they may have the
      right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city. </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> Outside are the dogs, the
      sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and
      everyone who loves and practices falsehood. </span> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] <span class="wordsOfJesus"> I, Jesus, have sent my angel
      to testify these things to you for the assemblies. I am the root and the
      offspring of David; the Bright and Morning Star.”</span> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” He who hears, let him
    say, “Come!” He who is thirsty, let him come. He who desires, let him take
    the water of life freely.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy
    of this book, if anyone adds to them, may God add to him the plagues which
    are written in this book.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this
    prophecy, may God take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the
    holy city, which are written in this book.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] He who testifies these things says, <span class="wordsOfJesus">
      “Yes, I come quickly.” </span> <br>
    <br>
    Amen! Yes, come, Lord Jesus. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints.
    Amen. <br>
