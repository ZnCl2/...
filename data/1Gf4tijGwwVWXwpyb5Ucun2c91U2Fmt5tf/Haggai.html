      <h1>Haggai</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month,
    in the first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came by Haggai, the prophet, to
    Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son
    of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “This is what Yahweh of Armies says: These people say, ‘The
    time hasn’t yet come, the time for Yahweh’s house to be built.’” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Then Yahweh’s word came by Haggai, the prophet, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] “Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled
    houses, while this house lies waste?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Now therefore this is what Yahweh of Armies says: Consider
    your ways.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] You have sown much, and bring in little. You eat, but you
    don’t have enough. You drink, but you aren’t filled with drink. You clothe
    yourselves, but no one is warm, and he who earns wages earns wages to put
    them into a bag with holes in it.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] This is what Yahweh of Armies says: “Consider your ways.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build the house. I
    will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified,” says Yahweh.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] “You looked for much, and, behold, it came to little; and
    when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why?” says Yahweh of Armies,
    “Because of my house that lies waste, while each of you is busy with his own
    house.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and
    the earth withholds its fruit.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on
    the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on that which the ground produces,
    on men, on livestock, and on all the labor of the hands.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son
    of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed
    the voice of Yahweh, their God, and the words of Haggai, the prophet, as
    Yahweh, their God, had sent him; and the people feared Yahweh. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Then Haggai, Yahweh’s messenger, spoke Yahweh’s message to
    the people, saying, “I am with you,” says Yahweh. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of
    Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, the son of
    Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people;
    and they came and worked on the house of Yahweh of Armies, their God,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] in the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month,
    in the second year of Darius the king. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month,
    Yahweh’s word came by Haggai the prophet, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of
    Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the
    remnant of the people, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] ‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former
    glory? How do you see it now? Isn’t it in your eyes as nothing?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ says Yahweh. ‘Be strong,
    Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the
    land,’ says Yahweh, ‘and work, for I am with you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] This is the word that I covenanted with you when you came
    out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you. ‘Don’t be afraid.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For this is what Yahweh of Armies says: ‘Yet once, it is a
    little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry
    land;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] and I will shake all nations. The precious things of all
    nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory, says Yahweh of
    Armies.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,’ says Yahweh of
    Armies.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] ‘The latter glory of this house will be greater than the
    former,’ says Yahweh of Armies; ‘and in this place will I give peace,’ says
    Yahweh of Armies.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second
    year of Darius, Yahweh’s word came by Haggai the prophet, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] “Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Ask now the priests concerning
    the law, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] ‘If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment,
    and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food, will it
    become holy?’” <br>
    <br>
    The priests answered, “No.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean by reason of a
    dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?” <br>
    <br>
    The priests answered, “It will be unclean.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Then Haggai answered, “‘So is this people, and so is this
    nation before me,’ says Yahweh; ‘and so is every work of their hands. That
    which they offer there is unclean.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Now, please consider from this day and backward, before a
    stone was laid on a stone in Yahweh’s temple.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty
    measures, there were only ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out
    fifty, there were only twenty.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail in all the work
    of your hands; yet you didn’t turn to me,’ says Yahweh.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] ‘Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the
    twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of
    Yahweh’s temple was laid, consider it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Is the seed yet in the barn? Yes, the vine, the fig tree,
    the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven’t produced. From this day will I
    bless you.’” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Yahweh’s word came the second time to Haggai in the
    twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] “Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, ‘I will
    shake the heavens and the earth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I will destroy the
    strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow the chariots, and
    those who ride in them. The horses and their riders will come down, everyone
    by the sword of his brother.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] In that day, says Yahweh of Armies, will I take you,
    Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,’ says Yahweh, ‘and will make
    you as a signet, for I have chosen you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.” <br>
