      <h1>Titus</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
    according to the faith of God’s chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth
    which is according to godliness,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised
    before time began;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] but in his own time revealed his word in the message with
    which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace,
    mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in
    order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I
    directed you;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having
    children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward; not
    self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not
    greedy for dishonest gain;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded,
    fair, holy, self-controlled;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] holding to the faithful word which is according to the
    teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to
    convict those who contradict him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and
    deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole
    houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are
    always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them
    sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of
    men who turn away from the truth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are
    defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their
    conscience are defiled.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] They profess that they know God, but by their works they
    deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] But say the things which fit sound doctrine,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded,
    sound in faith, in love, and in patience:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not
    slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] that they may train the young women to love their husbands,
    to love their children,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in
    subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in
    your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned; that he who
    opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters,
    and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may
    adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to
    all men,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and
    worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present
    world;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of
    our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
    iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous
    for good works.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority.
    Let no man despise you. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to
    authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be
    gentle, showing all humility toward all men.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived,
    serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and
    hating one another.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward
    mankind appeared,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but
    according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and
    renewing by the Holy Spirit,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our
    Savior;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs
    according to the hope of eternal life.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I
    desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may
    be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to
    men;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and
    disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being
    self-condemned. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to
    come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey
    speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Let our people also learn to maintain good works for
    necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in
    faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. <br>
