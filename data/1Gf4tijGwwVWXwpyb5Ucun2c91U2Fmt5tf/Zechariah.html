      <h1>Zechariah</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, Yahweh’s
    word came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet,
    saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Yahweh was very displeased with your fathers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Therefore tell them: Thus says Yahweh of Armies: ‘Return to
    me,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘and I will return to you,’ says Yahweh of
    Armies.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Don’t you be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets
    proclaimed, saying: Thus says Yahweh of Armies, ‘Return now from your evil
    ways, and from your evil doings;’ but they did not hear, nor listen to me,
    says Yahweh.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live
    forever?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] But my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants
    the prophets, didn’t they overtake your fathers? <br>
    <br>
    “Then they repented and said, ‘Just as Yahweh of Armies determined to do to
    us, according to our ways, and according to our practices, so he has dealt
    with us.’”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the
    month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, Yahweh’s word came to Zechariah
    the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] “I had a vision in the night, and behold, a man riding on a
    red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in a ravine; and
    behind him there were red, brown, and white horses.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Then I asked, ‘My lord, what are these?’” <br>
    <br>
    The angel who talked with me said to me, “I will show you what these are.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The man who stood among the myrtle trees answered, “They
    are the ones Yahweh has sent to go back and forth through the earth.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] They reported to Yahweh’s angel who stood among the myrtle
    trees, and said, “We have walked back and forth through the earth, and
    behold, all the earth is at rest and in peace.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Then Yahweh’s angel replied, “O Yahweh of Armies, how long
    will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against
    which you have had indignation these seventy years?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Yahweh answered the angel who talked with me with kind and
    comforting words.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] So the angel who talked with me said to me, “Proclaim,
    saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh of Armies: “I am jealous for Jerusalem and for
    Zion with a great jealousy.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] I am very angry with the nations that are at ease; for I
    was but a little displeased, but they added to the calamity.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Therefore thus says Yahweh: “I have returned to Jerusalem
    with mercy. My house shall be built in it,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and a
    line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.”’ <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] “Proclaim further, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh of Armies: “My
    cities will again overflow with prosperity, and Yahweh will again comfort
    Zion, and will again choose Jerusalem.”’” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four horns.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these?” <br>
    <br>
    He answered me, “These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and
    Jerusalem.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Yahweh showed me four craftsmen.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Then I asked, “What are these coming to do?” <br>
    <br>
    He said, “These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted
    up his head; but these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of
    the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter
    it.” <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a
    measuring line in his hand.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Then I asked, “Where are you going?” <br>
    <br>
    He said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and what is
    its length.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another
    angel went out to meet him,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] and said to him, “Run, speak to this young man, saying,
    ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the
    multitude of men and livestock in it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] For I,’ says Yahweh, ‘will be to her a wall of fire around
    it, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,’ says Yahweh;
    ‘for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky,’ says Yahweh.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] ‘Come, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of
    Babylon.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] For thus says Yahweh of Armies: ‘For honor he has sent me to
    the nations which plundered you; for he who touches you touches the apple of
    his eye.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they will
    be a plunder to those who served them; and you will know that Yahweh of
    Armies has sent me.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for, behold, I come,
    and I will dwell in your midst,’ says Yahweh.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Many nations shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day,
    and shall be my people; and I will dwell in your midst, and you shall know
    that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Yahweh will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land,
    and will again choose Jerusalem.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Be silent, all flesh, before Yahweh; for he has roused
    himself from his holy habitation!” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before Yahweh’s
    angel, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Yahweh said to Satan, “Yahweh rebuke you, Satan! Yes, Yahweh
    who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn’t this a burning stick plucked out
    of the fire?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was
    standing before the angel.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying,
    “Take the filthy garments off of him.” To him he said, “Behold, I have
    caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich
    clothing.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] I said, “Let them set a clean turban on his head.” <br>
    <br>
    So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and Yahweh’s angel
    was standing by.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Yahweh’s angel protested to Joshua, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] “Thus says Yahweh of Armies: ‘If you will walk in my ways,
    and if you will follow my instructions, then you also shall judge my house,
    and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among
    these who stand by.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who
    sit before you; for they are men who are a sign: for, behold, I will bring
    out my servant, the Branch.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one
    stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave its engraving,’ says Yahweh of
    Armies, ‘and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] In that day,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘you will invite every
    man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.’” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The angel who talked with me came again, and wakened me, as
    a man who is wakened out of his sleep.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He said to me, “What do you see?” <br>
    <br>
    I said, “I have seen, and behold, a lamp stand all of gold, with its bowl on
    the top of it, and its seven lamps on it; there are seven pipes to each of
    the lamps, which are on the top of it;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] and two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the
    bowl, and the other on the left side of it.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me,
    saying, “What are these, my lord?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Then the angel who talked with me answered me, “Don’t you
    know what these are?” <br>
    <br>
    I said, “No, my lord.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, “This is Yahweh’s
    word to Zerubbabel, saying, ‘Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,’
    says Yahweh of Armies.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Who are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you are a
    plain; and he will bring out the capstone with shouts of ‘Grace, grace, to
    it!’” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this
    house. His hands shall also finish it; and you will know that Yahweh of
    Armies has sent me to you.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Indeed, who despises the day of small things? For these
    seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel.
    These are the eyes of Yahweh, which run back and forth through the whole
    earth.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Then I asked him, “What are these two olive trees on the
    right side of the lamp stand and on the left side of it?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I asked him the second time, “What are these two olive
    branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that pour the golden oil
    out of themselves?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He answered me, “Don’t you know what these are?” <br>
    <br>
    I said, “No, my lord.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by
    the Lord of the whole earth.” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Then again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a
    flying scroll.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He said to me, “What do you see?” <br>
    <br>
    I answered, “I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits, and its
    breadth ten cubits.” <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over
    the surface of the whole land; for everyone who steals shall be cut off
    according to it on the one side; and everyone who swears falsely shall be
    cut off according to it on the other side.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] I will cause it to go out,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and it
    will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears
    falsely by my name; and it will remain in the midst of his house, and will
    destroy it with its timber and its stones.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Then the angel who talked with me came forward, and said to
    me, “Lift up now your eyes, and see what is this that is appearing.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] I said, “What is it?” <br>
    <br>
    He said, “This is the ephah basket that is appearing.” He said moreover,
    “This is their appearance in all the land<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] (and behold, a talent of lead was lifted up); and this is a
    woman sitting in the midst of the ephah basket.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He said, “This is Wickedness”; and he threw her down into
    the midst of the ephah basket; and he threw the weight of lead on its mouth.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Then lifted I up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there were
    two women, and the wind was in their wings. Now they had wings like the
    wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah basket between earth and the
    sky.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Then I said to the angel who talked with me, “Where are
    these carrying the ephah basket?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] He said to me, “To build her a house in the land of Shinar.
    When it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place.” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 6</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four
    chariots came out from between two mountains; and the mountains were
    mountains of brass.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] In the first chariot were red horses; in the second chariot
    black horses;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot
    dappled horses, all of them powerful.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Then I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these,
    my lord?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The angel answered me, “These are the four winds of the sky,
    which go out from standing before the Lord of all the earth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The one with the black horses goes out toward the north
    country; and the white went out after them; and the dappled went out toward
    the south country.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The strong went out, and sought to go that they might walk
    back and forth through the earth: and he said, “Go around and through the
    earth!” So they walked back and forth through the earth. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Then he called to me, and spoke to me, saying, “Behold,
    those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north
    country.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] “Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah,
    and of Jedaiah; and come the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the
    son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Yes, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on
    the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] and speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh of Armies,
    “Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his
    place; and he shall build Yahweh’s temple;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] even he shall build Yahweh’s temple; and he shall bear the
    glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall be a priest on his
    throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to
    Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in Yahweh’s temple.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Those who are far off shall come and build in Yahweh’s
    temple; and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you. This
    will happen, if you will diligently obey Yahweh your God’s voice.”’” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 7</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] In the fourth year of king Darius, Yahweh’s word came to
    Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Chislev.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The people of Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem Melech, and
    their men, to entreat Yahweh’s favor,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] and to speak to the priests of the house of Yahweh of
    Armies, and to the prophets, saying, “Should I weep in the fifth month,
    separating myself, as I have done these so many years?” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Then the word of Yahweh of Armies came to me, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] “Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests,
    saying, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month
    for these seventy years, did you at all fast to me, really to me?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] When you eat, and when you drink, don’t you eat for
    yourselves, and drink for yourselves?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Aren’t these the words which Yahweh proclaimed by the former
    prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and its cities
    around her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?’” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Yahweh’s word came to Zechariah, saying,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] “Thus has Yahweh of Armies spoken, saying, ‘Execute true
    judgment, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Don’t oppress the widow, nor the fatherless, the foreigner,
    nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your
    heart.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] But they refused to listen, and turned their backs, and
    stopped their ears, that they might not hear.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Yes, they made their hearts as hard as flint, lest they
    might hear the law, and the words which Yahweh of Armies had sent by his
    Spirit by the former prophets. Therefore great wrath came from Yahweh of
    Armies.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] It has come to pass that, as he called, and they refused to
    listen, so they will call, and I will not listen,” said Yahweh of Armies;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] “but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the
    nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so
    that no man passed through nor returned: for they made the pleasant land
    desolate.” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 8</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The word of Yahweh of Armies came to me.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Thus says Yahweh of Armies: “I am jealous for Zion with
    great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Thus says Yahweh: “I have returned to Zion, and will dwell
    in the midst of Jerusalem. Jerusalem shall be called ‘The City of Truth;’
    and the mountain of Yahweh of Armies, ‘The Holy Mountain.’” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Thus says Yahweh of Armies: “Old men and old women will
    again dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his
    hand for very age.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The streets of the city will be full of boys and girls
    playing in its streets.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Thus says Yahweh of Armies: “If it is marvelous in the eyes
    of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in
    my eyes?” says Yahweh of Armies. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Thus says Yahweh of Armies: “Behold, I will save my people
    from the east country, and from the west country;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] and I will bring them, and they will dwell in the midst of
    Jerusalem; and they will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and
    in righteousness.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Thus says Yahweh of Armies: “Let your hands be strong, you
    who hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who were
    in the day that the foundation of the house of Yahweh of Armies was laid,
    even the temple, that it might be built.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For before those days there was no wages for man, nor any
    wages for an animal; neither was there any peace to him who went out or came
    in, because of the adversary. For I set all men everyone against his
    neighbor.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in
    the former days,” says Yahweh of Armies.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] “For the seed of peace and the vine will yield its fruit,
    and the ground will give its increase, and the heavens will give their dew;
    and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] It shall come to pass that, as you were a curse among the
    nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you
    shall be a blessing. Don’t be afraid. Let your hands be strong.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For thus says Yahweh of Armies: “As I thought to do evil to
    you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and I
    didn’t repent;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] so again have I thought in these days to do good to
    Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Don’t be afraid.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] These are the things that you shall do: speak every man the
    truth with his neighbor. Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your
    gates,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his
    neighbor, and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate,”
    says Yahweh. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] The word of Yahweh of Armies came to me.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Thus says Yahweh of Armies: “The fasts of the fourth fifth,
    seventh, and tenth months shall be for the house of Judah joy and gladness,
    and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Thus says Yahweh of Armies: “Many peoples, and the
    inhabitants of many cities will yet come;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] and the inhabitants of one shall go to another, saying,
    ‘Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Yahweh, and to seek Yahweh of
    Armies. I will go also.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Yes, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek
    Yahweh of Armies in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Yahweh.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Thus says Yahweh of Armies: “In those days, ten men will
    take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they will take hold of
    the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying, ‘We will go with you, for we have
    heard that God is with you.’” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 9</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] An oracle. <br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh’s word is against the land of Hadrach,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will rest upon Damascus;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the eye of man</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0">Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Tyre built herself a stronghold,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">and the king will perish from Gaza,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>

    <span class="line indent0">and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] I will take away his blood out of his mouth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his abominations from between his teeth;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he also will be a remnant for our God;</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Shout, daughter of Jerusalem!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Behold, your King comes to you!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is righteous, and having salvation;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">lowly, and riding on a donkey,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">and the battle bow will be cut off;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he will speak peace to the nations:</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] As for you also,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because of the blood of your covenant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have set free your prisoners from the pit in

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] For indeed I bend Judah as a bow for me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have filled the bow with Ephraim;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will stir up your sons, Zion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">against your sons, Greece,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will make you like the sword of a mighty man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Yahweh will be seen over them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his arrow will go flash like lightning;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will go with whirlwinds of the south.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Yahweh of Armies will defend them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will destroy and overcome with sling
      stones;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will drink, and roar as through wine;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will be filled like bowls,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like the corners of the altar.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Yahweh their God will save them in that day as the flock
      of his people;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for they are like the jewels of a crown,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">lifted on high over his land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For how great is his goodness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and how great is his beauty!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Grain will make the young men flourish,</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Ask of Yahweh rain in the spring time,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh who makes storm clouds,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he gives rain showers to everyone for the
      plants in the field.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For the teraphim have spoken vanity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the diviners have seen a lie;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they have told false dreams.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They comfort in vain.</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">They are oppressed, because there is no shepherd.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] My anger is kindled against the shepherds,</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">For Yahweh of Armies has visited his flock, the

    <span class="line indent0">Their heart will be glad in Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] I will signal for them, and gather them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for I have redeemed them;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will increase as they have increased.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] I will sow them among the peoples;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will remember me in far countries;</span><br>

      return.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and gather them out of Assyria;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and

    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I will strengthen them in Yahweh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will walk up and down in his name,” says
      Yahweh.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Open your doors, Lebanon,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">that the fire may devour your cedars.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Wail, fir tree, for the cedar has fallen,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because the stately ones are destroyed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Wail, you oaks of Bashan,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the strong forest has come down.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] A voice of the wailing of the shepherds!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For their glory is destroyed: a voice of the
      roaring of young lions!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Thus says Yahweh my God: “Feed the flock of slaughter.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Their buyers slaughter them, and go unpunished. Those who
    sell them say, ‘Blessed be Yahweh, for I am rich;’ and their own shepherds
    don’t pity them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land,” says
    Yahweh; “but, behold, I will deliver the men everyone into his neighbor’s
    hand, and into the hand of his king. They will strike the land, and out of
    their hand I will not deliver them.” <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] So I fed the flock of slaughter, especially the oppressed of
    the flock. I took for myself two staffs. The one I called “Favor”, and the
    other I called “Union”, and I fed the flock.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was
    weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Then I said, “I will not feed you. That which dies, let it
    die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let those who
    are left eat each other’s flesh.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I took my staff Favor, and cut it apart, that I might break
    my covenant that I had made with all the peoples.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] It was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock
    that listened to me knew that it was Yahweh’s word.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] I said to them, “If you think it best, give me my wages;
    and if not, keep them.” So they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of
    silver.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Yahweh said to me, “Throw it to the potter, the handsome
    price that I was valued at by them!” I took the thirty pieces of silver, and
    threw them to the potter, in Yahweh’s house.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Then I cut apart my other staff, even Union, that I might
    break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Yahweh said to me, “Take for yourself yet again the
    equipment of a foolish shepherd.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For, behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who
    will not visit those who are cut off, neither will seek those who are
    scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but
    he will eat the flesh of the fat sheep, and will tear their hoofs in pieces.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Woe to the worthless shepherd who leaves the flock! The
    sword will be on his arm, and on his right eye. His arm will be completely
    withered, and his right eye will be totally blinded!” <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 12</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] An oracle. Yahweh’s word concerning Israel. Yahweh, who
    stretches out the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms
    the spirit of man within him says:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the
    surrounding peoples, and on Judah also will it be in the siege against
    Jerusalem.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] It will happen in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a
    burdensome stone for all the peoples. All who burden themselves with it will
    be severely wounded, and all the nations of the earth will be gathered
    together against it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] In that day,” says Yahweh, “I will strike every horse with
    terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open my eyes on the house of
    Judah, and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The chieftains of Judah will say in their heart, ‘The
    inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Yahweh of Armies their God.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] In that day I will make the chieftains of Judah like a pan
    of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they will
    devour all the surrounding peoples, on the right hand and on the left; and
    Jerusalem will yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Yahweh also will save the tents of Judah first, that the
    glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem
    not be magnified above Judah.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] In that day Yahweh will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
    He who is feeble among them at that day will be like David, and the house of
    David will be like God, like Yahweh’s angel before them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] It will happen in that day, that I will seek to destroy all
    the nations that come against Jerusalem.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants
    of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they will look to
    me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for
    his only son, and will grieve bitterly for him, as one grieves for his
    firstborn.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] In that day there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem,
    like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The land will mourn, every family apart; the family of the
    house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of
    Nathan apart, and their wives apart;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives
    apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] all the families who remain, every family apart, and their
    wives apart. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 13</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] “In that day there will be a spring opened to the house of
    David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] It will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies,
    that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they will be
    remembered no more. I will also cause the prophets and the spirit of
    impurity to pass out of the land.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] It will happen that, when anyone still prophesies, then his
    father and his mother who bore him will tell him, ‘You must die, because you
    speak lies in Yahweh’s name;’ and his father and his mother who bore him
    will stab him when he prophesies.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] It will happen in that day, that the prophets will each be
    ashamed of his vision, when he prophesies; neither will they wear a hairy
    mantle to deceive:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] but he will say, ‘I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the
    ground; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth.’<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] One will say to him, ‘What are these wounds between your
    arms?’ Then he will answer, ‘Those with which I was wounded in the house of
    my friends.’ <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] “Awake, sword, against my shepherd,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and against the man who is close to me,” says
      Yahweh of Armies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be
      scattered;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I will turn my hand against the little ones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] It shall happen that in all the land,” says Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“two parts in it will be cut off and die;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the third will be left in it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] I will bring the third part into the fire,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will refine them as silver is refined,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will test them like gold is tested.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will call on my name, and I will hear them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will say, ‘It is my people;’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they will say, ‘Yahweh is my God.’”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 14</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Behold, a day of Yahweh comes, when your plunder will be
    divided in your midst.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle;
    and the city will be taken, the houses rifled, and the women ravished. Half
    of the city will go out into captivity, and the rest of the people will not
    be cut off from the city.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Then Yahweh will go out and fight against those nations, as
    when he fought in the day of battle.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] His feet will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives,
    which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split
    in two, from east to west, making a very great valley. Half of the mountain
    will move toward the north, and half of it toward the south.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] You shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley
    of the mountains shall reach to Azel; yes, you shall flee, just like you
    fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Yahweh
    my God will come, and all the holy ones with you./f + Septuagint reads “him”
    instead of “you”./f*<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] It will happen in that day, that there will not be light,
    cold, or frost.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] It will be a unique day which is known to Yahweh; not day,
    and not night; but it will come to pass, that at evening time there will be
    light. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] It will happen in that day, that living waters will go out
    from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward
    the western sea; in summer and in winter will it be. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Yahweh will be King over all the earth. In that day Yahweh
    will be one, and his name one.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] All the land will be made like the Arabah, from Geba to
    Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she will be lifted up, and will dwell in her
    place, from Benjamin’s gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner
    gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king’s wine presses.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Men will dwell therein, and there will be no more curse;
    but Jerusalem will dwell safely.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] This will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike all
    the peoples who have fought against Jerusalem: their flesh will consume away
    while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will consume away in their
    sockets, and their tongue will consume away in their mouth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] It will happen in that day, that a great panic from Yahweh
    will be among them; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his
    neighbor, and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all
    the surrounding nations will be gathered together: gold, and silver, and
    clothing, in great abundance. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] So will be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the
    camel, and of the donkey, and of all the animals that will be in those
    camps, as that plague.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] It will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations
    that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the
    King, Yahweh of Armies, and to keep the feast of tents.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] It will be, that whoever of all the families of the earth
    doesn’t go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Yahweh of Armies, on them
    there will be no rain.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] If the family of Egypt doesn’t go up, and doesn’t come,
    neither will it rain on them. This will be the plague with which Yahweh will
    strike the nations that don’t go up to keep the feast of tents.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of
    all the nations that don’t go up to keep the feast of tents.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] In that day there will be on the bells of the horses, “HOLY
    TO YAHWEH”; and the pots in Yahweh’s house will be like the bowls before the
    altar.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to
    Yahweh of Armies; and all those who sacrifice will come and take of them,
    and cook in them. In that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the
    house of Yahweh of Armies. <br>
