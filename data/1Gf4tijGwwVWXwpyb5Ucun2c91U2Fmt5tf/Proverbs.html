      <h1>Proverbs</h1>
      <br>
      Chapter 1</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel: <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] to know wisdom and instruction;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to discern the words of understanding;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] to receive instruction in wise dealing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in righteousness, justice, and equity;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] to give prudence to the simple,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">knowledge and discretion to the young man:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that the man of understanding may attain to sound
      counsel:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] to understand a proverb, and parables,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the words and riddles of the wise.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] My son, listen to your father’s instruction,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] for they will be a garland to grace your head,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and chains around your neck.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] My son, if sinners entice you, don’t consent.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] If they say, “Come with us,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let’s lay in wait for blood;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without
      cause;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and whole, like those who go down into the pit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] We’ll find all valuable wealth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We’ll fill our houses with plunder.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] You shall cast your lot among us.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">We’ll all have one purse.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] My son, don’t walk on the path with them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Keep your foot from their path,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] for their feet run to evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They hurry to shed blood.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] but these lay wait for their own blood.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They lurk secretly for their own lives.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It takes away the life of its owners.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Wisdom calls aloud in the street.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She utters her voice in the public squares.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] She calls at the head of noisy places.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her
      words:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">How long will mockers delight themselves in
      mockery,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and fools hate knowledge?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Turn at my reproof.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will make known my words to you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Because I have called, and you have refused;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid
      attention;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] but you have ignored all my counsel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and wanted none of my reproof;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] I also will laugh at your disaster.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will mock when calamity overtakes you;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] when calamity overtakes you like a storm,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when distress and anguish come on you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Then will they call on me, but I will not answer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They will seek me diligently, but they will not
      find me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] because they hated knowledge,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] They wanted none of my counsel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They despised all my reproof.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and be filled with their own schemes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The careless ease of fools will destroy them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 2</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] My son, if you will receive my words,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">and store up my commandments within you;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] So as to turn your ear to wisdom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and apply your heart to understanding;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Yes, if you call out for discernment,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and lift up your voice for understanding;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] If you seek her as silver,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and search for her as for hidden treasures:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] then you will understand the fear of Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and find the knowledge of God.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For Yahweh gives wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Out of his mouth comes knowledge and
      understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] that he may guard the paths of justice,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and preserve the way of his saints.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Then you will understand righteousness and justice,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">equity and every good path.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] For wisdom will enter into your heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Discretion will watch over you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Understanding will keep you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] to deliver you from the way of evil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from the men who speak perverse things;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] who forsake the paths of uprightness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to walk in the ways of darkness;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] who rejoice to do evil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and delight in the perverseness of evil;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] who are crooked in their ways,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and wayward in their paths:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] To deliver you from the strange woman,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even from the foreigner who flatters with her
      words;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] who forsakes the friend of her youth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and forgets the covenant of her God:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] for her house leads down to death,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">her paths to the departed spirits.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] None who go to her return again,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither do they attain to the paths of life:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] that you may walk in the way of good men,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and keep the paths of the righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] For the upright will dwell in the land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The perfect will remain in it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] But the wicked will be cut off from the land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The treacherous will be rooted out of it.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 3</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] My son, don’t forget my teaching;<br>
    <span class="line indent0">but let your heart keep my commandments:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] for length of days, and years of life,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and peace, will they add to you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Bind them around your neck.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Write them on the tablet of your heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] So you will find favor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and good understanding in the sight of God and
      man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Trust in Yahweh with all your heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t lean on your own understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] In all your ways acknowledge him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he will make your paths straight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Don’t be wise in your own eyes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] It will be health to your body,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and nourishment to your bones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Honor Yahweh with your substance,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with the first fruits of all your increase:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] so your barns will be filled with plenty,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your vats will overflow with new wine.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] My son, don’t despise Yahweh’s discipline,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither be weary of his reproof:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] for whom Yahweh loves, he reproves;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even as a father reproves the son in whom he
      delights.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Happy is the man who finds wisdom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the man who gets understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] For her good profit is better than getting silver,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and her return is better than fine gold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] She is more precious than rubies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">None of the things you can desire are to be
      compared to her.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Length of days is in her right hand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In her left hand are riches and honor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Her ways are ways of pleasantness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All her paths are peace.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Happy is everyone who retains her.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">By understanding, he established the heavens.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the skies drop down the dew.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] My son, let them not depart from your eyes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] so they will be life to your soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and grace for your neck.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Then you shall walk in your way securely.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Your foot won’t stumble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] When you lie down, you will not be afraid.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be
      sweet.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Don’t be afraid of sudden fear,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it
      comes:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] for Yahweh will be your confidence,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will keep your foot from being taken.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">tomorrow I will give it to you,”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when you have it by you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Don’t devise evil against your neighbor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">since he dwells securely by you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Don’t strive with a man without cause,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">if he has done you no harm.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Don’t envy the man of violence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Choose none of his ways.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but his friendship is with the upright.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] Yahweh’s curse is in the house of the wicked,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Surely he mocks the mockers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he gives grace to the humble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] The wise will inherit glory,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but shame will be the promotion of fools.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 4</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Pay attention and know understanding;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] for I give you sound learning.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t forsake my law.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For I was a son to my father,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">tender and an only child in the sight of my
      mother.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He taught me, and said to me:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Let your heart retain my words.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Keep my commandments, and live.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Get wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Get understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t forget, neither swerve from the words of my
      mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Love her, and she will keep you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Wisdom is supreme.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Get wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get
      understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Esteem her, and she will exalt you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She will bring you to honor, when you embrace
      her.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] She will give to your head a garland of grace.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Listen, my son, and receive my sayings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The years of your life will be many.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] I have taught you in the way of wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I have led you in straight paths.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] When you go, your steps will not be hampered.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When you run, you will not stumble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Take firm hold of instruction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t let her go.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Keep her, for she is your life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Don’t enter into the path of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t walk in the way of evil men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Avoid it, and don’t pass by it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Turn from it, and pass on.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] For they don’t sleep, unless they do evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their sleep is taken away, unless they make
      someone fall.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] For they eat the bread of wickedness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and drink the wine of violence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that shines more and more until the perfect day.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] The way of the wicked is like darkness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They don’t know what they stumble over.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] My son, attend to my words.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Turn your ear to my sayings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Let them not depart from your eyes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Keep them in the midst of your heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] For they are life to those who find them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and health to their whole body.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Keep your heart with all diligence,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for out of it is the wellspring of life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Put away from yourself a perverse mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Put corrupt lips far from you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Let your eyes look straight ahead.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Fix your gaze directly before you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Make the path of your feet level.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let all of your ways be established.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Don’t turn to the right hand nor to the left.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Remove your foot from evil.</span><br>
    <br>

    <center>Chapter 5</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] My son, pay attention to my wisdom.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Turn your ear to my understanding:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] that you may maintain discretion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that your lips may preserve knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Her mouth is smoother than oil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and as sharp as a two-edged sword.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Her feet go down to death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Her steps lead straight to Sheol.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] She gives no thought to the way of life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Her ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t depart from the words of my mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Remove your way far from her.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t come near the door of her house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] lest you give your honor to others,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your years to the cruel one;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] lest strangers feast on your wealth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your labors enrich another man’s house.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] You will groan at your latter end,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when your flesh and your body are consumed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] and say, “How I have hated instruction,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and my heart despised reproof;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] I have come to the brink of utter ruin,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the midst of the gathered assembly.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Drink water out of your own cistern,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">running water out of your own well.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Should your springs overflow in the streets,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">streams of water in the public squares?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Let them be for yourself alone,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">not for strangers with you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Let your spring be blessed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Rejoice in the wife of your youth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] A loving doe and a graceful deer—</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">let her breasts satisfy you at all times.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Be captivated always with her love.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] For why should you, my son, be captivated with an
      adulteress?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Why embrace the bosom of another?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He examines all his paths.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The cords of his sin hold him firmly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] He will die for lack of instruction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 6</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">if you have struck your hands in pledge for a
      stranger;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] You are trapped by the words of your mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You are ensnared with the words of your mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">since you have come into the hand of your
      neighbor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Go, humble yourself.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Press your plea with your neighbor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Give no sleep to your eyes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor slumber to your eyelids.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Go to the ant, you sluggard.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Consider her ways, and be wise;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] provides her bread in the summer,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and gathers her food in the harvest.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] How long will you sleep, sluggard?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When will you arise out of your sleep?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] A little sleep, a little slumber,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a little folding of the hands to sleep:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] so your poverty will come as a robber,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your scarcity as an armed man.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] A worthless person, a man of iniquity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is he who walks with a perverse mouth;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who motions with his fingers;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] in whose heart is perverseness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who devises evil continually,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who always sows discord.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will be broken suddenly, and that without
      remedy.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] There are six things which Yahweh hates;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, seven which are an abomination to him:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] haughty eyes, a lying tongue,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">hands that shed innocent blood;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] a heart that devises wicked schemes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">feet that are swift in running to mischief,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] a false witness who utters lies,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he who sows discord among brothers.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] My son, keep your father’s commandment,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Bind them continually on your heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Tie them around your neck.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] When you walk, it will lead you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When you sleep, it will watch over you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When you awake, it will talk with you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] For the commandment is a lamp,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the law is light.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] to keep you from the immoral woman,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The adulteress hunts for your precious life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Can a man scoop fire into his lap,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his clothes not be burned?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Or can one walk on hot coals,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his feet not be scorched?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Men don’t despise a thief,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">if he steals to satisfy himself when he is
      hungry:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] but if he is found, he shall restore seven times.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He shall give all the wealth of his house.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] He who commits adultery with a woman is void of
      understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who does it destroys his own soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] He will get wounds and dishonor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His reproach will not be wiped away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He won’t spare in the day of vengeance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] He won’t regard any ransom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither will he rest content, though you give
      many gifts.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] My son, keep my words.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Lay up my commandments within you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Keep my commandments and live!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Bind them on your fingers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Write them on the tablet of your heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Call understanding your relative,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] that they may keep you from the strange woman,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">from the foreigner who flatters with her words.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] For at the window of my house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I looked out through my lattice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] I saw among the simple ones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I discerned among the youths a young man void of
      understanding,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] passing through the street near her corner,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he went the way to her house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] in the twilight, in the evening of the day,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the middle of the night and in the darkness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a
      prostitute,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and with crafty intent.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] She is loud and defiant.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Her feet don’t stay in her house.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Now she is in the streets, now in the squares,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and lurking at every corner.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] So she caught him, and kissed him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">With an impudent face she said to him:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] “Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">This day I have paid my vows.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Therefore I came out to meet you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to diligently seek your face,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and I have found you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Come, let’s take our fill of loving until the morning.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let’s solace ourselves with loving.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] For my husband isn’t at home.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He has gone on a long journey.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] He has taken a bag of money with him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will come home at the full moon.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] With persuasive words, she led him astray.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] He followed her immediately,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as an ox goes to the slaughter,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as a fool stepping into a noose.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Until an arrow strikes through his liver,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as a bird hurries to the snare,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and doesn’t know that it will cost his life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Now therefore, sons, listen to me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Pay attention to the words of my mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Don’t let your heart turn to her ways.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t go astray in her paths,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] for she has thrown down many wounded.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, all her slain are a mighty army.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Her house is the way to Sheol,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">going down to the rooms of death.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Doesn’t wisdom cry out?<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Doesn’t understanding raise her voice?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] On the top of high places by the way,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">where the paths meet, she stands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">at the entry doors, she cries aloud:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] “To you men, I call!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I send my voice to the sons of mankind.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] You simple, understand prudence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">You fools, be of an understanding heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Hear, for I will speak excellent things.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The opening of my lips is for right things.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] For my mouth speaks truth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] They are all plain to him who understands,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">right to those who find knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Receive my instruction rather than silver;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">knowledge rather than choice gold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For wisdom is better than rubies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All the things that may be desired can’t be
      compared to it.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] “I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Find out knowledge and discretion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] With me are riches, honor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">enduring wealth, and prosperity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">my yield than choice silver.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] I walk in the way of righteousness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the midst of the paths of justice;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] That I may give wealth to those who love me.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I fill their treasuries.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] “Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">before his deeds of old.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">before the earth existed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] When there were no depths, I was born,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when there were no springs abounding with water.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Before the mountains were settled in place,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">before the hills, I was born;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor the beginning of the dust of the world.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] When he established the heavens, I was there;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when he set a circle on the surface of the deep,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] when he established the clouds above,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when the springs of the deep became strong,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] when he gave to the sea its boundary,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that the waters should not violate his
      commandment,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when he marked out the foundations of the earth;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] then I was the craftsman by his side.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I was a delight day by day,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">always rejoicing before him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Rejoicing in his whole world.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">My delight was with the sons of men.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] “Now therefore, my sons, listen to me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for blessed are those who keep my ways.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] Hear instruction, and be wise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t refuse it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Blessed is the man who hears me,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">watching daily at my gates,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">waiting at my door posts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] For whoever finds me, finds life,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will obtain favor from Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[36] But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">All those who hate me love death.”</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Wisdom has built her house.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">She has carved out her seven pillars.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] She has prepared her meat.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She has mixed her wine.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She has also set her table.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] She has sent out her maidens.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She cries from the highest places of the city:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">As for him who is void of understanding, she says
      to him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] “Come, eat some of my bread,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Drink some of the wine which I have mixed!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Leave your simple ways, and live.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Walk in the way of understanding.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] He who corrects a mocker invites insult.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who reproves a wicked man invites abuse.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Reprove a wise man, and he will love you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Instruct a wise man, and he will be still wiser.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in
      learning.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] For by me your days will be multiplied.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The years of your life will be increased.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] If you are wise, you are wise for yourself.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If you mock, you alone will bear it.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The foolish woman is loud,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Undisciplined, and knows nothing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] She sits at the door of her house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">on a seat in the high places of the city,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] To call to those who pass by,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">who go straight on their ways,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">as for him who is void of understanding, she says
      to him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] “Stolen water is sweet.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Food eaten in secret is pleasant.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The proverbs of Solomon. <br>
    <span class="line indent0">A wise son makes a glad father;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Treasures of wickedness profit nothing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but righteousness delivers from death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Yahweh will not allow the soul of the righteous to go
      hungry,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] He becomes poor who works with a lazy hand,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the hand of the diligent brings wealth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] He who gathers in summer is a wise son,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who sleeps during the harvest is a son who
      causes shame.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Blessings are on the head of the righteous,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The memory of the righteous is blessed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the name of the wicked will rot.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The wise in heart accept commandments,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a chattering fool will fall.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He who walks blamelessly walks surely,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who perverts his ways will be found out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] One winking with the eye causes sorrow,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a chattering fool will fall.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The mouth of the righteous is a spring of life,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Hatred stirs up strife,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but love covers all wrongs.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a rod is for the back of him who is void of
      understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Wise men lay up knowledge,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the mouth of the foolish is near ruin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The rich man’s wealth is his strong city.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The destruction of the poor is their poverty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] The labor of the righteous leads to life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The increase of the wicked leads to sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He is in the way of life who heeds correction,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who forsakes reproof leads others astray.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] He who hides hatred has lying lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who utters a slander is a fool.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] In the multitude of words there is no lack of
      disobedience,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who restrains his lips does wisely.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] The tongue of the righteous is like choice silver.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The heart of the wicked is of little worth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] The lips of the righteous feed many,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the foolish die for lack of understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Yahweh’s blessing brings wealth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he adds no trouble to it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] It is a fool’s pleasure to do wickedness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but wisdom is a man of understanding’s pleasure.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] What the wicked fear, will overtake them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the desire of the righteous will be granted.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the righteous stand firm forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is the sluggard to those who send him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] The fear of Yahweh prolongs days,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] The prospect of the righteous is joy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the hope of the wicked will perish.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] The way of Yahweh is a stronghold to the upright,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but it is a destruction to the workers of
      iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] The righteous will never be removed,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the wicked will not dwell in the land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] The mouth of the righteous produces wisdom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the perverse tongue will be cut off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the mouth of the wicked is perverse.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 11</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] A false balance is an abomination to Yahweh,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">but accurate weights are his delight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] When pride comes, then comes shame,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but with humility comes wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] The integrity of the upright shall guide them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the perverseness of the treacherous shall
      destroy them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Riches don’t profit in the day of wrath,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but righteousness delivers from death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the unfaithful will be trapped by evil
      desires.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] When a wicked man dies, hope perishes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and expectation of power comes to nothing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] A righteous person is delivered out of trouble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the wicked takes his place.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the righteous will be delivered through
      knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When the wicked perish, there is shouting.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] One who despises his neighbor is void of wisdom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a man of understanding holds his peace.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] One who brings gossip betrays a confidence,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one who is of a trustworthy spirit is one who
      keeps a secret.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but in the multitude of counselors there is
      victory.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who refuses pledges of collateral is
      secure.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] A gracious woman obtains honor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but violent men obtain riches.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The merciful man does good to his own soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Wicked people earn deceitful wages,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one who sows righteousness reaps a sure
      reward.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] He who is truly righteous gets life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who pursues evil gets death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to
      Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but those whose ways are blameless are his
      delight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Most certainly, the evil man will not be unpunished,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the seed of the righteous will be delivered.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] The desire of the righteous is only good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The expectation of the wicked is wrath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] There is one who scatters, and increases yet more.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is one who withholds more than is
      appropriate, but gains poverty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] The liberal soul shall be made fat.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who waters shall be watered also himself.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] People curse someone who withholds grain,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but blessing will be on the head of him who sells
      it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] He who diligently seeks good seeks favor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who searches after evil, it shall come to
      him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] He who trusts in his riches will fall,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the righteous shall flourish as the green
      leaf.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The foolish shall be servant to the wise of
      heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who is wise wins souls.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Behold, the righteous shall be repaid in the earth;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">how much more the wicked and the sinner!</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 12</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Whoever loves correction loves knowledge,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who hates reproof is stupid.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] A good man shall obtain favor from Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he will condemn a man of wicked devices.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] A man shall not be established by wickedness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] A worthy woman is the crown of her husband,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a disgraceful wife is as rottenness in his
      bones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The thoughts of the righteous are just,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the advice of the wicked is deceitful.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] The words of the wicked are about lying in wait for blood,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the speech of the upright rescues them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The wicked are overthrown, and are no more,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the house of the righteous shall stand.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] A man shall be commended according to his wisdom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who has a warped mind shall be despised.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Better is he who is lightly esteemed, and has a servant,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than he who honors himself, and lacks bread.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] A righteous man respects the life of his animal,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who chases fantasies is void of
      understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The wicked desires the plunder of evil men,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the root of the righteous flourishes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] An evil man is trapped by sinfulness of lips,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the righteous shall come out of trouble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his
      mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The work of a man’s hands shall be rewarded to
      him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who is wise listens to counsel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] A fool shows his annoyance the same day,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one who overlooks an insult is prudent.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He who is truthful testifies honestly,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a false witness lies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a
      sword,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the tongue of the wise heals.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Truth’s lips will be established forever,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a lying tongue is only momentary.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but joy comes to the promoters of peace.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] No mischief shall happen to the righteous,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the wicked shall be filled with evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Lying lips are an abomination to Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but those who do the truth are his delight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] A prudent man keeps his knowledge,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the hearts of fools proclaim foolishness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] The hands of the diligent ones shall rule,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but laziness ends in slave labor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a kind word makes it glad.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] A righteous person is cautious in friendship,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the way of the wicked leads them astray.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] The slothful man doesn’t roast his game,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the possessions of diligent men are prized.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] In the way of righteousness is life;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in its path there is no death.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <center>Chapter 13</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] A wise son listens to his father’s instruction,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a scoffer doesn’t listen to rebuke.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] By the fruit of his lips, a man enjoys good things;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the unfaithful crave violence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] He who guards his mouth guards his soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">One who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the desire of the diligent shall be fully
      satisfied.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] A righteous man hates lies,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a wicked man brings shame and disgrace.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Righteousness guards the way of integrity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but wickedness overthrows the sinner.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] There are some who pretend to be rich, yet have nothing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There are some who pretend to be poor, yet have
      great wealth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The ransom of a man’s life is his riches,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the poor hear no threats.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The light of the righteous shines brightly,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Pride only breeds quarrels,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but with ones who take advice is wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Wealth gained dishonestly dwindles away,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who gathers by hand makes it grow.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Hope deferred makes the heart sick,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but when longing is fulfilled, it is a tree of
      life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Whoever despises instruction will pay for it,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who respects a command will be rewarded.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The teaching of the wise is a spring of life,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to turn from the snares of death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Good understanding wins favor;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the way of the unfaithful is hard.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Every prudent man acts from knowledge,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a fool exposes folly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] A wicked messenger falls into trouble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a trustworthy envoy gains healing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Poverty and shame come to him who refuses discipline,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who heeds correction shall be honored.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but fools detest turning from evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] One who walks with wise men grows wise,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a companion of fools suffers harm.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Misfortune pursues sinners,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but prosperity rewards the righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s
      children,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the wealth of the sinner is stored for the
      righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] An abundance of food is in poor people’s fields,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but injustice sweeps it away.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] One who spares the rod hates his son,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one who loves him is careful to discipline
      him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] The righteous one eats to the satisfying of his soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the belly of the wicked goes hungry.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 14</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Every wise woman builds her house,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the foolish one tears it down with her own
      hands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] He who walks in his uprightness fears Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who is perverse in his ways despises him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] The fool’s talk brings a rod to his back,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the lips of the wise protect them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Where no oxen are, the crib is clean,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but much increase is by the strength of the ox.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] A truthful witness will not lie,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a false witness pours out lies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] A scoffer seeks wisdom, and doesn’t find it,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but knowledge comes easily to a discerning
      person.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Stay away from a foolish man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you won’t find knowledge on his lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The wisdom of the prudent is to think about his way,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the folly of fools is deceit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Fools mock at making atonement for sins,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but among the upright there is good will.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The heart knows its own bitterness and joy;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he will not share these with a stranger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The house of the wicked will be overthrown,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the tent of the upright will flourish.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] There is a way which seems right to a man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but in the end it leads to death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Even in laughter the heart may be sorrowful,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and mirth may end in heaviness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The unfaithful will be repaid for his own ways;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">likewise a good man will be rewarded for his
      ways.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] A simple man believes everything,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the prudent man carefully considers his ways.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] A wise man fears, and shuns evil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the fool is hot headed and reckless.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He who is quick to become angry will commit folly,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a crafty man is hated.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] The simple inherit folly,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] The evil bow down before the good,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] The poor person is shunned even by his own neighbor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the rich person has many friends.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] He who despises his neighbor sins,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but blessed is he who has pity on the poor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Don’t they go astray who plot evil?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">But love and faithfulness belong to those who
      plan good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] In all hard work there is profit,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the talk of the lips leads only to poverty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] The crown of the wise is their riches,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the folly of fools crowns them with folly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] A truthful witness saves souls,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a false witness is deceitful.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] In the fear of Yahweh is a secure fortress,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he will be a refuge for his children.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of life,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">turning people from the snares of death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] In the multitude of people is the king’s glory,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but in the lack of people is the destruction of
      the prince.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] He who is slow to anger has great understanding,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who has a quick temper displays folly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] The life of the body is a heart at peace,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but envy rots the bones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for his Maker,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who is kind to the needy honors him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] The wicked is brought down in his calamity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but in death, the righteous has a refuge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and is even made known in the inward part of
      fools.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Righteousness exalts a nation,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but sin is a disgrace to any people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] The king’s favor is toward a servant who deals wisely,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but his wrath is toward one who causes shame.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 15</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] A gentle answer turns away wrath,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a harsh word stirs up anger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The tongue of the wise commends knowledge,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the mouth of fools gush out folly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Yahweh’s eyes are everywhere,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">keeping watch on the evil and the good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] A gentle tongue is a tree of life,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but deceit in it crushes the spirit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] A fool despises his father’s correction,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who heeds reproof shows prudence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] In the house of the righteous is much treasure,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the income of the wicked brings trouble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The lips of the wise spread knowledge;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">not so with the heart of fools.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The sacrifice made by the wicked is an abomination to
      Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the prayer of the upright is his delight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The way of the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he loves him who follows after righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] There is stern discipline for one who forsakes the way:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whoever hates reproof shall die.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Sheol and Abaddon are before Yahweh—</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">how much more then the hearts of the children of
      men!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] A scoffer doesn’t love to be reproved;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he will not go to the wise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] A glad heart makes a cheerful face;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but an aching heart breaks the spirit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The heart of one who has understanding seeks knowledge,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the mouths of fools feed on folly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] All the days of the afflicted are wretched,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one who has a cheerful heart enjoys a
      continual feast.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Better is little, with the fear of Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than great treasure with trouble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than a fattened calf with hatred.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] A wrathful man stirs up contention,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one who is slow to anger appeases strife.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] The way of the sluggard is like a thorn patch,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the path of the upright is a highway.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] A wise son makes a father glad,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a foolish man despises his mother.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Folly is joy to one who is void of wisdom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a man of understanding keeps his way
      straight.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Where there is no counsel, plans fail;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but in a multitude of counselors they are
      established.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Joy comes to a man with the reply of his mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">How good is a word at the right time!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] The path of life leads upward for the wise,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to keep him from going downward to Sheol.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Yahweh will uproot the house of the proud,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he will keep the widow’s borders intact.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Yahweh detests the thoughts of the wicked,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the thoughts of the pure are pleasing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who hates bribes will live.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] The heart of the righteous weighs answers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the mouth of the wicked gushes out evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Yahweh is far from the wicked,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he hears the prayer of the righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] The light of the eyes rejoices the heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Good news gives health to the bones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] The ear that listens to reproof lives,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and will be at home among the wise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] He who refuses correction despises his own soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who listens to reproof gets understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] The fear of Yahweh teaches wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Before honor is humility.</span><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The plans of the heart belong to man,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the answer of the tongue is from Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but Yahweh weighs the motives.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Commit your deeds to Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your plans shall succeed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Yahweh has made everything for its own end—</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, even the wicked for the day of evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to
      Yahweh:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they shall certainly not be unpunished.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">By the fear of Yahweh men depart from evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] When a man’s ways please Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he makes even his enemies to be at peace with
      him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Better is a little with righteousness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than great revenues with injustice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] A man’s heart plans his course,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but Yahweh directs his steps.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He shall not betray his mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Honest balances and scales are Yahweh’s;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">all the weights in the bag are his work.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] It is an abomination for kings to do wrong,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for the throne is established by righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Righteous lips are the delight of kings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They value one who speaks the truth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The king’s wrath is a messenger of death,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a wise man will pacify it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] In the light of the king’s face is life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His favor is like a cloud of the spring rain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] How much better it is to get wisdom than gold!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather
      than silver.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] The highway of the upright is to depart from evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who keeps his way preserves his soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Pride goes before destruction,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a haughty spirit before a fall.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than to divide the plunder with the proud.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] He who heeds the Word finds prosperity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Whoever trusts in Yahweh is blessed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] The wise in heart shall be called prudent.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the punishment of fools is their folly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] The heart of the wise instructs his mouth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and adds learning to his lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Pleasant words are a honeycomb,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] There is a way which seems right to a man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but in the end it leads to death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] The appetite of the laboring man labors for him;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for his mouth urges him on.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] A worthless man devises mischief.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His speech is like a scorching fire.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] A perverse man stirs up strife.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A whisperer separates close friends.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] A man of violence entices his neighbor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and leads him in a way that is not good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] One who winks his eyes to plot perversities,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">one who compresses his lips, is bent on evil.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Gray hair is a crown of glory.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It is attained by a life of righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a
      city.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] The lot is cast into the lap,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but its every decision is from Yahweh.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 17</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Better is a dry morsel with quietness,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">than a house full of feasting with strife.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes
      shame,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and shall have a part in the inheritance among
      the brothers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but Yahweh tests the hearts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] An evildoer heeds wicked lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who is glad at calamity shall not be
      unpunished.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Children’s children are the crown of old men;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the glory of children are their parents.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Arrogant speech isn’t fitting for a fool,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">much less do lying lips fit a prince.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives
      it;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">wherever he turns, he prospers.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He who covers an offense promotes love;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who repeats a matter separates best
      friends.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than a hundred lashes into a fool.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] An evil man seeks only rebellion;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against
      him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">rather than a fool in his folly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Whoever rewards evil for good,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">evil shall not depart from his house.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">therefore stop contention before quarreling
      breaks out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the
      righteous,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">since he has no understanding?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] A friend loves at all times;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a brother is born for adversity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] A man void of understanding strikes hands,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and becomes collateral in the presence of his
      neighbor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] He who loves disobedience loves strife.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">One who builds a high gate seeks destruction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] One who has a perverse heart doesn’t find prosperity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into
      trouble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] He who becomes the father of a fool grieves.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The father of a fool has no joy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] A cheerful heart makes good medicine,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] A wicked man receives a bribe in secret,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to pervert the ways of justice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the
      earth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] A foolish son brings grief to his father,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and bitterness to her who bore him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Also to punish the righteous is not good,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor to flog officials for their integrity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] He who spares his words has knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who is even tempered is a man of
      understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be
      discerning.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 18</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] An unfriendly man pursues selfishness,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">and defies all sound judgment.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] A fool has no delight in understanding,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but only in revealing his own opinion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] When wickedness comes, contempt also comes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and with shame comes disgrace.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The words of a man’s mouth are like deep waters.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor to deprive the innocent of justice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] A fool’s lips come into strife,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his mouth invites beatings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] A fool’s mouth is his destruction,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his lips are a snare to his soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they go down into a person’s innermost parts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] One who is slack in his work</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is brother to him who is a master of destruction.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Yahweh’s name is a strong tower:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the righteous run to him, and are safe.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The rich man’s wealth is his strong city,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like an unscalable wall in his own imagination.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Before destruction the heart of man is proud,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but before honor is humility.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He who gives answer before he hears,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that is folly and shame to him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] A man’s spirit will sustain him in sickness,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a crushed spirit, who can bear?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The heart of the discerning gets knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The ear of the wise seeks knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] A man’s gift makes room for him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and brings him before great men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He who pleads his cause first seems right;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">until another comes and questions him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] The lot settles disputes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and keeps strong ones apart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified
      city;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and disputes are like the bars of a castle.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] A man’s stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] Death and life are in the power of the tongue;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">those who love it will eat its fruit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and obtains favor of Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] The poor plead for mercy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the rich answer harshly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] A man of many companions may be ruined,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but there is a friend who sticks closer than a
      brother.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 19</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Better is the poor who walks in his integrity<br>
    <span class="line indent0">than he who is perverse in his lips and is a
      fool.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] It isn’t good to have zeal without knowledge;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor being hasty with one’s feet and missing the
      way.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] The foolishness of man subverts his way;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his heart rages against Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Wealth adds many friends,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the poor is separated from his friend.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] A false witness shall not be unpunished.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who pours out lies shall not go free.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Many will entreat the favor of a ruler,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and everyone is a friend to a man who gives
      gifts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] All the relatives of the poor shun him:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">how much more do his friends avoid him!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He who gets wisdom loves his own soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who keeps understanding shall find good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] A false witness shall not be unpunished.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who utters lies shall perish.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">much less for a servant to have rule over
      princes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">It is his glory to overlook an offense.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but his favor is like dew on the grass.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] A foolish son is the calamity of his father.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A wife’s quarrels are a continual dripping.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] House and riches are an inheritance from fathers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a prudent wife is from Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The idle soul shall suffer hunger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he will reward him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Discipline your son, for there is hope;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">don’t be a willing party to his death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for if you rescue him, you must do it again.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Listen to counsel and receive instruction,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">that you may be wise in your latter end.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] There are many plans in a man’s heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but Yahweh’s counsel will prevail.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A poor man is better than a liar.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he rests and will not be touched by trouble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he will not so much as bring it to his mouth
      again.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">rebuke one who has understanding, and he will
      gain knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] He who robs his father and drives away his mother,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] If you stop listening to instruction, my son,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">you will stray from the words of knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] A corrupt witness mocks justice,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Penalties are prepared for scoffers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and beatings for the backs of fools.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 20</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Wine is a mocker, and beer is a brawler.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">Whoever is led astray by them is not wise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own
      life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but every fool will be quarreling.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have
      nothing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a man of understanding will draw it out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Many men claim to be men of unfailing love,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but who can find a faithful man?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] A righteous man walks in integrity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Blessed are his children after him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] A king who sits on the throne of judgment</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">scatters away all evil with his eyes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Who can say, “I have made my heart pure.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I am clean and without sin?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Differing weights and differing measures,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Even a child makes himself known by his doings,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whether his work is pure, and whether it is
      right.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh has made even both of them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Don’t love sleep, lest you come to poverty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with
      bread.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] “It’s no good, it’s no good,” says the buyer;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but when he is gone his way, then he boasts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] There is gold and abundance of rubies;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a
      stranger;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Fraudulent food is sweet to a man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Plans are established by advice;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">by wise guidance you wage war!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">therefore don’t keep company with him who opens
      wide his lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Whoever curses his father or his mother,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his lamp shall be put out in blackness of
      darkness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">won’t be blessed in the end.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Don’t say, “I will pay back evil.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Wait for Yahweh, and he will save you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Yahweh detests differing weights,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and dishonest scales are not pleasing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] A man’s steps are from Yahweh;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">how then can man understand his way?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">then later to consider his vows.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] A wise king winnows out the wicked,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and drives the threshing wheel over them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] The spirit of man is Yahweh’s lamp,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">searching all his innermost parts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Love and faithfulness keep the king safe.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">His throne is sustained by love.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] The glory of young men is their strength.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The splendor of old men is their gray hair.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Wounding blows cleanse away evil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and beatings purge the innermost parts.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 21</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The king’s heart is in Yahweh’s hand like the watercourses.<br>
    <span class="line indent0">He turns it wherever he desires.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but Yahweh weighs the hearts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] To do righteousness and justice</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] A high look, and a proud heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the lamp of the wicked, is sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to
      poverty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Getting treasures by a lying tongue</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The violence of the wicked will drive them away,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">because they refuse to do what is right.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The way of the guilty is devious,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the conduct of the innocent is upright.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than to share a house with a contentious woman.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The soul of the wicked desires evil;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When the wise is instructed, he receives
      knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and brings the wicked to ruin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he will also cry out, but shall not be heard.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] A gift in secret pacifies anger;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] It is joy to the righteous to do justice;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but it is a destruction to the workers of
      iniquity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] The man who wanders out of the way of understanding</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">shall rest in the assembly of the departed
      spirits.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] He who loves pleasure shall be a poor man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who loves wine and oil shall not be rich.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] The wicked is a ransom for the righteous;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the treacherous for the upright.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] It is better to dwell in a desert land,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than with a contentious and fretful woman.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the
      wise;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a foolish man swallows it up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] He who follows after righteousness and kindness</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">finds life, righteousness, and honor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] A wise man scales the city of the mighty,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and brings down the strength of its confidence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">keeps his soul from troubles.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] The proud and haughty man, “scoffer” is his name;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he works in the arrogance of pride.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] The desire of the sluggard kills him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for his hands refuse to labor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] There are those who covet greedily all day long;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the righteous give and don’t withhold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">how much more, when he brings it with a wicked
      mind!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] A false witness will perish,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a man who listens speaks to eternity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] A wicked man hardens his face;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but as for the upright, he establishes his ways.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] There is no wisdom nor understanding</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor counsel against Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] The horse is prepared for the day of battle;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but victory is with Yahweh.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 22</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] A good name is more desirable than great riches,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">and loving favor is better than silver and gold.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] The rich and the poor have this in common:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh is the maker of them all.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] A prudent man sees danger, and hides himself;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The result of humility and the fear of Yahweh</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is wealth, honor, and life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whoever guards his soul stays from them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Train up a child in the way he should go,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and when he is old he will not depart from it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The rich rule over the poor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The borrower is servant to the lender.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He who sows wickedness reaps trouble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He who has a generous eye will be blessed;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he shares his food with the poor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, quarrels and insults will stop.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is the king’s friend.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] The eyes of Yahweh watch over knowledge;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will be killed in the streets!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he who is under Yahweh’s wrath will fall into it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Folly is bound up in the heart of a child:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the rod of discipline drives it far from him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and
      whoever gives to the rich,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">both come to poverty.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Apply your heart to my teaching.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">if all of them are ready on your lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] That your trust may be in Yahweh,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I teach you today, even you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Haven’t I written to you thirty excellent things</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of counsel and knowledge,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] To teach you truth, reliable words,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to give sound answers to the ones who sent you?</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Don’t exploit the poor, because he is poor;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t crush the needy in court;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] for Yahweh will plead their case,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and plunder the life of those who plunder them.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Don’t befriend a hot-tempered man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t associate with one who harbors anger:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] lest you learn his ways,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and ensnare your soul.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Don’t you be one of those who strike hands,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">of those who are collateral for debts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] If you don’t have means to pay,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">why should he take away your bed from under you?</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Don’t move the ancient boundary stone,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">which your fathers have set up.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Do you see a man skilled in his work?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will serve kings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He won’t serve obscure men.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 23</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] When you sit to eat with a ruler,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">consider diligently what is before you;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] put a knife to your throat,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">if you are a man given to appetite.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Don’t be desirous of his dainties,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">since they are deceitful food.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Don’t weary yourself to be rich.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">In your wisdom, show restraint.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Why do you set your eyes on that which is not?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and
      flies in the sky.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Don’t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t crave his delicacies:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] for as he thinks about the cost, so he is.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">“Eat and drink!” he says to you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but his heart is not with you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and lose your good words.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Don’t speak in the ears of a fool,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he will despise the wisdom of your words.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Don’t move the ancient boundary stone.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] for their Defender is strong.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He will plead their case against you.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Apply your heart to instruction,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your ears to the words of knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Don’t withhold correction from a child.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If you punish him with the rod, he will not die.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Punish him with the rod,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and save his soul from Sheol.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] My son, if your heart is wise,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">then my heart will be glad, even mine:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] yes, my heart will rejoice,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when your lips speak what is right.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Don’t let your heart envy sinners;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but rather fear Yahweh all the day long.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Indeed surely there is a future hope,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your hope will not be cut off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Listen, my son, and be wise,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and keep your heart on the right path!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Don’t be among ones drinking too much wine,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or those who gorge themselves on meat:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and drowsiness clothes them in rags.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Listen to your father who gave you life,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t despise your mother when she is old.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Buy the truth, and don’t sell it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] The father of the righteous has great joy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Let your father and your mother be glad!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let her who bore you rejoice!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] My son, give me your heart;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and let your eyes keep in my ways.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] For a prostitute is a deep pit;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a wayward wife is a narrow well.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Yes, she lies in wait like a robber,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and increases the unfaithful among men.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Who has woe?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who has sorrow?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who has strife?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who has complaints?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who has needless bruises?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who has bloodshot eyes?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Those who stay long at the wine;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">those who go to seek out mixed wine.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Don’t look at the wine when it is red,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when it sparkles in the cup,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when it goes down smoothly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] In the end, it bites like a snake,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and poisons like a viper.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] Your eyes will see strange things,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your mind will imagine confusing things.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the
      sea,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or as he who lies on top of the rigging:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[35] “They hit me, and I was not hurt!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">They beat me, and I don’t feel it!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">When will I wake up? I can do it again.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I can find another.”</span><br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Don’t be envious of evil men;<br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither desire to be with them:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] for their hearts plot violence,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their lips talk about mischief.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Through wisdom a house is built;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">by understanding it is established;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] by knowledge the rooms are filled</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">with all rare and beautiful treasure.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] A wise man has great power;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a knowledgeable man increases strength;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] for by wise guidance you wage your war;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and victory is in many advisors.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Wisdom is too high for a fool:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he doesn’t open his mouth in the gate.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] One who plots to do evil</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">will be called a schemer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] The schemes of folly are sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The mocker is detested by men.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] If you falter in the time of trouble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your strength is small.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Rescue those who are being led away to death!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the
      slaughter!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] If you say, “Behold, we didn’t know this”;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">doesn’t he who weighs the hearts consider it?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who keeps your soul, doesn’t he know it?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Shall he not render to every man according to his
      work?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] My son, eat honey, for it is good;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet
      to your taste:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">if you have found it, then there will be a
      reward,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">your hope will not be cut off.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] Don’t lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of
      the righteous.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t destroy his resting place:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] for a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up
      again;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Don’t rejoice when your enemy falls.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t let your heart be glad when he is
      overthrown;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and he turn away his wrath from him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Don’t fret yourself because of evildoers;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither be envious of the wicked:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] for there will be no reward to the evil man;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the lamp of the wicked shall be snuffed out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] My son, fear Yahweh and the king.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t join those who are rebellious:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] for their calamity will rise suddenly;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the destruction from them both—who knows?</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] These also are sayings of the wise. <br>
    <span class="line indent0">To show partiality in judgment is not good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous”;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">peoples shall curse him, and nations shall abhor
      him—</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] but it will go well with those who convict the guilty,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a rich blessing will come on them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] An honest answer</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is like a kiss on the lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Prepare your work outside,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and get your fields ready.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Afterwards, build your house.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Don’t be a witness against your neighbor without cause.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t deceive with your lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] Don’t say, “I will do to him as he has done to me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I will render to the man according to his work.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] I went by the field of the sluggard,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Behold, it was all grown over with thorns.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Its surface was covered with nettles,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and its stone wall was broken down.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] Then I saw, and considered well.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">I saw, and received instruction:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] a little sleep, a little slumber,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a little folding of the hands to sleep;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[34] so your poverty will come as a robber,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your want as an armed man.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 25</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of
    Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] It is the glory of God to conceal a thing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the glory of kings is to search out a matter.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Take away the dross from the silver,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and material comes out for the refiner;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Take away the wicked from the king’s presence,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and his throne will be established in
      righteousness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Don’t exalt yourself in the presence of the king,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or claim a place among great men;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] for it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than that you should be put lower in the presence
      of the prince,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">whom your eyes have seen.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Don’t be hasty in bringing charges to court.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">What will you do in the end when your neighbor
      shames you?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Debate your case with your neighbor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t betray the confidence of another;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] lest one who hears it put you to shame,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and your bad reputation never depart.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] A word fitly spoken</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is like apples of gold in settings of silver.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is a faithful messenger to those who send him;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for he refreshes the soul of his masters.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] As clouds and wind without rain,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] By patience a ruler is persuaded.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A soft tongue breaks the bone.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] Have you found honey?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Eat as much as is sufficient for you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">lest you eat too much, and vomit it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">lest he be weary of you, and hate you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is like a bad tooth, or a lame foot.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] As one who takes away a garment in cold weather,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or vinegar on soda,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">If he is thirsty, give him water to drink:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] for you will heap coals of fire on his head,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and Yahweh will reward you.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] The north wind produces rain:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than to share a house with a contentious woman.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Like cold water to a thirsty soul,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is good news from a far country.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Like a muddied spring, and a polluted well,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is a righteous man who gives way before the
      wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] It is not good to eat much honey;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor is it honorable to seek one’s own honor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Like a city that is broken down and without walls</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is a man whose spirit is without restraint.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 26</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,<br>
    <span class="line indent0">so honor is not fitting for a fool.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Like a fluttering sparrow,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">like a darting swallow,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so the undeserved curse doesn’t come to rest.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] A whip is for the horse,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a bridle for the donkey,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a rod for the back of fools!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Don’t answer a fool according to his folly,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">lest you also be like him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Answer a fool according to his folly,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">lest he be wise in his own eyes.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] One who sends a message by the hand of a fool</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is cutting off feet and drinking violence.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Like the legs of the lame that hang loose:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] As one who binds a stone in a sling,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is he who gives honor to a fool.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Like a thorn bush that goes into the hand of a drunkard,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] As an archer who wounds all,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is he who hires a fool</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or he who hires those who pass by.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] As a dog that returns to his vomit,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is a fool who repeats his folly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is more hope for a fool than for him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">A fierce lion roams the streets!”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] As the door turns on its hinges,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so does the sluggard on his bed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The sluggard buries his hand in the dish.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than seven men who answer with discretion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Like one who grabs a dog’s ears</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not
      his own.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows, and death,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “Am I not
      joking?”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] For lack of wood a fire goes out.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Without gossip, a quarrel dies down.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] As coals are to hot embers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and wood to fire,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is a contentious man to kindling strife.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">they go down into the innermost parts.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Like silver dross on an earthen vessel</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] A malicious man disguises himself with his lips,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he harbors evil in his heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] When his speech is charming, don’t believe him;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for there are seven abominations in his heart.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] His malice may be concealed by deception,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but his wickedness will be exposed in the
      assembly.</span><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] A lying tongue hates those it hurts;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a flattering mouth works ruin.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 27</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] Don’t boast about tomorrow;<br>
    <span class="line indent0">for you don’t know what a day may bring.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] Let another man praise you,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and not your own mouth;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a stranger, and not your own lips.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] A stone is heavy,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and sand is a burden;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Wrath is cruel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and anger is overwhelming;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but who is able to stand before jealousy?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Better is open rebuke</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than hidden love.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Faithful are the wounds of a friend;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">although the kisses of an enemy are profuse.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] A full soul loathes a honeycomb;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is
      sweet.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] As a bird that wanders from her nest,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is a man who wanders from his home.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so does earnest counsel from a man’s friend.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Don’t forsake your friend and your father’s friend.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of
      your disaster:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">better is a neighbor who is near than a distant
      brother.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] Be wise, my son,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and bring joy to my heart,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">then I can answer my tormentor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a
      stranger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Hold it for a wayward woman!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in
      the morning,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">it will be taken as a curse by him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] A continual dropping on a rainy day</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a contentious wife are alike:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] restraining her is like restraining the wind,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or like grasping oil in his right hand.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Iron sharpens iron;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so a man sharpens his friend’s countenance.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He who looks after his master shall be honored.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] Like water reflects a face,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so a man’s heart reflects the man.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a man’s eyes are never satisfied.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] The crucible is for silver,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the furnace for gold;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but man is refined by his praise.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along
      with grain,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Know well the state of your flocks,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and pay attention to your herds:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] for riches are not forever,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor does even the crown endure to all
      generations.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] The hay is removed, and the new growth appears,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the grasses of the hills are gathered in.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] The lambs are for your clothing,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the goats are the price of a field.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for your family’s food,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and for the nourishment of your servant girls.</span><br>
    <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The wicked flee when no one pursues;<br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the righteous are as bold as a lion.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] In rebellion, a land has many rulers,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but order is maintained by a man of understanding
      and knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] A needy man who oppresses the poor</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">is like a driving rain which leaves no crops.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Those who forsake the law praise the wicked;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but those who keep the law contend with them.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] Evil men don’t understand justice;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but those who seek Yahweh understand it fully.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Better is the poor who walks in his integrity,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is
      rich.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Whoever keeps the law is a wise son;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his
      father.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] He who increases his wealth by excessive interest</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">gathers it for one who has pity on the poor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] He who turns away his ear from hearing the law,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">even his prayer is an abomination.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">he will fall into his own trap;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the blameless will inherit good.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The rich man is wise in his own eyes;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the poor who has understanding sees through
      him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] When the righteous triumph, there is great glory;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but whoever confesses and renounces them finds
      mercy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] Blessed is the man who always fears;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] As a roaring lion or a charging bear,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so is a wicked ruler over helpless people.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long
      days.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] A man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive
      until death;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">no one will support him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] One who works his land will have an abundance of food;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one who chases fantasies will have his fill
      of poverty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] A faithful man is rich with blessings;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one who is eager to be rich will not go
      unpunished.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] To show partiality is not good;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] A stingy man hurries after riches,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and doesn’t know that poverty waits for him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">than one who flatters with the tongue.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Whoever robs his father or his mother, and says, “It’s
      not wrong.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is a partner with a destroyer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] One who is greedy stirs up strife;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one who trusts in Yahweh will prosper.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] One who trusts in himself is a fool;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] One who gives to the poor has no lack;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one who closes his eyes will have many
      curses.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but when they perish, the righteous thrive.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 29</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck<br>
    <span class="line indent0">will be destroyed suddenly, with no remedy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but when the wicked rule, the people groan.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a companion of prostitutes squanders his
      wealth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] The king by justice makes the land stable,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but he who takes bribes tears it down.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] A man who flatters his neighbor</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">spreads a net for his feet.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] An evil man is snared by his sin,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the righteous can sing and be glad.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] The righteous care about justice for the poor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">The wicked aren’t concerned about knowledge.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Mockers stir up a city,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but wise men turn away anger.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the fool rages or scoffs, and there is no peace.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and they seek the life of the upright.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] A fool vents all of his anger,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a wise man brings himself under control.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] If a ruler listens to lies,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">all of his officials are wicked.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Yahweh gives sight to the eyes of both.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] The king who fairly judges the poor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">his throne shall be established forever.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] The rod of correction gives wisdom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a child left to himself causes shame to his
      mother.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] When the wicked increase, sin increases;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but the righteous will see their downfall.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] Correct your son, and he will give you peace;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, he will bring delight to your soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] Where there is no revelation, the people cast off
      restraint;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one who keeps the law is blessed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] A servant can’t be corrected by words.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Though he understands, yet he will not respond.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">There is more hope for a fool than for him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] He who pampers his servant from youth</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">will have him become a son in the end.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] An angry man stirs up strife,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a wrathful man abounds in sin.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] A man’s pride brings him low,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but one of lowly spirit gains honor.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his
      own soul.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He takes an oath, but dares not testify.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] The fear of man proves to be a snare,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but whoever puts his trust in Yahweh is kept
      safe.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] Many seek the ruler’s favor,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a man’s justice comes from Yahweh.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] A dishonest man detests the righteous,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the upright in their ways detest the wicked.</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the oracle: <br>
    <span class="line indent0">the man says to Ithiel,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to Ithiel and Ucal:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Surely I am the most ignorant man,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and don’t have a man’s understanding.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] I have not learned wisdom,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">neither do I have the knowledge of the Holy One.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who has gathered the wind in his fists?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who has bound the waters in his garment?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Who has established all the ends of the earth?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if
      you know?</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] “Every word of God is flawless.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Don’t you add to his words,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] “Two things I have asked of you;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">don’t deny me before I die:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Remove far from me falsehood and lies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Give me neither poverty nor riches.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Feed me with the food that is needful for me;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] lest I be full, deny you, and say, ‘Who is Yahweh?’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or lest I be poor, and steal,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and so dishonor the name of my God.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] “Don’t slander a servant to his master,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] There is a generation that curses their father,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and doesn’t bless their mother.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet are not washed from their filthiness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Their eyelids are lifted up.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] There is a generation whose teeth are like swords,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and their jaws like knives,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">to devour the poor from the earth, and the needy
      from among men.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] “The leach has two daughters:</span><br>

    <span class="line indent0">the way of a ship in the midst of the sea;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the way of a man with a maiden.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] “So is the way of an adulterous woman:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">she eats and wipes her mouth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and says, ‘I have done nothing wrong.’</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] “For three things the earth tremble,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and under four, it can’t bear up:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] For a servant when he is king;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">a fool when he is filled with food;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] for an unloved woman when she is married;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and a handmaid who is heir to her mistress.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] “There are four things which are little on the earth,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but they are exceedingly wise:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] the ants are not a strong people,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet they provide their food in the summer.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] The conies are but a feeble folk,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet make they their houses in the rocks.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] The locusts have no king,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet they advance in ranks.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] You can catch a lizard with your hands,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yet it is in kings’ palaces.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] “There are three things which are stately in their march,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">four which are stately in going:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] The lion, which is mightiest among animals,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and doesn’t turn away for any;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] the greyhound,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">the male goat also;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the king against whom there is no rising up.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[32] “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">or if you have thought evil,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">put your hand over your mouth.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[33] For as the churning of milk produces butter,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and the wringing of the nose produces blood;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">so the forcing of wrath produces strife.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>Chapter 31</center>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;[1] The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught
    him. <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[2] “Oh, my son!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Oh, son of my womb!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Oh, son of my vows!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Don’t give your strength to women,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor your ways to that which destroys kings.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[4] It is not for kings, Lemuel;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">it is not for kings to drink wine;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[5] lest they drink, and forget the law,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and pervert the justice due to anyone who is
      afflicted.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[6] Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and wine to the bitter in soul:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[7] Let him drink, and forget his poverty,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and remember his misery no more.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[8] Open your mouth for the mute,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">in the cause of all who are left desolate.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[9] Open your mouth, judge righteously,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and serve justice to the poor and needy.”</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[10] Who can find a worthy woman?</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">For her price is far above rubies.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[11] The heart of her husband trusts in her.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">He shall have no lack of gain.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[12] She does him good, and not harm,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">all the days of her life.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[13] She seeks wool and flax,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and works eagerly with her hands.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[14] She is like the merchant ships.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She brings her bread from afar.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[15] She rises also while it is yet night,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">gives food to her household,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and portions for her servant girls.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[16] She considers a field, and buys it.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">With the fruit of her hands, she plants a
      vineyard.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[17] She arms her waist with strength,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and makes her arms strong.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[18] She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Her lamp doesn’t go out by night.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[19] She lays her hands to the distaff,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and her hands hold the spindle.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[20] She opens her arms to the poor;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">yes, she extends her hands to the needy.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[21] She is not afraid of the snow for her household;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[22] She makes for herself carpets of tapestry.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Her clothing is fine linen and purple.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[23] Her husband is respected in the gates,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">when he sits among the elders of the land.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[24] She makes linen garments and sells them,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and delivers sashes to the merchant.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[25] Strength and dignity are her clothing.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">She laughs at the time to come.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[26] She opens her mouth with wisdom.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Faithful instruction is on her tongue.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[27] She looks well to the ways of her household,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">and doesn’t eat the bread of idleness.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[28] Her children rise up and call her blessed.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Her husband also praises her:</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[29] “Many women do noble things,</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but you excel them all.”</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[30] Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain;</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">but a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be
      praised.</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[31] Give her of the fruit of her hands!</span><br>
    <span class="line indent0">Let her works praise her in the gates!</span><br>
