World is not (and it will not be if it continue this way) a perfect place. Interesting document, thank you for sharing it and this blog post.\n\nYes, offering a service for a financial fee might very well be the future of law enforcement this century, certainly in 'The West' at least. I've made some cursory research these past 10 years & it would seem a number of European countries are very keen to introduce so-called 'Super Max' prisons but they're hindered by European human rights law, how frustrating for them :( \n\nOf course we know GCHQ provides a contract to the NSA & also funding for police forces in a number of European countries is being scaled-back creating instability due to increased crime levels (UK, France, Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Spain to name a few). \n\nAnother prominent case is the UK, where lethal knife crime & flagrant acid attacks in London have sky-rocketed in 2018. \n\nIt will be interesting to follow what happens next. Will the formula of problem-reaction-solution be applied to solve the issue of record-breaking violent crime across Europe?\n\nPerhaps this might lead to the European human rights law being amended, to pave the way for the introduction of privatized 'Super Max' prisons, a la the USA? \n\nTime will tell !",
