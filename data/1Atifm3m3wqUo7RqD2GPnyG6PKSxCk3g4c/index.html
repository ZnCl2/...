				<p>I managed to go a whole year without updating this zite.  I didnt forget about it though.  Just checking in, i doubt anyone ever looks here anymore. If you're reading this, hi! </p>

				<p>Hi, i recently discovered the language "Esperanto" and i think it's pretty cool.  If you dont know what it is, its a language that was designed to be a lingua franca or common language so people can communicate easier and more effectively.  It is not meant to be a persons first language, rather a second language that is easy enough to learn that many people will learn it.  It was designed to be easy to learn and it is very logical in its structure.  I think that this is something that we should somehow incorporate into zeronet so that more people can communicate with each other.  We should create a page for esperanto on zerotalk and other sites that are very common on zeronet so that knowledge and use of the language spreads.  Communication is a key part of human success and being able to communicate with more people will grow this community and bring new ideas to it as well.
					<br></br>
				Saluton, mi lastatempe malkovris la lingvon "Esperanto" kaj mi pensas ke ĝi estas sufiĉe bonega. Se vi ne scias kio ĝi estas, ĝi estas lingvo kreita por esti franca lingvo aŭ ofta lingvo por ke homoj povu komuniki pli facile kaj pli efike. Ĝi ne celas esti unua lingvo de homoj, sed dua lingvo, kiu estas sufiĉe facila por lerni, ke multaj homoj lernos ĝin. Ĝi estis desegnita por esti facile lernebla kaj ĝi estas tre logika en sia strukturo. Mi pensas, ke ĉi tio estas io, kion ni iel inkluzivu al zerono, por ke pli da homoj povu komuniki unu kun la alia. Ni devus krei paĝon por esperanto ĉe nulkesto kaj aliaj retejoj tre oftaj sur nulo por ke diskonado kaj uzado de la lingvo disvastiĝu. Komunikado estas ŝlosila parto de homa sukceso kaj povi komuniki kun pli da homoj kreskigos ĉi tiun komunumon kaj alportos novajn ideojn al ĝi.

		<p>Welcome to 2019, i started this zite back in 2015 and im surprised that im still here today.  zeronet hasnt caught on with the masses yet but i am certain that eventually it will.  This is the best implementation of website hosting for a large number of reasons.  With the new laws and regulations passed by various governments around the world since the inception of zeronet 4 years ago, zeronet is the only way to preserve the internet as we know it.  I hope the community continues to develop this monumental software for years to come.

			<p> One of the things that the owner of a zite has consider is how to make thier zite attractive enough to people that they seed thier zite.  When i created this zite zeronet was still relatively new and zites were kinda scarce so i suspect that people seeded my zite because zeronet was new and they wanted to help the community grow and they had no reason not to seed.  Now that zeronet has been around for a few years i have noticed that my seeders have dropped significantly. I think this is due to people needing space for other zites, they are not interested in my zite, and also my zite is only listed in one search engine, kaffiene search, where its listing hasnt been updated since 2015 and it is tagged as #dead.  In my time exploring the zites on zeronet i have come across a lot of zites that offer no real use to most people.  they are typically jsut blogs, some of which havent been updated in years. i think that blogs are an important part of zeronet because they allow people to have thier own personal space to create whatever they want so i am in no way against them.  I do however think that they are not something that will drive lots of interest in zeronet.  I think that in order to become more popular zeronet needs more zites that can be interacted with by a visitor.  My zite of couse is just a blog that i try to make interesting by posting my thoughts and things that i find interesting but i would like to add things to it that make it more useful and more interesting.  one of the things that i struggle with in doing this is that any interaction with a zite must be accomplished with javascript and i do not have much knowladge of javascript.  I also do not have any good ideas that i could implement in my zite. If anyone actually reads this and has any thoughts or ideas feel free to zemail me at pineapples@zeroid.bit.  im not sure if my zemail works or not because the echobot never replies to my test emails and i dont have anyone to email to see if it works but its worth a shot.

			<p> Originally i wanted to make a wolfram alpha clone for zeronet that had some of the functionality of wolfram alpha but could be run in the browser offline like any other zite but i soon realized that this was a huge task to get even something as simple as a quadratic formula calculator to work let alone all the other things wolfram alpha can compute.  during my research to make this wolfram alpha clone i discovered a better solution which is the free open source mathematics software called SageMath.  it can solve complex equations just like wolfram alpha but it does not require an internet connection like wolfram alpha does.  i can imagine this would appeal to zeronet users because first of all its free and open source and secondly there is no need to connect to a central server to use it.  SageMath is not a complete replacement for wolfram alpha because it only focuses on math and wolfram alpha can do a lot more than just math but i think it is a very valuable tool nontheless. if your interested <a href=http://www.sagemath.org/index.html> Here </a> is the link to the SageMath website.

			<p>I wanted to learn some java script so after like 5 hours of reading tutorials and trying things i finally made <a href="ZeroCalc/quadratic.html"> this </a>. Its a quadratic formula calculator and its very basic but it works. for some reason insead of a whole number like "2" it might say "1.9999999999" and im sure there is an explanation and solution but im just proud of myself for getting it to mostly work. I need to add an option to re run the program and id like to make it look nicer and not use alerts so thats what i will do with it next.

				<p> Hello. I made a zite based on something interesting i saw a while back. someone made a zite and published the private key so that it could
				be publicly edited. thier mistake was to publish the key on the site itself and appatently someone thought it
				would be funny to replace the site with a giant FBI logo saying the site had been siezed or
				something and they also deleted the key so that no one else could edit it.
				Im going to make a site for the purpose of public editing but im gonna post the key here
				so no one can take over it completely.  so heres the link to the site</p>
				<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:43110/1LZu93Ka66uzgmCiTyxFnfSc3i5XcwrHsB"> http://127.0.0.1:43110/1LZu93Ka66uzgmCiTyxFnfSc3i5XcwrHsB</a></p>
				<p> and here's the private key          5JEifzCWDPJV4jYCsv7SbTwqSp5Hc3eLE6W9ycFwxURGfRn5weN                        Enjoy ;) </p>
