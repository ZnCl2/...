So it will take a while until they will have implemented them.\n\nBut there is also .flif (free lossless image format). It's even better than webp. But it is still in development. There is however a similar tool (aka javascript converter) like webpjs for it.\n\nMaybe we could ask some professionals in the forums if they know how to include the scripts?\nThere is a .js file in the blog-page folder. Maybe if the script would be included in there it could work?",
