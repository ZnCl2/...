I see that as one of the main uses of a proxy: to get a general list of sites/peers that'd be much larger than what my own machine is capable of pulling.\n> Also, having the start page have a huge list of sites makes it more friendly to newbies who might not know their way around ZeroNet. Seems like a weird decision. I can understand lacking newsfeeds and that sort of thing though.\n\n1. There's a reason why 0list is at the top of the larger sites, many people announce their sites there. The connected sites list was getting unwieldy and was many screens of sites, so I decided to simplify it, especially so it doesn't daunt new users.\n\n2. Newsfeeds work fine if you're logged in ;) (and they'll work better once I get persistence done)",
