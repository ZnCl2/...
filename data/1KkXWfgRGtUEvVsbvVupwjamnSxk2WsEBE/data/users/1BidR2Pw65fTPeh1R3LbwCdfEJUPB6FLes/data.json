I'll document soon how-to do this in Debian.Do you also use this: http://127.0.0.1/1LtvsjbtQ2tY7SCtCZzC4KhErqEK3bXD4n/ ?\n\n1. Will do right now!\n2. Yup, updating every 5 minutes through `cron`",

Works fine with a dualcore VPS with ~1500MB RAM.\n\nUnfortunately, ZeroNet is also very hungry of RAM.\n\n    zmccorkle@ZeroNet:~$ cat /proc/9946/status\n    Name:   python\n    ...\n    VmSize:   699912 kB\n    ...",
