Cody was very drunk. He tripped on the last few steps leading down into the basement and nearly faceplanted; he managed to grab the railing and steady himself before he could slop more than a little of his drink on himself. He’d never been this drunk before, and the jury was still out on how much he liked it. The world seemed to be swinging back and forth in front of him, face and voices swimming into and out of his perception. 

The party had not been Cody’s idea, nor was he normally the sort to go out on a Friday night, preferring his video games and comics to beer and bad dubstep. But his friend Garret had pestered him to come to this one, evidently because some girl he liked was also attending. But then Garret had vanished shortly after they’d arrived, and Cody had somehow worked his way through…how many drinks? He stared at the cup in his hand and tried to remember. At least five. Six? More? He’d had some of the jungle juice being served up in the kitchen as well, out of a large Gatorade cooler. In short, he was shitfaced.

Cody surveyed the dark basement as best he could. At the far end was a DJ and a keg, and people filled the space nearly shoulder to shoulder, most dancing. It was the first warm day of the year, and turnout was epic; the house was almost full and kids crowded the front and back yards. High school parties were a big deal in Woodcrest, and the Student Council kids who threw them all had huge houses in the gated community at the north end of town. 

He was about to give up and go back upstairs when Cody spotted the reason he had come down to the basement: Alanna Forrester, his crush for almost three years. She was talking with a group of her friends maybe twenty feet away, all kids Cody knew from his classes, drinking from a cup like his. She was dressed for the weather, in a t-shirt and capris, and all of her gorgeous muscled curves were on full display. Cody had been ready to go home after Garret had ditched him, but he couldn’t bring himself to leave after seeing Alanna was there. As he’d gotten drunker, he’d gotten less subtle about following her around the party.

You should go talk to her, a little voice slurred in his head, but Cody ignored it. His eyes remained fixed on Alanna’s hard, ripped body, his gaze traveling from her powerful arms, over her wide chest, down her massive legs and then back up. Every muscle was flawless. Cody couldn’t imagine a more perfect body. 

As he ogled her, Alanna suddenly excused herself from her friends and began walking towards him. Cody had no time to disappear into the crowd. Even if he did, he was way too drunk to do much more than register her movement before she was standing in front of him. He noticed she’d changed her hair; her formerly long brown locks were now short and choppy, and she’d dyed it a very deep blue. This close he could also see that they were basically the same height; in his head she was always taller than him.

“Hello, Cody,” she said. Cody must have reacted to the use of his name, because she followed with, “Did you think I didn’t know who you were? You’re in all my major subject classes, you know. You might be quiet, but you’re not invisible.” She crossed her arms, and Cody stared at how her chest flexed. “You’ve been following me around all night. You want something?” She fixed him with an expectant look from behind her glasses.

Cody didn’t look at her when he answered, he was too busy ogling her muscles. He rarely got to see her body this close up, and he was having a very hard time with how full and big her arms were, even when she wasn’t flexing. 

“Yeah…I want to feel your arms. They’re so big and muscular…” A split second later he realized what he had just said and looked back at her, face burning, mortified.

Alanna raised one eyebrow. “Oh really?”

“Oh fuck! Oh God, I’m so sorry, I just—”

“Shh! Don’t worry about it. People ask me that all the time.” She smiled and Cody’s stomach dropped; it was wide and friendly and all for him, and then she casually flexed her arm and Cody forgot all about the smile. Alanna’s bicep was huge, it filled her t-shirt sleeve and pushed it back, and her forearms were thick and strong looking. “Go for it,” she said.

Cody reached out and caressed her muscle, tentatively at first, and he had to stifle a moan at how hard it felt, like warm smooth stone. As it was he made a small whine before he bit his lip, hard, to quiet himself. There was a constant swooping feeling in his stomach, and he was so aroused it was making him feel a little sick. He’d fantasized about this exact occurrence so many times, and it was infinitely better than anything he had ever imagined.

Alanna pumped her arm a couple times and the fire in Cody’s abdomen roared higher. “You know, I was wondering if you’d admit it,” she said.

Cody was so focused on her arm that he almost didn’t hear. “What do you mean?”

“It’s all over your face. No one looks at me like that if they don’t think it’s hot. You really like muscular girls, don’t you Cody?”

“Oh God, yes,” Cody replied. “All those hard, gorgeous curves…it’s the hottest fucking thing. There are a couple girls at school I could name, with these big calves and thighs, it drives me crazy. And you…um…” He fell silent, his drunken rambling quashed by his desire to not make a fool of himself in front of his crush.

“What about me?” Alanna cocked her head and put her hands on her hips, though she seemed honestly curious.

“You’re…perfect,” Cody said quietly. “You have the biggest arms of any girl in school, and you’re just so muscular, and when I look at you it aches, so much, especially when I think about what all those huge, strong muscles could do to me…” He trailed off, drinking in her physique once more, thinking vaguely about what he had just confessed but not overly bothered by it.

“And what is it that my muscles could do to you, Cody?” Alanna smiled, a little threateningly, and Cody almost couldn’t believe it. No fucking way.

“I think you know,” he said in a small voice.

“True.” Her smile was definitely threatening now. “I guess now I should ask if you want to know, too.”

“W-what?” Cody was sure he knew what that meant, but he was still in a state of shock that the girl he liked was also into kinky muscledomme stuff.

“Don’t play dumb with me, boy.” Alanna stepped closer, putting Cody against the wall, leaving inches between them. Cody could smell something subtly fruity on her; he realized it was her breath. She was drunk, too. This realization made him at least twice as excited. “I want you to come upstairs with me, obviously. I know where the guest rooms are in this house. Also it’s not a request.” She grabbed his wrist in an iron grip and pulled him through the crowd.

Cody’s heart pounded as she led him upstairs and then upstairs again, down a hallway with cream carpeting and unfamiliar family pictures to a closed door, which she opened and pushed Cody through. He had a moment to take in a modest room with a double bed, wardrobe, side table, and a chest of drawers with a TV on it, before he heard Alanna shut the door. He turned to look at her.

“I gotta say I’m kind of surprised.” She walked towards him, almost swaggering, her hips swaying from side to side. Cody couldn’t help imagining her gorgeous, steely ass, how big and round it was… “This is the first time a boy from school has been into my muscles like this. There are a few jock girls I know that like it, but the boys are always, You look like a man, blah blah blah.”

Cody shook his head. “They’re wrong. You’re one of the prettiest girls I know. And your muscles are fucking amazing.”

Alanna smiled. “Well, I know you think so, but thank you anyway.” She began preening, rubbing her arms, running her hands over her chest and stomach. “So when you fantasize about me, what am I usually flexing?” When Cody sputtered in embarrassment, she said, “Don’t try to deny it. You already basically said it.” She casually flexed her arms and Cody whimpered a little. “Is it my biceps?” She pumped both arms a few times. “Big, huh?” She looked at Cody and grinned smugly.

“They’re…awesome,” was all Cody could manage.

“Or maybe my legs?” Alanna stretched one leg out, to show off her softball sized calves and the way her thighs bulged in her jeans. “You said you think about what I could do to you. You know how strong my thighs are?” She smirked, leaving the rest to Cody’s imagination, and he couldn’t help but think of his mom Tess, and how huge and strong her legs were, and how incredible it had been to be crushed by them.

“Hey, boy.” Cody was snapped out of his daydream by Alanna’s sharp voice. When he looked up, she beckoned him closer with one finger, smirking and looking at him like he was prey. “Come here.”

He didn’t hesitate to do as he was told, approaching her as much as he dared. He sucked in a breath as Alanna simply reached down and cupped her hand over his crotch, lightly squeezing the bulge in his pants. “Someone’s excited,” she said, amused. Cody gulped, his heart pounding. His hands quivered; he wanted so badly to touch every part of her, but he was scared of what she might do to him. He wasn’t sure if this was motivation for or against touching her.

Alanna abruptly grabbed Cody’s ass, groping him hard and pulling him flush against her. He gasped; her body was so firm, hard and unyielding, and he felt his cock straining in his jeans. Alanna noticed his discomfort.

“What’s wrong, Cody? Are you having some trouble?” She let out a little giggle, and Cody tried to push himself away, but it was useless. Her hold on him remained unbroken, and he shivered at how effortlessly she had taken command of his space, how impossible it was to resist her, just how much stronger she was than him. 

“P-please…” he whispered, though he honestly had no idea what he was asking for. Alanna seemed to realize this.

“What? You want me to stop?” She let him go with a look like ‘you asked for it,’ and Cody whined. He briefly thought about how this girl had turned him from a mature, articulate young man (certainly more than most of his peers) into the complete mess of arousal and pathetic noises he currently was.

“NO! I mean…” He cringed, well aware of how pitiful he must look. Even as drunk as he was, he still harbored fears that his behavior would scare her off.

“I didn’t think so.” She took his wrists, gently this time, though still in a firm enough manner to indicate that Cody had no choice in the matter, and placed his hands on her waist, in turn putting her arms around him. “There. Isn’t that better?” Her voice was thick and husky.

Cody could only nod, biting his lip. He kept trying to look her in the eye, but he found it impossible to do for more than a few seconds. Her gaze was as unyielding as her flesh, and Cody felt like an insect being scrutinized. Even her powerful body didn’t make him feel as small and weak as those gorgeous blue eyes. It was like trying to look on the face of a goddess.

“Can I touch your legs?” Cody asked the question with no prior thought; it simply tumbled from his mouth, as quick as an you want,” Alanna cut him off, shoving him against the wall. “Wow, you’re even skinnier and weaker than I thought.” She poked him hard in the chest, and Cody felt his face burn. “You’re nothing compared to me.” She flexed both arms and grimaced. “Rrr! You wanna compare, little boy?” She smiled and peeled off her shirt. The bra she wore was bikini style and matched her underwear, jet black with dark red trim. Cody could see her nipples were hard. It made him even hotter to think how much this was turning her on. 

“Look at how big and strong I am, Cody.” Alanna started posing for him, showing off her arms, her abs, her chest and back. “Mmm yeah, that feels good…” She pressed her hands together, and Cody watched in awe as her arms rippled, biceps and forearms bulging, her small, perky tits rising on her thick pecs. “Look at these massive biceps. Look how wide I am!” She grinned, striking a lat spread. She leaned in close, pinning him to the wall with her body. The warmth and firmness of her made Cody shudder. Part of him wanted to resist, his deep embarrassment over his fetish simultaneously making him want to escape and also arousing him, but he knew firsthand how strong she was, and how useless that would be, and how pathetically easy it would be for her to overpower him.

“I bet you’d love to feel all these huge, hard muscles crushing you, wouldn’t you boy?” Her voice was right in his ear, smooth and impossibly sexy. Cody gritted his teeth and only just managed not to orgasm again. It was like his wildest fantasies were all coming true: the girl he’d lusted after for years apparently loved all the same kinky shit he did, and now he was alone and drunk with her. 

“Yes, Goddess…please, please Goddess, please let me touch your perfect muscles!”

“Go ahead,” she said into his ear. “Worship me, boy.”

Cody didn’t hesitate. His hands moved over her body eagerly, across her arms and shoulders, over her enormous chest and back, down her sides to her abs, all the while murmuring quietly about how hard she felt, how big and stunning her body was. He kissed her too, her smooth, warm skin like silk against his lips. Alanna flexed for him as he touched her, her muscles bulging, massive and pumped. She showed him her arm, pumping up her bicep slowly, and the sight of her muscle mounding into a hard peak was just too much for Cody; he closed his eyes and whined through his teeth as he climaxed.

“Did you come again?” Alanna’s voice was hard. “Did I say you could do that?!” She grabbed his throat and lifted him up, holding him against the wall. Cody’s face and chest flushed red, especially when Alanna looked distastefully at the now obvious dark stain at his crotch. “You don’t feel pleasure unless I allow it, boy.” She squeezed, her fingers like steel digging into his neck, and Cody gasped.

“I’m…sorry…p-please…forgive me, Goddess.” Alanna smiled cruelly at his attempts to talk. “You’re so…incredible…” He sucked in a breath, “I can’t…help it…”

“I suppose I can forgive you.” Alanna lowered him down, but didn’t release his throat. “But now I need to punish you.”

“Oh God, yes yes yes, please punish me Goddess, please put me in my place! I’m a pathetic bitch, I need to be shown my place—” 

Alanna cut him off with a hard slap. “Shut up! Your whining is disgusting.” She pulled him to her, forcing his neck into the crook of her elbow, and began to choke him. Cody felt her muscles swelling against his neck. His hands pulled at her arm, but it was a token effort; he had no hope of dislodging her hold. 

“You know, I know exactly how to knock you out, Cody,” Alanna said. Her tone was light, as if she was talking about school, or the weather. “All I have to do is cut off the blood flow to your brain. If I squeeze here, just so…” Cody made a strangled noise and spots danced in front of his vision. He felt himself fading, but Alanna released him before he could pass out. He fell to his knees, coughing, but before he could recover, Alanna had picked him up and pushed him against the wall, holding his wrists together painfully behind his back, her other hand reaching around him to rub his crotch. Cody whimpered as he felt himself grow hard for the third time.

“I can’t believe how weak you are, Cody! I can do anything I want to you, and you’d just take it!” She tightened her grip on his wrists and pushed him into the wall harder, and Cody cried out. “So pathetic. But you’d never be able to stop me anyway, even if you tried. I probably outweigh you by thirty or forty pounds, and it’s all muscle. I’m so huge and strong, and you’re just a little bitch, hehehe.” She put her lips close to his ear. “Of course we both know that you don’t want to fight back, do you boy? You love being my plaything. Weak little nothing…”

Cody was going out of his mind. Her fingers on his crotch were possibly the most arousing thing yet, and he could think of nothing but how incredible it felt to be dominated by the one person he’d always fantasized about being dommed by. The alcohol helped, too. “Please Goddess, take me, use my weak little body for your pleasure! I need it, Goddess, please…”

He heard her breathing, heard how it grew deeper and more urgent, and knew she was getting off on this, too. “You want that, boeven before she began slowly rolling her hips against his in a measured, tortuous rhythm. “Thank you Goddess, oh fuck…thank you, you’re so perfect…”

“I know, boy. But your praise is appreciated.” She rested her hands on his stomach, her pelvis moving smoothly back and forth, and Cody gritted his teeth, almost writhing under her. “Look at me, boy. Don’t you want to watch your Goddess show off her flawless body?” 

He’d had his eyes closed, but now Cody raked his gaze over Alanna’s physique, taking in all her huge, perfect muscles once more. She flexed for him, arms, shoulders, back and chest, abs. He could feel himself getting closer to orgasm very fast. “Goddess, I…aaaannnnnnng…I’m gonna…”

“Not yet you’re not. You’re my bitch, Cody, and you’ll come when I say. Just keep your eyes on me.” Alanna grimaced and struck a powerful crab flex. Her biceps flexed bigger than ever, hard round peaks above her beefy forearms. Her perky tits lifted up and out over her bulging pecs, and her abs hardened, rippling. “I love this pose. Don’t I look fucking awesome?” 

It took all of Cody’s willpower to keep from climaxing. He imagined Alanna’s tight t-shirt splitting open over all those huge muscles. “Please, Goddess, I can’t…” He gritted his teeth. “I’m so weak, your body is too much for me, please…”

“Very well,” she said. “Come for your Goddess, boy.” She smiled at him, and Cody’s body gave up at that moment, his cock throbbing as he came, and he let out a high pitched squeal.

He felt Alanna ride him for maybe thirty seconds more until she came too, moaning loudly, though not as loud as him. When she was done she sat and looked down at him, smirking, arms crossed, breathing hard and covered with sweat. She looked gorgeous.

“Well?”

Cody, chest heaving and feeling like he might melt into a puddle any second, looked back at her. “Well what?”

“Are you gonna thank me? I’m pretty sure I just made all your sexiest dreams come true.” She was smiassment rolled through him. “It feels…I mean…shit, how did you know?”

“You’re not sneaky, Cody. I see the way you look at me in class. It’s not just lust. You really like me.” She didn’t say it accusingly or unpleasantly; she simply stated it as a fact. Which it was.

“I mean…yeah, okay. It feels awesome.” He flopped back on the bed. “I can’t believe you’re into the same stuff as me.”

“To be honest, I…didn’t really think much about it. It just seemed like the thing to do.” Alanna shrugged, looking a little embarrassed herself. 

“But you…just went right to it!” Cody took another gulp of water. “I don’t get it.”

“Hehehe. Don’t get me wrong, it was so much fun. I’d just never thought about that before. Kind of made it up as I went along.” Alanna’s expression turned mischievous. “I wouldn’t mind doing it again sometime, either.”

“Uh, ah,” was all Cody could say to that. “You make it really, really hard to talk to you.”

“It’s just fun pushing your buttons. I can’t help that.” Her voice was smug.

Cody made an exasperated noise. “So…what now?”

“We could go back downstairs. Dance a little. Do the social thing.”

“Dance? I don’t really dance.” Cody winced.

“That’s not the point, Cody. The point is that you get to dance with me, which I’m sure you won’t object to, and I want to dance with you. Got it?” As she said this, Alanna crawled towards him on the bed, until Cody was leaning back on his elbows, her arms on either side of him and her face inches away.

“Yeah,” he replied, smiling. “Yeah, I got it.”
