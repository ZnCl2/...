<h3>futa on male rp via omegle</h3>
<article>
[WARNING: Long and slow at the start. Futa on male, both students, in the closet of their school.]

Stranger: Hey, I'm Michael.

You: Hey. Looking to RP?

Stranger: Yeah, are you?

You: Definitely! I'm currently obsessed with futanari so I'd LOVE to do something with that.

You: How about you?

Stranger: -giggles- You wanna play one? Or...?

You: Don't mind.

Stranger: Please? If you're really not picky.

You: I'll give it my best shot.

Stranger: Okie

Stranger: Mind if I ask your age/appearance?

You: I'm Charlotte Dunois. Aged 17, I'm a high-school student. I'm blonde, petite but fit. I'm about 5'3. I'm quite shy and timid (for reasons completely unrelated to what you're thinking... thank you very much) but once you get to know me I'm very affectionate. (What's your name?)

Stranger: I'm Michael.

Stranger: Wh-whoa now... What reasons did you think I was thinking about?

You: Well, Michael, let's say I'm *DEFINITELY NOT* timid and shy because at birth I was born with both sets of genitalia and it's caused me serious self-confidence issues.

Stranger: I wasn't thinking that was why you were timid...

You: Good, good.

You: I can't really do a good job of making friends throughout school. I suppose I never really got the hang of it - never felt like I fitted in.

Stranger: I'm... Kind of the same way.

You: I'm starting to feel a bit like we have something in common now, so I can relax a little bit. "Really?"

Stranger: I nod, smiling a bit. "Yeah, really. Never really had people around me."

You: "Well, well I'm glad that you decided you wanted to be around me. What made you walk over to me and talk to me?" (scene: we're on a bench in the school caffeteria that's fairly out of the way. You didn't come and sit next to me because you had to, you wanted to)

Stranger: My cheeks flare up red. "Honestly...? I thought you were cute, and I wanted to know why someone as pretty as you was all alone over here." I look down at the floor, carefully studying the tile.

You: It's now my turn for my face to flush as red as a tomato. I get a bit panicky when people compliment me because I'm really not that used to it. "That's... very nice of you to say." I can't even make eye contact with you, staring intently into my sandwich I wasn't even really eating. I briefly look you up and down a bit in a way I think is subtle but you totally notice. "You're... kind of handsome, too. Yeah." I nod.

Stranger: My cheeks mirror the color of your own. "Th-that's nice of you to say... But you don't have to say stuff like that just because I did... I meant it." I glance over at you again. "But maybe I'm being too forward. Sorry."

You: "It's not that you're being too forward. I'm just not use to boys interacting with me. You're fine, don't worry, you know, you're keeping your hands off me and whatever." I pause, "at least you haven't touched my butt or something yet. There's this guy, David, who keeps doing that whenever he sees me. Probably another reason why I'm a bit scared of boys. Sorry. I'm going on about nothing... Do you want to tell me about you a bit maybe?"

Stranger: I lean in and whisper. "I'm not touching because I don't want to. I just... Shouldn't." I sit upright again, munching on a potato chip and flash a smile at you. "Is there something you wanna know?"

You: I'm a little bit scared by his leaning in and intimately whispering but I'm sure that's normal. I should probably enjoy it, and besides he seems gentle. Actually I don't think I disliked that as much as I was expecting to. He smells quite nice. "I, I don't really know what to ask... What do you do for fun, you know, what interests you?"

Stranger: I blush and look down. "Really, I'm pretty much just a bookworm. I read a lot, draw sometimes." I just keep trying to focus on my lunch, noticing how uncomfortable you seem to be now. "What about you?"

You: It seems like he really respects me and really wants to be gentle with me. I can't help but find that rather endearing, despite my prior issues. "I like books too! I've read, uh, A Song of Ice and Fire recently. It's the one that got made into a TV series, Game of Thrones? It's really... well I suppose it's weird in some ways because it's very unconventional." Heh. Like me. "Heard of it?" My eyes light up and I make eye contact now, enthused by the idea of common interests.

Stranger: I nod. "Yeah, heard of it. I might've seen the show a few times, but don't really super follow it. It was cool though. I've got a friend who read quite a few of those."

You: "Cool. That we have something in common makes me feel a lot more comfortable around you, Michael." I smile and look you up and down a few times, quite content with your physical appearance. Definitely handsome, but the gentleness demonstrated thus far is attracting me more than anything else. My cheeks blush a little bit again.

Stranger: I look over at you, flashing a smile and noticing your wandering eyes. "You... Umm... You see something you like?" My cheeks light up like a stop light and I bite my lip, giving you a look over before looking back at my lunch, taking another bite.

You: I blush heavily and look away, back to my sandwich. "I... I wasn't looking! Well, maybe I do see something I like..." face is bright red. "But I wasn't looking!"

Stranger: I lean over again to whisper. "Maybe if you wanna look... It'd be okay if I did?"

You: That sounds fair. It wouldn't be nice of me to say no. Besides, he's so handsome in fact that it's starting to cause me... y'know... problems in the lower departments so I can't exactly stand up. (I have my bag in my lap so you can't see that part of me just yet). "Yeah, I guess you can look. I hope you, um, like what you see... as much as I do." I wish I could stop blushing and play it more confidently.

Stranger: I let my eyes sneak a peek over at you, trying not to ogle, but looking you up and down a few times. A smile found it's way to my lips as I make eye contact with you. "I'm not sure how much you like what you see, but I think I like what I'm seeing."

You: I start feeling the blood rush down to my groin, and a bit of panic sets in. I haven't really been controlling myself at all since I've been too busy checking out Michael. This is a problem because once I start properly getting hard, there'll be no way I can hide it. This bag in my lap currently covering the growing problem won't be enough soon. "Uh, Michael, listen," I'll just say anything at this point. "I really like what I'm seeing too but... I need to go... uh." I dunno how to do this. "If you're open minded, and I mean /really/ open minded, you can follow me. Don't freak out though." I leave the room through the nearest exit and run as fast as I can to a nearby, secluded spot.

Stranger: I look at you, confused and then a little concerned. This is such an abrupt change in your demeanor. I get up after you do and take your tray to the trash with mine, poking my head out the door to see if I can find you. "Charlotte?" I wander off down the hall, looking for you.

You: I suppose I did run off a little too fast but I'm unsure what else to do - if he sees, I don't want him to freak out and tell other people. But he seems so gentle and nice earlier maybe he'll be okay with it. "I'm down here, uh." I say, sticking my head out of a smaller and darker corridor off the side of the one you're in. "Michael, here." I say a bit louder to make sure you hear me. Maybe one of these doors isn't locked...?

Stranger: I tilt my head, slipping down the side corridor where there's burned out light. "Charlotte, what's gotten into you?" (What're you wearing?)

You: I test the doors, hoping one of them will be open and we can at least avoid anyone who'll walk past. The more private, the better. I test each and every single one in the hallway and I find one that opens an inch but not nearly far enough for us to get through. "I promise I'll explain, if you'll listen. Right now though I need you to listen to me. I have a secret... a big one. I need you to push this door open for me." I guess some boxes have fallen on the other side of the door but ig we can get it open and put the boxes back we'll be safe. I'm too weak though, and too preoccupied hiding this.

You: (I'm wearing this school's standard uniform for girls, which consists of a just-above-the-knee navy skirt, black tights, and a white button-down shirt)

Stranger: I just nod and come over next to you, pushing my shoulder into the door while holding the knob, opening it just a little more, some kind of supply closet. I snicker to myself maybe that's why the light hasn't been replaced, it's in this blocked room. "That looks like enough." I squeeze my way through the doorway, seeing all the boxes that tumbled over. "Can you make it?"

You: I quickly stuff my dick up my shirt, because there's nowhere else for it to fucking go and I don't want it to protrude out of my skirt. Hopefully it's so dark in her he won't notice at least for a bit. I nod, squeezing myself through. The gap's not very big though and the growing problem between my legs actually brushes up against the doorway as I push myself through it. It's a shame, when you're as big as I am, anything stimulates you. "Okay, thank you. Now I need you to help me put these boxes back so nobody can come in here." I quickly bend down and start gathering boxes, that way at least if I'm moving he maybe can't see... but it's growing even more.

Stranger: I just nod, totally confused, but the adrenaline of the situation getting to my head a little. I just help you blockade the door again, pushing boxes back and not paying as much attention to you. "What's this all about?" I look you over again, but still don't notice that out of place bulge. "Is something wrong?"

You: I try to back into a reasonably poorly lit corner of the room, and I'm suddenly thankful that either the light's don't work in this room or they're just off because it means I can maybe prolong my covering it up. But I have to tell him... I take a deep breath, "Okay, first of all thank you for just going with what I've said so far. I *reallu* appreciate you not asking questions and just going with it. The reason why..." I know I can't keep it secret anymore. "I'm a girl, okay? I promise I'm a girl. I'm not lying. You said I was cute and only girls are cute but I *am* a girl." Another deep breath, two in fact. "But at birth I was... born different."

Stranger: I just find a box nearby and sit on it, looking at you, trying to make out your face in the dim corner. "Different?"

You: "It would be easier and faster to show you... Just promise you won't run away? No, don't, because it's fine if you do. But if you do run away PLEASE don't tell anyone about me?" If he agrees, I suppose I won't have any choice but to just come out with it and show him.

Stranger: I just smile at you. "I won't run. It's okay, really. Just take a deep breath, hun." I hop off my seat and try to take a few steps in to hug you.

You: Ohgodohgodohgodohgod. If he hugs me he's just gonna feel it. ...That's not a bad idea. I mean, if I show him by just flopping it out he might be freaked out but I read in a psychology book that people are more accepting of things they've found out for themselves. This could backfire in a big way, and my dick is by no means small at this stage - in fact I'm nearly full length with the tip up to where my DD-cup breasts are, it's not quite in between them but it's not far, and it's as thick as two coke cans together. I take a deep breath and lean into the hug. I whisper into his ear "don't freak out."

Stranger: I just wrap my arms around you tight and hold onto you. There's a brief moment when my eyes go wide, feeling something between us. "Ch-charlotte..." I sway just a little, then look into your eyes. "Is... Th-this what I'm not supposed to freak out about?" I flash a smile, then back away a teensie bit, curious what I bumped into. "Your stomach just feels kind of... Firm."

You: "Yeah, it's this. That firm thing in between us, it's not my boobs."

Stranger: I shake my head. "Those felt pretty soft." I smile, blushing. "N-not that I was trying to feel them or anything."

You: I'm noticing a distinct lack of screaming, crying, and running away from me-ing. Wow. Wasn't expecting that. "So, you're not freaked out by the fact I have a penis basically half as tall as me?"

Stranger: I just gulp, staring at you. "H-half as tall as you?"

You: I laugh. "I'm exaggerating. Right now it's coming out of between my legs - obviously - and it's reaching up to between my boobs. If this shirt wasn't buttoned you would be able to see my glans. Anyway, it's pretty fucking big and the whole reason why I had to leave the room is because I can't exactly hide it when it gets hard... and you got me hard."

Stranger: I blush and step back in, reaching my hands out to undo the top few buttons on your shirt. "I... I did...?"

You: I can feel my not-so-slightly dominant side starting to shine through now, it grows along with my dick I suppose. "Yes, you. I was checking you out, you're exactly my type - gentle, kind, and handsome - and it wasn't long until I started to feel the blood rushing down here." I take a few steps forward, moving into the light so you can see me.

Stranger: My eyes are on your chest as you step forwards. All this talk is making my own bulge grow, but no where near as much as yours did. "I d-didn't even do anything though." My mouth drops a little as I gasp.

You: The tone of my voice, which was previously timid and shy, starts to become more commanding and confident. "When you look that cute, you don't need to really *do* anything, Michael. Now you've got me here and ridiculously hard, what are you going to do with me?"

Stranger: I step forwards and kiss you full on the lips, my hands wrapping around your back and holding on tight, my bulge pressing against the base of your cock.

You: I wasn't expecting that, but I'm not feeling so dominant that I'd like to dish out the slut treatment and start treating this cute boy like a cum dumpster, so I lean into his kiss and start exploring his tongue with mine. I rub basically my entire length up against his chest a little bit, it really gets in the way but he seems to like it...

Stranger: I blush, kissing you back, harder. My tongue teases against yours as it slides into my mouth before I pin it to the roof of my mouth, rubbing along the underside as my hands rub up and down your back, soft moans escaping my lips into yours.

You: You've got my mouth preoccupied, so I'm only left with one way to communicate that I'd like you to direct your hands to another part of me - there's this thing I've just always been able to do where I can tense the muscles in my dick and make it throb on command. So, with my shaft rubbing up against your chest and your pectoral muscles, I make it throb nice and hard. My hands are free, so I clumsily unbutton my top. Now, if you were to move away, my dick would flop out.

Stranger: My hands hold onto your hips as I break the kiss, leaning back just a little as you half your top half-unbuttoned. I glance down at your chest, blushing deeply.

You: Now I've got my mouth back I intend to run it. "I don't know where you've really been expecting this to go, but my dick doesn't stimulate itself." I put my hand on your chin and lift your head so you're looking into my eyes. You seem to like this, so I'll keep it going. "So, what are you going to do?"

Stranger: I shake my head out of your finger's nudge and kiss your tip, letting out a soft moan against it. My hands grab yours and put them on my pants, smirking against your tip and letting my tongue flick out against your cum slit while I keep eye contact with you.

You: "Listen, Michael, maybe you don't get it or I haven't made it clear enough but I don't really feel like pleasuring you right now..."

Stranger: I look up at you. "J-just touch me... Please? I'm not saying I'm gonna take my focus off you... I just want you to see too..."

You: I have a soft spot for men who otherwise look very manly, but beg when they see something they want. "Why not?" A little pleasure for you now might make sure you give me lots of pleasure a little bit later. "Keep playing with my dick and definitely keep looking at me while you do it." I love that puppy dog expression. My hands go for the zipper on your trousers and it only takes me a second before I've got your trousers around your ankles, rubbing your dick through your underwear.

You: (You might want to describe your own dick size here)

Stranger: (Oh? You don't have some idea? ;3)

You: (No, and it's best for me to not guess, so I don't insult you~)

Stranger: (I won't take it as an insult, promise.)

You: (You're a bit above the average male in both width and length. 7 long, and wide enough to fill out a girl in a very satisfying way, I'd imagine. Other girls my age would probably even say you're big, but compared to my literal monster cock it's kinda pathetic.) "Is this all you've got?

You: No! That was rude. Yours is fine. It's just... you're a lot smaller than I am. But I'm a freak and you're normal."

Stranger: I blush deeply, feeling your hand grab me. "Y-yeah, that's all I've got." I smile at you. "A lot smaller..." I bite my lip and lean in to kiss your tip hard, opening my lips to spread them around your head, leaning further down while my hands continue to unbutton your top.

You: I know when I masturbate I like a firm grip so that's exactly what I do to you, occasionally pausing to spit on my hand to lube you up. There's no harm to giving you a little pleasure, I think to myself. And it'll make you moan onto my dick in a way that just feels fantastic. "Ooooooooh fuck~, keep licking the head for now. Pay special attention the very tip where I'm gonna cover you in cum later." I stop myself, cover my mouth a little, and then show you a devilish grin... "Did I perchance say that out loud?" Now you know my plans for you... well, some plans of many...

Stranger: I yelp from how firm your grip is, pushing my lips further down in an effort to stifle it, my tongue still prodding against your cum slit while I bob back and forth, letting out long, drawn-out moans on your flesh as I rock my hips a little. I look up at you when you say that, my cheeks somehow turning deeper red. "Y-yeah, you did..." I mumble through your cock as I start to suckle, feeling something slick and thick coating my tongue.

You: "Aw, c'mon, a little bit of pain never hurt anyone. I know you're enjoying this, anyway." It's now my turn to let out cute girly moans while you work the tip of my dick. "God, that just feels so good... You have a very talented mouth and an equally talented tongue, Michael. I'll be sure to enjoy it thoroughly." As if to punctuate my point precum starts to drip out of the tip. "I'm very difficult to make cum, I should warn you about that, but you just seem so eager to please that you shouldn't have much of an issue..." I giggle evilly, and move my hands from your dick to your balls - which I'm very gentle with.

Stranger: Fearing another firm grip, I jump as you touch my balls, pushing my lips further down on your cock, bobbing up and down faster, suckling harder as I feel the need to gulp from all that precum filling my mouth. I keep eye contact with you the whole time, bobbing faster and faster, trying to take more until my tongue can't reach your slit anymore.

You: The sound of you gulping makes me giggle, "if you think that's a big load, wait until you get my actual cum~" I'm just teasing you now. I gently rub your balls, not at all sorry for how rough I was with your dick, but wanting to make you feel good all the same. "I wonder if having your balls played with feels as good for you as it does for me... Why don't we find out?" I lift up my skirt and underneath you can see my balls, and the elastic waistband of my skirt stretched as my dick is still up along my chest.

Stranger: My hands reach down to play with your balls, gently massaging my fingers over the fabric of your panties, cupping and squeezing them softly. My head keeps bobbing and I gulp audibly every now and then, still nudging deeper. My own cock is leaking a little pre as well, a few drops making it to your hand.

You: "Really gently rub your nails up and down my balls. Don't scratch - I'll fucking tear you in two if you scratch - but just do that for me..." I think that an upside to fucking a boy is he *should* know how gentle to be with my most sensitive parts. If he doesn't, I'll punish him. I move my hand off your dick once I feel the droplets of precum splash onto it and I lick your juices off my fingers. Only fair, since you'll be swallowing gallons of mine later. "You don't taste half bad."

Stranger: I blush, mumbling something, but I'm so far down on your cock that it just comes out as completely incoherent moans. My fingertips gently press against your balls, something I'd never thought to do on my own. Then again, like every other part of you, your sack is much larger and has more to scratch at, gently of course.

You: "YES fucking god shit fuck yes fuck", imagine me just letting out a stream of curse words and moans at the euphoric feeling presented by your fingers caressing my balls in a way that feels just so fucking nice I don't want you to ever stop until I think of something else to do with you. As you grab my balls and continue to stimulate the head and first few inches of my dick, I can either sit back and enjoy myself or I can start hinting at what I'd like to do next. I'll go for the latter. I grab your toned butt in my hands, one cheek in each, and grab it firmly.

Stranger: I just suckle harder, looking up at you and holding eye contact as my lips bob further down, gulping harder, louder. My fingers just keep rubbing and scratching at your balls, using the top of my nails, almost petting them as I shiver against you, throbbing harder and my bum tensing up as you grab onto it.

You: An idea pops into my head that I'm gonna waste no time putting into practice. "You're doing such a good job, I'm close to cumming, Michael. Make me cum, and hold a mouthful of my cum in your mouth. If you don't, I'll be really really angry and definitely have to take it out on you." I'm just gonna lean back against the wall for this part and enjoy it as much as possible.

Stranger: I look up at you, your tip pressed into my throat by now, being milked by gulp after gulp as I try to push you deeper, one hand scratching at your balls, the other just gently kneading it. I let out an even longer moan, completely muffled on your cock, just vibrating it.

You: Patience wearing very thin, "I'm going to face fuck you now." I grab your head in both my hands and push down on my dick as hard as I can, until I feel the back of your throat start to rub against the tip. It occurs to me that I'm since large I probably won't be able to get down your throat, but I'm damned if I'm gonna let that stop me from trying. I hold you in place and thrust my hips as best as I can, though it's hard with us both standing and you stooped forward so before long I give up on that and go back to pushing you up and down on my dick. "Relax. It'll make it easier. I'm not taking this out until I've cum, so you may as well make it easy for me to fit this down your throat and just relax. Won't hurt. Much."

You: occurs to me that since I'm this large*

Stranger: I do my best, yelping at the sudden change of pace, and yelped, my hands forgetting your balls and just grabbing onto your hips for support as you shove me down. The first time you pull back I try to push off, to get a deep breath before you yank me back down and make me squeal, muffled on your shaft as you dig deeper and deeper to bury your tip.

You: "Ohhhh fuck that's it. Keep your throat open because I'm gonna fuck it until you cum." I keep one hand on your head to keep you bobbing up and down, I'm using your hair to both give me grip and hurt you a little bit. "Moan more for me." I can feel it building up in my balls, so I use my other free hand to massage them and do the same fingernail trick you were doing. "Just keep this up..."

Stranger: I groan, my throat trying to stay open but I can't help but gulp around you over and over, trying not to gag. I yelp and moan with every thrust, every tug on my hair. My jaw just struggles to stay open to keep my teeth off of you, but you're so big, it doesn't really work.

You: I grab your head and hold you as deep as I can get. You can't move, but you don't want to anyway. I let out one last and particuarly loud moan as the growing sensation in my balls culminates in a fucking shower of cum running down my dick and into your awaiting throat and mouth. I'm breathing heavily and sweating a little bit as I hold you in place and you start to feel my hot, sticky, delicious cum coat your throat. I slowly move myself up and out of your throat, coating every inch of you with delicious cum you immediately and hungrily gulp down. When just my head is left in your mouth and my cum shot starts to end, I use my hand to grab your face, make you look up at me, and say "remember to hold a mouthful."

Stranger: I look up at you, wide-eyed and almost intoxicated from that orgasm, my cheeks bulging as I try to nod, feeling your cock slip out with a wet pop.

You: "That was immensely satisfying, Michael. You're a very good boy, and I can tell you loved my cum. Keep satisfying me like that and I'll be using you *very* often indeed." I pause. "However, I'm not nearly done with you yet. I know you want to get fucked. Get on your knees, open your mouth, and let me get my shaft nice and lubed up using my own cum."

Stranger: I gulp, careful not to take the cum down with it, sliding down to my knees and looking up at you as my mouth hangs open, spilling out onto your cock.

You: I grab the head and plunge it into the pool of cum you've so obediently saved for me. "Truth is, I don't really know how much this will actually lube you up. I hope you've practiced before or something, because I'm just so sick and tired of being gentle with the holes I fuck so I'd like to be really rough with your ass. On your hands and knees, facing away from me, quickly." I move onto my knees so I can fuck you from behind. "Hurry up."

Stranger: I gulp and just turn around, squeaking a little as you kinda push me, so impatient as I bite my lip hard and brace myself, ass swaying side to side. "Like this...?"

You: "Perfect." I waste no time at all getting my head firmly embedded in your ass, and your tightness wraps around me like I've unlocked a fountain of pleasure. I push more and more of myself in, grabbing your shoulders in my hands and pulling you up so I have perfect access to your butt. I push myself in a bit deeper still, about a quarter of the way in. "You're being a good boy, you're doing well, keep it up." I pant between moans and heavy breathing. I'm not lying. I didn't expect your butt to be this fucking tight.

Stranger: I really hope you're enjoying this because right now, all I can feel is a very tight, painful stretching. It feels completely bizarre, not like a normal pain, but still very uncomfortable as you thrust deeper ad deeper. I can hear your breath on my ear as you lift me up, it makes me blush and moan, knowing you're enjoying it so much. "F-fuck...! Charlotte!"

You: "If it hurts now, don't worry, it'll feel better when the head of it rub against your prostate. But also please know you feel incredible for me, and I'm really enjoying myself." I can't really make my dick any smaller but I can at least encourage you with words. I move myself in a bit deeper still, knowing soon you'll be able to feel - hopefully - as good as I do.

Stranger: I suddenly yelp, feeling you thrust deeper and sending bolts of lightning through my insides, especially towards my cock. I can feel it jump and throb as you drill deeper, making me squeal loudly as I collapse into your embrace.

You: I grab you in my arms and pull you up so my breasts rub against your back, and I can just grind my hips into your delightfully tight asshole. God this is good. "I thought your throat was good, but this is out of this world." I kiss and nibble on the skin of your neck, wanting for osme reason to make you feel good. I also move my right hand to your dick and stroke it up and down gently.

Stranger: As you grab my cock, I tense up completely. I throb in your hand, my balls tighten and my ass clenches down on you. I shake my hips, trying to feel more of your hand as you rock into me, but just getting completely lost in all the pleasure.

You: I rub up and down your shaft as fast as I can, enjoying your cute moans that almost sound girly. I like that a lot. "Keep on moaning for me, and also know you can cum whenever you like~"

Stranger: Sometime seems to be keeping me from cumming. I don't know what but I just feel so tensed up that it just keeps me right on the edge as I rock my hips against you, moaning louder and louder.

You: My left hand reaches around your front and gently grabs your balls while my right is still pumping up and down your dick. "These feel very full, Michael. I don't want to stop grinding myself around and enjoying your butt, so this is all I can do to make you shoot out a nice, creamy orgasm. Though I will promise to let you lick it all up after while I watch and masturbate myself? Doesn't that sound good?"

Stranger: I blush, feeling the pleasure mounting more and more until even that incredible tightness makes me throb on your fingers and even against your cock. My ass clenches over and over, milking you as I feel my orgasm wash over me, spilling ropes of thick, hot seed all over your fingers.

Stranger: (I have to go like right now. I got caught up in this with you and forgot to keep track of time. If you have Kik, mine's __________. Maybe I'll see you ahain sometime! Really enjoyed this!)
