<h3>Neon Genesis Evangelion: One Depressing Night</h3>
<article>

Ikari Shinji knew that something "bad" had happened, something that quite possibly threatened and/or was still threatening the safety of his fellow Pilots, but beyond that he was mostly in the dark. Actually, he found as he reflected somewhat cynically on the fact, depressed as usual, this had rapidly become the status quo for his life in general. At least this current incident didn't seem to be the typical heralding of the apocalypse such as an Angel attack. Even better, it seemed no one was expecting him to fix the situation or deal with the consequences.

As far as he understood it, and this was only from interpreting Misato's rushed phone call an hour or two earlier, there had been some sort of experiment involving Eva Units 00 and 02 earlier that day. As per the norm, his own Eva, Unit 01, had been excluded from participation. He harbored no illusions that this was due to concern on his father's part for his own safety rather then the importance of his bioweapon, or else the First Child, Ayanami Rei, would not have been put "at risk". As cold and heartless a bastard as Ikari Gendou was, and as far as he'd abandoned and disavowed knowledge of his son, the dictator of NERV seemed to care only for himself and the enigmatic, albino girl with whom Shinji piloted.

In any case, from what Shinji could gather, the experiment had something to do with increasing the Eva's power while at the same time making them more docile and manageable should they, or perhaps it would better be stated <em>when</em> they next went berserk and out of NERV's control. Something to do with newly developed hormones and chemical messengers designed to target and work upon the Evas' organic systems.

Granted Misato had seemed frazzled and pressed for time, in a rush to give him a quick heads up on the incident before returning to whatever it was she was doing, but it had all sounded to Shinji like bad science fiction. He had actually commented on as much over the phone, which had dragged a scathing remark from his guardian, something along the lines of, "That crazy, blond bitch never knows <em>what</em> she's doing. 0.000000001% chance of success my ass...". After witnessing their aftermath enough times, Shinji had begun to lose some of his admiration for Akagi Ritsuko's work himself.

Apparently, either due to a mistake in calculations, a lack of understanding about the Evangelions, or perhaps the simple fact that Project E's science division had forgotten that the central nervous systems of the Pilots were hardwired into that of the Evas, the hormone treatment had been shunted through the biological channels and delivered to Rei and the Second Child, his apartment-mate Sohryu Asuka Langley instead.

The results had been uncertain, a least at the time of Misato's call, but it was evident that the girls were alive and well, and seemingly without any noticeable bodily harm. The Major had assured Shinji that they'd spend a couple of hours in quarantine, no doubt being poked and prodded from head to toe in an attempt to discover any unforeseen or long-term detrimental effects of the mishap, but that if nothing turned up in the initial testing then the girls would be released to return home. Before rapidly hanging up so as to avoid his protestations, Misato had implored him to "look after" Asuka when she got back.

Which, according to Shinji's estimates and if, god forbid, nothing turned up in their physicals, should be any second now. To say he wasn't looking forward to it would be an understatement. Even at the best of times Asuka was hard to deal with, arrogant, vain, and sometimes just plain mean to boot. He understood on some level that it was a shell she used to prevent herself from being emotionally hurt, just as his own depression and introvertedness worked for him, but that didn't make it any easier to deal with on a daily basis.

Oh, she had her good points to be sure. She was highly attractive, confident, and, dare he admit it, fun to be around when she wasn't putting him down or bossing him around. Despite vehement protestations when pointed out by others, he was also certain that she harbored some more-than-platonic feelings for him, bottled up under pressure as well. The times when he was able to enjoy such positive attributes, however, were rather rare.

When she was worked up about something though, Asuka could be a real nightmare, screaming obscenities and tossing little bits of violence about in tantrums that could last hours. He was sure she'd be in the furthest thing from a peaceful mood after any sort of Eva-related failure, regardless of whether or not she was to blame, to say nothing of the time spent undergoing Ritsuko's often invasive medical examinations.

He sighed, wishing for a moment that he bunked next door to Rei instead, before quickly retracting that notion from the slate of his mind. He had the same issues with his feelings towards the First Child, albeit for entirely different reasons. With her unique looks and intelligence, and the strange bond that he didn't entirely understand which had instantly formed between them and drawn him towards her, Shinji couldn't deny his attraction to the taciturn Pilot. Her aloof, sometimes emotionless behavior, however, as well as the connection she shared with Shinji's father, when coupled with his own emotional constipation, made connecting with her difficult.

Before his mental train of thought could build up more steam he heard the front door slam, derailing it thoroughly. Not one to delay the inevitable, Shinji headed through the living room to greet Asuka at the stoop. Rounding the corner to the entrance he almost bumped straight into her, jumping back just in time. He took in her flaming red curtain of hair, offset by the brilliant blue of her eyes, his own pupils tracing a quick route down her young, school uniform clad figure before she noticed and the situation worsened from the dismal point at which he was sure it was going to start. His gaze lingered a second longer then necessary against both his will and repressed nature. He knew Asuka had a great body for her age, he certainly saw enough of it each day, but was she really already <em>that</em> curvy?

Bracing himself for the explosion to come, he averted his face completely and muttered,"Welcome home, Asuka. Heard you had a rough day." After a second or two passed and he hadn't been slapped, nor heard her break into ranting in mixed Japanese and German, he chanced a glance upwards. She was staring down a bit into his eyes, silently, with a look he couldn't quite place. After an awkward moment spent in this manner, she shook her head as if to clear it and brushed past him towards the kitchen.

"Rough isn't the half of it baka-Shinji," she responded flippantly over her retreating shoulder, in much better spirits, or at least nowhere near as irate, as he'd expected. "Sometimes I wonder if those eggheads from E-Project have any idea what the hell they're doing."

He was about to reprimand her for entering the house without removing her shoes despite his reservations about her mood, she'd been in Japan long enough to know the proper etiquette and customs, when he noticed to his surprise that she'd already taken them off before he arrived at the entranceway. But...but that didn't make sense. They were roughly the same height barefoot, but she'd definitely been gazing <em>down</em> to maintain eye contact a moment ago.

Shrugging it off uncertainly as his error, perhaps due to being tired, he followed her slowly towards the apartment's cooking area. "So you and Ayanami...you're fine right?" he called hesitantly as he went. "They didn't find any problems? I mean, you're home earlier then I expected." This was a lie, but he figured it might prevent any anger she could direct at him for showing open concern.

"To be honest, I don't think they have any goddamn clue <em>what</em> happened to me and wondergirl as a result of today's screw-up" she called back, voice growing more distinct as he approached. "Other then some unpredictable hormone levels they didn't seem to find anything that upset them too much. In any case Akagi's convinced we're not going to die, mutate into monsters, or try to kill everyone around us, so in the end she just said it was pointless to hold us there all night and sent us home."

A note of poorly disguised venom crept into her voice. "Probably was just desperate to start studying her precious Evas, couldn't care less about us." Surprising Shinji again, her tone quickly returned to its mild, almost pleasant attitude from a second or two previously, if not even a touch warmer. He found himself off balance from the atmosphere, highly unusual for the oft volatile and guarded girl he knew.

"Actually, we've been out for a little while, but I got off the train a stop or two before the usual one. I wanted to walk a little bit. Needed to...clear my head a while. Awwww, were you worried about lil' old me Shin-chan?" This last was said in a teasing, but good-natured lilt.

Any protests he was about to make died in his throat as he rounded the corner and passed Pen-Pen's fridge, coming face-to-face with Asuka's well rounded, but tight derriere. She was bent over, leaning into the refrigerator, ostensibly searching for something to drink.

The thing that struck him first was that the free show had to be for his enjoyment. The way Asuka had her rear thrust up in display, not to mention the unnecessary way she was wiggling back and forth, made that much obvious. Likewise was the fact that there was nothing in their icebox save racks of beer and a bottle or two of milk, so needless to say the fiery redhead could easily have made her selection before he arrived.

Following only shortly behind this first realization was the fact that Asuka's ass seemed, well, too big for her britches, to put it mildly. The firm globes were pressing heavily against the fabric of her panties, drawing them taut, her cheeks pressing out through the leg holes on either side. It almost seemed to him as if her behind was spreading outwards as he watched, so slowly as if almost to go unnoticed, devouring the fabric of her underwear deeper into the cleft of her buttocks where it ran around to meet her crotch. He was sure it was just an optical illusion caused by her tush's swaying motion, as was the sound of stretching material, but it sure drew his attention as she'd obviously hoped it would. In either case, it certainly didn't look comfortable.

Perhaps reading his mind, Asuka suddenly straightened and whirled around, hands clasped together behind her back in a mock demure gesture over the folds of her skirt. This also created quite a bit of motion in the chest area of her uniform as those pesky laws of physics caused Asuka's breasts to do wonderful things beneath her heavy uniform top. Once more Shinji, well versed in his friend's body shape, found himself thinking against his will and better judgment that there was more bounce there than there had been previously. Although, he pondered, reflecting on the amount of movement he'd witnessed, that might simply be because she's not wearing a bra.

"Pick your jaw off the floor there Third Child," Asuka teased, not unkindly. "I know being in my presence can be overwhelming, but try to get a hold of yourself, hm?" She turned and headed down the hall towards their bedrooms. "I'm going to get changed, find something good on TV would you?"

He simply stood there, watching her stride away. There was no doubt about it now that he was specifically looking. She was a good few inches taller than he was now, more so than she'd been at the door only a few minutes prior. Likewise, her uniform was taking on a distinctly strained appearance, straps and seams struggling against what looked like a young woman's body cosplaying for some lolita crowd in a deliberately undersized outfit. It was far from the strangest thing he'd encountered since coming to work for NERV, but nevertheless he couldn't understand it. Nor could he fathom Asuka's suddenly flirtatious, almost affectionate, or at the very least stimulated, attitude.

Rather, he wasn't stupid. He knew it had <em>something</em> to do with the failed experiment earlier, with hormone levels and the like. He simply couldn't grasp exactly what he was supposed to do about his fellow Pilot's increasing stature and, he gulped aloud at even the possibility of the thought, her increasing libido. As he had thought only shortly before she'd returned, Asuka was normally hard enough to cope with as it was. Though he knew he was not only getting ahead of the problem, but letting his imagination run wild, the image of a giant, horny Asuka rampaging through the streets of Tokyo-3 sent shivers down his spine.

He was distracted from his reverie by the noises emanating from Asuka's closed door. Some thumps, grunts, and sporadic curses were accompanied by the sound of tearing fabric. Even as he paled and wanted to run, mentally screaming, into a corner somewhere he called out questioningly,"Asuka? Is everything alright?"

"No problems, baka-Shinji," her voice cried back. "Just some minor wardrobe malfunctions! I'll be there in a minute!"

"Okay," he reluctantly confirmed, before heading back into the living room. He had just reached the television, he had always found it best to at least pretend to acquiesce to Asuka's demands, when he heard her door slide open and her footsteps thudding, a bit harder then usual towards him.

Whatever he was going to say caught in his throat when he got a good look at her choice of attire. She had thrown on the plain tank top and short-shorts combo that she sometimes wore when loafing around the apartment, indeed, that she had once worn sleeping next to him shortly after arriving in the city. Always a revealing outfit, it had never looked quite like this.

Even in the few minutes she'd been away from his sight Asuka had added a few inches to her height, and quite a few to her other sizes as well. The tank top, once loose and airy, was now plastered to her form and only covered about half her svelte torso. Her hips flared dramatically out from the bottom of the material, the shirt pulled up to reveal most of her toned midriff. Up higher, her sizeable boobs were mashed together and bulging from the neckline and sides of the flimsy garment, competing against each other in a dramatic struggle for what little room there was remaining. They seemed in danger of flying out of the constraining top at any moment, nipples tenting the fabric noticeably.

He could also see that the ripping sounds he'd heard had been the Second Child forcibly thrusting her legs into the already miniscule shorts, which seemed painted on and which had torn nearly to the waistband exposing nearly all of Asuka's long, tanned legs on both sides. Her tight ass was protruding slightly from the back, complementing the swell of her hips and trim waist, the only facet of her body that hadn't seemed to expand along with the rest of her.  

Definitely welcoming his dumbfounded stare, nay, eating up his attentions, Asuka made no effort to hide the posing and sexy come-on looks she was oozing in his direction. Seeming to prowl past him, making sure to brush her side enticingly against his to get him to turn to follow her, she leaned over to bring her eyes level with his once again. Naturally, as she'd planned, this created a veritable canyon of cleavage within the formerly loose top, ensuring that Shinji's gaze went nowhere near her own.

"What's the matter Shin-chan," she chided him lightly,"Didn't I ask you to find something to watch?"

"Th..there was nothing good on..." Shinji stammered, doing his best to avert his stare. She stood up fully again and placed her hand on her hip. Shinji could practically taste the pheromones baking off her form. Half of him, the rational half, wanting to run screaming from the apartment, maybe spend the night over at Touji's. The other half, the one he'd kept locked away starving in the closet of his soul for the better part of his life, was hoping she'd reach out and make good on some of the promises her hungry gaze was making.

"Really?" she commented, feigning disappointment. "That's too bad. Oh well, there <em>are</em> some other things I can think of doing right now." She licked her lips suggestively and made as if to saunter closer.

Before she could, however, the sound of tearing stitches drew both their attention. Asuka was growing again, Shinji could see it clearly this time. Her strong legs were both lengthening and widening, causing her to inch upwards and outwards while pulling apart what remained of the short's bottom segment. The waistband remained intact, for the moment, but the fabric of the actual clothing was like two veils tantalizingly keeping her ballooning ass and leaking lower lips from view.

Even that didn't seem like it would last long as her swelling hips forcibly drew the elastic band tighter around her sides. Two sets of wide eyes watched as the tank top seemed to shrink around Asuka's increasingly impressive bust, exposing the entirety of her lithe abdomen. He heard her gasp and suck her lower lip into her mouth as her enlarging tits ran out of room and her nipples grated against the inside of the top. Pushing against each other and trapped in the now too-tight prison of cloth drawn around her fleshy spheres, they could only wonder whether the top or bottom would give first.

In actuality it was the sides that failed, due to her upward gain in height the stressed seams around her armpits popped free a stitch at a time, revealing inch by creamy inch of firm boobflesh. Asuka was breathing raggedly at this point, the heaving motion of her breasts not helping the structural integrity of what remained of her outfit.

"Asuka," Shinji heard himself question, sounding more awestruck then he would have liked,"What's happening to you?"

Coming back to herself a bit at the sound of his voice, she brought a likewise spreading hand up to her chest to hold the last of the tank top in place, which only served to mash her still growing breasts out in all directions and finish bursting what few seams of the garment were intact in one go. As an afterthought she did the same with the part of her shorts still covering the rising bubble of her butt.

"It's just like we covered a while ago Shin-chan, you remember don't you?" she winked at him, out of breath but still managing a seductive tone. "Thermal expansion. When something gets warmer, it grows bigger." She shot up one more inch, almost like an aftershock, and the recent growth spurt petered out. Though effectively the size of a "normal" adult, Shinji wagered Asuka and Misato could probably look eye-to-eye if they wanted, her plush figure was one even their comely guardian would have to envy.

"Oooh, and bigger," she added playfully. She turned that predatory gaze back on him and Shinji ironically found his weak, reserved nature fighting viciously against his natural male instinct over whether or not he'd let himself be captured. "And right now Shin-chan, I'm just about as hot as I've ever been in my life."

She brushed past him once more, this time rubbing naked flesh against his side and cheek, making sure to maintain eye contact which forced him to look up to her face and subtly reinforced her increase in size over him. Most of her flowing figure was on display for him, save the parts she was covering up herself, more for effect then out of modesty.

"I'm going to change, Shin-chan. Again," she added with a touch of amusement. "If your trying to decide whether to run away or not, now would be a good time. Your last chance, in fact." She grinned at that and continued past her own door.

Seeing her destination, Shinji called out reflexively,"But Asuka, that Misato's room!"

"I know that, silly!" she called back through the room she'd just entered. "Nothing of mine's gonna fit anymore! Well, nothing of Misato's will probably fit right either, at least not for long. But knowing her, she might have something hidden in here more appropriate to the mood."

The internal struggle still raging within, Shinji went on autopilot, feeling a bit like an Eva himself, and found himself taking slow steps towards the door. He wasn't sure how long he stood there, unable to reach out, turn the knob, and flee into the night, when he once more detected Asuka's footsteps drawing near.

"Still here Shin-cha~n?" she called out in a sing-song voice. "If not, then I'm coming after you!" As she turned the corner into the entryway and Shinji got a good look he felt his breath literally leave his body in a gasp this time, and a silent curse passed his lips.

Asuka had found what must have been some sort of old party outfit of Misato's, and it couldn't have suited her, or emphasized her expanded sexuality, more. It was all done in crimson latex, sleek and shiny, hugging the natural curves of the body poured like liquid within. Thigh-high boots accentuated the inner curve of Asuka's impressive legs and a tight mini-skirt didn't do a much better job of hiding her prominent hips, round ass, and womanly goods any more than the recently destroyed shorts. The main difference was that this was <em>designed</em> to do so, and that made all the difference in the world.

Likewise, her trim abs were still on display, the tan skin drawing the eyes along its curves due to the contrast with the nearly luminescent material. Her boobs were bulging within the latex top, held in firm shape and yet put on delicious display by an open space in the fabric between them. A space that, Shinji noted, had been stretched wider than intended by Asuka's impressive endowments. He didn't even attempt to persuade himself that it was imagination which seemed to see this space pulling minutely wider as Asuka's bust, and size in general, continued to increase.

Both stood there, staring at each other silently for a moment without moving. Shinji actually had the distinct impression that there wouldn't be too many more words exchanged, if any. Rather, he suspected he had but moments before Asuka fell upon him in a sexual frenzy the likes of which even Kensuke and Touji hadn't seen in the numerous pornos they'd invited him to watch with them.

He found his hand clenching uncontrollably as was his habit when dealing with massive amounts of stress. Within his head his welcome mantra had begun, building in volume,"I musn't run away, I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away..."

Before the critical moment could come, however, there came an insistent knocking on the door just behind them. "<em>Thank</em><em>God</em><em>!</em>" Shinji thought to himself in relief,"<em>That</em><em>must</em><em>be</em><em>Misato</em><em>coming</em><em>back</em><em>from</em><em>NERV</em><em>! </em><em>Of</em><em>all</em><em>the</em><em>great</em><em>nights</em><em>to</em><em>come</em><em>home</em><em>early</em><em>!</em>"

Before Asuka could respond, he whirled around and threw open the door. On the threshold stood Ayanami Rei, her ice-blue, cropped hair shining in the overhead light, her piercing red eyes and milky, pale skin tone inadvertently drawing his eye like a magnet as they never failed to do. Her own hungry look matched Asuka's, all the more intimidating, or alluring depending on which side of Shinji's brain you consulted, because she generally showed no open emotion whatsoever.

She was also huge compared to normal, not unlike Asuka, both girls pushing upwards of 7 ft. tall. <em>Unlike</em> Asuka, however, yet very much like herself, displaying her always notable lack of social norms, Rei hadn't seen fit to change in any way following the beginning of her recent growth spurts. Shinji had no doubt she'd remained in her school uniform, having never seen her wear anything other then it and the plugsuit they wore when piloting Eva.

As a result, all that persevered from Rei's wardrobe was a relatively plain set of white panties stretched to their limit across the hills of her hips like a thong, and a commendably durable bra far overtaxed from its usual load by the massive boulders the girl now sported on her chest. He remembered the time he'd come upon her naked in her apartment and had watched her dress. Her respectable B-Cups had comfortably fit inside this poor brassiere at that time, but now they were swollen up and over the wires, ready to pop the insignificant ribbon holding it intact.

Her other features had been equally augmented, and, as she simply walked into the apartment closing the door behind her, causing Shinji to backstep until he bumped against the warm, soft, welcoming surface that was Asuka, he couldn't help but feel dwarfed by these two girls he knew so well and usually saw as equals. Rei approached until she stood inches away and Shinji was properly sandwiched with nowhere to run.

"I'm sorry for the intrusion, Ikari-kun," she simply stated in her calm, quiet voice. "As you are aware there were some...changes brought on by today's experimentation. As a result I feel strongly compelled to 'become one' with someone, though I do not understand it well myself. You were the only one I desired this with, and so I headed here directly from my home."

Shinji meant to point out, or at least ask something along the lines of whether or not Rei had simply gotten on the train, enlarging and mostly naked as she was, but all that sputtered out was," Ayanami...your body..."

"Yes, it's grown quite large," she agreed as if such an observation was the most natural thing in the world. Looking down at herself momentarily, she raised her delicate hands and hefted a tit in each one, squeezing slightly as if to confirm her visual senses matched those of her touch.

Apparently meeting her approval, she sidled closer, experimentally caressing his face and playing with his hair. He noted Asuka had done the same on his other side and had somehow worked her large hand into the front of his pants without him noticing. Quite a feat really. Feeling straight into his underwear, Shinji learned a new definition for the term "inadequate". Asuka didn't seem to mind the size ratio in the least, if the bedroom eyes she was shooting him were any indication. Even so, his face turned glumly towards the carpet.

Asuka chuckled slightly and leaned down to whisper in his ear, "Only you could be emo in this type of situation Shin-chan." She gave his earlobe a small lick and purred appreciatively when he shuddered in response. She then drew up to her full height, taxed latex groaning as her form expanded relentless upwards and outwards, and locked eyes with her chief rival.

"We're not going to have any issues this evening, I trust, Pilot Sohryu?" Rei asked evenly, the faint cock of one eyebrow the only hint as to the amusement she felt.

"Oh, I think I can call a truce just this once," Asuka smiled back, a bit too wide. "There should be enough Shin-chan to go around." Between them, Shinji whimpered slightly, hoping he survived the experience to come. "Besides," she added, a touch of her usual pride shining through as she ran her free hand down her side, noticeably stretching another inch or two higher, her boobs spilling out in a wave through the bottom of the racy top, the skirt pulling into something less than a micro-mini,"I'm bigger and better than you are wondergirl." She actually stuck her tongue out, playfully.

"Perhaps...for now," Rei responded, swelling another few inches of her own as if to prove her point. The sound of a strap giving way violently spelled the end of her bra's tenacious hold on life.

Without a moment's hesitation each girl wrapped themselves around one of Shinji's arms and lead him towards the bedrooms. "Oh well," Shinji thought, depressed as usual at his lack of control over his own life,"It could be worse I suppose."
