Alex tried to still her wildly beating heart and keep her eyes on the ground. Anything but make eye contact at the girl sitting demurely by the window, her hands resting gently on her desk. She wasn’t looking out the window, but the sunlight was glinting off the top of her head, setting the stray hairs aglow, a bright amber shining through the coal black locks. Alex felt herself begin to blush. Oh Christ.
The very last class of the day in the last semester of her last year in high school and this happens.

“Excuse me,” someone said behind her. A boy pushed past her into the classroom and she realized she was standing stock still in the doorway. Dummy.
“Sorry,” she muttered. Now she was definitely blushing.

She hurried out of the way, taking a circuitous route around the room to stay out of the eyeline of the girl. Along the way, she clutched her backpack surreptitiously to her crotch, feeling the redness of her embarrassment throb there too. No one seemed to notice.
She grabbed a desk that was two seats back and one row to the right of the girl’s. She didn’t want to be noticed, but she couldn’t deny the simple reptile desire to keep the girl in sight.
It wasn’t just the girl’s hair that Alex liked, after all.
Even from this angle, Alex could make out the swell of her breasts, pressing and flush against her baggy t-shirt. The weight of them and how soft they looked. Her face was in a near profile, delicate and fine. Her features were seemingly drawn from the models in a teen magazine. She looked simultaneously older and more mature than any of the other seniors in the school—in her mid-twenties, an adult—and younger than anyone else. She still had that child-like softness to her that made Alex want to protect her, care for her.
And fuck her brains out, of course.

She flushed brighter at this thought and pulled out a notebook to hide her face in.
Again, that twinge in her crotch, that pulling, sucking need—running the length, and up into her gut.
It got bigger, just a little. Swelling. She felt it begin to push its way down her thigh. This was bad.
She glanced around, afraid that somehow, someone had noticed.

As if to answer her fear, the bell rang suddenly—just the first warning bell, but it was enough to jar her attention away. She looked down at her empty notebook, just to focus on anything.
“Think about baseball” was the old bit of sage advice. But she didn’t care about baseball, so she started doodling instead. The quick click of her mechanical pencil and the lines began to unfurl and her arousal was forgotten.
Dicks. Just a line of dicks. That was what her subconscious summoned. But it was too late by the time she noticed. The final bell rang and her teacher, appearing as if from nowhere, cleared his throat. She shut her notebook with a snap.
The class was AP English, and, like the first day in any class, they wasted their time. First they played a game to remember each other’s names.

“Ella,” said the girl when it came to be her turn.
Ella.

She looked like an Ella, Alex thought. And to be honest, Alex looked like an Alexis, too. She realized this with a flush of recognition as she said her own name, and the girl, Ella, turned in her seat to look at her. To see whom this “Alexis” might be.
“But everyone calls me Alex,” Alex said.
She’d said that entirely for Ella’s benefit, though she didn’t know it at first. Not until she turned to look Ella dead in the face and their eyes connected. From that moment on, it was too late. Ella had made her choice, though Alex didn’t know that. But she did know that their quick glance felt like lightning and her cock swelled quickly enough to make her seams stretch and threaten to burst.
She was sitting and no one seemed to notice, but Alex felt the hot weight against her leg, felt it strain and threaten, four inches, five inches down her leg. Still tiny, thankfully, still enough to catch.
“Think of baseball.”
 
Alex had seen Ella for the first time in the dead of summer. It was not half a year before, when summer vacation was at its peak, stretching on far enough ahead and behind that it seemed to engulf everything.
The first sighting had been innocuous enough, but it had left an impression of Alex. She’d been at the grocery store with her mother, and across the way, down the baked goods aisle, she’d seen the girl she’d just come to know as Ella. Ella had also been with her mother, but she’d looked bored and disconnected. Her arms had been folded underneath her enormous breasts and Alex’s breath had been stolen away from her, leaving her gasping. She was gorgeous—but that description was too easy. This girl had an otherness to her. A sense of not belonging to this tiny city in this boring state. She felt like she should’ve been in Hollywood or gracing the court of some medieval castle in a distant age. Maybe she was one of the fae and had slipped through the barrier that separated them from the mundane world at the last possible moment. Anywhere but here, looking bored in a grocery store with her mom. But her tits took her somewhere else. They were conspicuously huge against her delicate, elfin frame. Too huge to ignore and dirty enough to drag her ethereal looks through the mud.

Alex had felt her cock grow a little back then, too. That contradictory state, between body and presence, had made her—
She’d bitten her lip and stared so obviously that even her mother had made the connection, giving her a disapproving raise of the eyebrow and ushered her away.
Alex had always liked girls and her cock had little to do with it. It was just a coincidence. A genetic roll of the dice.
Just like her cock, she ‘d told herself.
 
The bell rang and school was over for the day.
Alex gathered her things, feeling drained and bored, until she saw Ella stuffing her notebook into her bag. A little swell of hope and fear. It seemed like a dream that this girl would end up in her class. She hadn’t even known that she was in her grade.
After the incident in the grocery store, she’d only spotted her two or three around the school—the first time at the beginning of the year, which had been the biggest shock of her life until that point. Like a dream come true, walking through the halls of her school, tits pressed behind her books, looking between the wandering students with a practiced kind of quiet. But they hadn’t shared any classes or anything. After a while, Alex had almost been convinced that she was the product of a sexual fever dream—a figure imagined up that couldn’t possibly be real.
But she was real and she was in Alex’s class and she was looking at her right now. And she watched as Ella’s big green eyes turned and connected with hers once again. Alex tried to drop her gaze, but it was held fast, tethered by the immediacy of Ella’s beauty and the sincerity buried deep inside.
Alex blinked, clutched her backpack and made a break for it.
She made it out the door, up the hall, down the stairs and through the front door. The sharp winter air hit her and she realized with a start that she’d forgotten her coat. She turned around and ran almost smack dab into Ella.
“Oof,” Ella said. Her voice was sweet and thick, even when making such a silly proclamation. Her hands had caught Alex by the belly and they were small and firm, lingering for a fraction of a second too long.
“Sorry,” Alex said, turning scarlet. Some deep part of her knew that this was her chance to say something—anything—to this girl, but she ducked out of the way anyway, weaving between a crush of students, and turned back to her locker.
Voices and noise overwhelmed her, but soon she saw the familiar numbers and she swirled the dial automatically, reciting the combination in her head without thought.
A gentle presence at her side.

For a moment, Alex didn’t dare look, but she turned and found herself face to face with Ella yet again.
“Excuse me,” she said.
“Huh, what?” Alex said, dumbfounded.

Ella pointed to the locker next to her and Alex stepped aside to make room instinctively. Ella fiddled with the dial and the locker came open. “Sorry,” she said, “I just had to get my coat.”
Impossible.
How in the world were their lockers right next to one another?

“You, uh,” Alex said, not thinking, “You forgot your coat too, huh?”

Alex could’ve sworn she saw the faintest shade of pink spread across Ella’s cool features.
“Yeah,” she said, slipping her coat on. She hesitated for a moment—maybe hoping Alex wouldn’t see—but she caught the pause in movement regardless. “Sorry,” Ella said suddenly, her face hidden, turned away slightly. “I wanted to catch you before you left and I wasn’t thinking. But I guess you weren’t either.”
“Catch me why?” Alex said. Her head was numb.
“You seem interesting,” Ella said. They still weren’t facing each other, but Alex could sense the expression on her face, in the tone of her voice. A predatory, quiet intent.
Alex giggled nervously. “Interesting?” she said. “You must be talking to the wrong girl. I’m as basic as—” She swallowed. Ella’s attention was entirely on her, even if she wasn’t looking at her.
A moment of silence passed, but what was sent between them was a thousandfold more complex than words, louder than the thrumming in Alex’s ears.
“Do you want a ride?” Alex said suddenly.
The words came to her mouth so easily. There was no thought, only truth, only desire.
Alex finally looked at Ella and saw she was smiling. Instantly, it melted the tension in her heart. The smile was an expression of pure, thawed relief.
“I would like that,” she said.
 
They first kissed inside Alex’s car. It had happened suddenly, but naturally. Alex had unlocked the doors, they had trickled inside, escaping the cold, and then their hands were upon each other. Alex couldn’t say who had touched whom first, but the distinction was superfluous. For all intents and purposes, the action was entirely mutual and simultaneous.
Alex’s hands were all over her and she felt Ella’s surveying her own body, crawling up her back, at her waist, awkwardly leaning over the handbrake. Entirely without thought, Alex’s hand touched one of Ella’s breasts. It was incredibly heavy and Alex’s hand sunk into the soft flesh with almost no resistance, no bones underneath to stop her, only the tight fabric and under wires of what felt like an ill-fitting bra. Ella moaned inside her mouth.
Her lips were so soft, her cheek was velvet. Her hand ran through her hair and all Alex could think was that this was a dream.
But it wasn’t a dream. Ella was real. Flesh. So much flesh.
Her cock was already growing hard, and the pop of a seam in her jeans broke their attention long enough to part their lips.
“Fuck,” Alex said, looking down at her crotch. Her cock was already eight inches down her leg and bulging the fabric of her jeans. She flushed and turned to Ella. “I know this is kinda weird, but—”
Ella bent over and kissed the shaft of her penis, touching and gently gripping the head through her jeans.
Several more threads exploded and Alex started the car, lightning passing through her. The reptile was taking over and she had to get somewhere safe and secure fast.
 
Alex stopped the car. The journey had abated the growth of her cock just a little bit, but it was still semi-hard, sitting somewhere around eleven inches, almost halfway down her thigh.
They were in her driveway. Her parents wouldn’t be home for several hours, so they had plenty of time to do—
Another seam, further down her thigh popped.

“We better get inside before you explode,” Ella laughed hungrily.

Alex didn’t dare look her in the eyes for fear that her premonition might come true. She yanked the keys out of the ignition and in a blur, they fell through the front door, the familiar scent of her family home flooding her and she and Ella were touching and her skin, her flesh was hot under her hands. Her hands travelled up Ella’s back and with a flick, undid her bra. She was ravenous and she needed to see, needed to feel Ella’s massive tits with her own, very intimate senses. She’d been dreaming about something like this since she was twelve years old, since she’d first discovered her addiction to girls, jerking her enormous cock into the toilet, into the sink, into any receptacle she could find. Her own body and modest tits satiated her in the interim, pretending in the mirror that they were somebody else’s, but it was a poor substitution for the otherness of another person and she knew that now.

They oozed upstairs to Alex’s room, a mess of hands and tongues, until Alex turned her lights on and Ella pushed her gently onto the bed.
Alex lay on her back and stared up at Ella as she pulled her shirt over her head, her husk of a loose bra falling down her arms and cast aside. Her nipples were delicate pink, like a flower, and shot through with gentle blue veins. Her tits were huge beyond Alex’s initial imaginings, somehow larger beneath their fabric and wire holdings, swallowing her torso obscenely. They were like fat, firm parasites, dangling from her body, like a corruption, but blended beautifully and perfectly. Her skin was achingly flawless and white and with her gorgeous face floating over it, Alex felt her sense of reality recede. There was no possible way a girl this perfect was here, now, about to do what she was reaching to do.
With a hunger like famine, like the desperate need to breathe, Ella turned away from her own striptease and pounced on Alex’s jeans. She fumbled with the button and fly while Alex felt her engorged penis rip further down her leg in a sudden swell. The hunger was overpowering, infectious.

Ella yanked her jeans down in a series of violent jerks, exposing more and more of the shaft breaking through her boxer briefs—panties had proven too impractical for holding in her monster—and finally popping free with her gigantic, engorged head, a big as a python’s. The shaft jumped and waved, pressed firmly aside by the elastic of her underwear’s leg hole.
“Jesus,” Ella breathed, thrusting her fingers in her mouth.
“This is nothing,” Alex said. She wasn’t bragging, but being naively matter-of-fact. No other person had seen or touched her penis besides her doctor since it had started to grow with puberty. And no one knew of its monstrous size and appetite besides her.
Her neglected pussy ran over with wetness and smeared across her hand as she traced it up and around her balls and up her shaft, ending and polishing the tip of her head. Once it took hold, her cock commanded all.
She ripped her boxer briefs off, and, with a self-satisfied giggle, flung it aside with the rigidness of her penis, like a tiny catapult.
Ella let out a single unbelieving laugh and then undid and threw her skirt and panties aside in a couple of brief, practiced movements. And then she was upon Alex’s cock.

She squatted on Alex’s knees, half standing, and worked her mouth up and down the length of Alex’s penis. It boiled beneath her movement and Alex found untold pleasure in feeling Ella’s small hands and mouth grow smaller beneath her growth, shrinking down to a doll’s touch and tongue, but no less huge and radiant as before, until she reached an almost painful hardness, a hardness hitherto unknown to her.
She looked down and gasped between her involuntary moans. Her cock was over two feet long, a good five or six inches bigger than it had ever been before. She relished incredibly beneath the knowledge that her arbitrary growth was bigger and wider in girth from her normal size than most boys would ever know. She pumped her cock harder and wilder beneath Ella’s diminutive grasp as it eclipsed all of her torso but her heaving tits. Just the sight of it was going to make her cum.
No big deal, of course. She always had cum to spare.
“You going to cum already?” Ella said, moaning, popping her lips. “We haven’t even started yet.”
“It’s—ah¬—okay,” Alex said, tossing her head aside. “I—ungh—never run out. Oh!”

She bucked and pre-cum ran in a thick rivulet from her fat head.

“I was hoping you were going to say something that,” Ella said, and ran her tongue up Alex’s shaft to the slit. And that was enough.
“Ah! Oh!” Alex cried and sweet release and overwhelming pleasure washed over her, a gift from her enormous cock and the supple warmth of Ella’s foreign body. It was too much—far too much—and Alex lost herself.

Cum jetted from her cock, seemingly more than her body could hold. Stream after jet after river sailed out of her member, firing up towards the ceiling. A full two seconds passed and Alex felt it raining down over her, splashing her body as she strained and flexed.
“Oh my god,” Ella said and Alex propped open an eye just long enough to watch her clamp her mouth over the stream, catching her cum down her throat. Alex held her breath and bucked her hips up into the air; the only sound was Ella and her throat gulping, swallowing mouthful after mouthful of cum. Finally she relented and fell back and Alex continued to gush freely, still bucking her hips in time with each thrust and spray of cum. It rocketed out of her, plopping down in great dollops all around her and she gritted her teeth. She’d never cum so hard before. The very pheromones drifting from Ella’s skin and hair made her ravenous, something she’d been dimly aware of since the first time they’d passed one another in the school hallways.
 
Her tits had bounced obscenely. It didn’t matter how delicately she walked—and the strained step of her toes told Alex that she had practiced delicacy for years—her tits still bounced and swayed, straining against bra and baggy t-shirt, her nipples pointing defiantly through, as if their sole purpose was to embarrass the poor girl. Back before Alex knew she was Ella. Back before Ella was hugging her cock, drinking her cum.
They’d barely shared a few sentences between them and already Ella was drinking her cum…
 
Alex opened a single eye, felt the gushing pleasure and realized she was still cumming. She’d lost herself from the pleasure for one brief moment. The splattering sound was gone and she saw that Ella had her mouth gripped around her head and was drinking from her cock again in earnest.
Just the sound of gulping, mouthful after mouthful after mouthful.
Alex felt a new warmth against her and realized it was Ella’s belly.
Her orgasm redoubled, a second, third, blending together—her feminine gift—and she bucked back, though Ella held on tight.
Alex had never cum so much in her life, not in a single orgasm, not in a single day, not in a week. Her cock was formidable, of this she had no doubt—watching porn and supposed “monster cocks” and wondering where the real monsters were—but this was something else.

She gripped the folds of her sheets with both hands and braced herself against the pleasure.
It was all Ella. Everything about this girl sent her body into overdrive, made her seed double, triple, quadruple.
They were made for each other. It was the only explanation she could think of.
Ella finally gave up trying to drink all her cum again and fell back to licking up and down her shaft. It was impossible to drink everything, but Alex felt proud of her for trying. All this cum belonged to her, after all. Every ounce, every cup, every gallon—because surely it had been gallons by now? Somehow, impossibly. It all belonged to her. Every sperm cell was dying to be inside Ella, digested or wriggling inside an egg cell. It all belonged to her to do as she willed.

Alex finally opened her eyes to admire her handiwork and was stunned. Ella was entirely covered in cum, her hands and mouth still working furiously. Her belly was swollen like she was 9 months pregnant, maybe with twins—maybe more—and it sat fatly between her legs. But there was softness and a pliancy to her that was different than the stretch of pregnancy. Her skin was unblemished and smooth. Meanwhile, Alex’s bed was soaked, and cum was spattered on the furniture around her. The pictures of her friends stuck in the edges of her mirror, the trinkets bought and given to her by her family, her clothes scattered across the floor—all of it was soaked.
Pride filled her chest and an animal superiority. Primal dominance. All this was hers. And it was all for Ella.

“How?” Ella muttered between mouthfuls of cum. “How are you still cumming?”
Alex couldn’t manage the words. White hot pleasure continued to rack her body, blackening her senses. All she could manage were moans and shudders of pleasure, her hands twisting into fists and knots.

Another half minute ticked by and finally her orgasms began to subside. There had been maybe four or five in total, but she couldn’t tell. From her heaving chest and pounding heart, it had all been one dose of hot ecstasy.
Ella was there to lick up the last weak throbs of cum as they dribbled down her shaft.
She stood up and Alex saw again how her belly bulged. She’d drank so much cum—two or three gallons’ worth at least. All for her. For no reason other than to honor and worship her. Just as Alex worshiped Ella, and had from the moment they’d first met. It was incredible.
Ella put a hand to her belly and rubbed it gently.
She blushed, as if realizing how obscene she must look.

“It—it looked so delicious,” she said, growing redder under Alex’s smoldering gaze. “I couldn’t help myself. I just kept drinking it.”

Alex was on her feet in an instant. She grabbed Ella and spun her around, pressing her into the cum-soaked bed sheets. Her tits pressed underneath her, spreading to either side of her body like rising dough, utterly enormous. The sight of her, pinned, resting on her enormous tits and belly, skinny ass in the air, was too much, and Alex began to ease the tip of her gigantic penis into Ella’s little pussy.

“Do it,” Ella said. “Fuck me. Hurry.”

For a split second, Alex was frankly astonished. She expected her to demur, to be fearful of her insane monstrosity. But this was Ella. The girl meant for her. And all she wanted was her, Alex.
So Alex gave her what she wanted.
Her feet slid back in the cum-saturated floor as she pressed. There was a good quarter-inch soaking the floorboards around her bed. But she pushed, seemingly against an impenetrable wall of muscle. But like a miracle, it opened up wider and gratefully took her in.
Alex felt her cock slide in with little resistance. Inch by inch, almost too easy. She heard Ella’s startled moans, holding her cum-filled belly with one hand and propping herself against the bed with the other.
More and more of her cock disappeared inside Ella’s body, swallowed up by her indomitable hole. It was almost horrifying for a moment and Alex worried she might puncture one of Ella’s lungs or her heart with her quivering shaft. But then she remembered the insane amount of cum around her and all the cum stored safely inside the body she was currently penetrating and she calmed down. Clearly there was some magic at work or something. Nothing to worry about.

“Fuck,” Ella groaned, bucking her hips against Alex’s cock. She was too greedy and anxious for Alex to start. “You’re so fucking big. I can’t handle it.”

Alex kept sinking more of her cock inside of Ella’s tiny body until her hips were pressed against her ass. Her entire cock was swallowed and gone—and if it wasn’t for the flashes of her shaft as Ella fucked up against her, she might just imagine it had vanished entirely. She hadn't started moving yet; Ella was doing all the work.

“Fuck me,” Ella pleaded, gripping at Alex’s hips behind her and swaying like an animal. “Please fuck me. Please. I’ll go crazy if you don’t.”

Alex needed no further prompting and in fact felt herself swell even larger inside of Ella. Her body still offered almost no resistance, however. Her pussy had expanded, pushing aside the other, lesser organs.
Right now fucking was all that mattered and Ella and Alex needed it like breathing.
Alex pounded her hips into Ella’s ass and Ella gasped and rocked.

“Fuck me,” she breathed, startled. “I’m already cumming. Ah! Oh fuck!”

Alex felt a spray against her body, a jet like a garden hose with someone’s thumb it. It splattered her whole lower body, drenching her to her knees. The fluid was girlcum, and it was viscous and white, almost as thick as her own cum.
The girlcum shot against her in waves and subsided as quickly as it had started. It that one moment, Ella, just a girl, had cum more than most men could dream of cumming in their entire lifetimes.
Ella panted, limp against the bed. “Jesus Christ,” she gasped. Alex kept pounding her, unabated. “Fucking incredible. Oh! Oh god! Ah!”
And immediately she came again. Her body was still soft and prone, only her, hand, gripped in Alex’s reaching hand, squeezed.

Another couple of gallons of girlcum sprayed out of her in fits and starts, adding to Alex’s mess on the floor. “F-fuck,” Ella muttered, shaking. Her body trembled. “I don’t know what h-happening to m-me—” And she came again, spraying her thick girlspunk everywhere. “F-fuck!” And she came yet again.

Alex giggled to herself. Ella’s body felt amazing on the inside, but she was only just starting. The poor girl was going to get worn out before Alex even ever began.
 
Alex was wrong, of course. Her parents came home from work and left for dinner and came back and went to bed. All the while Alex kept fucking Ella. Meanwhile, Ella was cumming non-stop. Her sprays of girlcum had grown no less frequent or thick and, by now, the cum had risen up to Alex’s ankles, slopping through the heavy gunk.
She’d sworn she’d heard her parents listening at her door, but they hadn’t bothered knocking or anything. She’d heard their concerned mutterings behind Ella’s cries of pleasure and then they’d left. Most likely they knew exactly what was going on behind her door and wanted nothing to do with it. Alex didn’t blame them. This shit was beyond reason.
And yet it felt so natural.
After hours of pumping away and being sprayed with cum, Alex turned Ella over on her bed so that her feet were in the air. Ella immediately wrapped them around Alex’s waist like her body was a buoy in the middle of an ocean. Alex was astonished to see her cock churning in the narrow places around Ella’s swollen belly. It seemed to go up and into the base of her ribcage and the thought of that made her swell even bigger with excitement.

“You’re too fucking big,” Ella gasped. “Are you ever going to sto-stop?” She came again and this time Alex’s chest took the brunt of the spray. “Pl-please don’t. Don’t stop fucking me. I need you.”
Alex doubled over, putting more weight and energy into her thrusts. She wasn’t growing any more tired—she couldn’t with Ella’s pheromones coursing through her. “F-fuck” Alex cried. She was close to cumming again, swelling larger and growing even harder—so hard she was lifting and suspending Ella’s body from the bed at the height of her thrusts, an iron girder that could hold a building. Her cock was so swollen and huge that Ella’s legs were held as wide apart as they could go, and even still Alex could feel her trying to squeeze them together, to give Alex as much pleasure as she could muster. It wasn’t possible, though. It felt as though their fucking would tear the world apart and her pleasure was like the trumpets of the apocalypse. Inexorable and heady, filling her blood.
She came suddenly, just as her cock swelled to even larger dimensions and Ella gasped.

Alex watched through pleasure-sewn eyelids as each jet visibly pulsed and  stretched Ella’s belly. “Oh f-fuck!” she cried with pleasure, her voice mixed with the spray of a fresh wave of girlcum. “F-fuck, Alex! Fill me up! Fill me up!”
And so, obliged, Alex did. She felt willed on by Ella’s desire. She was barely cumming for herself. This was all for Ella. All for her body and her rapidly stretching womb. Ella’s belly ballooned out with each surge of cum pouring from Alex and Alex was lifting her, willing herself to keep cumming, keep cumming. She needed to cum for Ella and cum until she was satisfied. Her cock was so big—almost as thick as Ella’s petite waist—that not a drop was spilled, but Ella continued to cum as well, painting Alex with her own spunk, her legs twisting with pleasure, her toes knotting and unfurling.
Roughly, hurriedly, Alex flipped Ella into her side, her enormous belly flopping onto the mattress, and began to fuck her from this new angle. Ella’s pleasure-possessed leg kicked over Alex’s shoulder and Alex held onto her thigh, using it as leverage to pound her harder, cumming as she went. All the while her belly was continuing to grow, filling with liter after liter of semen, turning to gallons inside her.

“M-more,” Ella moaned, clutching at her belly. “C’mon baby, keep c-cumming for me! Oh!”
Another volley of sprays of girlcum, drenching Alex’s already dripping crotch.
Everything was Ella. It was all Ella. Her whole world. And conversely Ella’s everything, her entire body, was dedicated to Alex and her marvelous, unrivaled cock. She worshiped the gallons and gallons of seed pouring into her. The primeval forms of creation. They were Gaia and Uranus, one plunged deep within the other, filling her with the means of all life. And the ecstasies of all life filled them to bursting.
Cum poured from Alex’s loins like a wellspring, unending, surging through her and scorching her vessels and nerves with pleasure like lengths of burning thermite. Ella’s belly continued to take it all, her womb convinced it was going to capture and hold the entire world and it became doubly certain as it began to grow over the edges of the bed, spreading onto the floor and flooding over it, a creeping, smooth wall of flesh. Her body was a cum balloon and Alex was the endless faucet.
Swelling, growing, expanding and pumping. Still pumping despite, and because of, the overwhelming, body-wracking pleasure.

Ella felt something cold and smooth and realized she’d reached one of the walls. “F-fuck, I’m s-so b-big,” she stuttered. “L-look what you’re doing to me, baby.”
Alex opened one eye and saw the swell of Ella’s beautiful, unblemished flesh. This was all because of her. She was doing this to sweet little Ella. Turning her into this mountain.
The room was growing dark as Ella’s body blotted out the lamps, as it kept swelling, surging with more cum.
“K-keep cumming for me,” Ella pleaded, moaned, spraying Alex with wave after wave of girlcum. “I want to get bigger. So much bigger. Oohhh…”
She didn’t have to ask twice. More orgasms overlapped, until they became a blur, heightening ecstasy to brighter, more holy levels. Ella’s cunt, as pliable and as wet as ever, squeezed her, holding back the lake of cum, doubly sealed by her cervix and the one-way pressure of Alex’s surging, spraying cockhead deep inside her.

Night was passing rapidly, but the copulation continued unabated, the partners wrapped around one another, fused, a love beyond words and simple expressions. It was in the squeezing of hands, in the wet slap of groin to ass, the spray of girlcum, up to the edge of the bed now, and in the wall of Ella’s belly as it pushed them, further and further away, to the opposite end of Alex’s bedroom.
They hit the far wall, Ella’s body filling almost all of Alex’s bedroom now and they were sliding upwards, pressing to where there was still space. Alex heard her furniture splinter under the weight of Ella’s belly and her swimming pools’ worth of cum. Still she kept pumping, still she kept cumming. Their copulation wasn’t over yet. Alex had one orgasm in her yet and she could feel it mounting, feel Ella’s body prepare to match hers.
The sun began to rise, day began to break. People woke up and began to get ready and eat breakfast and go to work. Dew settled on the grass and the nightly predators hid away in their caverns of leaves and branches. Life began anew.
Alex bucked. All around her was Ella’s belly. They were suspended, pressed to the wall.

“Y-you ready?” Alex said. She couldn’t hold it in anymore.
Ella bit her lip and nodded, spraying girlcum everywhere, still cumming nonstop.
“F-fuck,” Alex stuttered and shook. She flexed her body, pushing with all her might inside of Ella and Ella returned with a cry. She twisted around and they locked lips, kissing passionately through faces twisted with the agony of a final orgasm.
Alex heard the wall splinter away easily as Ella’s body surged. Pouring out of the side of house and into the street and beyond. Ella groaned, overwhelmed by the pleasure of her sudden, and unbelievable growth. She expanded, her belly pouring out and growing higher and higher. Cum poured so strongly and rapidly out of Alex’s body, it was like the world itself was being turned inside out. The pleasure was immeasurable, wiping away the memories of all previous orgasms.
This was it.
Together they cried into each other’s mouths, gripping hands, growing and cumming. And the instant it was over, trickling away as suddenly and as explosively as their initial attraction had clicked, they succumbed to sleep, clutched in each other’s arms.
 
“Unbelievable, you two. Just unbelievable!”

Alex opened her eyes slowly. Ella was still held tightly in her arms. She was just coming round as well. They were outside, lying in the grass.
“The school was supposed to keep them separated! What happened?”
Alex’s parents. It was her parents standing over them. Their faces were both bright with indignation and fury. Next to them stood two adults Alex had never seen before, though one seemed vaguely familiar.
Alex looked back to Ella and saw she was wide-awake, glancing sheepishly between the two strange adults.
Ella’s parents, Alex realized. She swallowed.
Slowly they sat up together. They were both naked, but Alex was amazed to see Ella’s body had returned to normal. Her massive tits rested heavily on her slim, pert belly, caressing her thighs as she crossed her legs. Alex felt her cock—now dwindled down to its usual flaccid two inches—begin to grow hard, expanding as she stared.

“You knock that off right now, young lady!” her dad said sternly.

Alex grimaced and flinched. “S-sorry, Dad.”
“What’s happening?” Ella asked looking between all the adults.

Alex’s father gestured to the exploded house behind them. Alex could see the remains of her room inside, everything showered with wooden detritus and girlcum. Alex felt her face turn somehow brighter than it already was.

“You two weren’t supposed to meet properly for another year,” Ella’s mother said, shaking her head.
“At least until you were out of high school, for chrissakes,” Alex’s dad groaned.

Alex and Ella glanced at each other. They didn’t care what it meant or how their parents knew about them. All that mattered was one thing:

“What are you going to do about it now?” Alex asked. She held onto Ella tightly and Ella held her back.

The parents all exchanged looks.

Alex’s father cleared his throat. “Well. We can’t very well separate you now.”

Simultaneously Alex and Ella broke out into grins. They squeezed each other and kissed excitedly.
“But,” Alex’s father said. “A repeat performance of this.” He gestured severely towards the house. “And you can expect to spend the rest of high school on opposite sides of the state.”

Alex and Ella nodded vigorously. They were inseparable now and the idea of being so far apart ached like a physical wound.

“Now, er, you two go inside and get cleaned up and we’ll…” her father ran his hand through his hair and surveyed the damaged. “We’ll, uh, figure out what to do about this mess.”

They didn’t need to be told twice. Alex and Ella scrambled to their feet and ran back to the house, stifling conspiratorial giggles as they went. Even if they couldn’t fuck like that again for a while, they were in love. And love was sweet.
