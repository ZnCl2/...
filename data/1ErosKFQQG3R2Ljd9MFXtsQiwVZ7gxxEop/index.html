	<h3>wat?</h3>
	<p>It's a collection of smutty stories--mainly fetish stuff.
	<h3>why tho?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Lots of <dfn title='by my standards at least'>the good shit</dfn> is on websites that have been around since the internet stone age, with all the stability that implies.
		<li>Urls change.
		<li>I couldn't think of a 3rd thing.
	</ul>
	<p>
	<h3>disclaimer?</h3>
	<p>That's not a question, but: while it's not super likely that literature is going to be a main target for law enforcement, you should still check the legal status of adult content in your jurisdiction if it's a possible cause for concern.
	<p>Also: the only content I make an active effort to disinclude is work involving gore, defecation, or real-life people who are not public figures (more might be added). The category listings should serve as a fair warning, but they are not guaranteed to be all-inclusive.
	<h3>TODO</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>feedback mechanisim (maybe)
		<li>kaffie-like by-tag fuzzy search system
		<li>full text search (eventually)
		<li>workflow that can neatly render html files and break up by chapter via a custom html element
		<li>use the zeronet router thing, dbscheme designer zite, prettify this shit
		<li>find more good pastebin providers
		<li>have pastebin links lead to actual html files so that users can restore them manually if seeding is poor
	</ul>
	<h3>NOTE</h3>
	It's come to my attention that pastebin is sometimes axing relevant pastes. I imagine some of it definitely is better off deleted, but pastebin seems to be erring on the side of caution by removing things in bulk, without human review (partly understandable due to the size of the site). I will be looking into other sites to back up this content one to be safe.
