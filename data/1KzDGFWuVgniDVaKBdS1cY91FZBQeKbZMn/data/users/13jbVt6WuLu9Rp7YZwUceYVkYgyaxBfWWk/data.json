We  will  cooperate  internationally  to  ensure  safe,  orderly  and  regular migration  involving  full  respect  for  human  rights  and  the  humane  treatment  of migrants regardless of migration status, of refugees and of displaced persons. Such cooperation should also strengthen the resilience of communities hosting refugees, particularly in developing countries. We underline the right of migrants to return to their country of citizenship, and recall that States must ensure that their returning nationals are duly received.",
