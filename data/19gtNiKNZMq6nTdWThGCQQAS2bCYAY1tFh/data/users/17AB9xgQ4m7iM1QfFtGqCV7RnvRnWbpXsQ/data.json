Tor is being written about in all major thought leading journals, papers and reported on in serious television, while I2P is not even known in those circles most in need of it. This is no accident I guess. Any half-assed decentralized service will be heavily touted in the regular centralized cultural media, while the one \"killer protocol\" won't get any limelight, just to conflate decentralization with that useless service in the heads of users.  ",
