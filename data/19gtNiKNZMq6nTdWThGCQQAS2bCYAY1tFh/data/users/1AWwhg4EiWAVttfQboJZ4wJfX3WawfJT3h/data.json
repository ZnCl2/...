Our research found these humans most often don’t actually have Facebook or other popular social media accounts and as such, do not seem to be socially ‘connected’ to family members on this platform.

In the Middle Ages, that street was an important center of commerce, much of which has now moved online. By the 19th century, the street was home to ticker machines and reporters racing each other to make the evening papers. That world, too, has largely moved online.</p><p>And much has changed for the bankers and policymakers here in the City of London. But that is only the beginning. Let us spin the hands ofBig Ben forward to 2040 to catch a glimpse of their world. We might see that:</p><p>· Cars have disappeared, because people are moving about in hovering drones, or “pods,” which elegantly avoid each other in the morning rush hour.</p><p>· One of those pods carries the central bank governor, who recently started her second term. As part of her morning routine, she swipes through a hologram of news videos curated by a digital assistant, before arriving at Threadneedle Street.</p><p>· The governor disembarks, walks up to the columned façade, opens the door and…</p><p>Who will she encounter inside the building? Are there economists sitting at desks, debating policy choices around a table? Or is there an intelligent machine making decisions, setting rates, and issuing money?</p><p>In other words, how will fintech change central banking over the next generation? That is the focus of my remarks today.</p><p>I would like to consider the possible impact of three innovations—virtual currencies,new models of financial intermediation, and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Some of these innovations have already found their way into our wallets, smartphones, and financial systems. But that is only the beginning.</p><p>Are you ready to jump on my pod and explore the future together? As one of your fellow Londoners—Mary Poppins—might have said: bring along a pinch of imagination!</p><p>1. Virtual currencies</p><p>Let us start with virtual currencies. To be clear, this is not about digital payments in existing currencies—through Paypal and other “e-money” providers such as Alipay in China, or M-Pesa in Kenya.</p><p>Virtual currencies are in a different category, because they provide their own unit of account and payment systems. These systems allow for peer-to-peer transactions without central clearinghouses, without central banks.</p><p>For now, virtual currencies such as Bitcoin pose little or no challenge to the existing order of fiat currencies and central banks. Why? Because they are too volatile, too risky, too energy intensive, and because the underlying technologies are not yet scalable. Many are too opaque for regulators; and some have been hacked.</p><p>But many of these are technological challenges that could be addressed over time. Not so long ago, some experts argued that personal computers would never be adopted, and that tablets would only be used as expensive coffee trays. So I think it may not be wise to dismiss virtual currencies.</p><p>Better value for money?</p><p>For instance, think of countries with weak institutions and unstable national currencies. Instead of adopting the currency of another country—such as the U.S. dollar—some of these economies might see a growing use of virtual currencies. Call it dollarization 2.0.</p><p>IMF experience shows that there is a tipping point beyond which coordination around a new currency is exponential. In the Seychelles, for example, dollarization jumped from 20 percent in 2006 to 60 percent in 2008.</p><p>And yet, why might citizens hold virtual currencies rather than physical dollars, euros, or sterling? Because it may one day be easier and safer than obtaining paper bills, especially in remote regions. And because virtual currencies could actually become more stable.</p><p>For instance, they could be issued one-for-one for dollars, or a stable basket of currencies. Issuance could be fully transparent, governed by a credible, pre-defined rule, an algorithm that can be monitored…or even a “smart rule” that might reflect changing macroeconomic circumstances.</p><p>So in many ways, virtual currencies might just give existing currencies and monetary policy a run for their money. The best response by central bankers is to continue running effective monetary policy, while being open to fresh ideas and new demands, as economies evolve.</p><p>Better payment services?</p><p>For example, consider the growing demand for new payment services in countries where the shared, decentralized service economy is taking off.</p><p>This is an economy rooted in peer-to-peer transactions, in frequent, small-value payments, often across borders.</p><p>Four dollars for gardening tips from a lady in New Zealand, three euros for an expert translation of a Japanese poem, and 80 pence for a virtual rendering of historic Fleet Street: these payments can be made with credit cards and other forms of e-money. But the charges are relatively high for small-value transactions, especially across borders.</p><p>Instead, citizens may one day prefer virtual currencies, since they potentially offer the same cost and convenience as cash—no settlement risks, no clearing delays, no central registration, no intermediary to check accounts and identities. If privately issued virtual currencies remain risky and unstable, citizens may even call on central banks to provide digital forms of legal tender.</p><p>So, when the new service economy comes knocking on the Bank of England’s door, will you welcome it inside? Offer it tea—and financial liquidity?</p><p>2. New models of financial intermediation</p><p>This brings us to the second leg of our pod journey—new models of financial intermediation.</p><p>One possibility is the break-up, or unbundling, of banking services. In the future, we might keep minimal balances for payment services on electronic wallets.</p><p>The remaining balances may be kept in mutual funds, or invested in peer-to-peer lending platforms with an edge in big data and artificial intelligence for automatic credit scoring.</p><p>This is a world of six-month product development cycles and constant updates, primarily of software, with a huge premium on simple user-interfaces and trusted security. A world where data is king. A world of many new players without imposing branch offices.</p><p>Some would argue that this puts a question mark on the fractional banking model we know today, if there are fewer bank deposits and money flows into the economy through new channels.</p><p>How would monetary policy be set in this context?</p><p>Today’s central banks typically affect asset prices through primary dealers, or big banks, to which they provide liquidity at fixed prices—so-called open-market operations. But if these banks were to become less relevant in the new financial world, and demand for central bank balances were to diminish, could monetary policy transmission remain as effective?</p><p>If anything, central banks may well have to increase the number of counterparties to their operations. The Bank of England is already leading the way by including large broker-dealers and central counterparty clearing houses.</p><p>All this, of course, has regulatory implications. More counterparties imply more firms falling under the central bank’s regulatory umbrella—which is the price to pay for liquidity on a rainy day. Whether the future holds more or less rain is an open question. Still, better regulating shadow banks looks all the more pressing. The FSB has already made progress in this area under your leadership, Mark.</p><p>The remit of central banks will grow, and with it, perhaps, public scrutiny and political pressures. Independence—at least to set monetary policy—will need further defenses and require even clearer communication.</p><p>We may also see a shift in regulatory practices. Traditionally, regulators have focused on overseeing well-defined entities. But as new service providers come on stream in new shapes and forms, fitting these into buckets may not be so easy. Think of a social media company that is offering payments services without managing an active balance sheet. What label should we stick on that?</p><p>All this is good for lawyers, but not so good for regulators. The regulators will likely have to further expand their focus, from financial entities to financial activities—while possibly also becoming experts in assessing the soundness and security of algorithms. Easier said than done.</p><p>Cooperation is key</p><p>To make things smoother—at least a bit—we need dialogue. Between experienced regulators and those regulators that are just beginning to tackle fintech. Between policymakers, investors, and financial services firms. And between countries.</p><p>Reaching across borders will be critical as the focus of regulation widens—from national entities to borderless activities, from your local bank branch to quantum-encrypted global transactions.</p><p>Because of our global membership of 189 countries, the IMF is an ideal platform for these discussions. Technology knows no borders: what is home, what is host? How can we avoid regulatory arbitrage and a race to the bottom? This is about the IMF’s mandate for economic and financial stability, and the safety of our global payments and financial infrastructure.</p><p>The stakes—and gains—from cooperation are high. We want no holes in the global financial safety net, however much it gets stretched and reshaped.</p><p>I am convinced that the IMF has a strong role to play in this respect. But the Fund will also have to be open to change, from bringing new parties to the table, to considering a role for a digital version of the SDR.</p><p>In other words, the IMF is in for the pod-ride.</p><p>3. Artificial intelligence</p><p>Which brings us to the third and final leg—the transformative effect of artificial intelligence.</p><p>Will our governor in 2040 walk into the Bank to polish a monetary policy-setting machine? Will your prediction, Andy [Haldane], of 15 million jobs being automated in the U.K., affect the Bank and its world-class staff?</p><p>One thing is clear: we always have more data. Some estimates suggest that 90 percent of the data available today was generated in the past two years. [1] This is not just information on output, unemployment and prices, but also behavioral data on the quirks and irrationalities of the homo economicus.</p><p>Thanks to smartphones and the internet, this data is now abundant, ubiquitous, and increasingly valuable as we pair it with artificial intelligence.</p><p>Artificial intelligence is taking immense strides. Over the past year, some of the world’s best players of Go, the ancient board game, have lost to a self-learning computer. For many, that day of reckoning was supposed to be decades away. The machine learned tactics, recognized patterns, and optimized its game—better than we could.</p><p>Clearly, the economy is vastly more complex than a game of Go. But over the next generation, machines will almost certainly play a larger role—in assisting policy-makers, offering real-time forecasts, spotting bubbles, and uncovering complex macro-financial links.</p><p>But let me reassure you, humans will still be needed.</p><p>For one, there is immense uncertainty about the economy. Changes in basic economic relationships need to be spotted, and risks evaluated. Judgment and constant questioning by peers, diversity of opinions, and even a few maverick spirits, will remain essential to good policy. But what if the machine could do that too?</p><p>Next is the question of communication. Good monetary policy, as we know, is about story telling. Policy is effective if it can be explained clearly so the public can form expectations about future policy. Could machines really explain their decisions in plain English?</p><p>Even if that hurdle could be overcome, a last one remains. Even with the best algorithms and machines, targets will be missed, crises will occur, mistakes will be made. But can machines really be held accountable—to the young couple unable to buy a house, to the working mother finding herself unemployed?</p><p>Accountability is key. Without it, we cannot have independence; how else to bestow so much power in a technocratic organization? And without independence, policy is bound to go astray, as this conference reminds us loud and clear.</p><p>So no, I do not see machines taking over monetary policy. In 2040, the governor walking into the Bank will be of flesh and bones, and behind the front door she will find people, at least a few.</p><p>So there will always be an Old Lady living in Threadneedle Street. [2] And I hope you agree that it is often enlightening to speak to a lady of a certain age!</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>As our pod journey comes to an end, some of you may wonder about my upbeat tone. For many, this new world of central banking is less Mary Poppins, and more Aldous Huxley: a “brave new world,” much like the one described in Huxley’s famous novel.</p><p>I believe that we—as individuals and communities—have the capacity to shape a technological and economic future that works for all. We have a responsibility to make this work.</p><p>That is why I prefer Shakespeare’s evocation of the brave new world in The Tempest: “ O wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world .”</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>[1] IMB (2017), “Ten Key Marketing Trends for 2017,” available at https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=WRL12345USEN</p><p>[2] Allusion to “the Old Lady of Threadneedle street,” namely the Bank of England.</p><p></p><p></p>",

The focus on Backpage was because it's <br/>the go to example for why some claim this bill is needed (even though <br/>Congress passed another law two years ago to target Backpage, and that <br/>law has never been used, and even though there's already a federal grand<br/> jury investigating Backpage and there's nothing that stops the DOJ from<br/> going after Backpage under federal law). The focus on Facebook and <br/>Google is a bit more nebulous, but could be summed up as: &#34;those <br/>companies are too big and should do more to stop bad stuff happening <br/>online.&#34; There's a pretty easy path from &#34;Section 230 of the <br/>Communications Decency Act says internet platforms aren't responsible <br/>for what their users do&#34; to &#34;we need them to be more responsible&#34; to <br/>&#34;let's amend CDA 230.&#34; This line of thinking is problematic for any <br/>number of reasons that we've already discussed, so I won't go over them <br/>again now.<br/></p><br/><p><br/>But, as we've tried to explain, SESTA doesn't just impact Backpage, <br/>Facebook and Google. Indeed, Facebook and Google are uniquely positioned<br/> to handle the burdens (bogus takedowns, trollish threats, baseless <br/>litigation) enabled by SESTA. We've already shown how SESTA leaves <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171107/10023238562/dear-senators-portman-blumenthal-what-should-blogs-do-if-sesta-passes.shtml\">small sites like our own</a> at tremendous risk (and we're still waiting for <b>anyone</b><br/> -- but especially the bill's authors -- to explain how we avoid that <br/>risk), but lots and lots of other sites will be impacted as well.<br/></p><br/><p><br/>Take Wikipedia for example. The Wikimedia Foundation has published an excellent article describing how <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Wikimedia/three-principles-in-cda-230-that-make-wikipedia-possible-c0fb0006a932\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia only exists because of CDA 230</a><br/> and how it creates the space for a site driven entirely by its userbase<br/> to exist. More importantly, the article, by Wikimedia's Leighanna <br/>Mixter, details three ways in which SESTA puts Wikipedia at serious risk<br/> by upsetting the careful balance created by CDA 230. And here's where <br/>it's important to remind people that CDA 230 actually does two things. <br/>Many of its largest critics, incorrectly, think that all CDA 230 does is<br/> give websites a free pass to ignore everything that happens on their <br/>platform. But it also <em>encourages</em> sites to moderate activity <br/>that they don't want on their platform by noting that they don't lose <br/>their immunity in doing some forms of moderation. It's this part of CDA <br/>230 that gets less attention, but is potentially more important. And yet<br/> SESTA rips that apart. That leads to Wikimedia's first concern:<br/></p><br/><blockquote><em><br/></em><p><br/><b>1. Website operators need freedom to review content without legal risks</b><br/></p><br/><p><br/>The fundamental goal of Section 230 is to keep the internet free and <br/>safe by encouraging operators to host free expression and remove <br/>problematic content without the disincentive of possible lawsuits.<br/></p><br/><p><br/>SESTA introduces a vague standard for website operators that expands <br/>liability for “knowing” support of certain criminal activity. This will <br/>encourage websites to avoid gaining knowledge about content (to avoid <br/>liability) instead of actively engaging in content moderation.<br/></p><br/></blockquote><br/><p><br/>The post then drills down (as we have) to explain why the knowledge <br/>standard in SESTA (even as updated) leaves Wikipedia in serious danger. <br/>Because Wikipedia is maintained by thousands upon thousands of <br/>volunteers -- what will constitute &#34;knowledge&#34; of illegal behavior. If <br/>one of the volunteers comes across links to sex trafficking and fails to<br/> remove them, does that mean all of Wikipedia has &#34;knowledge&#34;? Do all <br/>editors of Wikipedia now need to be deputized to respond to sex <br/>trafficking issues? Does Wikipedia need to stop allowing volunteer <br/>editing (its entire basis of existing) and switch only to paid editors?<br/></p><br/><p><br/>A second problem with SESTA is how it opens up any web platform to a <br/>whole variety of state laws that smaller sites are unlikely to be able <br/>to follow and understand (and which can change over time).<br/></p><br/><blockquote><em><br/></em><p><br/>SESTA would amend Section 230 to allow, for the first time, civil and <br/>criminal liability for websites under state law as well as federal law <br/>in cases where the federal sex trafficking law has also been broken. <br/>This improves upon an earlier version of the bill, which would have <br/>allowed for much broader liability under state law. Website operators <br/>should not have to monitor and attempt to comply with differing laws in <br/>all 50 states. Doing so would require substantial time and resources <br/>just to stay aware of new laws and ensure compliance, which would be <br/>particularly difficult for a small company or nonprofit like the <br/>Wikimedia Foundation. It also would put operators in an impossible bind <br/>if two states passed laws with contradictory requirements.<br/></p><br/></blockquote><br/><p><br/>Finally, perhaps the biggest concern is how SESTA opens up smaller sites<br/> to what's likely to be myriad new lawsuits, in part because people will<br/> be testing the contours of the new law, but also because the standards <br/>in the law are so vague. Again, Facebook and Google can handle <br/>themselves when faced with lawsuits. Smaller sites? Not so much. As we <br/>expressed in our earlier post, small sites like our own and other <br/>individually owned blogs will have tremendous difficulty dealing with <br/>frivolous lawsuits under the law, but even Wikipedia notes that this <br/>would be very damaging.<br/></p><br/><blockquote><em><br/></em><p><br/>When plaintiffs target online speech, they often go after the website, <br/>not the speaker.

Critically, Section 230 does not prevent <br/>websites from being held responsible for their own actions — websites <br/>that are directly involved in illegal activities can already be <br/>prosecuted by the Department of Justice. However, SESTA would open up <br/>websites to more liability under federal and state law, likely resulting<br/> in increased litigation. Some of these lawsuits will be legitimate <br/>responses to improper conduct by websites; others may simply target the <br/>website over the speaker as an easier way to attack online speech.

			"body_p": "White theme is for noob, light theme is for amateur, dark theme is for expert ;)This userstyle has been actively polished for more than 10 months, should work on all official zites and their clones.Some unofficial zites are also supported, like NullPaste, ZeroWiki, Kaffiene Search. Nevertheless, some other zites may have side effects - that some bright elements are still not changed. You can try it yourself, ask me to modify them or temporarily disable the theme.Some devs may find the way I develop this userstyle very stupid, I should be able to automate a lot of things by writing a python script, but I enjoy the procedure like playing jigsaw puzzles, and having some simple time X)Code theme is Vim Desert.For Firefox family browser before Firefox 57, you can install it by Stylish plugin/add-on.For Chrome family browser, you can use Stylus. The Chrome version of Stylish and the Firefox version newer than 3.xx is not recommended, as it's not opensource and has an opt-out option to collect user data, and I confirm that even I uncheck the data collection option, every time I start Inox (an ungoogled Chromium) it will connect to google-analytics. Even so use a firefox family browser if you care your privacy.Currently Stylus Beta is available for Firefox 57, but in my Firefox (Iceweasel, Debian's rebranded version), it doesn't work for ZeroNet. There is another add-on called xStyle but it doesn't work, too... So for now there is no solution for Firefox 57.How to install:If you use Firefox (version &lt; 57) and Stylish 2.xx, in the Manage Styles Setting you can choose Install from URLs, then simply copy this link and install it (for NullPaste bin it doesn't work in this way).If you use Stylus, under Manage page, use Import styles and import this file, then click the update button to update it to the lastet version.

			"body": "Written by Soapdog, reshared from SSB\n<br/><br/>\n\n## SSBC grant proposal - Add SSB features to Firefox\n<br/><br/>\n\nThis proposal is for creating an add-on (or multiple) for #Firefox using the WebExtension APIs to add some scuttlebutt features to the browser.\n<br/><br/>\nMotivation\n<br/><br/>\nAt the moment, there are two main ways of interacting with scuttlebutt: running an electron based app or running some form of server and opening a local webapp. In the first case, your scuttlebutt experience is decoupled from your web experience which is at the same time good and bad. In the second case, even if you're using scuttlebutt from a tab in your browser of choice, it doesn't interact with the remaining web experience you have while using the browser. The creation of this (these) add-on, would make possible new experiences and features that are not easy done with the above mentioned ways of running scuttlebutt. I'd like to summarize some reasons why I believe this is a good idea:\n<br/><br/>\nRicher interaction with the browser\n<br/><br/>\nUsing an add-on allows us to tap into APIs that are not available to normal webapps. It opens possibilities for contextual menus, browser buttons, sidebars, and other UX experiences. For example, a compose message window on a sidebar allows you to change your active tab while still composing the message, thus making it a lot easier to compose entries that carry content from multiple sources and to fact-check stuff while you're posting.\n<br/><br/>\nAllows us to run one less web engine\n<br/><br/>\nThere are too many electron based apps in our daily usage. Many of us (me included) are running an editor such as visual studio code or atom, slack, spotify, patchwork, trello app, and each of those apps is one more chrome engine running. Chrome is not known for being a diet browser, if we could run one less instance of chrome, that would help our machine.\n<br/><br/>\nInvestigate new usage patterns\n<br/><br/>\nAs this deeper integration opens up new possibilities of usage (mostly by reducing friction), new forms of interaction between the current web and the decentralized web might be investigated. Having a decentralized technology inside a major browser will probably lead to new usage patterns beyond what we have seen so far.\n<br/><br/>\nPave the way for more decentralized features inside major web browsers\n<br/><br/>\nOnce completed and working, the method of adding ssb features to Firefox will make it easier to add features from other dex solutions such as dat and ipfs, which could lead to larger and more frictionless adoption of those technologies as well.\n<br/><br/>\nWebExtensions are a standard\n<br/><br/>\nThe new add-on API called WebExtensions is basically an standard. The API is shared between Firefox, Chrome, Opera and even Edge and Vivaldi. Each browser has some APIs that are not present in the others but it is a lot easier to port between browsers than it was when each used their own API. This work could later be used in porting the add-ons to other browsers.\n<br/><br/>\nWhat I will build\n<br/><br/>\nDue to the lack of TCP and UDP APIs in WebExtensions, we'll use native messaging api to talk to a native companion app built with NodeJS which will have sbot and friends as a dependency. All the ssb features are provides by this companion application which does IPC with add-ons over standard input and output, websockets and HTTP.\n<br/><br/>\nA major add-on called patchfox is planned and will provide features that ressemble patchwork/patchbay/patchfoo. We can think of pathfox add-on as a client for scuttlebutt.\n<br/><br/>\nOther smaller add-ons might be built if there is time and money to cover features beyond normal patchwork-like usage such as git-ssb, bookmarks and #ticktack\n<br/><br/>\nHow the money will be used\n<br/><br/>\nThe money will be used to cover my time as a part-time worker and any other professional I might need to hire (such as buying some custom graphical designs for icons and other GFX).\n<br/><br/>\nWhy me? Why I need the grant?\n<br/><br/>\nSince I started here on patchwork not long ago, I have been building simple experiments talking with sbot from other languages (mostly #red and #webextensions). My investigations proved that it is possible to build a custom scuttlebutt client as an add-on and I'd like to have the resources to build this correctly.\n<br/><br/>\nI am a Mozilla Rep and a Mozilla TechSpeaker. I wrote the first book about Firefox OS in the world back when the project was alive. I used to contract for Mozilla Foundation (not as a developer, but as a coordinator for a digital skills social program). I have sent patches to different Mozilla apps and know a lot of people inside. I am in a very good position to build this as I know the APIs well (for add-ons) and know who I can contact if I need help from Mozilla, I also know that I can reach out for all you amazing people in case (aka when) I need help with scuttlebutt APIs.\n<br/><br/>\nI am building this anyway but without the grant, I can't devote the necessary time to do this in the best way possible and also in a short time.

			"title": "Requiem for GitHub - Pieter Hintjens (2016)",
			"body": "http://hintjens.com/blog:111Since its birth in 2008, GitHub redefined how software developers worked together. The firm was famous for several reasons: it had no middle management, it had a strong remote working culture, it made exactly what we needed, no more or less, and it was always profitable. These are interrelated. Today, GitHub has 500 employees, is valued at $2bn, and I think it is dying. Here is why.FoldTable of ContentsA Prayer for the DyingUpdateUpdate 2 (2016/02/25)A Prayer for the DyingLet me start by saying I've been a fan of GitHub ever since I met a \"GitHub guy\" at a GitHub drink-up in Brussels. His job seemed to be to write code, and travel around the world drinking with other developers. I fell in love with company culture immediately.Over the years, GitHub never disappointed me. Their platform was stable and reliable. Their UI remained minimalistic and as smooth fitting as a velvet glove. We switched our issue tracking from the venerable Jira to GitHub, watched with joy as it integrated with Travis and AppVeyor, and felt cosseted and safe with a firm that worked and thought as we did.I've often turned to GitHub support for help. They have always been impeccable: fast, accurate service. It is unheard of for a web business. Obviously the staff loved their firm, loved their work, and loved their users. And we loved them right back.Then in 2014 the drama started. It began with one recent employee making claims of harassment against the CEO and his wife. It turned nasty as anonymous rumors spread of this employee's manipulative behavior in the firm, and her public tweets about being blackmailed towards sex with the CEO. The employee produced no evidence to back up her claims.The founder and CEO resigned, his co-founder took over, and a new wind started to blow in the firm. A VP of Social Impact was hired. Middle management started to creep in. These new managers began to crack down on remote working. The old guard started to leave.This story goes far beyond a fight between Social Justice Warriors and the Patriarchy for control over our Open Source dollars. This is not simply Death by Code of Conduct, though the firm did adopt a controversial CoC that disturbed not a few of its users.I've written extensively on living systems and power pyramids, and the war between these two organizational models. GitHub was a rare example of a successful living system growing out of the fruit basket that is Silicon Valley. It quickly became dominant in its market. It was profitable, free of debt, growing, loved.I've learned one thing from being an entrepreneur for 35 years: when there is unguarded money on the table, the wolves arrive. Call these as you like, their goal is to take the cash and blame someone else. They always use the same strategies, which I've documented extensively in my book The Psychopath Code. Divide and conquer. Charm and distraction. Promises and lies. Stealth, and violence.GitHub is a treasure. Its current valuation of $2,000,000,000 is just a baseline. It is worth ten times more, at least, if handled right. What it needs to justify a $20bn price tag are three things:    The right structure. That means a power pyramid instead of this strange \"horizontal\" network.    The right size. 300 employees is too few. Yahoo! has 12,500 employees, and is worth $33bn on the stock market. GitHub needs at least 5,000 employees.    The right product. The minimalist GitHub we open source developers know and love does not appeal to corporate clients.The first two changes are already happening. I predict the third will start to appear over the next six to 12 months. We'll see acquisitions of firms like Travis, expansion of core features like the issue tracker, more sophisticated organization management, and so on. If you want to see what GitHub looks like in two years' time, look at its traditional competitors.GitHub will become more profitable. If I had shares in the firm I certainly would not sell them yet. Wait a year or two, until the VCs and new managers find their acquisition target. Wait until the exit, and then sell. After that, it's over for the firm, and those who have stayed long enough to make their winnings will be looking for a way out.There are people who will question my framing and the time-line. Let me explain this as a murder mystery. We see a healthy person suddenly falling sick. We see a massive insurance policy being taken out. This person's demise is going to be extremely profitable. As investigator, you assume malice. You assume there exist people capable and willing to do anything if the price is right. You look for motive, means, opportunity. You follow the money.Look at the timing of VC investment, hiring of new employees, internal political fights, ousting of old CEO, and hiring of new managers. Look at a climate in which political outsiders use the weapons of gender and race against meritocracy. What emerges is the picture of a slow fight between the owners and investors, and the founder/CEO. The owners want their billions. The founder/CEO wants to keep GitHub alive.Unfortunately our data is incomplete. People are unwilling to speak publicly about what happened. We rely on claims and anonymous counter claims. Only time will tell.I wish I was wrong. Yet we are seeing large-scale interference in a successful, and essential platform. This is not idle tinkering to solve diversity issues. This is not idealism. We are watching a fight over money and power. No, that's wrong: there is no more fight. The founders of GitHub have already given in, one way or another. The fight is over. The users of GitHub won't fight. They will either accept, or move away.If my speculation is right, what will the impact be? GitHub have established themselves as The Place to host our public projects. Surely losing this will be a major blow to free and open source. Well, happily, no. This is how it happens: we construct, and then when we reach a plateau, the wolves come along, destroy what we make, and liberate us to go forth and do better. Psychopaths are the garbage collectors of human society.Whither the ZeroMQ community? I'm going to begin using GitLab for my own projects, and if that works, I'll aim to move the ZeroMQ projects that I care for, to GitLab, after discussion and consensus.Thanks for all the fish, GitHub. And to all GitHubbers, thank you a million times. You did the impossible, and you did it right, and I wish you all the best for your next projects. Hugs. :)UpdateTo my surprise, Julie Ann Horvath (JAH) commented on my tweet:    Julie Ann Horvath: @hintjens CEOs are very rarely (see: never) removed from a company without a claim being backed by substantial evidence.So her argument is this: TPW agreed to step down, meaning he was \"removed.\" The implication is that TPW admitted guilt by quitting, despite GitHub's investigation showing JAH's two claims of harassment were false.JAH backs up her argument by stating as a fact that CEOs are \"never\" removed from a company without substantial evidence. Thus, she implies, there was in fact substantial evidence against TPW. Note that she doesn't actually say this, not has she ever produced such evidence.From my own experience, CEOs and other managers tend to fight with shareholders and boards, and it's this politics that forces them out. The role CEO is always temporary, annually renewable. Fired, or step down, it's much the same. Anyhow, let's look for some research on why CEOs get fired. Bingo: Forbes reports on a study of 286 organizations. Nothing about harassment. Rather:    My team and I interviewed 1,087 board members from 286 organizations that fired, or otherwise forced out, their chief executive. And we found that most CEOs get fired for “soft issues.” Thirty-one percent of CEOs got fired for poor change management, 28% for ignoring customers, 27% for tolerating low performers, 23% for denying reality and 22% for too much talk and not enough action.I tweeted this to JAH.    Pieter Hintjens: @nrrrdcore that is false: study of 286 organizations showed majority fired for \"soft\" reasons: http://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2015/07/16/leadership-styles-are-often-why-ceos-get-fired/#21a2d28a6155JAH dismissed this study using the \"true Scotsman\" argument:    Julie Ann Horvath: @hintjens in public companies, perhaps. Rerun those numbers against privately held/vc backed startups.I pressed F5 to \"rerun\" the numbers and got exactly the same results. I'm not sure what else JAH would expect, as I did link her to the Forbes site. Nowhere does the article say it looked only at public companies. Nor is there any logical reason it would be different in a private firm from a public firm. I'd expect the standards of evidence to be higher in a public firm, if anything. I suspect she didn't RTFA.Here is a telling quote from Leadership IQ's the original article:    \"A more accurate explanation for why they get fired,\" he added, \"is that the Board of Directors or shareholders have lost confidence in their ability to generate sufficient financial returns in the future.\"In other words, it's about money. And my hypothesis that TPW was pushed out in order to turn GitHub into a cash cow still stands.Undeterred, JAH now attacks my motivations, instead of providing any real information:    Julie Ann Horvath: again, you're reaching to make an argument that suits your interests and currently held position.What position? I'm a writer. My position is, I write what I see. My interests are truth and knowledge. There's no profit in this. Maybe JAH is projecting her own viewpoint.Then JAH continues in a flood of tweets, presumably playing to her audience:    Julie Ann Horvath: @hintjens also, I don't identify as an SJW, I'm merely a tech worker who happens to be a woman.Did I call her a SJW? No, I said the situation at GitHub \"goes far beyond a fight between Social Justice Warriors and the Patriarchy.\" If anything I was saying, to the Reddit crowds, don't read this as a classic SJW drama. It's not.JAH continues, to applause from her admirers, I assume:    Julie Ann Horvath: @hintjens I'm vocal, yes. But please don't label me in a way that's been known to incite violence against women.Ah, here is the payload. She implies (no accusation, it's the implication) that I've placed her in physical danger by labeling her. \"Violence against women,\" seems oddly specific coming from someone who doesn't \"identify as an SJW.\" Why not simply \"violence?\" Is there a specific form of violence that… ah, yes, men the aggressors, women the victims. \"Don't call me SJW, that's so cishet!\"    Julie Ann Horvath: @hintjens all I'm asking for is the same respect you would award your own peers or employees.Well, for a start I have no employees, and any peer who made unfounded accusations of sexual harassment would get the same treatment from me. This has happened to friends of mine, male and female, and my first response is: \"do you have evidence, and if not, how can I believe your word over theirs?\"If someone abuses, harasses, or threatens you, get evidence any way you can (pull out your smartphone!) and then proceed.There is a classic pattern here. Woman claims sexual harassment from powerful man. Man denies it. Woman goes to social media and makes her case in court of public opinion. Man cannot disprove a negative. Woman gets crowd of sympathetic admirers. Some may hate men. Some may feel guilt at their own misdeeds. Some may hate what that powerful man stands for. Some may just like being part of a mob.The court of public opinion is not a court, and street justice is not justice. It is above all, the vulnerable and weak who get abused in such systems. We worked hard and long to build justice into the State.If you are harassed or abused, you do not shout about it. You take it to the police and if they don't act, you still have the choice of a private lawsuit. This is what courageous women and men do, when they are abused. What JAH did was something different. If you go to the public with a private matter, you lose your right to privacy.JAH insists on dodging the reason we're exchanging tweets: her public allegations, and her failure to produce any material evidence.    Julie Ann Horvath @hintjens I hope this conversation helps you better consider the implications of statements like these in the future.Well, my statements stand, and now I have more to back them up. Talking to a professional victim always leaves one with a nasty, unpleasant feel. There's no honesty there, just a shadow person who is good with charm and words. See, I didn't made any accusations. Just the implication. Neat, isn't it?    Julie Ann Horvath @hintjens and I also hope you have an awesome week 😊Sweet. I'd have expected a little more backwash from 24.6K followers, yet there we are.I then stumbled on Daniel Tennner's article on GitHub. This is worth reading. A few choice quotes:    These are all very clear signs of an open culture that’s being ripped to shreds. It’s tragic. It’s also terribly ironic to see the old bullshit excuse that “well, it just doesn’t work at this scale” being deployed.And:    When did the dream start dying? Who knows. But I have a hunch that it started before Tom Preston-Werner was ousted from the company, a couple of years ago, in a case of sexual harassment that was later dismissed as groundless. This smacks me of political play, a scenario very similar to what played out at AES, where an unrelated incident is used .. to weaken, attack or destroy it. GitHub was an open culture at the time. What did Tom do there? Why was it important to get him out?This story isn't over.Update 2 (2016/02/25)GitHub hires another political commissar, this one famous for enforcing political correctness on open source projects. The combination of charm and deniable brutality is familiar.",
