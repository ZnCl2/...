Kraken is good to buy coins using bank transfer.\nThough i do not like Bitcoin high transaction fees, 20+ minutes for transaction to \"complete\" and also high ecologic footprint (electricity consumption to confirm transaction - http://blog.zorinaq.com/bitcoin-mining-is-not-wasteful/, \"in 2 years. On this basis the per-transaction cost would not be $0.45 but $0.68.\"). Yet there are alternatives for Bitcoin and many merchants support also altcoins: https://coinmarketcap.com/",

			"body": "I think that there should be some step by step tutorial for noob users which will guide them on all various things they can do on zeronet, there should be links to most popular sites so people not getting stuck not knowing how to usefully spend time on zeronet and what to do.\nAlso i would welcome tooltips on many basic functions/buttons, that may not be clear for newcomers.\nI think ZeroHello interface is too basic and not meant for intensive usage. The interface should be more minimalistic to show more sites. Should allow better/instant filtering, categorizing, searching, sorting, custom naming groups of sites. Other member put it this way: \"The Zeronet front page would be so much easier to navigate if we could create custom collapsible categories for our added sites to sort them up instead of one large list.\"\nAlso there should be some link on ZeroHello where newcomers can see the list of the content management systems they can use to setup their own site and setup should be very convenient for noobs.\nZeroNet should allow much more creativity to its users in regards to creating sites, sharing content with other users.",
