While it seems possible to decide regulations using zeronet, I don't see a way enforcing rules with zeronet. Providing such a possibility is the true inovation of ethereum.\n\nby definition zeronet itself and every page on it can already be considered a dao. since taking down the creators server has zero effect and they can run any scripts you can write aka smart contracts. all you need is to make a sites code audit-able im sure that isnt hard\n\n",
