So my judgement what's possible with one or the other is indeed weak. But I  think I's at least much easier to reward wanted and penalize unwanted behaviour Money is a very good instrument for regulating things. On the other side for providing content zeronet seems to be the better option. At least internet is big enough for both and much more.\n",
