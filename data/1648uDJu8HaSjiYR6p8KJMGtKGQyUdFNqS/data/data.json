			"body": "# Zeronet Web Of Trust\n\n*   [Introduction](#introduction)\n    *   [What was this set out to resolve:](#what-was-this-set-out-to-resolve-)\n    *   [What this WILL NOT resolve](#what-this-will-not-resolve)\n    *   [Earning Trust](#earning-trust)\n    *   [How would this work?](#how-would-this-work-)\n    *   [Why this could work](#why-this-could-work)\n\n## Introduction\n\nUnder this system, we assume that all users are bots, all votes are by bots, unless we explicitly verify that \"that user isn't bot\" they will always assumed to be a bot, verified votes are \"prioritized\" to show beside total votes, and moderation actions are only performed if majority of trusted user agreed so...\n\nRead More below for a in-depth explanation of my ideas and how this could be made possible\n\n### What was this set out to resolve:\n\n*   This is made to resist vote manipulation and allow addition of votes for moderation actions(example: hiding a comment as spam)\n*   This system will need no centralizations of any form\n*   This does not invade privacy of one to verify one's humanity\n\n### What this WILL NOT resolve\n\n*   this will **NOT work** for public consensus voting as everyone will have different trusted list thus an agreement between all parties will never be met\n*   this is **NOT a way to block/ignore users by trust score** and was never intended to be used for blocking people with low scores unless it was an \"emergency\" when the network was under spam this should never ever be employed as this **leaves new user isolated and ignored** and felt left out\n\n### Earning Trust\n\nOne can earn trust of peers by doing useful things or just to interact and get acquainted once they think you have done enough to be trustable as a \"human\" they can assign you some score.\nNow think of this what if you want to vote it twice for that person to see, you have to fake interacting or to appear to be trustful for each new identity and each new target\n\n### How would this work?\n\nThis would work by first collecting a list of users who up voted say a post for example,\nand evaluating all of their trust scores, if their result is 0, they are ignored since you didn't trust them yourself or they have no one in your trust list that delegates their trust to them, there's a chance they might be bots\nFor the remaining users, they are tallied, and now your UI could show `20 upvotes[1000]` with the first one begin trusted and the bracket of total votes\n\nA more advanced system would be having your peers whom you trusted as moderators, everyone can vote for if a post should be hidden, and what reason should it be hidden under OR to vote that video as \"clear\"\n**Side note**: **the website itself is responsible of implementing the hiding mechanism**, the WOT is responsible of providing \"trustable users\" for the site to judge which content should be hidden\n\nIn example above, everyone can flag a post to be hidden with optional description and a main category, or flag it as clear the site can gather user's trust values to act upon said content, say: hiding a post if there's for example > 5 votes to hide it, and 70% of the users who voted agrees on hiding it\n\nUsers should be able to also see who you trusted voted for what, and delist users who intentionally voted otherwise, users them self also gets a say which the peers that trusted them will take it into account\n\n### Why this could work\n\nSending 100 users interacting with one user will no doubt raises suspicion of why 100 random strangers want to befriends me, thus it will get challenging as the undercover users you want increases.\n\nEven if someone has some time to kill they this definitely will make it tedious that it should hinder their progress and make it non cost-effective. And this principle and foundation how this idea could be resistant to Sybil attacks.\n\n## Abstract Ideas\n\n### Trust Score\n\nTrust score is basically a score given to every user, by default it should be 0,\n\n0 means humanity unsure, the system dont really know if the user is bots or human, better consider them as bots to be sure\n\n0~1 means on a scale of how much you trust them to be a human, 0.5 means 50%, anything above 1 gives user more voting power(within moderation action voting) and will also delegate your trust to their trust list(integrating whoever they trusted into your list)\n\n-0~-1 may be used as an explicit marker as this user is very likely to be bot\n\nsidenote: might be better off separating it into 2 different scores, trust and bot likeness\n\n### Trust delegation\n\nTrust delegation can happen when an individual has a trust above the trust delegation threshold OR explicitly enabled, it will attempt to seek out for said individual's trust lists\n\nHow much you trust the person's list is factored by how much trust score you given them, OR you can explicitly set another value to be used for trust delegation\n\nIn the abstract: a trusted b and b trusted c and c trusted d, therefore a also trusted d to some minor extend\nIF all b and c are above trust delegation threshold, possible mathematics of how this will work will be discussed in the technicality\n\n### Trust List merging\n\nUsers can have more then one trust list, to facilitate it a way a merging it would to be employ a priority list of trust list(which user can adjust), and follow the first value you found on the highest list as using addition and subtraction might create unintended side effects, we can consider adding the total value between the trust list and dividing it with the trust list that has said user be a possible alternative approach\n\n### Trust List Searching\n\nTo be done (also see trust list link)\n\n## Abstract Components\n\n### Trust list\n\nA trust list is just a file that stores how much points you given to someone, based on their auth address and it can also store other metadata like comment and known usernames+@provider and other future metadata\n\nInside the file there will be a global and a per site and a by merger zone's name trust list\nthe hierarchy order would be site->merger->global, site's trust list will be used, for each users unless that's not found, ,merger will be used or else it fallbacks onto global\nsites can have a SET user's score, or perform a mathematical operation of +-*/ it's global score\n\nA trust list itself has no owners by default, but it can be:\n\n*   Not signed by anyone\n*   Signed by someone/multiple entities\n*   Encrypted by someone's keys\n*   Private by not begin accessible online(example: stored in local drive)\n\nWhen user allocates a trust score, it can be saved in one or multiple trust lists, a user can own one or more trust lists,\na user can have multiple trust list files on multiple locations, multiple trust list file is merged into a single list, merged based on priority of the location\n\nUsers can \"link\" others to their trust list via any form of communications, and add the \"owner\" of the file to be whoever shared it, it can also detect it if it's signed by someone else, it can also be added as a standalone trust list file with the trust score of how much you trust the file itself\n\n### Trust list link file\n\nThis is a file that points to a trust list, should be on root of a site, or inside of a user's directory\nThis file can link to anywhere where the trust list of said user is stored\n\nIf this was on the site root, the link must start with the same address of the current site or it will be ignored unless user told it to do so, even if the link is valid no actions will be taken unless it's over the trust delegation threshold which then client will take it into account\nThis is useful for say me leaving a trust link file on my blog's root address that links to another more organized place for my actual list\n\nIf this was inside of a user directory, it will be crawled regardless of site, and applied if it's above the trust delegation threshold\nThis is useful for site admins to allow user to put their trust link file that points to their actual trust list on their personal site which only they have control over\nThis enhances security and make it unnecessary to put your trust list on every site but just a link to one place on your own site thus saves data space\n\n## Technicality\n\n### Casting Trust score into binary\n\nTrust score benefits more when not casted into binary of true or false, for example a person you trust more gets more say on if a post is \"clean\" or \"spam\" aka a biased moderation voting\n\nBut in certain situations it might needed to be casted into binary of trusted or not for example upvotes a post, it isnt used to vote if what should be done to that post but a purely cosmetic number of the people you trusted vs total votes\n\n### Trust score math\n\n(math related technicality probably wont be done here)\n\n### Trust score delegation\n\n(math related technicality probably wont be done here)"

			"body": "Inspired by [this thread](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1524765490_1D2E7WbvtaBxyunA2P3M1rFzsWBaZhDUCW) on ZeroTalk i decided to repost that concept here but in more detail and reworked.\n\nPlease note all of this is just a concept, i am too lazy to make this into something real, and most likely a lot will be overlooked\n\nThe Idea: We will mimic how zeronet works to prevent government takedown and censorship and also be able to securely hide the owner's identity within the swarms, we will also attempt to make this a two way protocol\n\nThe Concept: Some ideas of how it could be possible\n\nSending commands: All the owner has to do is to sign and publish a \"site\" to random peers, a few but not to many so that shall someone with malicious intent still can't find out who originally sent the command or is that node just propagating it through\n\nReceiving commands: When a peer receives a \"site update\" it verify signature and timestamp(to prevent replaying) and stores it then will send it to more peers, randomly select within 2 to 7 peers both number is arbitrary made up but the goal is to make sure it's not too small or not too big, it will also rebroadcast if it received the same file as it's current file if the timestamp is quite new, peers can also just ask random peers for the latest file(shall it was just rebooted up for example or periodically in case of missed packets)\n\nSending responses: If the command dictate a response is needed, it will create a message and append the responses and broadcast it to peers in the same manner of how a command is broadcasted, the peers will not write to file but save in memory and propagate it like the command with a TTL\n\nTo receive responses: The owner will just need to be connected to the swarms and wait for the response sites to be propagated\n\nProblems:\n\n- not instant\n\n- probably too much effort when you can spin up a tor server and be as secure or even better then this"
