Everybody can give points to your post and normal all posts have more than 50 points. Bad posts can be voted down and posts under 50 will not be shown to you. So you only see the good posts.\nFurther you can follow a trusted user and trust his trust list. \nThis is not perfect but works.\nI hope, we can have a WoT here as well.",
