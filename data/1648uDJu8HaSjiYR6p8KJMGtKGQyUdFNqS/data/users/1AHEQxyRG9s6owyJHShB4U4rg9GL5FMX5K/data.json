I mean assuming a user can only vote signed in. I'm not saying this couldn't have other uses like content aggregation.\n\nno zeronet does not use blockchain it only uses bitcoin cryptography\nbots can easily register hundreds of accounts in a quick succession if someone is motivated to make these bots to mass vote on something\nthere's nothing stopping them to spam or to maliciously vote for something",

So you only see the good posts.\n\nPersonally i dont agree on \"bad post\" like what makes a post \"bad\", most times it's always used as a \"i dont agree with you\" button,\nthus i just included things like matching a \"flaggable content\", example spam, nsfw etc which people are free to opt in/out of, both are separate things\nbut yeah you could have an \"opinion voting\" button which you only follow people you WOT trust, though i dont really think it's a good use of WOT",
