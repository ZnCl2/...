<h1><span style="font-size:1vw">07<sup>m</sup>30<sup>d</sup>2016<sup>y</sup>1<sup>p</sup></span> &#x131;tem durabl&#x131;ll&#x131;ty and defense</h1>
<p>Digiverse is going to need a way to keep players on their toes. How I have chosen to do that is to give player built structures a method of being damaged over time, so that the player base will need to upkeep infrastructure. All occupied building and city locations will be constructed by players. Cities will rise and fall, and creations may be razed by organizations, or destroyed in conflict. Sometimes PvE enemies may attack player fortifications. When damage is done to these structure from any source, they will lose durability.</p>
<p>Items like equipment, weapons, armor, and consumable items will not be burdened by durability. For consumables, some items will contain multiple uses charges as they represent items not used all at once, such as restoration items, food, and drink sources. Overall, durability will apply to structure and fortifications like automated turrets and active security. Passive structures like walls, statues, and buildings themselves will have much more durability than active structures which will need to be replaced as they are attacked.</p>
<p>As was mentioned before, structures will gain maximum durability as they are recreated, in order to promote the reuse of times. This will increase the durability of an item by a fixed amount. Interestingly, this means that the more a structure is targeted by an attacker, the stronger a defender becomes. As with the rest of the battle system, defensive structures will have parts associated with them like enemies do. A wall for example would have one ''wall'' segment with a very high durability value like 100 or 200, meaning vitality segments that would <span class="tooltip" title="Full damage is 4 points, 2 to what power equals 4? 2 durability would be lost. If 18 damage is delt, 2 to the power of ~4.16992 = 18. The floor function takes only the integer part of a floating point number. floor(4.16992500144) = 4. So 4 durability would be lost.">lose durability equal to <b>floor(log2(damage)) </b><i>[HOVER FOR TOOLTIP]</i></span> would require 50 to 100 strong attacks against the structure in order to incapacitate it.</p>
<p>Larger or more complex defensive structures could be created with the segmentation of parts for the digiversus system. A turret could be made of 1 movement, 2 weapon, 1 sensor, and 1 control segment. Where the control would be the vital segment, movement and sensor would target, and weapon would be the ability to attack. Other examples would be a camera-like object with 1 movement, 1 sensor, and 1 control segment; or a railgun-like defensive structure with 2 weapon, 2 power, 1 sensor, and 1 control segment. Where the defensive structure would be unable to move without movement segments. High power with the penalty of a limited targeting position. Further, we can help restrict this concept by requiring an exponential amount of resources, dependent on the number of segments included in a structure to prevent ridiculous player creations like: 10 movement, 10 control, and 1 weapon segment; or 1 control, and 10 weapon segments.</p>
<p>PS: I am including some mechanics in these posts like the tooltip and rarity tags. This is for testing. As digiverse is a text based browser game I would like to start early. I have had some good feedback on my ability to make animations in CSS exclusively. There is no javascript on this site. Remember the idea for digiverse is for it to be HTML, CSS, and PHP5 exclusively. So the challenge here is to limit myself through not being able to use stuff like jQuery for these animations although I would love to have bold text in my <span class="tooltip_a" title="Did you know you can style this too?

Like, it even supports carriage returns and text justification. The only problem I have with this example is that it shows two tooltips because the data is duplicated with the content CSS attribute. Oh well. It looks really nice, especially for tutorial text and other such information.">tooltips</span>.</p>

<h1><span style="font-size:1vw">07<sup>m</sup>26<sup>d</sup>2016<sup>y</sup>1<sup>p</sup></span> recycl&#x131;ng, repurpos&#x131;ng, and recreat&#x131;ng</h1>
<p>Well, I just some of my own contribution to the donation poll, to purchase a .bit domain. I have enough to retain the URL for 3 years or so. It is notice to see that this blog has 40 peers and that number has only been increasing since I first started posting. I thank you for your support of the blog. The more people we having using zeronet on a regular basis, the better this community will grow as a whole.</p>
<p>Let us now go over the topic of equipment and item management. Realistically we are going to have to restrict player inventory to discourage private hording of resources and promote community storage with player organizations. There are many ways to gather resources in digiverse, which include gathering, attack players and monsters, trade, and equipment management. Players will find a use for every item the game has to offer, especially through the upgrade system.</p>
<p>The first major way to retain resources will be through recycling. Recycling of crafted items and equipment will return a certain percentage of resources that were used in the original crafting of the that item. Higher level equipment that is recycled in this way will return portion of the total amount of resources used in all rituals up to that point. Encouraging the collection of equipment for resources along.</p>
<p>Next is repurposing. A mechanic will be put into place that will allow a player to substitute a number of resources needed for the construction of an item or fortification. This will replace the a larger amount of the required resources than what you would obtain from recycling. However, a player cannot receive potentially rare resources back from this process. This is a good option to alch items in order to ease the creation of an item. Repurposing cannot be used in place of the materials needed for a ritual, or for other challenges. It would be useful in cases where resources are needed for a machine or constructions used for organizations or encampments.</p>
<p>Finally there is recreation, which will contribute a significant amount of resources to the production of a new product. Because fortifications, structures, and constructions have a certain level of durability (The subject of the next post.), they will occasionally be repaired. Repairing of one of these items will restore the durability of the item at a depreciated rate. It is always better to create and use a new object in this way, rather than repair and existing object. Repairing will use less resources in the short run, but subsequent repairs will not be as effective or economically efficient as creating a new object to replace it. In order to mitigate the cost of recreating these objects, an older object can be recreated, contributing a larger portion of the resource requirement. Recreating an object multiple times will improve it quality and maximum durability over each iteration.</p>

<h1><span style="font-size:1vw">07<sup>m</sup>25<sup>d</sup>2016<sup>y</sup>1<sup>p</sup></span> equ&#x131;pment craft&#x131;ng and rar&#x131;t&#x131;es</h1>
<p><b>tl;dr - Prepare for a wall of text. Rarities in digiverse are not rarites so much as they are feats of human ingenuity.</b></p>
<p>Again, I am going to have to apologize for the lack of post frequency here. I have been working on another minor project for practice in dealing with genetic algorithms. That and playing MMOs like a loser. Also, I've had some personal issues involving relationship drama; this has taken up much of my free time over the past week. That should be all but resolved now. As always you are free to address any question to me, that should be answered rather quickly. An usually be made public knowledge here on the ''blogverse''. I like seeing new things in my inbox. We have a contact page.</p>
<p>Other than that, if you actually read this blog today's episode will cover the equipment crafting and rarity system. Unlike most lootfest styled games like Trove, Diablo, PSO... any MMO that comes out of Korea, China, or Japan. Digiverse will have equipment that matters. Equipment will not drop with a 50% chance every time you kill an enemy. In fact, equippable items will not drop at all. All equippable items in the game will have to be crafted by players. Equipment will be one of the few aspects of the game to which players have little control. Where players will have to search for items in order to increase the rarity of their equipment.</p>
<p>The first controller of equipment rarity will be the initial creation of the equipment. The materials in order to craft equipment will be determined by a research value based on the amount of materials used in the initial creation. Basically, let us say 20 Animal Hides, 40 Cotton Fabics, 12 Brass Rivets and 2 Brass Fittings are needed to craft a piece of armor. The crafting of this object will be instantaneous because I don't want there to be much in the way of waiting for crafting to finish. Nobody likes timed events.</p>
<p>A player may choose to instead craft multiple of an item at once. If they choose to mass produce an object, they will use less material over all. They must have ALL of the materials in order to get the craft bonus. For example, a player crafting 20 armors, will need 400 hide, 800 fabric, 240 rivets, and 40 fittings; in their possession to begin the crafting. The crafting however would only use 90% of that material. If a player only had 360 animal hide, they would get the reduced rate for crafting more than 10 armors (-5%), because they only have the material to craft 50. Crafting equipment in bulk like this, will generate basic equipment that can be traded to other players. When the equipment is generated it will randomize the rarity of the equipment.</p>
<p>The second contributor of equipment rarity, is the equipment upgrade system. In digiverse a player does not risk the destruction of their equipment. To promote the market, equipment of a certain rarity level will produce a lot of material if it is ever recycled, repurposed, or recreated (The subject of the next blog post.). Although, upgrading equipment will not harm it in any way, it will use an ''deterrent amount'' of personal resources. There are different kinds of upgrades equipment can have. Upgrades that only effect rarity, effect stat values, or give bonuses to certain actions a player will perform; usually in relation to combat or exploration actions like gathering or mining.</p>
<p>Upgrading equipment has the effect of being a personally daunting task. There aren't many people who are going to be upgrading equipment to high rarity. Because of the way equipment rarity is handled, upgrading equipment will either require a coordinated group effort, or an organization. Here is a breakdown of the rarities.</p>
<p><span class="label_w">COMMON</span> This is the most common result of crafting a new piece of equipment.</p>
<p><span class="label_g">UNCOMMON</span>10% of crafted equipment is labeled as a quality of uncommon. Having uncommon equipment changes the description listed in the player profile. Equipment can be upgraded to uncommon from common by consuming a list of common resources.</p>
<p><span class="label_b">RARE</span> 1% of crafted equipment is rare. Rare equipment adds a descriptive text to the player profile. To get from uncommon to rare, a moderate list of both common and uncommon resources must be consumed.</p>
<p><span class="label_p">HEIRLOOM</span> Heirloom equipment gained when any rare equipment is traded from one player to another. Because subsequent upgraded require antique rarity as a base, you can only obtain it through trade. It cannot be crafted. Heirloom equipment adds a small description to both the player profile and the equipment text itself. The only equipment for heirloom equipment is the trade from one player to another.</p>
<p><span class="label_gl">ARTIFACT</span> Now that you have the foundation for your career as a badass in the digiverse, you have to secure your position with an upgrade to artifact status. The creation of an artifact requires a long list of common, uncommon, and rare materials. The amount of materials will be reasonable for a player to obtain. Upgrading equipment to artifact status will broadcast a message to the members of your organization and to your immediate area. Your profile will gain a short description.</p>
<p><span class="label_r">RELIC</span> Your fame is growing, and with that you need equipment able to express your powerful influence. Creating a relic binds and item to existence to the digiverse preventing the object from being destroyed. In order to make this upgrade, a significant amount of resources of any quality will be need to provided by the player. While not too many more than required for the artifact upgrade, the materials will need to be sourced from all over the digiverse. Rare materials from rare event monsters may be required. It is possible for a single player to accomplish this, although difficult. In addition to the description provided on the profile, a player will be able to customize the name of their equipment. Upon completion of the upgrade, a broadcast will be made to the player's organization and immediate area.</p>
<p><span class="label_bl">LEGEND</span> Equipment of this rarity is not longer a feat that can be accomplished by just one man. Materials needed for the upgrade ritual will need a coordinated effort to gather. One player holding all of the materials required for the upgrade will initiate the start of the ritual. The item will need to be passed from one player to another, to be forged by 5 different players in order to acquire legendary status. An extreme level of trust will need to take place between yourself and others, as you need to rely on others to return your equipment to you after forging.  There will be no penalty imposed by the game management for equipment stolen from you in this way. Management of your equipment will be your responsibility. The after 5 people have forged the equipment, legendary status can be triggered by the killing of boss enemy. The description of the equipment will expand on the character profile to include the names of the players that contributed to the forging. After the crafting is complete, a message will be broadcast globally including whether or not the equipment created was stolen; if the name of the person who triggered the legendary status does not match the name of the person who started the ritual. So that they may be judged by the gameplay community.</p>
<p><span class="label_sp">MYTH</span> The next step on the road to digital godhood is the upgrade to mythical status. In order to reach mythical status, a coordinated group of players will need to earn all of the items listed to perform the upgrade ritual. The same forging ritual of 5 players will need to take place. The difference here, is that the forgers have to be 5 different organization leaders with organizations of a population of 100 or higher. The equipment should then be returned to the person who triggered the forging ritual. To trigger mythic status, the player will need to need to kill 5 different boss enemies. Upon triggering the mythic status, a global message will be displayed to all players, including who has stolen the item if it has been stolen. On the player profile, in addition to the description and the list of forgers, an icon will be included next to the player's name showing they own a piece of mythic equip, which will look like this <span class="label">xenith</span> <span class="label_sp">M</span>.</p>
<p><span class="label_q">EMPYREAL</span> Just when you thought your journey of immortality was over, you find out there is a higher level of enlightenment you can reach. Empyreality represents that which is transcendence, from the realm of the gods. In order to craft empyreal equipment you will need to acquire progressively more and more difficult lists of equipment. Once 5 of these rituals are triggered, you will expect you to need a few forgers. You would be correct. You will need to sacrifice 5 pieces of mythical rarity equipment. Each piece must have 5 forgers whom do not share names. Therefore 25 unique organization leaders will be required to forge this equipment. The upside to this, is that you do not have to trade the empyreal equipment in order to have it reforged. After you have completed the sacrifice, you will be required to deal the final blow to a server raid boss to trigger empyreal equipment status. After the trigger, a global message will be broadcast to all players, organizations, and a message will remain on the bottom of every page until a new piece of empyreal equipment is forged. This message will include a link to your profile. Players will be able to submit to you a description of your equipment that you can choose to display or ignore and downvote for 10 points. The 25 forgers will be listed on your profile, and you will receive a tag next to your name that looks like this. <span class="label">xenith</span> <span class="label_q">E</span>.</p></p>
<p><span class="label_qq">???</span> This rarity represents something that exists in defiance of its requirement of non-existence. Its transience within the digiverse is viewed as an abomination of the properties set in place by the foundation of the digiverse itself. It is an object beyond comprehension. The method of acquisition of this equipment rarity and the effect of its triggering are left intentionally unknown.</p>

<h1><span style="font-size:1vw">07<sup>m</sup>19<sup>d</sup>2016<sup>y</sup>1<sup>p</sup></span> d&#x131;g&#x131;versus battle system</h1>
<p>Sorry for the lack of posts in the last few days. I have a personal life, and you know that can be a little complicated sometimes. In today's post is going to explain the idea of how this battle system will work. We are going to give every player and enemy an array of target areas. A human would have 1 head segment, 2 arm segments, 2 leg segments, and 1 torso segment. The head would be high, the torso and arms mid, and the legs low. These would be the targetable areas of the player. The defending target could choose to protect the high, mid, or low segments. Defending the top segments would cause full damage to be delt to the low segments, and half damage to the mid. Defending the low segments would get full damage to the top, and half in mid. Defending the mid segments would get 50% damage to the top and lower segments. The difficulty would be in deciding which of the segments to defend.</p>
<p>Each segment would be subjected to a certain amount of damage. Every component of the body would need to have a specific rating of vitality to protect the target from attack. An attacker making a surprise attack has the advantage of making an attack against the defender without the opportunity to defend themselves. Some defenders will not be sentient enough to completely defend from and attack. Some equipment will improve the protection capability of defender. An attacker will be targeting a specific segment of their attack region. The defender will be defending a segment within that region. Only a total block of a segement will entirely prevent damage. Failing to blocking segment in a protected zone will still prevent lethal damage.</p>
<p>Another example of an enemy would be a giant ant, with 1 head, 1 sensor, 6 leg, and 2 torso segments; or an elephant with 1 head, 2 horn, 1 torso, 1 tail, and 4 leg segments. The elephant would be larger, and have certain bonuses to defending some segments, but penalties to the protection of others, like the torso.</p>
<p>Damage will come in the form of damage points. When an attack is made against a defender, a minimum of 4 points are used in the attack. Equipment will provide bonuses to the attack and defense during the encounter. Taking a full 4 points of damage will result a segment to lose 3 durability, 2 points for 2, 1 point for 1, 8 points for 4, 16 for 5... etc. When the durability of a segment is reduced to 0, the segment because unusable. Head and torso segments are considered vital. Loss of vital segments will result in loss of the encounter. Loss of less important limb segments can prevent a player or target from fleeing combat, moving quickly, or attacking and defending.</p>
<p>After an encounter ends, the losing player or targeted monster will be defeated and lose appropriate class experience if necessary. If a player is made to be damaged beyond vitality. They will respawn at a city location, a death message will be broadcast, and will lose 50% of the contents of their inventory, 10% of which is made is given to the player that defeated them. The winning player, even if only combating a npc monster, will still remain wounded, but be given the option to return to their nearest city location, to their organization, or to continue exploration.</p>

<h1><span style="font-size:1vw">07<sup>m</sup>15<sup>d</sup>2016<sup>y</sup>1<sup>p</sup></span> a rant about good pvp</h1>
<p>Every good online game is going to need an equally good battle system. Even if a game you develop is made to be purely co-operative PvE (Player Versus Environment) like for example a couple of my favorite games: Phantasy Star Online ver.4 Blue Burst for Dreamcast and PC by Sonic Team the creators of Sonic the Hedgehog, and Trove the Trion Worlds massively multiplayer online sandbox player versus environment roleplaying game (I think I covered everything #MMOSBPVERPG); you will have to create a player versus player system eventually, otherwise players feel like they are entirely restricted. This idea is entirely respectable. It is something a developer should be able to deliver to a game's community from release. People simply like knowing that they are the best. If you read the points breakdown on the main page, you knew this subject would come up in conversation eventually. There is no way it wasn't going to happen. Here is a explanation of the battle system.</p>
<p>In many games the PvP aspects of gameplay feel drastically different than that of the PvE. In Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst (PSOBB), the PvP doesn't feel right at all, because it is not what the game was developed to do. The game was engineered around brutal PvE combat, and a team of 4 players overcoming that pressure. It was not built for PvP balance because equipment was build to balance against the environmental hazards the game provides. A PvP focused character can target another player automatically across closed rooms for an amount of damage that would warrant instantaneous death. For example (and I'm sorry if you have no idea what I am talking about), a level 128 FOMarl (that provides a +50% damage bonus to light damage spells) with max mental strength (the stat that determines spell damage), using level 30 Grants (max level light damage spell to which there are few weaknesses), equipped with a Yin Yang Merge (an aura that boosts light damage by 50%), a Select Cloak (an armor that boosts light damage by 20%), a v801 (an armor mod that increases casting speed by 50%), x3 Adept (three copies of an armor mod that halves spell casting cost by 50%... so 1/8), and Mercurius Rod (AKA Caduceus a staff that boosts light damage by yet another 90% percent).</p>
<p>Needless to say this setup is okay against the last boss with a 90% damage resistance to light based damage, can STEAL A PLAYERS SOUL causing that player to take any damage directed to it, and is INVINCIBLE to damage half the time they are not doing this. Because the game is balanced for PvE gameplay. But for PvP, even against a Level 200 RACastel (class with highest base resistance) equipped with anything the game provides can only max about 50% light resistance. This means nothing when the highest HP a character has is capped at 2865, and I deal 6544 damage. Meaning I can 1 hit every player, from ''any distance I can effectively target at a range of 100 meters'' in a game where battles take place over typically 5... inches in front of your face. Casts in 20 frames (0.66 seconds). Allowing me to kill someone once every 4 seconds or so (because of resurrection animation time), by just standing in the same place. Against 3 other players (a max of 4 are allowed in a room), I am basically immortal.</p>
<p>This is only one example of how bad a PvP system can be, if a game is not developed for that purpose. For games that are developed with PvP in mind, they become immensly diverse with coordinated strategy and mechanics. EVE Online is a fantastic example of this, with in game wars <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/eve-online-battle-cost-virtual-war-damages-valued-500000-1551788" target="_blank">costing hundreds of thousands of US dollars</a> an thousands of hours of gameplay management time. Another spaceship management game OGame, at one time a browser based phenomenon now practically unknown, with communities dedicated with legitimate control centers actively monitoring a galaxy. This level of user engagement an outlandish but desirable outcome of the game development process. Even a small coordinated, active group of players can <a href="https://secure.tibia.com/mmorpg/free-multiplayer-online-role-playing-game.php" target="_blank">make a game legendary</a>.</p>
<p>In the next post I will cover what will make digiverse different from others games when it comes to PvP combat.</p>

<h1><span style="font-size:1vw">07<sup>m</sup>14<sup>d</sup>2016<sup>y</sup>1<sup>p</sup></span> handl&#x131;ng the player database</h1>
<p>This is going to be a shorter post, I just wanted to discuss and issue that I will have to deal with some time in the future. It has to deal with the database for the character information. As you may well know, each player has their own character file the the server reads instead of a proper MYSQLi database or something like that. This is part of the challenge proposed by the creation of this game in stock PHP5 or eventually PHP7. This issue here has to deal with the database management for the player ranking system. Because the class ranks are dependent of the player positions in the leaderboard. There first has to actually be a leaderboard. How is this going to be done?</p>
<p>I said before that there would be a python script in the server files. The purpose of this script is to once a day, cycle over the player files. It will be built to read all of the files and sort each stat into a leaderboard. Cycle back and edit these files to split the players into the 10 permission groups for each player class. At the end of each day, there will be an equal number of players for each permission rank.</p>
<p>Now, this sorting is only handled once a day, because in digiverse, the permissions access shouldn't be realtime anyway. Even though having a realtime ranking system would be useful for the players to see progress, updating the permission from this too quickly could cause malicious players to exploit permissions granted to them while they are available. Or to have organization members temporarily boost other players to allow them to get around permissions. To prevent this, providing players a change to permissions every 24 hours will give players time to adjust to changes made to their permissions.</p>

<h1><span style="font-size:1vw">07<sup>m</sup>13<sup>d</sup>2016<sup>y</sup>1<sup>p</sup></span> stat&#x131;st&#x131;cs and attr&#x131;butes</h1>
<p>Right now I am expanding the arrays of the files for the ''character sheet'' players will be using to manage their statistics. The file will add lines for current rank, and points available in the 9 classes. After which the stats for the battle system will be listed. This of course brought me to the next logical question. What would the battle system even look like for this game.</p>
<p>I have a several available ideas for this. The first idea was to have a variable driven stat system that would make large damage numbers common place. This would manage a number of player statistics like; physical damage, defense, accuracy, evasion, distance to the opponent... etc. I feel like this could be augmented by ''enchantments'' on weapons and armor with a crafting system that was complex and ever improving.</p>
<p>The second big one I had would make the game more of a ''tabletop'' game with die rolls and the like. Were weapons could be improved with stat augmenting bonuses. Where players would have a strength, dexterity, endurance, intelligence, resistance, and charisma score. Similar to dungeons and dragons, pathfinder, or d20 modern. This would give the game an overall different feel as I'm not sure if I want to go that way.</p>
<p>My third idea was to scrap the idea for ''statistics'' and go for a semi-real combat system that dealt more the strategic placement of attacks, and leave the ability to mortally wound the opponent or to protect one's self. Giving and attacking player, or defending monster some kind of ''rock paper scissors'' style artificial intelligence built to make the game really difficult. The options for hitting a target will be ''high medium low'' to which they would be weighted to hinder and opponent based on where the shot was targeted. I will write more on this battle system later as that is what I feel like I might be actually going with.</p>
<p>I really do want to stay away from ''player statistics'' as far as possible. Leaving the game itself to be mostly a game of skill. At the same time I want the battle system to be influenced by player equipment enough to promote its creation. Leave is just useful enough to warrant an in game economy built around it.</p>

<h1><span style="font-size:1vw">07<sup>m</sup>12<sup>d</sup>2016<sup>y</sup>1<sup>p</sup></span> open source</h1>
<p>I was asked by haskell over email. About whether or not the source of digiverse would be made public. After an initial denial of digiverse's ''open sourcity'', I have taken a bit of time to think about it. My reasons for declining a release of the source to digiverse stems from the need for a digiverse server to have an large of a number of users as possible. Opening the source to the public would mean others could open their own servers. As much as I would appreciate this level of dedication to spreading the project around; it could <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect" targe="blank">split an already niche community into individually weaker groups</a>.</p>
<p>However, leaving the software proprietary tends to keep users from engaging with the project, as all of those involved want some kind of idea as to how it works. Right now I am streamlining the login and database portion of the server, commenting the code, indenting it to make it more readable by others. So the intention is to share it along it's journey to becoming an enjoyable medium. I will probablt link it up on github sometime in the future.</p>

<h1><span style="font-size:1vw">07<sup>m</sup>11<sup>d</sup>2016<sup>y</sup>1<sup>p</sup></span> beg&#x131;nn&#x131;ng software supplement</h1>
<p>Alright, I spent most of today playing around with the PHP code I have running the server security, and I have to say I am pretty happy with it. There isn't much I can do to improve it without any hard testing. I am working on the server communication to the game engine, basically to get player stats like points, and permissions up and working.</p>
<p>I figure the hardest part of actually coding the game will be setting up the user permission to submit content, and organize the player chatrooms to make the inaccessible to other players. The chat rooms are going to need some kind of token ID. I mean the chat rooms not need to as security as the login to the server, but it shouldn't be that hard to add just a little extra security.</p>
<p>When the game is actually in a testable state (which willn't be any time soon I can assure you), I would like to have at least 1,000 testers actively harassing the server with inputs. Which I would personally find pretty interesting to watch. I should have support of a webserver to run this game on without any outside help. I administrate a hacking forum after all (<a href="https://hightechlowlife.eu/" target="_blank">http://hightechlowlife.eu</a> - shameless plug).</p>
<p>Anyone taking part in the indev, alpha, beta testing of the game will get any of the benefits I decide to implement for donators. Also, thank you to those people actively paying attention to the blog. Additionally, the creators of notepad++ need a free scotch. Best software in existence, I couldn't live without it.</p>

<p>Sorry for a lack of a post yesterday. No excuses I just didn't have anything worth posting. I think I do today though. I was thinking about how we would do some kind of donation incentives in game. Every website is going to need revenue to stay aloft. I wouldn't necessarily want to showcase advertisements. If it has to be done, they would be as unintrusive as possible. The problem with donation incentives is that in most games they mean providing a paying player with an advantage that other player's don't have.</p>
<p>This tends to make the non-paying players feel like paying is the only real way to win. The way around this, is to provide donation incentives that do not provide a gameplay advantage, and are purely cosmetic.</p>
<p>Purely cosmetic additions to the ''gameplay experience'' of digiverse may include programmatic appearance to usernames, constructions, descriptions and submissions. This would be used to supplant what players would normally see, giving the a donating player a psychological advantage over other players for the shear sake of being different to them. Often paying player would get a badge of some sort showing that they have donated a certain amount to the server, and that could be easily implemented. In addition to this, I would provide players to customize the appearance of their submissions, allowing them to stand out more against other submissions.</p>
<p>Things that would not make good donation incentives would be anything that would alter the point mechanics of the game to accelerate gameplay. Like any kind of ''50% more fighting class points'' for example. This gives a clear advantage to playing players thus making the game pay-to-win. However, altering penalties would not give too clear of an advantage. For example, eliminating the loss of points penalties for user submissions with bad reviews. Whenever a player makes a submission, they take a risk of bad reviews from other users on the server because of the democratic voting. We could remove or mitigate that penalty for donating users, as they deserve more influence in creating gameplay elements, because these players care about the game enough to donate to it.</p>
<p>This doesn't just cover donation incentives, this carries over to advantages given to alpha and beta testers of the game as well. Players on a server should know who have been in the game for a long time. Especially, in a social game like digiverse, knowing the experienced players can provide new players helpful information, and veteran players points in the helper and teller classes. These veteran players would find an ease in submitting content to the game, and with support from the development team should they have issues. Catering to seniority will help keep the game running for as long as possible.</p>

<p>So it's 4:16am right now, and I can't sleep. I don't really know why. I didn't sleep yesterday either. Not because of this or anything, but just general insomnia because that is how I am. I was just laying in bed banging my head into my pillow thinking maybe the rhythm would help me fall asleep. Needless to say that wasn't working. I popped open ZeroNet to realize 15 people have viewed this blog, which is basically a follow. Thank you very much for the distribution.</p>
<p>While trying to fall asleep my mind wandered into some of the issues in digiverse would run into that would be reoccurring. One of the main issues is the ranking system for the users and how that would be maintained over time. Because of the database structure, it is nor practically to create an ordered list of each user to be sorted each time a point is gained by a player or a rank changes. Realtime change of the ranks for roles would cause some minor issues with permissions should a player's rank drop in the middle of an action or something like that.</p>
<p>My solution to this issue would be to program a python script to, maybe 1-4 times a day, cycle through the users to check rankings and update the user data. In the mean time, each player could have a status bar on the side that would tell them how much their points have changed since the last ''server update''. Which would give the players some indicator of making progress. The ranking system could have a minibar or the like below the ranking system that would basically say ''this is how close you would have been to the next rank before the last server update''.</p>
<p>Another issue is the managing the chat overall for the player organizations. Deciding between if the logs should be cleared after a server update. I think that would be the best option to clear space, considering player organizations might be posting very frequently. It might also be beneficial to have some sort of ''chain of command'' for chat permissions, which would basically require me to come up with an IRC-like permissions architecture. Neither of these things are really an issue, to solve. Just a little bit of work.</p>
<p>Another issue I went over in my mind was the difficulty of new submitters to create new content with no content already in play. I will have to create a ''skeleton'' framework for the game in order for people to be able to work into submitting content. With the addition of requiring 100 votes before a submission can be implemented; which itself requires 100 active players. Implying that digiverse would be that popular immediately with zero user created content from the beginning. That would have to be worked in.</p>
<p>The final big issue I had was an anti-bot anti-cheat system that would post up traps for macro scripts in the browser like the ''imacros'' firefox addon. Because attacking an enemy harms the player over time, benefiting from automating that process would be more difficult than just gathering materials. Gathering of materials will be controlled by a random event handler that would roll through what the player obtains, or runs into while looking for materials. Because the game does not rely on graphics, bandwidth is very much preserved. I did not want to be like most browser games, and simply restrict the number of actions a player can make per hour, or some other kind of ''energy system''.</p>
<p>This issue is that automation of this gathering process boils down to ''press this button'' until something interesting happens or you get bored. This may tempt a player to do this for many minutes, sometimes hundreds or thousands of times. My anti-bot solution involved randomly generated bot traps with buttons coded like they are on every other page. However, a viewer to this page would instead see at ''CLICK THIS HUGE BUTTON'' prompt appear at a random interval. The smaller button would capture the script. If the button is clicked, the privilege of farming materials is restricted until the next server update. The rest of the game would still be freely available to them however.</p>

<p>Blog is now officially up on ZeroNet. I really do like this distributed internet thing. Such an interesting concept should not go unnoticed. Anyhow if you stumbled on to this blog, I will post try to post something digiverse related every day. I will try to refrain from posting images to save on everyone's bandwidth. There is currently only one image on this server. That would be the QR code on the donation page. I will start sharing stuff from the server here via imgur.</p>
