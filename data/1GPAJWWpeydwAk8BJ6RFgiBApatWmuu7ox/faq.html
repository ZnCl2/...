<h1>Q: What is the release date?</h1> 
<p>d&#x131;g&#x131;verse is only a concept. The code is in development, but we are not even sure the concept is feasible. I will personally have to do some research into deep search, especially if d&#x131;g&#x131;verse is going to traffic a high number of users.</p>

<h1>Q: How many people are working on this?</h1> 
<p>I am not going to give any names directly, but there are currently 12 people on the d&#x131;g&#x131;verse design document.</p>

<h1>Q: Who are you?</h1> 
<p>You can call me xen&#x131;th.</p>

<h1>Q: What kind of framework will d&#x131;g&#x131;verse be running?</h1> 
<p>An apache webserver WAMP/LAMP, programmed exclusively in PHP5 and some server side python scripts that aren't even going to be on the webserver.</p>

<h1>Q: Will this framework be secure?</h1> 
<p>I like to fancy myself as a cryptanalyst, so if you consider SHA512 a safe hashing algorithm, and think that sanitizing, salting, and hashing every bit of user input is an appropriate amount of caution; then we will get along just fine. Here is what one of the user files looks like. The first line is the username, followed by a hashed password (salted dynamically), the unique salt for this account (which changes after every login), and the user token (salted).

If you have any doubts about my server security. Feel free to attack the SHA512 to find the password. That file is legitimately from the server architecture. The password is only 8 characters long, lowercase alphanumeric. Be lucky you have this example. On the server, even the filenames are salted hashes.

<h1>Q: Will d&#x131;g&#x131;verse be pay to win?</h1> 
<p>Never. The game will give players no gameplay reward for donating. Only a cosmetic button, or change of player skin. Which is funny because this game is primarily text only.</p>

<h1>Q: How will the d&#x131;g&#x131;verse economy work anyway?</h1> 
<p>The game economy will be based on the number of players within the digiverse. Each time a player enters the game the maximum amount of currency on the server will be increased by 10,000. All players will start with 0 currency. Players will earn currency initially by killing monsters. A monster will drop a number of currency equal to its point value. This will circulate through the economy. This currency is a required component to craft equipment (not necessarily excluding other items). This is how the currency will be removed from the economy. If there is no currency to give out, it will no longer be given by killing monsters, and more must be removed from the economy before it can pay out again.</p>

<h1>Q: Will d&#x131;g&#x131;verse be open source?</h1> 
<p>Yep, give me a little time to prepare the framework. It will be made available as soon as possible.</p>

<h1>Q: Why is everything so orange?</h1> 
<p>Do you know of any other sites that use a primarily orange color scheme? Seriously though making variants is nothing. If you want more styles I can even save them as a cookie or in the player save file server side.</p>
