			"body": "Note - Horizon won't work if the zeronet rev is lower than **3582**.\n\n搜索太慢怎么办？\n\nWhy it's so slow to search?\n\n因为Horizon的数据几百万行，而零网现在又不支持Full text search，要等到零网迁移到python3才能用。\n\nBecause Horizon has millions of data.And zeronet doesn't support Full text search.So it will be slow,but if zeronet uses python3 to support FTS(this is planed),it will be quicker.\n\n进度条不动20多分钟了，咋回事\n\nI'm waiting for Horizon about 20 minutes,but it doesn't show the result.Why?\n\n绝大多数情况都是因为程序出bug了，请按`F12`查看开发者工具的输出并反馈给我。\n\nUsually,there is a bug in the program,please press `F12` and report me with the console output\n\n也有可能是因为站点版本过低导致无法搜索，请在github[下载](https://github.com/blurHY/Horizon)最新版Horizon并在零网目录里替换 (目录类似于`F:\\ZeroNet\\data\\1CjMsvhJ2JsV4B5qo3FDHnF3mvRCcHuxBn`)\n\nMaybe that's because your Horizon's version is too low.You should [download](https://github.com/blurHY/Horizon) from github and replace Horizon. The folder looks like `F:\\ZeroNet\\data\\1CjMsvhJ2JsV4B5qo3FDHnF3mvRCcHuxBn`",
