So your ZeroNet content is spreading fast.\n\n> I could just publish to 1~3 peers currently.I'm a passive peer\n\nThis is weird. The majority of ZeroNet users are in China. Even from me, from Russia, many hundreds of Chinese peers are visible. Yes, there may be problems with leaving China abroad, but inside China, the connections between the ZN-nodes should be free? Or I do not understand how the Chinese firewall works?",
