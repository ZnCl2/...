			"body": "This must be now my third night without regular alcohol consumption. I ran out of my homebrewed apple cider rather quickly, and had to go back to buying it from the store... so now I have to make more.This time I'll probably just use pre-made apple juice, so as to not have to spend a whole night in the kitchen slicing apples... then freeze-concentrate it to a 20-30% liquor after 2-3 months fermenting, so as to avoid having to bottle it. Fill up both of my 30L fermenters.\n \n..The thing is, though. Here I was thinking that going without alcohol for more than a day, would wind up killing me, or making me go nuts. It's actually been pretty okay.\n \nThe way I look at it, I'm actually enjoying the opportunity to take a break from Routine. Addiction is order... addiction is a routine. I can't stand living in a routine, it drives me insane. Predictability and routine are pretty much .. the very thing I am fighting against, in my life.\n \nI need a constant change of scenery, I need constant excitement ... and for me, just temporarily quitting booze, for the lulz ... after a long period of non-stop consumption ... that's, the best thing ever. Like that day I got hit by a car - I actually nearly laughed when I hit the concrete. It scares me to death, thinking about it .. but when I was in the moment, I was elated. It was a change in routine. It was something different ... so I embraced it. I bragged about it.\n \nThat doesn't mean I would embrace sobriety, mind you. Again ... we're talking about Routine, and I can't handle routines. They make me go koo-koo.",
