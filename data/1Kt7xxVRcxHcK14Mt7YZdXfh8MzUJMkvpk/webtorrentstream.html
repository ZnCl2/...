<body>

<p>On this ZeroNet based webpage (which can be delivered from multiple people) we are streaming a video file over <a href="https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent">WebTorrent</a> protocol (thanks to the WebRTC and WebTorrent .js included in this webpage). If you see the video (it appears in my case with like a minute dalay :), it means that your <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/webrtc.html" target="_blank">web browser has WebRTC enabled</a> and WebTorrent Javascript that is included in this webpage worked and your firewall not blocking the connection.</p>

<p>The webtorrent streaming NOT worked when i used .torrent or magnet link from btorrent.xyz or instant.io. But streaming worked, when i created torrent from within Windows application "<a href="https://webtorrent.io/desktop" target="_blank">WebTorrent Desktop</a>" and used provided magnet link. Im may no more seed the video. The video that should be played is webtorrent.io/torrents/sintel.torrent one.</p>

<a href="webtorrentstreamsource.txt">There is HTML source code of this webpage</a><br>


<!--<p>The initial seeder of the torrent can be any person/s, and moreover this video can be streamed from multiple people thanks to Web torrent .js which makes all video watchers (that have WebRTC enabled) to stream video to all others watchers.</p>-->

<!--<p>So this distributed webpage loaded by many people/peers and distributed video that can be streamed between all its current visitors and also streamed by all volunteers that wish to stream it. If i provide magnet URL (it is in this page source code) anyone can add it into his/her Web Torrent enabled torrent client (like Web Torrent Desktop) to download video and also help seeding it.</p>-->

<br>
<p>Below should be the sample video seeded by webtorrent.io (widescreen video) and also a <abbr title="Video can have bad connection, refresh page a few times or im offline.">video seeded by me (Bruce Lee video)</abbr>:</p>
