			"body": "A useful post, especially for newcomers. It's really wonderful how you could bind Optional files + Big files + Merger sites + etc. together. I think @nofish: is now asking himself how he created such a platform.\n\nNow some notices.\n\n> The Merger Zite/Genre is named from itself, rather than the callback zite (which is how it's done in Git Center).\n\nThe main reason I moved ~everything from merged sites to merger site (there is only redirect in merged site) is updating.\n\nFor example, soon you'll want to make hubs for genres+authors, not only genres. You won't be able to add inputs to old hubs. Or if you would want to rename ZeroLSTN, you'll have to leave an old ZeroLSTN.bit address because of backward compatibility.\n\n> The Merger Zite doesn't auto-redirect when visiting it, and allows you to specify on which URL it'll return to to install the new Genre.\n\nThis one is a good idea. I'm now thinking how to implement auto-updating on Git Center to change redirect code.",
