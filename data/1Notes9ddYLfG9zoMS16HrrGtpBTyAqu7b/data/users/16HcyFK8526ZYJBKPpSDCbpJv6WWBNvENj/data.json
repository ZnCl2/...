It will be very good for users to understand zeronet more quickly, as this kind of feature is a killer feature! Keep up the good work man\n\nThank you for the kind comment :)\n\n> The main reason I moved ~everything from merged sites to merger site (there is only redirect in merged site) is updating.\n\n> For example, soon you'll want to make hubs for genres+authors, not only genres. You won't be able to add inputs to old hubs. Or if you would want to rename ZeroLSTN, you'll have to leave an old ZeroLSTN.bit address because of backward compatibility.\n\nYes, I was aware of this issue and somehow have managed to not have to fix Genre sites yet for any reason. \n\nFor author-based sites, that should be fine since I'll just need to change new Genre instances to mention that the name can be a Genre or an Author. I'm still waiting for that inevitable bug that affects old Genre sites for some reason though.\n\nAs for the name, hopefully it won't need to be changed :)",
