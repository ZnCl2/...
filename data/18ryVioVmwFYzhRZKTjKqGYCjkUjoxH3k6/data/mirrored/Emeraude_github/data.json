It can be by looking at te files and replacing them by the new ones, but a very few part of the users will be able to do that.\r\n\r\nHere is a proposition to fix it:\r\nAdd the following entry in the `content.json` file of the cloneable zite:\r\n```json\r\n\"repository\": \"https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroBlog\"\r\n```\r\nRegularly (let's say once a day), zeronet will check for all the updates, and the cloned zite admin will have a notification on its ZeroHello page, asking him if he want to update its zite.
