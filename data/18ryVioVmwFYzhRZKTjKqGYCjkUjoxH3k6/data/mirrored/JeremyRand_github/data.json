GPLv3 reflects these changes too. Whenever someone conveys software covered by GPLv3 that they've written or modified, they must provide every recipient with any patent licenses necessary to exercise the rights that the GPL gives them. In addition to that, if any licensee tries to use a patent suit to stop another user from exercising those rights, their license will be terminated.\r\n> \r\n> What this means for users and developers is that they'll be able to work with GPLv3-covered software without worrying that a desperate contributor will try to sue them for patent infringement later. With these changes, GPLv3 affords its users more defenses against patent aggression than any other free software license.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/rms-why-gplv3.html also says:\r\n\r\n>  Another threat that GPLv3 resists is that of patent deals like the Novell-Microsoft pact. Microsoft wants to use its thousands of patents to make users pay Microsoft for the privilege of running GNU/Linux, and made this pact to try to achieve that. The deal offers rather limited protection from Microsoft patents to Novell's customers.\r\n> \r\n> Microsoft made a few mistakes in the Novell-Microsoft deal, and GPLv3 is designed to turn them against Microsoft, extending that limited patent protection to the whole community. In order to take advantage of this protection, programs need to use GPLv3.\r\n> \r\n> Microsoft's lawyers are not stupid, and next time they may manage to avoid those mistakes. GPLv3 therefore says they don't get a \u201cnext time\u201d. Releasing a program under GPL version 3 protects it from Microsoft's future attempts to make redistributors collect Microsoft royalties from the program's users.\r\n> \r\n> GPLv3 also provides users with explicit patent protection from the program's contributors and redistributors. With GPLv2, users rely on an implicit patent license to make sure that the company which provided them a copy won't sue them, or the people they redistribute copies to, for patent infringement.\r\n> \r\n> The explicit patent license in GPLv3 does not go as far as we might have liked. Ideally, we would make everyone who redistributes GPL-covered code give up all software patents, along with everyone who does not redistribute GPL-covered code, because there should be no software patents. Software patents are a vicious and absurd system that puts all software developers in danger of being sued by companies they have never heard of, as well as by all the megacorporations in the field. Large programs typically combine thousands of ideas, so it is no surprise if they implement ideas covered by hundreds of patents. Megacorporations collect thousands of patents, and use those patents to bully smaller developers. Patents already obstruct free software development.\r\n> \r\n> The only way to make software development safe is to abolish software patents, and we aim to achieve this some day. But we cannot do this through a software license. Any program, free or not, can be killed by a software patent in the hands of an unrelated party, and the program's license cannot prevent that. Only court decisions or changes in patent law can make software development safe from patents. If we tried to do this with GPLv3, it would fail.\r\n> \r\n> Therefore, GPLv3 seeks to limit and channel the danger. In particular, we have tried to save free software from a fate worse than death: to be made effectively proprietary, through patents. The explicit patent license of GPLv3 makes sure companies that use the GPL to give users the four freedoms cannot turn around and use their patents to tell some users, \u201cThat doesn't include you.\u201d It also stops them from colluding with other patent holders to do this.\r\n\r\nThe tl;dr is that, indeed, the GPLv3 is better than GPLv2 if you oppose software patents.", "added": 1572772265, "modified": 1572772265, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2269#issuecomment-549130428", "source_type": "github"}], "1604067608_mirrored_ZeroNetTickBot_github": [{"comment_id": 16, "body": "It's not clear to me why both of the following are listed:\r\n\r\n* GPLv3+ if you accept switching to GPLv3 or later\r\n* GPLv3 if you accept switching to either GPLv3 or later or to GPLv3-only\"\r\n\r\nBoth of these are legally equivalent, because any software that is licensed under GPLv3+ (3 or later) can be re-licensed under GPLv3 (3 only) without any further authorization from the copyright holder.\r\n\r\nAre you intending to overload this poll by simultaneously asking what licenses the authors' work is under, *and* asking what licenses the author politely recommends that the ZeroNet maintainers relicense it under?

Specifically, a user can license their own work under a superset of the licenses that they are recommending that ZeroNet choose to use.  That's the point I was trying to convey (and it empirically appears that I did not do a good job of explaining this): the overloaded interpretation of the poll question looked to me like this:\r\n\r\n* \"GPLv3\": I agree to license my own contributions under GPLv3+, but I politely recommend that ZeroNet choose to relicense them under GPLv3-only.

They are different in terms of what the author is *recommending* that ZeroNet maintainers do, which is solely up to the ZeroNet maintainers.  That's why I asked about whether this was an overloaded poll question -- these are both very valid questions to be asking (what can ZeroNet legally do, and what is ZeroNet recommended to do), but it wasn't clear to me if the question was intended to cover both of them, or if there was some confusion about whether GPLv3+ code can be re-licensed to GPLv3-only.\r\n\r\nDoes that make more sense?", "added": 1573061011, "modified": 1573061121, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2273#issuecomment-550484870", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 24, "body": "> Actually, I'm not sure whether the GPLv3+ option allows us to license contributions under GPLv3-only.

Idk....\r\n\r\n@krixano In my totally-not-legal-advice opinion, giving permission for a 3rd  party to license your work under a given license is mostly equivalent to re-licensing that work yourself.  There is arguably a difference in the sense that I can distribute my code to 2 people under 2 different licenses, and each person is bound by a different license, and whoever they distribute it to is bound by whatever license the person whom they got it from was bound by.  But this distinction is basically meaningless in this case, so I wouldn't worry about it.\r\n\r\nBut yes, it is totally possible (and, I would argue, reasonable) for the ZeroNet maintainers to ask contributors to (1) state what licenses the ZeroNet maintainers are legally allowed to use, and (2) state a polite non-binding recommendation of which subset of (1) they'd like ZeroNet to go with.  I think combining these two questions into a single question isn't ideal.  But, since (1) is by far the most important, and (1) is the main question being asked in this poll, my opinion is that we're fine, and anyone who wants to answer (2) can do so informally in a free-form comment.  After all, since (2) is a recommendation, it may be that the ZeroNet maintainers will want to take argumentation/reasoning into account rather than just tallying votes, since it's ultimately up to the ZeroNet maintainers what to do with respect to (2).", "added": 1573062992, "modified": 1573062992, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2273#issuecomment-550496773", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 30, "body": "> Ok...

If they accidentally voted for a recommended license instead of a permitted license, then the only harm that's been done is that ZeroNet maintainers might have fewer choices about what license they can pick.

I am of the opinion that the security necessity of preserving the old repo for audits will outweigh whatever copyright interests are at play, for the same reason that no one has sued the operators of CT logs [1] for illegal content that they're hosting.  I *would* however recommend that the old audit-only repo have one final commit appended to it, which removes all files and adds a readme explaining why the repo has been recreated, and explaining that the old repo is only there for security audits.

Yes, without a doubt.  However, I am not in the business of shitting on projects, or refusing to work with them, just because they have shortcomings.  In order for me to shit on a project over something like this, the project would need to demonstrate that they don't care about those shortcomings and have no intention of fixing them.  That is not the case for ZeroNet; I've spoken with both Tamas and Lola extensively, and it is clear to me that they want to fix those issues.  Work is ongoing to fix the situation (and this is a collaboration between me and Tamas and Lola), so I'm satisfied and have no intention of removing mentions of ZeroNet from Namecoin.org.  Why is it taking a while to get the situation fixed?  Because it's hard for me to get funding for ZeroNet-related Namecoin work, so I usually need to find a way to justify that work as relevant to another use case, and find a way to implement those deliverables so that they meet the requirements of the other use case but happen to also make things better for ZeroNet.  This will hopefully change in early 2020.
