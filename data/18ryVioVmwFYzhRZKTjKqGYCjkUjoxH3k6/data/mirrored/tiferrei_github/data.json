I was wondering if the `zeronet.conf` file on the data dir could take this kind of parameters and options? Would be cool to have the same level of customisation.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\ntiferrei", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1496006813, "modified": 1499441468, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/958", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 2, "comment": {"1604065940_mirrored_tiferrei_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "Does it support pretty much all the script arguments then?
