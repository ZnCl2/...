And, indeed, when navigating to the site, all three point to the same site. All the same folder. This results in having the site listed 3 times in the sidebar. See the attached image. \n\n![screen shot 2016-03-07 at 1 08 50 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4239836/13564814/355091b2-e401-11e5-98b3-202f5355115d.png)\n\nThe only difference between them is the case-sensitivity, which is entirely irrelevant it seems when navigating to the site, and managing the site folder. Further, the system doesn't allow me to delete the 'real' one (the one with proper case sensitivity that was generated automatically) due to owning it, however, the other two are freely able to be deleted.\n\nFrom what I can tell, this happens when you navigate to a site using improper case. I can't imagine this is the intended functionality.\n\nEdit: Try the example on the link you provided. Navigate to '1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipt' (with a lowercase t at the end instead of capital). It'll navigate to the site, create a new entry in sites.json, and have two sites that are functionally identical in the side bar.\n", "added": 1457331193, "modified": 1457331522, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/333#issuecomment-193172440", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065398_mirrored_MoreJ_github": [{"comment_id": 2, "body": "Yup.
