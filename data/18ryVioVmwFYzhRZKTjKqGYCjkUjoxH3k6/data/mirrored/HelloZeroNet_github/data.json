(SSD performs better on loading many, small files)\n\nThere is multiple possibility to solve this:\n- Lazy load content.json files to memory (only when requested by the client eg. need to verify a changed file). I have already made it working as experiment and it's also dramatically reduces the memory usage (80MB->40MB), but there is some command (list all content.json newer than X date) that needs to check every file. To workaround this problem maybe we should index the content.json modification date in a db or simple json file.\n- Instead of using raw file system we could store the content.json files in database (Sqlite or Berkeley DB) I have also made benchmark on this, the results on an crazy slow, overloaded VPS (loading and parsing content.json from a site with 5000 users):\n\n```\nsqliteRead  | 3.992s Mem: 10.50MB(+0.92MB)\nbsddbRead  | 2.624s Mem: 11.11MB(+0.61MB)\njsonRead  | 331.137s Mem: 11.11MB(+0.00MB)\n```\n\nFile size:\n- On FS: 3.2MB\n- Sqlite: 6MB\n- Bsddb: 5.7MB\n", "added": 1463998871, "modified": 1464003555, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/463#issuecomment-220978182", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065319_mirrored_EtherTyper_github": [{"comment_id": 888, "body": "There is no \"official\", but there is polls at: http://127.0.0.1:43110/zeropolls.bit\n", "added": 1464105835, "modified": 1464105835, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/464#issuecomment-221371120", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065321_mirrored_EtherTyper_github": [{"comment_id": 889, "body": "ZeroNet site addresses are 100% compatible with bitcoin, so you can use:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25804.msg321135#msg321135\n", "added": 1464105935, "modified": 1464105935, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/465#issuecomment-221371534", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 890, "body": "Easiest way:\n- Generate an address/privatekey with vanitygen\n- zeronet.py siteCreate\n- Rename data/createdsiteaddress to data/vanityaddress\n- zeronet.py siteSign vanityaddress vanityprivatekey\n- visit 127.0.0.1:43110/vanityaddress\n", "added": 1464155278, "modified": 1464155278, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/465#issuecomment-221511445", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065325_mirrored_calebebrim_github": [{"comment_id": 891, "body": "History/Cookie and some functions manipulations are restricted by browser iframe sandbox\n", "added": 1464213161, "modified": 1464213198, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/469#issuecomment-221749822", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 892, "body": "You can't use replaceState (url modification) functions directly, maybe it's possible to disable in jquery mobile\n", "added": 1464242417, "modified": 1464242417, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/469#issuecomment-221816070", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 893, "body": "Yes, if it's works on one machine, then it's different problem, are you sure every file is well synced?\n", "added": 1464298857, "modified": 1464298857, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/469#issuecomment-222032802", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 894, "body": "I mean are the files has the same content?\n", "added": 1464328538, "modified": 1464328538, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/469#issuecomment-222095532", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 895, "body": "check the directory sizes should be enought\n", "added": 1464756947, "modified": 1464756947, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/469#issuecomment-222919731", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 896, "body": "It does not affect us, since the replace/push state command is executed outsite of the iframe by zeroframe api commands", "added": 1494782389, "modified": 1494782389, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/469#issuecomment-301337173", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065326_mirrored_Emeraude_github": [{"comment_id": 897, "body": "Thanks!\n", "added": 1464335242, "modified": 1464335242, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/pull/470#issuecomment-222117081", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065329_mirrored_yurivict_github": [{"comment_id": 898, "body": "normally it should not happen: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/blob/master/src/util/helper.py#L12\n- It writes new content to data/sites.json-new\n- Renames current to sites.json-old\n- Renames sites.json-new to sites.json\n- Deletes sites.json-old\n\nHave you checked the sites.json content?

So it does not requires any modification in the site source code, but it has some drawbacks:\n- Caching: Browser caches .js files, so you have to wait some minute after chaing language\n- It does not works for every string, eg if you have somthing like this: `if (mode == \"Page\") $(\"#mode\").text(\"Page\")` and you want to translate \"Page\" then it will also translate the one in condition so it will never matches. As for solution for this you have to write: `if (mode == \"Page\") $(\"#mode\").text(_(\"Page\"))` and if put `\"_(Page)\": \"Oldal\"` to the translate json, it will only translate `_(\"Page\")`\n- If you don't like this solution you are free to translate the string in real-time. (by adding `_(\"anything\")` to every string you want to translate and return the translated one based on user's language), but I choosen this one because it does not adds extra \"noise\" to site's source code and the other reason is speed: The virtual dom liblaries re-rendering the structure array on every update, click or keypress, so if you translate in real-time it has to call the translation function for every string you have on the page. (it it can easily add 1000s of function calls to every keypress)\n\nI will also translate ZeroTalk and ZeroMe with this solution before the release to see if it can also work for that sites.

If you visit a site it can download up to 10MB of data that required by the site (source code, database) If you want to have more data than that, then the site owner able to define optional files that only downloaded when a client requests it. \r\nUsing the merger sites you can also split the database into multiple sites (eg. by based on category, date, language, etc.), so you will only download and receive updates for data you are interested in. The example for this is the Hubs for ZeroMe.\r\n2. There is no content censorship filter and I don't see any easy solution for that. Who going to decide what content is problematic?\r\n3. Sites have size limit, the connections has CPU time, re-connection thottle and content updates are also limited, but probably there is lots of attack vectors on that. (especially hard on Tor network where every connection is comes from 127.0.0.1)\r\n4. Peers are stored locally, so the next time you fire up your client can connect to them (and query other IPs via PEX) without any trackers. Local peer discovery and DHT planned later.\r\n5. The content download is proritized by type (html, js first), freshness (newest posts first) and based on browser GET requests. If the images marked as optional files, then it will not download until you request it.\r\n6. There is no data re-use yet. Latest web framework produces a single build.js files that has everything packed-in, which makes it impossible to share between sites. And having a central site of js liblaries also against the decentralization idea.\r\n7. Not that I know.\r\n8. There is no backed, so you can't render html, but if you have a single page application, that has it's storage layer well separated, then I think its possible to re-use. Basically you can execute database queries directly from javascript and you have to keep in mind, that every data is public.\r\n9. Currently you have to encrypt the parts you want to keep in secret. You can give write permissions based on site directories, but nothing more.\r\n10. Basically you have to start your client with `--ui_ip \"*\"`, then it will be accessible to anyone on your public ip. (enabling Multiuser plugin also recommended)\r\n11.

If the user wants to post on myblog.bit he adds the cert to his content.json, and the peers will accept his/her new content. \nPros: \n- Does not requres peers to seed the auth site\n- Works even if the auth site deleted\n\nCons:\n- No way to revoke cert\n\nTo make any of it possible the user has to use the same auth_address for talk.zeronetwork.bit and myblog.bit. (unique auth_address generated for currently every user using the same BIP32 xprv, but its easily possible to copy the identity)\n## _Update:_\n\nI think i will go for the second solution.\n\nRequired modifications:\n- [x] File for specify rules where the third-party signed can be stored Contains: trusted authorization services, allowed files/size limit using regexp, directory where it will be stored, banned users.\n- [x] Modifications on web interface that allows to use the same auth_address on multiple sites\n- [x] A sample trusted authorization service page\n- [x] Protocol command to get all current commented users data file (changedSince)\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1429533333, "modified": 1544877497, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/88", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604064877, "title": "Plugin for password based auth for the web interface", "body": "Would be handy to allow access ZeroNet from anywhere (eg. mobile) using a box that running the client.\nCookie or Http auth based (logout?).\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1430001720, "modified": 1493476234, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/91", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604064880, "title": "Use Openssl to sign/verify where possible for 50x speedup", "body": "Have to find a way to verify pybitcointools generated signs using openssl.\n\n```\n10x pybitcointools verify 1.44s \n10x openssl verify 0.026s\n```\n\nFull code: https://gist.github.com/HelloZeroNet/6af2373a1e33333eb3e8\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1430036956, "modified": 1430163922, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/92", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604064889, "title": "Gzipped file support", "body": "To reduce space/network bw used by data files:\n- On network protocol level: less work, but does not reduces the storage requirements\n- On file storage level\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1431195729, "modified": 1502270777, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/98", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604064891, "title": "Display confirmation dialog on drastical site size changes", "body": "Currently the warning dialog only displayed when site reaches 80% of it limits.\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1431284827, "modified": 1435245092, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/99", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604064894, "title": "Ignore sqlite cache db files from sitesign", "body": "", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1431285429, "modified": 1508695191, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/100", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604064908, "title": "SSL encrypted connections", "body": "- [x] Workaround to fix gevent SSL bug on python 2.7.9\n- [x] Benchmark SSL vs RAW connection speed\n  It's around 6 times slower than raw connection when running client and server on the same machine.\n  \n  ```\n  10 worker:\n  # Raw:      10000 req 1000009 kbytes transfered in 5.39999985695\n  # RSA 2048: 10000 req 1000009 kbytes transfered in 27.7890000343 using ('ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA', 'TLSv1/SSLv3', 256)\n  # ECC:      10000 req 1000009 kbytes transfered in 26.1959998608 using ('ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA', 'TLSv1/SSLv3', 256)\n  # ECC:      10000 req 1000009 kbytes transfered in 28.2410001755 using ('ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384', 'TLSv1/SSLv3', 256)\n  \n  100 worker:\n  # Raw:      10000 req 1000009 kbytes transfered in 7.02700018883 Mem: 14.328125\n  # RSA 2048: 10000 req 1000009 kbytes transfered in 44.8860001564 using ('ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384', 'TLSv1/SSLv3', 256) Mem: 20.078125\n  # ECC:      10000 req 1000009 kbytes transfered in 37.9430000782 using ('ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384', 'TLSv1/SSLv3', 256) Mem: 20.0234375\n  ```\n- [x] Generate SSL cert&key PEM unique files on every startup\n  I have tried to find a pure-python solution for this, but not found any, so using openssl command for it (openssl.exe bundled for windows).\n  \n  The key pem file creation is possible using [python-ecdsa](https://github.com/warner/python-ecdsa), but I could not found solution for the cert file:\n  \n  ``` python\n  from ecdsa import SigningKey, VerifyingKey, NIST384p\n  sk = SigningKey.generate(curve=NIST384p)\n  print sk.to_pem()\n  vk = sk.get_verifying_key()\n  vk_pem = vk.to_pem()\n  print vk_pem\n  ```\n- [x] More lightweight solution to encryption to avoid compatibility problems (eg. we dont need HMAC because every client is trustless)\n- [x] Transparently update the connection to ssl using wrapssl\n  To make raw & encrypted connections work on same port:\n  -

It will make possible to create larger sites with many image (and later videos).\n\nTo do this we can simply add `optional_files` node to content.json that is identical to current `files` node. This files only downloaded if user is request it directly (by a http request).\n\nThese files are excluded from site limit calculation (10MB by default). These files lands in a cache registry which has use-configurable size, and if the cache is runs out of the configured limit the most seeded file will be automatically removed.\n## Problem 1: Initial distribution\n\nIn a Multi-user imageboard site if someone uploads a new image it will not downloaded by default anyone, so he/she has to wait until someone open the site and request it.\n\nPossible solution: It would be possible to join to a site as \"sponsor\" who is downloads every optional files automatically and keeps it seeding until its necessary.\nAlso every user would be able to add \"share friend\" users. If your share friend uploads a file you automatically downloads his/her files and help to distribute it.\n\nThe API also adds possibility to \"pin\" (where it will not removed automatically from cache) and dislike (immediately remove) files.\n## Problem 2: Who has it?\n\nCurrently every peer has every file, so if you want to download a file you can request it from anyone. With optional files this is going to change: To solve this every connected peer has to keep a `hashfield` table which holds the downloaded files hashes first 4 character (only first 4 for economy reasons) eg.:\n\n```\npeer1 = ['8a42', 'fa11']\npeer2 = ['12ab', 'bbc9', 'd39a']\n```\n\nIf you want to download an optional file you checks if it's hash's first 4 character is in any of connected peer's hash table. If its not then you ask your connected peers to check if any of their connected peers has it. If still not found you can try to connect other peers randomly.\n\nIf you finish downloading an optional file you send the connected peers to add it to your `hashfield`, so if anyone looking for it later they will know you has it.

In that manual commit mode journal: DELETE looks like results in less io operations and writes are faster, than WAL journal mode (3.6s vs 7.2s for INSERT, 0.4s vs 1.7s for DELETE) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\n- [x] Benchmark threaded db overhead\r\n- [x] Benchmark various db options\r\n- [ ] Test if previous db files are compatible with new modes\r\n- [ ] Test hw falure by unplugging slow pendrive during db write (#1782)\r\n- [ ] Remove transactions from all .py files as we move away from autocommit\r\n- [ ] Test site rebuilding on slow disk\r\n- [ ] Test content.db rebuilding on slow disk (#1774)\r\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1543441742, "modified": 1543844740, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1794", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604067193, "title": "Display notification if there is unsigned modification in a owned site", "body": "## Why?\r\n\r\nTo reduce unreachable new sites because the owned made changes after the content.json changes.\r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\nAdd a notification message to ZeroHello and/or to the site about unsigned content.\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n -

It could be hard/impossible to find peers to small files if you are not connected to a site where that file is popular.\r\n - Hash collision as we use only the first 4 letter of the hash in hashfield\r\n\r\n#### Solution #2\r\nAnnounce all files to zero:// trackers, reduce re-announce time to eg. 4 hours (re-announce within 1 minute if new file added)\r\n(sending this amount of request to bittorrent trackers could be problematic)\r\nDon't store peers for file that you have 100% downloaded.\r\n\r\nRequest for 10k files: 32 * 10k = 320k (optimal case)\r\n\r\n#### Possible optimization #1:\r\nChange tracker communication to request client id token and only communicate hash additions / deletions until the expiry time.\r\nToken expiry time extends with every request.\r\n\r\n#### Possible optimization #2:\r\nTake some risk of hash collision and allow the tracker to specify how many character it needs from the hashes.\r\n(based on how many how many hashes it stores)\r\nEstimated request size to announce 22k files:\r\n - Full hash (32bytes): 770k\r\n - First 6 bytes (should be good until 10m hashes): 153k\r\n - First 7 bytes (should be good until 2560m hashes): 175k\r\n - First 8 bytes (should be good until 655360m hashes): 197k\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n - Depends on the zero:// trackers\r\n - Heavy requests, more CPU/BW load to trackers\r\n\r\n\r\n### Download all optional files / help initial seed for specific user\r\n\r\nDownloading all optional files in a site or uploaded by a specific user won't be possible anymore:\r\nThe optional files no longer will be stored in the user's `content.json` file `files_optional` node.\r\n\r\n####  Solution #1\r\nAdd a `files_link` node to `content.json` that stores uploaded files in the last X days.\r\n(with sha512, ext, size, date_added nodes) ", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1568122313, "modified": 1585469052, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2192", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604067943, "title": "Websocket Invalid HTTP method error in debug mode", "body": "### Step 1: Please describe your environment\r\n\r\n  * ZeroNet version: Rev4462\r\n  * Operating system: Win10\r\n  * Web browser: Chrome\r\n  * Tor status: disabled\r\n  * Opened port: no\r\n  * Special configuration: --debug with Werkzeug (0.14.1) installed\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Describe the problem:\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n -
