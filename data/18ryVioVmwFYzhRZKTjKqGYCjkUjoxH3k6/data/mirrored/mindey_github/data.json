Mining NameCoin separately is a hassle, and buying it is also a hassle. How can we simplify this, and make it free like seeding is.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI suppose, ideal solution would be some kind of PoS-based chain, that's embedded in the ZeroNet, perhaps a version of NameCoin itself, with proof-of-stake scheme.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI've considered, that it could happen in a similar way that users register their usernames, perhaps with expiry due to non-seeding.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIn the context of launching a website on ZeroNet.", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1568031819, "modified": 1568971823, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2189", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 2, "comment": {"1604067497_mirrored_mindey_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "> perhaps with expiry due to non-seeding\r\n\r\nI meant, expiry due to **non-seeding by the user who registered the domain**.\r\n\r\nFor example, failing to seed for at least N days in a period of M days, would result in loss of domain, where N, M - some reasonable numbers.\r\n", "added": 1568042506, "modified": 1568042579, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2189#issuecomment-529604641", "source_type": "github"}]}}
