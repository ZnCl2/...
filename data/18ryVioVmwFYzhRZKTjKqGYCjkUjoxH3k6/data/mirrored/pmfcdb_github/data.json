This software could empower people and technology to choose their own path  instead of being pushed by other interests. \r\n\r\nSo Eduroam is academic wifi network for students,researchers and academic staff  https://www.eduroam.org/ but I can't connect with zeronet. The network uses NAT and block a lot of external ports. \r\n\r\nSo, is there an option/workaround to connect to zeronet from this network? Also Opera browser with private window and vpn ON cannot bypass external port block. I'm using windows 10 x64 pro.\r\n\r\nThks,", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1489476582, "modified": 1489565025, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/861", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 2, "comment": {"1604065815_mirrored_pmfcdb_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "Ok, thks it worked!
