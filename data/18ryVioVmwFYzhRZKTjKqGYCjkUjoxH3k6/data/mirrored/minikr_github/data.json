(Tor is not an http proxy.)\r\n```\r\nWhen this happens, ZeroNet begins to hang and stops updating sites.  If I look at the stats page I usually see a bunch of nodes where connection status under `open` is `n/a`.  Some nodes have a larger ping than normal, but eventually most nodes end up with a `n/a` state after a while.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\nSometimes this happens the moment I start ZeroNet, while other times it happens after a while.\r\nIt seems to happen randomly, and I've experienced this problem in earlier versions.\r\nWhen I try to restart ZeroNet after this happens to fix it, the same problem usually happens again.", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1514568728, "modified": 1529322022, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1228", "source_type": "github"}]}
