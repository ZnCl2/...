So as mentioned by HelloZeroNet i removed all other usernames except my main one from users.json.

Example:\r\n1AWwhg4EiWAVttfQboJZ4wJfX3WawfJT3h_1522912179\r\nSo later once i deleted all \"redundant\" users from users.json, i could manually open sites and topics i copied and follow them again manually.

Result was like 15 minut CPU overload of the computer, debug.log not went crazy, but i seen in Horizon site (0) menu that the site has 300MB .db\r\nAnd this size is nothing special, Zeronet should be able to cope with dynamic sites having lets say 10GB databases etc.\r\n\r\ncd ~/Apps/ZeroBundle/ZeroNet/data/1CjMsvhJ2JsV4B5qo3FDHnF3mvRCcHuxBn/data\r\n$ gzip -l *.json.gz\r\n```\r\n         compressed        uncompressed  ratio uncompressed_name\r\n            2743133            23285428  88.2% data_keywords1.json\r\n            2208428            23940669  90.8% data_keywords2.json\r\n            2602574            23455548  88.9% data_keywords3.json\r\n            2656768            23706139  88.8% data_keywords4.json\r\n             902385             8252620  89.1% data_keywords5.json\r\n            2789194            24995191  88.8% data_main1.json\r\n            2155699            15099977  85.7% data_main2.json\r\n            3347288            19561521  82.9% data_phrases1.json\r\n            2197791            23694010  90.7% data_relationship1.json\r\n            2425075            24690472  90.2% data_relationship2.json\r\n            1197466            14682409  91.8% data_relationship3.json\r\n             303130             1297035  76.6% data_zites1.json\r\n           25528931           226661019  88.7% (totals)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this happened to me several times on this site, because in debug-last.log i see:\r\nSite:1CjMsv..uxBn Imported 12 data file in 1443.11739898s\r\n\r\nIt may be related to unsolved issue where ZeroMe db tooks days to rebuild: [ZeroTalk topic](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1531836231_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS/Database+rebuilding+Imported+0000), also described in this unsolved issue: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroMe/issues/121", "added": 1537189873, "modified": 1537191371, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1612#issuecomment-422076705", "source_type": "github"}], "1604066788_mirrored_blurHY_github": [{"comment_id": 87, "body": "@DaniellMesquita @blurHY when i try to repeat what i did when the Broken pipe error appeared (first time opening new zite (horizon)), then i no longer see this error, so i do not think it is related to Horizon zite.

Once i synchronize ZeroNet/data/users.json between devices (not always fast & simple to connect various OS and find correct paths for noob), as time goes it goes out of sync and merging changes seems too difficult or impossible for noob user.\r\n\r\n**IDEA:** It would be handy if Zeronet will hash/encrypt the content of the ZeroNet/data/users.json and store it somewhere on well seeded site. Then ZeroNet on other device knows the save path and upon entering master seed or something like that,it will be able to automatically decrypt the \"export\" and merge it to local users.json.

Voting system can be used to allow users to moderate zites content (example vote to move some content to different category, vote to rank some content better or worse, vote to move some content into recycle bin or hide for moderation by reputable users). I think community driven sites is the future, not to rely on a single point of failure (a zite admin). But there is needed the system that will prevent abuse of the voting system by the bots and it will also prevent bulk spam.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Ideas on the antibot/antispam/anti-voting-abuse system:\r\n\r\n1. ID authority like zeroid will require new user to solve antibot challenge (select images that are car, solve a puzzle :), sort some elements)\r\n2. Generating some identity key based on device hardware or software and allow developers to rate-limit one device regarding number of actions it can do on site (number of votes, number of topics created)\r\n3. calculating user karma/score based on account age, posting frequency, number of deleted posts by moderator\r\n4.

If so, can you improve this so it does not influence site loading and its operations?\r\n\r\nPS: maybe the cause of the lag/unresponding is not queued files, but the way images are loaded on the site i linked above. Because zeronet stop loading sites and when i browse opened tabs, i sometimes see that on above linked web zite is the page where many images did not loaded (instead of a image thumbnail, there is a wheel indicating image loading) and when i close that tab, zeronet start responding... i always had impression it has to do with some zite function that is made wrongly to hang.

The screenshot was made after tens of minutes of high swapping, when computer started well responding and stopped swapping (thanks to zeronet high RAM usage).\r\n\r\n![zeronet-ram-usage-after-stopped-swapping](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6596726/72431452-cc414480-378c-11ea-8fa8-57bfa0996cd8.jpg)\r\n\r\nDuring the swapping, the Windows's resource monitor app (on the screenshot) shown significant amount of RAM marked in orange color (on the screnshot you can see 81MB, but it was gigabytes during swapping/ZN start) . And it decreased by like 2MB per second to the point you see on the screenshot. That orange kind of memory is described as \"changed\" and which content has to be written to the HDD before use. In the Windows's Resource monitor (keyb. shortcut Win + R, and execute \"resmon\"), Memory tab you can discover details about particular memory types to understand the screenshot.\r\n\r\nZeronet's debug log shows some interesting lines. Watch the timeflow. It shows time gaps of many minutes without any log lines - my log level is INFO, not DEBUG though.

Click \"threads_fs_write\" to see the count and the list of files to which is being writen by which zeronet task.\r\n\r\nI think in overal it would be beneficial for users to better underatand ZN configuration variables and set these appropriately.\r\n\r\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1588751817, "modified": 1588887312, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2550", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604068034, "title": "database disk image is malformed & Unhandled exception: MemoryError", "body": "### Step 1: Please describe your environment\r\n\r\n  * ZeroNet version: 4486\r\n  * Operating system: Raspbian\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Describe the problem:\r\n\r\n@HelloZeroNet \r\nZeronet pages fails to load dynamic content (from DB) so i extracted ERROR lines from the debug.log and sorted removing duplicates, this is result:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR    Site:1ADQAH..g6aA WebSocket receive error: OSError: [Errno 113] No route to host in UiWebsocket.py line 71 > __init__.py line 80 > 86 > 48 > 105 > 125 > 156 > _socket3.py line 378\r\nERROR    Site:1HeLLo..Tf3D WebSocket receive error: OSError: [Errno 113] No route to host in UiWebsocket.py line 71 > __init__.py line 80 > 86 > 48 > 105 > 125 > 156 > _socket3.py line 378\r\nERROR    Site:1MWkQT..72fR Announce to 5 trackers in 130.400s, failed\r\nERROR    Site:1uPDaT..NACf WebSocket handleRequest error: MemoryError:  in UiWebsocket.py line 79 > 215 > 341 > 1133 > SiteManager.py line 124 > helper.py line 52 > re.py line 192\r\nERROR    - Unhandled exception: DatabaseError: database disk image is malformed in greenlet.py line 766 > helper.py line 234 > Chart/ChartDb.py line 130 > Db.py line 150 > DbCursor.py line 105\r\nERROR    - Unhandled exception: KeyError: 'data/users/19ZYUMmjE6hvT25iPzre4LMmx55aAZ5C3y/content.json' in greenlet.py line 766 > Pooled.py line 12 > Bigfile/BigfilePlugin.py line 804 > 833 > Site.py line 803 > 767 > Bigfile/BigfilePlugin.py line 258 > ContentManager.py line 408 > ContentDbDict.py line 116\r\nERROR    - Unhandled exception: KeyError: 'data/users/1Cz94uug7y5gXzxKUzSpT5Cm2k8dM5KPDT/content.json' in greenlet.py line 766 > Pooled.py line 12 > Bigfile/BigfilePlugin.py line 804 > 833 > Site.py line 803 > 767 > Bigfile/BigfilePlugin.py line 258 > ContentManager.py line 408 > ContentDbDict.py line 116\r\nERROR    - Unhandled exception: MemoryError:  in greenlet.py line 766 > FileServer.py line 228 > Noparallel.py line 62 > 55 > Site.py line 509\r\nERROR    - Unhandled exception: MemoryError:  in greenlet.py line 766 > OptionalManager/UiWebsocketPlugin.py line 46 > OptionalManager/ContentDbPlugin.py line 243 > collections/__init__.py line 566 > 653\r\nERROR    - Unhandled exception: MemoryError:  in greenlet.py line 766 > OptionalManager/UiWebsocketPlugin.py line 46 > OptionalManager/ContentDbPlugin.py line 256\r\nERROR    - Unhandled exception: MemoryError:  in greenlet.py line 766 > SiteManager.py line 124 > helper.py line 52 > re.py line 192\r\nERROR    - Unhandled exception: MemoryError:  in greenlet.py line 766 > SiteManager.py line 138 > 124 > helper.py line 43 > json/__init__.py line 238 > json/encoder.py line 202\r\nERROR    - Unhandled exception: UnicodeEncodeError: 'latin-1' codec can't encode characters in position 99-109: ordinal not in range(256) in greenlet.py line 766 > Bigfile/BigfilePlugin.py line 833 > Site.py line 785 > FilePack/FilePackPlugin.py line 106 > SiteStorage.py line 390 > genericpath.py line 30\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease do you see any helpful information that can fix something or what do you suggest to try?\r\nShould i \"just\" quit ZN, delete content.db file and start it?

I have published post on Millchan (famous zeronet site) with a few files attached (some were bigfiles no bigger than 10MB each)\r\nBecause i know how bad zeronet can sometimes be in seeding/downloading i have opened that poSt on three other servers each located in different location and each server has open poRt and clicked to seed all files of that post. In recent hours i was repeating the seed all request on that post on three servers as i was seeing servers has problems to download files of that post, only some files, some parts was downloaded. After around 6 hours like only half of the content was downloaded by my servers and it is not like all servers downloaded same parts, one has full file, other 0% of same file, etc. And it is just under 20MB total size of the files and my seeder connectivity is not bad + open port. That 3 servers hosts millchan and indeed maybe hundred/s of images/files on it while maybe another hundred/s of optional files are queued for download or being \"paused\" due to no peer.\r\n\r\nOn the host who published mentioned post, there is alot of content downloaded/uploaded. ZN directory has 5 million files and quite significant data transfer during previous hours. Zeronet is slow past years and swapping the computer after maybe 1-2 days of runtime. The CPU and HDD iops does not seem to be the bottleneck. If it is connection limit somewhere then zeronet users should be instructed (via ZN interface) to modify the limits or apply patch. If it can not be modified then zeronet should be supplied with the special browser that has no such limits.\r\n\r\nMentioned terribly slow propagation of the content is tragedy. Something has to be done about this so Zeronet can grow and people stay using it and do not giveup being too annoyed of the slowness.
