I didn't notice this until recently, as I normally use obfs4 by default.  This is annoying, as it blocks zeronet.\n\nYawning's obfs4 project can be found [here](https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4), and the binary can be extracted from the tor browser bundle.  We can place it in ZeroBundle\\ZeroNet\\tools\\tor\\data and edit the torrc as follows.\n\n```\n# Tell tor where obfsproxy resides\nClientTransportPlugin obfs2,obfs3,obfs4,scramblesuit exec data\\obfs4proxy\n\n# Uncomment this line to enable bridges\n# UseBridges 1\n\n# Add bridges below\n```\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1465329087, "modified": 1494512500, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/487", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604065352, "title": "Add obfs4 lines to torrc", "body": "This implements half of #487, as I can't push a copy of obfs4proxy with the pull request.\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1465335055, "modified": 1499528238, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/pull/489", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 2, "comment": {"1604065349_mirrored_Arcturus36_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "obfs4 is a separate project, run and maintained independently of the Tor Project.\nWhen Zeronet is first run, it downloads the tor expert bundle from the Tor project site.  This includes nothing but the tor binary.  Unfortunately, this means zeronet doesn't gain obfsproxy support.  I'm still working on the code to automatically extract and place the necessary files from the normal Tor Browser Bundle.\nAlso, since obfs4 is a separate binary, it doesn't close when zeronet closes.  This causes the bundled tor binary to hang if zeronet starts again.  The solution to this is to find and close tor's child processes.\n", "added": 1467893309, "modified": 1467893862, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/487#issuecomment-231107049", "source_type": "github"}]}}
