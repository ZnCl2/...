I saw a BitTorrent directory, but it still pointed to externally tracked .torrents. The fact though that we're seeing these early uses, combined with ZeroNet's native use of BT for file distribution and the recently added capability to only serve some files belonging to a site initially, all suggest that it might come in handy soon.\n\nRe: Bitcoin, with \"BTC friendly\" I was talking about stuff like generated addresses and private keys being Bitcoin-compatible, as explicitly noted in the FAQ. That's not a statement about the feasibility/complexity of this idea -- I don't know how feasible it is.\n", "added": 1457019009, "modified": 1457025589, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/290#issuecomment-191898145", "source_type": "github"}]}}
