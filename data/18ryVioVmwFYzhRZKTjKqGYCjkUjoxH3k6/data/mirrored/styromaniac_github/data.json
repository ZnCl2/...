With iOS devices you also need content=\"yes\" meta tag. I've looked into creating a manifest.json and adding lines to content.json to apply in the regular view (no raw/ prefix), but I hadn't gotten them to work for such a purpose. These are needed for app-like presentation and treatment by browsers. An API that applies similar properties for multiple browsers would be nice, like theme colors, background colors for splash screens, full screen or standalone, screen orientation, icons, etc. Most important though is providing prerequisites for sites requiring JavaScript, which, I'll repeat, I have no idea how to set. Even the smallest support or wisdom here would be great, because opening ZeroMe or KopyKate from home/desktop/taskbar shortcuts in full screen would be nice.
