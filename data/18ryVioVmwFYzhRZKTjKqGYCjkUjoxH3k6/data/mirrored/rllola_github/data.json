Despite the fact that ICANN can steal just any TLD name for its own purposes, I think we should do our best to avoid the name clash with the existing TLDs. At least, if the name conflict appears in the future, it will be possible to say that `.zeronet` is long in use and other applicants are playing foul game.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, a protocol handler is an application that knows how to handle particular types of links. And it is not what we want ? I get your point on HTTP however I am not convinced that it is relevant (but I am not saying I can't be convinced...). Also I am interested in starting ZeroNet program using the protocol handler and adopting this standard would allow it. However I am aware that not everyone might be using ZeroNet this way. They might have a server running ZeroNet and they just need to register the browser which is possible too.\r\n\r\nRegarding the HTTP argument, I am wondering that if the HTTP part isn't only the protocol use to 'consume' the content?
