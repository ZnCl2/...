Nobody wants to be seeder if the data on there computer is not ensure to be secure.\r\n\r\nWhy not full disk encryption?\r\nFull disk encryption does protect against 3rd party access to data, but it does not protect the visitors. Example of this is that many person have been convict for not decrypting the disk.\r\n\r\nSo how is this different?\r\nYou see, the thing that file encryption have over full disk encryption is Plausible deniability\r\n\r\nYou can have sensitive files on your pc, securely delete it, and let 3rd party look over your pc. Pretending to be innocent.\r\n\r\nI don't think ZeroNet will have this feature soon. So I would like to know if there is external application that encrypt the \"data\" folder for me?", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1545353108, "modified": 1545358190, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1831", "source_type": "github"}]}
