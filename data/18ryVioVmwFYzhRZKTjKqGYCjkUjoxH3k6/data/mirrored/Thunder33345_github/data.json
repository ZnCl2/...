think we should consider to be able to tie it to an ID if needed\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\n\r\nTo add optional native implementation to sign verify, encrypt, decrypt messages from/to an id \r\n\r\n## Possible Usage\r\n\r\nSay i want to play tictactoe against another online user say bob@id.bit on a site,\r\nand we used P2P simply because it's not really needed for it to be permanent,\r\nwe should have a native way to sign a broadcast message as current user,\r\nand check if it's a signed message, so we dont get our games messed up with other players that are also playing,\r\nmaybe even encrypted to me@id.bit so no one can spy on how bad i am at playing tic tac toe\r\n\r\nit's also possible for something like IRC-hybrid that only save the messages to disk once every 1min(or site close) to preserve history, but broadcast all messages P2P, since it's better to collect all writes and flush it all at once\r\n\r\n## Possible concerns\r\n\r\nConcerns of privacy where one IP or tor address can be tied to one id, this can be dismissed, IF the site is big enough, more than likely that ip is just forwarding/propagating a message they receive\r\n\r\n## Minor Passive Protection Suggestion\r\n\r\nAdding more passive protections, i dont think a regex is enough, we should have:\r\n\r\n- something to restrict throughput\r\n\r\nif i am sure my application will never send out more then 1 packet per second i can put it there to limit and stop people spamming,\r\nconcerns: impossible to implement as anyone can just claim they are forward packets, and other peers will count your throughput to be your packets+packets you related but if there's a valid solution this will stop spammers dead in track\r\nmaybe a way to check throughput against an sender ID if it's signed\r\n\r\n- peer max byte to restrict max byte of an message\r\n\r\nother peers will drop and flag/add points, if the message is over x byte(wrapper should reject sending if over this limit), this limit should be very high and is just there to to prevent users sending absurdly large packets and choking peers with less bandwidth\r\n\r\n- force signed message\r\n\r\nThis flag force all messages sent to be signed with the valid signatures described(probably will be identical to the one in the `data/users/content.json` in most normal cases,\r\nunsigned messages will be dropped, this is useful for sites that know they wont be sending unsigned messages, thus making it harder to just spam with not signed packets without the whole peers starting to ignoring an ID,\r\nmay not work for sign+encrypted messages unless you encrypt then sign so everyone know you send an encrypted message, rather then everyone just see an encrypted message but receiver can decrypt and see the signer ", "added": 1526561274,

that can be generated on demand without any involvement of certificate authority or public free floating certificate.\r\n\r\nThis type of account has no \"domain\" unlike normal certs generated id that have @zeroid.bit for example.\r\nThis type of account CANNOT be assigned a username, username is based on the public key of the address, though you could use POW to get certain prefix/suffix.\r\n\r\nThere's only `auth_address` and `auth_privatekey` for this kind of account, maybe a custom nick+note for user to not get confused over which is for what.\r\nUsers can have as many accounts of this type as they want in one master seed.\r\n\r\n# why?\r\n\r\nthis enforces a true unique name and also allow privacy oriented sites to allow this kind of id without compromise of users sharing the same names to impersonate others, while remained decentralized.\r\n\r\n# implications\r\n\r\nsince this \"id\" have no suffix of @... unlike every other id, this might be a bad idea as it would be hard to \"permission\" it, for example how would we \"allow\" it?\r\nusing cert_signers wont wont because it has no suffix and nor a public key,\r\nand to say set it with a differing amount of \"space\" it wouldn't be possible to directly target it\r\n\r\nPossible proposal to rectify this would be to append @selfsign(or something), to the end of it when in programmatic operation and choose to omit it when displaying to end users, basically it's only there for operations like cert_signers and permissions, and only there when it's necessary. seems hacky solution though\r\n\r\nSince the username is a blob of huge string of character,\r\nthere should be a unique icon gen(with high entropy) using public key to prevent impersonating,\r\nsince it's long it could be trucened if user wish so to be like first1234567...last123\r\n\r\nIt's possible that these kind of account would make it more easier to \"spam\" sites, but that's ultimately up to site owner's

now we have 0 defenses against spamming, maybe this could be useful\r\nAlso this is NOT meant to exclude the possible damage of forcing POW as some users are mobile based and will struggle and lack the capability to legitimately post while the spammer on a mid tier rig can easily blast through POW\r\nThis is mostly a barrier of sort, not meant to be the only line of defense against spamming but to be used in combination with other tools..\r\n\r\n(FYI: i used the word POW signing to refer to computing a hash that matches requirement)\r\nPossible examples:\r\n# POW each publish\r\nThis is a simple system where each time you want to publish the data also need to be POW backed to publish, actually it dosent stop spammer, they could choose to spam everything in one go.\r\n\r\n# POW for file size\r\nThere should be a \"POW sign\" this to unlock XYZ more space\r\nEDIT: also there should be ways to have diffrent POW requirements, between certs providers and anonymous certs #1812 \r\nExample in contents.json for users:\r\n```\r\nPOW Sizegate signing:\r\n0byte: /^0000.*$/ (4 zeros hash)\r\n50mb: /^0000.*$/ (4 zeros hash)\r\n100mb: /^00000.*$/ (5 zeros hash)\r\n500mb: /^000000.*$/ (6 zeros hash)\r\n1gb: /^0000000.*$/ (7 zeros hash)\r\n*1gb: /^00000000.*$/ (8 zeros hash)\r\n```\r\nIn order to even do your first post you need a 4 zero hash check(explained by the 0 byte).\r\nEach time your data size reaches a new \"milestone\" you also need to create POW with matching regex.\r\nThe *1gb means each time you reach a new multiples of 1 gb you also must sign it, say you reached 3 gb, then you must sign it 3 times.\r\n\r\nfor example in the user's content.json\r\n```\r\nsize sign:\r\n0byte: (data that when combined will result in hash matching regex)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe hash match function would be something like\r\nhash(auth address+size+site address+data)\r\nsize and site address may be optionally excluded by owner's will, so that a hash can be signed once and used at elsewhere, and allow users to precompute huge hashes only based on their auth address\r\n\r\n# Other ways?\r\nOnly other ways i can think of is signing for every individual \"entity\" which depends on application, like zerome and zerotalk each have their own individual entity\r\nIt would sure be nice to be able to make each entity to require signing but i cant see a way without huge complication in the json structure of each file\r\nYes it's possible to do it front ended rather then at the network level, sure it hides the post but still dosent negate the fact people can spam and waste other's
