You know the so-called \"Internet\" in China: Almost everything is blocked.\n\nSo I use my router to do proxy. When I'm surfing the Internet, All traffic to IP address in China will be passed through directly, whereas traffic to outside China is passed through my proxy in Los Angeles. I'd like ZeroNet to see me as my real Chinese IP address, but it detects my server IP in Los Angeles, thus I cannot open my port to let others use, and I'm not able to use my local peers.\n\nWill it be possible to provide an alternative way to detect IP address (e.g. use IP detector page in China like http://www.pubyun.com/dyndns/getip) or some other measurements?\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1473911148, "modified": 1474027901, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/581", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 8, "comment": {"1604065468_mirrored_t123yh_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "@iShift Rules are based on IP addresses, not URL.\n", "added": 1473936685, "modified": 1473936685, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/581#issuecomment-247333706", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 2, "body": "@HelloZeroNet Not very clear what 'but the trackers will add the originating ip' means, could you please explain it a little bit more detailed?\n", "added": 1473975208, "modified": 1473975208, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/581#issuecomment-247491505", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 3, "body": "Then if I specify the ip_external parameter, will that be like this: I will be able to access ZeroNet using both China and World sources, but only users in China will be able to connect to me because the World see me as my Los Angeles IP?\n", "added": 1473978973, "modified": 1473978973, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/581#issuecomment-247498788", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 4, "body": "It seems that those checkers cannot see my actual IP address even I provided my real IP.\n\n```\n[14:06:38] FileServer Checking port 15441 using portchecker.co...\n[14:06:39] FileServer [BAD :(] Port closed: Port 15441 is closed.\n[14:06:39] FileServer Trying to open port using UpnpPunch...\n[14:06:54] FileServer Checking port 15441 using portchecker.co...\n[14:06:55] FileServer [BAD :(] Port closed: Port 15441 is closed.\n[14:06:55] FileServer Checking port 15441 using canyouseeme.org...\n[14:06:56] FileServer [BAD :(] Port closed: Error: I could not see your service on 107.151.188.*** on port (15441) Reason: Connection refused\n[14:06:56] FileServer Upnp mapping failed :( Please forward port 15441 on your router to your ipaddress\n```\n\nwhere `107.151.188.***` is my proxy server IP.\n", "added": 1474024139, "modified": 1474024139, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/581#issuecomment-247609946", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 5, "body": "I don't want to expose my proxy server IP.
