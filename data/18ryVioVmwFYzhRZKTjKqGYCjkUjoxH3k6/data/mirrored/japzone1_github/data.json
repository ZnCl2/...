It appears to be some kind of conflict in NoScript's \"ABE\" advanced function with Firefox's e10s multi-process feature. I can't tell if it was caused by an update to NoScript or Firefox though. \r\n\r\nI operate NoScript in a Blacklist mode, so only certain sites are supposed to be affected by it, which is why I missed it when tracking down the issue the first time round. After cloning my Firefox profile and removing things one by one I tracked it down.\r\n\r\nThe issue does seem to be directly related to Firefox's e10s, as disabling it fixes the issue as well. I guess I'll just have to leave that NoScript function disabled for now. Not sure exactly how to report the issue to NoScript though, as I haven't seen it affect anything besides ZeroNet yet, but I'm also not sure if it's worth looking into yourself for such a niche issue\r\n\r\nPS: This isn't important to this issue, but in Firefox Dev-Edition's version number the date is also important, as new builds are released almost daily.
