However, when trying to connect in Safari, there are a few problems. One, the flipping red square is white with a 1px red border (after it drops; as it's dropping it's red), two, dynamic content doesn't work (ZeroBlog is blank). It seems to be a problem with Ghostery (maybe?) but it worked fine with Ghostery in Chrome.
