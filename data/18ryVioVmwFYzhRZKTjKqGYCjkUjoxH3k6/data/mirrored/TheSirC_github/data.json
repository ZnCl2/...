However, I do not have the required knowledge and coding skills to do so. So I would like to translate the content written in the Wiki, the Docs and the README to enlarge the public of this project : I speak three languages so I think that could be helpful. Hear me right : I don't want to edit the content, I want to translate it. Unfortunately, I didn't find how to do it on my own.\n\nCould you show me a procedure to do so ?\n\nThankfully,\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1456909658, "modified": 1502787540, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/285", "source_type": "github"}]}
