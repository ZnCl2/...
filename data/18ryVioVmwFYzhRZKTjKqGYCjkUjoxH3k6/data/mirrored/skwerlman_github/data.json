By storing your dependencies in the repo, this allows people to still use the code even when the places where the dependencies are usually downloaded from are down or no longer exist (cough leftpad cough).\r\n\r\nyou can specify known working versions of modules in the requirements.txt\r\n\r\n> Basically, what I think would be the best is if there was a package manager (like npm) that stores the dependencies in a dependencies folder, and then you just track that folder in with your repo. The problem with doing this with web development (e.g. npm) is that the web has so many dependencies that it would definitely clutter up the directory and may take quite a lot of space. That's also why I think the whole climate of web development isn't very good (I mean come on, people are depending on libraries that literally have barely any lines of code - again leftpad).\r\n\r\nthis can be solved by using a venv and tracking that. python libs are typically smaller than npm libs, so this is not as big of an issue.", "added": 1521659651, "modified": 1521659651, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1350#issuecomment-375113494", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 49, "body": "> Did you read everything I wrote? I'm saying storing working versions in requirements.txt is not enough because the main sources that you can get these from could go down or be deleted, like with the case of leftpad.\r\n\r\nRight, which is what the venv is for. You still have the deps in the repo, but they are directly upgradeable by standard dependency management tools, a direct improvement over the current situation. In case what I mean by venv isn't clear, docs are here:\r\n\r\n- PY3's venv module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\r\n- the virtualenv tool for PY2: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/\r\n\r\nI think a longer term solution could be to mirror and fetch the needed deps on some decentralized file system, such as IPFS or a zite, but that's probably out of scope for zeronet\r\n\r\n> Btw, PHP is a horrible language.
