This is likely an <iframe> element loaded from a different domain for which you violated the same-origin policy.**\r\n\r\nIs it possible to host in ZeroNet Javascript apps? \r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n  1. For example, a well know example in VueJS is: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-hackernews-2.0/\r\n  2. The production files for that project are generated by running: npm run build.\r\n  3. Create a new ZeroNet site.\r\n  4. Copy the generated dist folder to the new site, and add the script in index.html.\r\n  5. Sign content.json\r\n  6. Try to open the website.\r\n\r\n#### Observed Results:\r\n\r\nI get the following message in Firefox console:\r\nSecurityError: Permission denied to access property \"document\" on cross-origin object\r\n\r\nIn Tor Browser:\r\nError: Permission denied to access property \"document\"\r\n\r\nAdditional information: There was attempt to access an object for which you have no permission. This is likely an <iframe> element loaded from a different domain for which you violated the same-origin policy.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results:\r\n\r\nRun the application without errors.\r\n\r\nEnglish is not my mother tongue; please excuse any errors on my part.", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1514972319, "modified": 1515087637, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1236", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 2, "comment": {"1604066289_mirrored_Rtnd_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "The Firebase plugin was the problem.
