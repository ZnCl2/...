Please describe.**\r\nIn overall I've enjoyed ZeroNet very much. However, when I've reached \"How can I create a ZeroNet site\" section I've found non-obvious that instead of using `zeronet.py` as a Windows user I could use `zeronet.cmd` from `\\lib` folder. Since I've found pip package manager UX quite frustrating I think that this is a thing that should be mentioned as early as possible and could save a couple of hours for other windows users.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI guess \"Windows\" subsection in \"How can I create a ZeroNet site?\" would be sufficient. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nIDK. You could tell me where you would like to see it.\r\n\r\nI hope you're having a good day :)\r\nRegards,\r\nBohdan\r\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1572008645, "modified": 1579523106, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2245", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 2, "comment": {"1604067572_mirrored_Wkalmar_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "I guess that just proves my point: no one can infere this from readme.md", "added": 1572279225, "modified": 1572279225, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2245#issuecomment-547102961", "source_type": "github"}]}}
