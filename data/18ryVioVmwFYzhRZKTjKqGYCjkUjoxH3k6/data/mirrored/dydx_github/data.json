But, it never seems to load. I get a message saying that `content.json download failed`\n\nDo I just need to wait for more seeds to propagate, or is there an error in my setup somewhere? \n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1421180636, "modified": 1421186595, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/10", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604064741, "title": "added functionality to save address and private key pair to disk", "body": "I know I'd forget that information under my own volition, so why not save it to disk?
