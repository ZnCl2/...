You will only need to create setup.py file.\n\nPros:\n- Official way to install python packages\n- Easier to install (pip install zeronet, dependencies are downloaded automagically)\n- Easier to update (pip install --upgrade zeronet)\n- [Command line scripts](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.org/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html)\n\nCons:\n- Some modifications to source code (mostly imports) may be required\n\nIf you think that such modifications can be useful, i can work on this issue and create PR later.\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1458447977, "modified": 1554597031, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/382", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 3, "comment": {"1604065216_mirrored_WeirdCarrotMonster_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "The package itself can be installed in bundle, the only thing that changes is update method - instead of downloading master branch from github, script will use pip to install latest released version.\n\nOn the other hand, it won't work with plugins in their current implementation - but if you ask me, marking plugins as disabled by prefixing \"disabled-\" is bad idea.
