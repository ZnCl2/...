In my testing, especially for .bit domains, sites already in the node will respond faster.\r\n\r\nThe same origin policy only prevents reading responses, not preventing them from taking place.\r\n\r\nThis isn't terribly significant except for people being strictly behind Tor or VPNs, in which case this may leak their identity.\r\n\r\nI wrote about this on my blog [here](https://www.chaoswebs.net/blog/timebleed-breaking-privacy-with-a-simple-timing-attack.html) and a proof of concept is [here](https://www.chaoswebs.net/timebleed/)\r\n\r\n:+1:", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1493491427, "modified": 1566311376, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/919", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604067337, "title": "Prevent ZeroNet from running if Python interpreter is optimized", "body": "ZeroNet (and dependencies) rely on assert statements in a few places, notably in [certificate pinning](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/blob/eb88dbbec8d88f58c5c4c060a61f74c9074e591e/src/Crypt/CryptConnection.py#L53)\r\n\r\nMy solution is to use assert to test if the Python interpreter is ran in optimized mode (-O) and exit if so. I doubt optimized mode really speeds up ZeroNet much anyway, so there is nothing of value lost.
