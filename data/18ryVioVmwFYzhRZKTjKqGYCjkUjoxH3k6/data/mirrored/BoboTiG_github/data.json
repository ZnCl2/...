I [quote](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21060677/1117028) a CPython core dev:\r\n\r\n> This ResourceWarning means that you opened a file, used it, but then forgot to close the file. Python closes it for you when it notices that the file object is dead, but this only occurs after some unknown time has elapsed. Thus in recent versions, Python also prints a ResourceWarning when it does that. It is a way for you to quickly identify where the unclosed files are, and properly close them. It might be important on some platforms which cannot have more than N files opened at the same time (e.g. 1024). Also, specifically on Windows, you cannot do some operations with a file if it's still open (e.g. deleting it).\r\n\r\nI think it is always good to do things in a clean way, but you have the last word :)", "added": 1546780317, "modified": 1546780317, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/pull/1848#issuecomment-451753592", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 3, "body": "OK, let's close this PR then :)", "added": 1546781267, "modified": 1546781267, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/pull/1848#issuecomment-451754744", "source_type": "github"}], "1604067608_mirrored_ZeroNetTickBot_github": [{"comment_id": 4, "body": "Choose what is best for you, I really have no issue with that ;)", "added": 1572848560, "modified": 1572851471, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2273#issuecomment-549273097", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 5, "body": "I don't care.", "added": 1572885258, "modified": 1572885258, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2273#issuecomment-549512181", "source_type": "github"}]}}
