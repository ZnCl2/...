When using a more traditional client/server setup you'd configure the server to serve the same page regardless of the url given and let the clientside javascript handle showing the correct content. As far as I know this isn't possible with ZeroNet, it will always try to serve the file the url is pointing to.\r\n\r\nJust to see if I could get the clientside routing thing to work if I could get ZeroNet to serve the right file, I hacked in the option ([gist](https://gist.github.com/Wieke/4491b9d66d47d1e1050d1317f8b299c8#file-uirequest-py-L490-L499)) for a zite to fall back on a configured path if the requested file couldn't be found. It worked, so it seems to me that giving a zite creator some rudimentary control over which file is served for which url could be useful.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nWieke", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1507745610, "modified": 1583755193, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1141", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 2, "comment": {"1604066166_mirrored_Wieke_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "@krixano Sweet. I'm using Vue as well and just noticed that vue-router tries to refresh the site when I hit forward. I'm going to give your router a try.\r\n\r\n@HelloZeroNet Having some kind of fallback page would probably be sufficient. It's not like you could actually do something with complex routing in zeronet, right?", "added": 1507906168, "modified": 1507906168, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1141#issuecomment-336522433", "source_type": "github"}]}}
