Creating a copy, deleting the content (in my case it was: 127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com, 127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com) than replacing the copy with the original. After entering password for authentication and restarting the computer I was able to connect to ZeroNet yet again. \n\nHope this will help you out.\n", "added": 1457543719, "modified": 1457543719, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/336#issuecomment-194488444", "source_type": "github"}]}}
