Visit KopyKate\r\n  2.  Enable Doanload & Help Distribute all files\r\n  3.  Set File Size Limit To 16MB\r\n  4.  Let data populate \r\n  5.  Visit site, Pull open right side panel, and click Rebuild database\r\n  6.  Click (Check Files) from main page ZeroHello\r\n\r\n#### Observed Results:\r\n\r\nWatch your limited storage box fill with a 490gb archive...\r\nHasn't started happening until the recent 2 updates.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results:\r\n\r\nObtain any missing files / uploads that passed the file size limit criteria.\r\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1522996282, "modified": 1526050210, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1379", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604066474, "title": "Pinned Files do not persist after site removal.", "body": "### Step 1: Platforms experiencing the problem\r\n  * ZeroNet version: v3407\r\n  * Operating system: win10pro | Ubuntu 16\r\n  * Web browser: firefox ESR\r\n  * Tor status: not [available]\r\n  * Opened port: yes\r\n  * Special configuration:  home desktop & private proxy\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Describe the problem:\r\nPinned files do not persist on site removal.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n  1.   Pin a file\r\n  2.  Remove the originating site\r\n  3.  Pinned file has been removed...\r\n\r\n#### Observed Results:\r\n\r\nZeronet should not auto-pin large files. Any pinning should be done manually by user.\r\nPinned files are marked for importance, preservation would likely be desired for that criteria.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results:\r\n\r\nA pinned files should be important enough to preserved for extended storage regardless of originating site removal. For example, a user could pin a file from KopyKate, delete the site, still preserve the pinned file(s), and if visiting the site again, choose to seed that file without having to re-obtain it.\r\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1522996731, "modified": 1526057791, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1380", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604066491, "title": "disreguard this", "body": "disreguard: my problem was isolated to firefox esr and self remedied by an uninstall /reinstall of the browser.", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1524180191, "modified": 1524419166, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1393", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604066527, "title": "ZeroHello's [FILES] tab displays incorrect optinal file total sizes.", "body": "\r\n  * ZeroNet version: v3465\r\n  * Operating system: Ubuntu 16\r\n  * Web browser: Firefox ESR\r\n  * Tor status: not available\r\n  * Opened port: yes\r\n  * Special configuration: private proxy, desktop client\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Describe the problem:\r\n Now that the auto-seeding feature of BigFiles has been fixed, the Files page displays a total sum of site files without exclusion of omitted files.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n  1. Enable auto-seed on a site\r\n  2. Let files populate\r\n  3. Examine [FILES] tab\r\n\r\n#### Observed Results:\r\n\r\n  * The reported site size will never match that of the real local folder size due to the page inclusion of omitted files that are halted at 0%\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results:\r\n\r\n  * Report a real or better estimate value of page size. \r\n\r\nExplanation of Included screen shot:\r\nThe screen shot is what my [FILES] page reports for the file size of KopyKat from the private proxy zeronet  GUI, the private proxy has a 40gb ssd. The ssh terminal gives the true value of the KopyKat folder size on the private proxy..\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-05-11 18-25-14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16652932/39950819-da0c3952-5549-11e8-8c3f-e425fdb75e0e.png)\r\n\r\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1526070894, "modified": 1526072375, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1419", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 3, "comment": {"1604066471_mirrored_thisguy43110_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "As of v3465 downloading via file limits appears to operate as expected.
