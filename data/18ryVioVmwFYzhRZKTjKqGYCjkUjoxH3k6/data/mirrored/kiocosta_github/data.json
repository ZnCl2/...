I don't think users will want to download 6GB of blockahain data just to view domain. But if you want using local Namecoin blockchain, use [ZeronameLocal](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/tree/py3/plugins/disabled-ZeronameLocal) plugin.\r\n\r\nPardon my ignorance, but can't this data be stored in a similar way Bitcoin\"s blockchain data is stored? I mean, its blockchain is huge and yet people don't have to download tons of gigabytes to use it. How's Zeronet data different and why can't be it stored in the same way as BTC transactions data?", "added": 1576432673, "modified": 1576432673, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2361#issuecomment-565846166", "source_type": "github"}]}}
