Just for clarification, mails (+ then I assume other message types as well) are stored locally in the browser's storage. But it's not quite clear what this means. Up to now, I tested with IE and assuming to delete my own test mails actually just hide them. Thus, in the IE view the mails do not appear anymore, but e.g. Chrome shows them all again. This behavior is unexpected (because it's different from client-server systems) and thus confusing. \nIf I understand 'owner' now as the sender of a mail/message, does this mean, only the sender can delete a mail/message, but the receiver/s on which devices a message is stored can't?\nThanks in advance.\n", "added": 1456900416, "modified": 1456900416, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/279#issuecomment-191153786", "source_type": "github"}]}}
