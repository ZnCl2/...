Does anybody seed all the torrents that they come across? I'm assuming you constantly seed 1000s of torrents you aren't interested in simply because they're out there, including ones that actually have no legitimate content... of course you do, right?\n\nI consider this comparison invalid. \n- ZN sites are tiny and consume insignificant resources. \n- There aren't 1,000's of ZN sites, in fact I doubt you've visited more than 50 and if you judiciously clicked on links you couldn't have found more than 50 bad sites.

I'd love to know your situation.\n\n> I'd also like to point out there currently exists a global \"Size Limit\" option, so it is already assumed people will be selectively seeding which sites they want.\n\nYes, so that already gives users a reasonable approach of limiting their seeding activities. \n\nWhat you are asking is to make \"Don't seed any sites I visit\" the default. The network doesn't have other method of propagating. Until there's a way to pay or get paid on the network, if \"Don't seed\" becomes the default then most new sites won't be available when the publisher is offline which at this stage would be bad for everyone. \n\nMy proposal is to make payments easier and introduce basic reputation and rating indicators such as WOT or other (so that one doesn't visit poor quality sites by accident). That would make it possible to find cheap & paid seeders and make it harder for bad (bloated, crappy, etc.) sites to use visitors' resources. \n\nUnless the network starts to grow very quickly, I would rather see developer time invested in features that would help the network and even (indirectly) mitigate this issue than solving minor issues that have their root in real issues such as the lack of reputation and monetization.\n", "added": 1465695367, "modified": 1465695431, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/492#issuecomment-225409753", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 18, "body": "The Size Limit punishes all sites including those you like, so it's probably less likely to be used by regular users because it inconveniences them on sites they do like.\nBut I've nothing against judiciously designed options to improve the experience, I'd just like this to be implemented in a way that allows the network to remain well seeded and resilient.\n", "added": 1465700735, "modified": 1465700735, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/492#issuecomment-225412041", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065356_mirrored_liaoran_github": [{"comment_id": 19, "body": "this is not a discussion forum, please use ZeroTalk or other venue\n", "added": 1465640210, "modified": 1465640210, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/493#issuecomment-225361002", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065511_mirrored_unsystemizer_github": [{"comment_id": 20, "body": "Well it doesn't work here. \nI got the log files over -
