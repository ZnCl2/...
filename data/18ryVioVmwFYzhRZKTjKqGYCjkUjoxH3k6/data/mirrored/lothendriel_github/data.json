Google File Stream completely blocks ZeroNet. If I quit the Google File Stream application then ZeroNet loads fine. I have tried this several times just to be sure. Google File Stream may be using the same localhost port as ZeroNet?\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n  1. Run Google File Stream\r\n  2. Then run ZeroNet\r\n  3. Open browser and try to navigate to ZeroHello\r\n  4. Page will not load\r\n\r\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1525954085, "modified": 1526970616, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1418", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 4, "comment": {"1604066522_mirrored_lothendriel_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "Not sure how to read the log", "added": 1525957159, "modified": 1525957159, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1418#issuecomment-388098746", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 2, "body": "Would you like me to paste the entries from today here or is that not a safe thing to do?", "added": 1525958086, "modified": 1525958086, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1418#issuecomment-388103336", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 3, "body": "Well, this is on my work computer.
