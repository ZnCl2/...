We recommend tools for people in potentially life-threatening situations. Using outdated code (by a couple of years) that has known vulnerablities just doesn't cut it. I was sad to see these problems brushed off and shut down by the core devs. If you want to avoid breakage while maintaining security than I advise you to develop on Debian stable where security fixes are backported while avoiding unstable code churn. Its also good for code reproducibility which will be a requirement in Debian stable-next.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe second point is not really your fault but its smart to avoid. Namecoin hashing power has sunk to a level where a single miner is dominating it. Domain squatting is becoming a serious problem.
