After a little investigating into how the zeroname_updater.py worked I discovered the `bitcoinrpc.authproxy` module doesn't exist. Quickly grabbing [Garzik's bitcoinrpc module](https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc) confirmed that there's only a `proxy` module not an `.authproxy` module. \n\n```\nimport bitcoinrpc\nhelp(bitcoinrpc)\n```\n\nReturns:\n\n```\nPACKAGE CONTENTS\n    config\n    connection\n    data\n    exceptions\n    proxy\n    util\n```\n\nand:\n\n```\npkgpath = os.path.dirname(bitcoinrpc.__file__)\nprint [name for _, name, _ in pkgutil.iter_modules([pkgpath])]\n```\n\nReturns:\n\n`['config', 'connection', 'data', 'exceptions', 'proxy', 'util']`\n\nSimply changing the line from:\n`from bitcoinrpc.authproxy import AuthServiceProxy`\nto:\n`from bitcoinrpc.proxy import AuthServiceProxy`\n\nSeems to work, but I want to make sure I'm not overlooking anything. \n\nTo be thorough I went looking through the ZeroNet bundled Python lib\\site-packages to check for a copy of bitcoinrpc, but didn't find anything. Also grepping through the folder structure didn't return much to go off of. Most of the time I just work with `jsonrpc import ServiceProxy` directly so I'm not as familiar with bitcoinrpc. Is there an older version of bitcoinrpc ZeroNet depends on or any modifications not included in the github repo? \n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1463267043, "modified": 1463429986, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/454", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 2, "comment": {"1604065306_mirrored_xtraeme-xt_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "Looks like it might have been something silly.
