Several are currently under discussion at the [ZeroTalk thread](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1_1Kr2JfCsBYQU1z96xQsYTshKvJ5nz4mTG3) for this topic.\r\n\r\nSince I'd prefer this clearnet issue serve as the central hub for this topic, I've taken the liberty of copying across a few of the more notable comments on that ZeroTalk thread. If this was unspeakably bad, just let me know and I'll remove the offending quotes.\r\n\r\n**Let's do this.**\r\n\r\n> - Hashing, integrity\r\n> How can we hash the big files in such a way that small segments can be verified efficiently?\r\n\r\nThe canonical solution is [Merkle trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) (i.e., hash trees). I'll be astonished if ZeroNet doesn't eventually adopt *some* variant on a hash tree for distributing and validating big files. The devil is in the details, however:\r\n\r\n> nofish \u2501 on Jun 09, 2017\r\n> It's planned this summer, right now I experimenting with merkle trees.\r\n> Conclusions so far:\r\n> Pros: Smaller content.json files (only one 64bytes roothash)\r\n> Cons: Needs to send proof with every pieces. (640 bytes/piece at 1000 pieces) and slower confirmation time\r\n> So I'm not sure if it's worth it...\r\n\r\n> p2p \u2501 on Jun 13, 2017\r\n> IMO we can have quick-hash-tree + SHA-512-whole-file-hash as default, and all-SHA-512-hash-tree as fallback. In `content.json` we just need to store these 3 kinds of hashes: quick-hash-tree's root hash, SHA-512-whole-file-hash, and all-SHA-512-hash-tree's root hash.\r\n> First, we calculate quick-hash-tree in which much faster checksums are used such as CRCs to calculate leaf node hashes, and then combine the whole file, calculate the SHA-512-whole-file-hash. In case of attack ( all CRCs are right but SHA-512-whole-file-hash is invalid ), we fallback to all-SHA-512-hash-tree to find out which data piece is fake.\r\n> In this way, we can address the performance problem.\r\n\r\nIntegrating [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) into ZeroNet is strictly off-the-table for all of the obvious reasons, including:\r\n\r\n> nofish \u2501 on Jun 10, 2017\r\n> It [*integrating IPFS*] could be possible, but then we need to run separate daemon which would reduce portability, more memory usage, probably no full tor support, more connections and [probably other problems](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md#copyright-violations).\r\n\r\n> skwerlman \u2501 on Jun 11, 2017\r\n> I hadn't thought about tor support, which is probably a deal breaker since IPFS is UDP-only atm.\r\n> That CoC [*Code of Conduct*] is pretty spooky, since it seems to apply US law globally, and, assuming it's enforceable, it means the IPFS devs are susceptible to state coercion.\r\n> I think you're right that IPFS isn't the right solution here.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of @MuxZeroNet's line of questioning ultimately reduces to user experience (UX). The ideal approach would be to incrementally generalize ZeroNet's existing *small* optional file support to gradually encapsulate all of the functionality required for *big* optional file support.\r\n\r\nTo do so sanely, a browser-based user interface for managing optional files is all but essential. Specifically, ZeroHello might introduce a new zite-specific context menu item (e.g., named \"Files,\" \"Share,\" \"Details,\" \"Content,\" or something similar). When clicked, this item might open a new browser tab:\r\n\r\n* Displaying a detailed list of all optional files available from the selected zite.\r\n* Displaying torrent-style AJAX controls permitting each optional file to be independently started, paused, stopped, and deleted.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I2PSnark in ZeroNet drag *ala*:\r\n\r\n![I2PSnark UI](http://i.imgur.com/dT01pls.png)\r\n\r\nSadly, the size of even small optional files currently contributes to the 10MB zite limit. Generalizing ZeroNet's existing support from small to big optional files thus requires decoupling the size of optional files from the maximum size of the zite hosting those files.\r\n\r\nThe ideal approach is probably the incremental approach \u2013 one slow, languorous pull request at a time until we're where we eventually want to be.

It's *not* simply the lack of a `setup.py` script, PyPI wheel, or eponymous top-level package. It's also:\r\n\r\n* The extreme number of bundled mandatory runtime dependencies in the `src/lib` subdirectory, most patched in a ZeroNet-specific manner in unclear and probably unsafe ways.\r\n* The lack of any official list of mandatory and optional build-, run-, and test-time dependencies (ideally complete with acceptable version ranges).\r\n* The lack of a documented protocol for performing system-wide installation, particularly with respect to requisite users, groups, permissions, and directory structure.\r\n* The lack of a default system-wide installation shell script.\r\n* The lack of a default configuration file template.\r\n* The lack of a default `systemd` unit.\r\n* The lack of a default OpenRC script.\r\n* The lack of a default `/usr/bin/zeronet` shell script. The bundled `zeronet.py` script fails to suffice for a medley of reasons. In particular, `zeronet.py`:\r\n  * Fails to include the system-wide ZeroNet configuration file (e.g., `/etc/zeronet.conf`) if any.\r\n  * Fails to generalize to Python 3.x (e.g., due to the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env python2.7`). While ZeroNet does *not* yet support Python 3.x, it really [needs to](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/149) start doing that.\r\n\r\nIn short, **ZeroNet is a Turing-complete nightmare with respect to packaging.**\r\n\r\nTo simplify packaging for other Linux distros, consider pilfering the `src_install()` function of my [recently complete ZeroNet ebuild](https://github.com/leycec/raiagent/blob/master/net-vpn/zeronet/zeronet-9999.ebuild#L112) for Gentoo Linux. This function dynamically synthesizes sane users, groups, permissions, directory structure, system-wide configuration file, `systemd` unit, OpenRC script, and launcher script from user-supplied choices (e.g., whether or not to enable Tor-based anonymization). The ebuild preamble also specifies the most authoritative list of mandatory and optional dependencies I've yet discovered.\r\n\r\nThe [ZeroNet PKGBUILD tree](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/?h=zeronet) for Arch Linux comes similarly recommended for this purpose.\r\n\r\nMay the genderless penguin be with you, fellow packagers. \ud83d\udc27 ", "added": 1495840975, "modified": 1495841792, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/382#issuecomment-304420648", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065933_mirrored_leycec_github": [{"comment_id": 6, "body": "@HelloZeroNet *Ping!* You're probably busy beyond belief.<sup>_bbb_</sup> Installation instructions are understandably very low-priority, but is there anything further you'd like me to do for this?\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to touch this up in any way you like.

This is @leycec, the [quasi-official maintainer of the Gentoo Linux ebuild for ZeroNet](https://github.com/leycec/raiagent), with a trivial dependency issue. As the title suggests, ZeroNet \u2265 0.7.0 requires PySocks \u2265 1.6.8. Unfortunately, the top-level `requirements.txt` file listing all mandatory dependencies of ZeroNet fails to specify this; this file only ambiguously lists `PySocks` rather than `PySocks>=1.6.8`. Specifically:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# This line in \"requirements.txt\"...\r\nPySocks\r\n\r\n# ...should resemble this instead.\r\nPySocks>=1.6.8\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is an issue under Gentoo Linux in particular, as only PySocks 1.6.7 is currently marked as stable. PySocks 1.6.8 is currently marked as unstable, meaning *most* Gentoo Linux users who upgraded to ZeroNet 0.7.1 now have a broken ZeroNet. [We've since patched this on our end](https://github.com/leycec/raiagent/commit/37d1a97a32165e97ba153840f2d569b2037ac975), but an official fix in the ZeroNet codebase would be swell.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the phenomenal volunteerism, @HelloZeroNet.

All connection attempts \u2013 including those to trackers \u2013 fail with a PySocks-specific exception buried deep within the curmudgeonly bowels of the `socks.py` codebase.

Previously, the detailed instructions under the FAQ question [\"How to use ZeroNet with the Tor browser?\"](https://zeronet.io/docs/faq/#how-to-use-zeronet-with-the-tor-browser) sufficed to render ZeroNet usable with Tor Browser. Tragicomically, Tor Browser 9.0 fundamentally broke us by removing the \"Use custom proxy settings\" subsection from the \"Preferences...\" dialog. This includes the \"No proxy for:\" field required to enable ZeroNet usage. *Yup.*\r\n\r\nThe forced removal of custom proxy settings from Tor Browser 9.0 doesn't simply effect *new* users; it also effects all *existing* users who previously listed `127.0.0.1` under the \"No proxy for:\" field.

Try again in a few moments.\r\n> * If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer\u2019s network connection.\r\n> * If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Tor Browser is permitted to access the Web.\r\n\r\nPerusing the Tor logs (e.g., via \"Preferences...\", \"Tor\", \"View Logs...\") yields a slightly more informative view:\r\n\r\n> 10/25/19, 02:33:28.443 [NOTICE] New control connection opened from 127.0.0.1. \r\n> 10/25/19, 02:33:28.788 [WARN] Rejecting SOCKS request for anonymous connection to private address [scrubbed]. [10 similar message(s) suppressed in last 300 seconds]\r\n\r\n**This is bad.** Since Tor Browser defaults to auto-updating itself, most Tor Browsers users will now find ZeroNet (and most other darknets) inexplicably unresponsive. There's no visual indication during either the Tor Browser update process *or* from within Tor Browser itself once restarted that localhost connections are now silently and unconditionally denied.\r\n\r\nThis is appalling user experience (UX) design. This is also disappointing behaviour from Tor Browser developers, who absolutely should know better than to fundamentally break previously working functionality for no demonstrably good reason. Clearly, they think they know better. Clearly, they don't.\r\n\r\n*I am darknet-based anger incarnate.*\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I couldn't find a recent ticket on the Tor bug tracker that publicizes this, but several ancient tickets appear to relate: [ticket/10419](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10419), [ticket/10165](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10165), and [ticket/11493](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11493). Please repeatedly pester, flame, and shame developers on the Tor bug tracker until they relent \u2013 which they won't, of course. They've only gotten worse and worse and ever more ~~authoritarian~~ \"vigilant\" about prohibiting localhost access. Expect to be ignored, in other words.\r\n\r\nBut wait! There's more. As any good Mozilla devotee knows, Firefox's public-facing UI is *also* overly authoritarian, unnecessarily minimalist, and frankly useless... but trivially circumvented by the One True Preferences dialog: `about:config`. Long live `about:config`! Without that, Firefox and now Tor Browser would be literally unusable for most sane purposes.\r\n\r\nDoes `about:config` help us here? It absolutely does. Well, until Tor Browser developers realize that users can restore access to localhost by defining a single setting in `about:config`. At that point, they'll probably attempt to prohibit that, too. When they do, we'll need to get imaginatively creative. Until then, the following alternative instructions to those listed at [\"How to use ZeroNet with the Tor browser?\"](https://zeronet.io/docs/faq/#how-to-use-zeronet-with-the-tor-browser) suffice to restore worky:\r\n\r\n1. Start Tor Browser.\r\n1. Browse to `about:config`.\r\n1. Enter `network.proxy.no_proxies_on` into the \"Search:\" box.\r\n1. Double-click the `network.proxy.no_proxies_on` line that appears.\r\n1. Enter `127.0.0.1` as the value of this preference.\r\n1. Click \"OK\".\r\n\r\nChanges take effect immediately. Restarting Tor Browser is unnecessary. No thanks for small favours!\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, we'll need to revise our FAQ instructions to note this. It would be nice **[read:** _it'll never happen_**]** if someone <sup>who is not me</sup> would also create a Tor Browser Add-on or Extension for ZeroNet that automates this and other mundane chores (e.g., installing a ZeroNet-specific `.pac` file for domain resolution).\r\n\r\nUntil then, we're stuck with low-level manual kludges. *Why, developers... Y U break worky!?!?*\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n  1. Update Tor Browser.\r\n  2. Note that ZeroNet is dead.\r\n  3. Repeatedly smash forehead against keyboard until lapsing into blissful unconsciousness.\r\n\r\n#### Observed Results:\r\n\r\n  * What happened? This could be a screenshot, a description, log output (you can send log/debug.log file to hello@zeronet.io if necessary), etc.\r\n\r\nZeroNet dead.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results:\r\n\r\n  * What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nZeroNet not to be dead.", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1571973278, "modified": 1572357890, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2244", "source_type": "github"}]}
