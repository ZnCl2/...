Correct package management guarantees this. Embedding copies of the libraries with God-only-know what modifications means that when it comes time to update any of the dependencies, no one will know how -- not even the original programmers.\r\n\r\nSecond, modularity.\r\n\r\nThird, security. No one has time to audit the code in the embedded versions of the libraries in every repo of every project. You should be able to audit each dependency once by auditing that dependency's repo and thus guarantee that the code you audited is the code you're building and running against.\r\n\r\nFourth, leaving out package management has no benefits. There's no upside to not doing it. If the packaging system is ever retired, you can always paste the libraries back in.\r\n\r\nNow, if these people's problem was with the specifics of a particular package management system (like a problem with pip that gradle or nuget don't have) THAT I could find more understandable.

Well that's annoying. I try increasing the size limit on both files and sites to 100 MB. No effect.\r\n\r\nThat's a problem to chase, but **here's the real issue:** The \"File update failed\" notification tries to open the site when you click on it, instead of taking you to something relevant like a more detailed error message or asking you if you want to try again.
