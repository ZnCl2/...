It may lead to deanonymisation of users: first user start posting content with identity X with Tor working, but then Tor malfunctions and ZeroNet switches to standard (non Tor) connection and user gets deanonymised. I think that if 'Tor for all connections' is enabled and Tor malfunctions ZeroNet should just prevent any connection to network to prevent deanonymisation.", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1558143348, "modified": 1558143348, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2023", "source_type": "github"}]}
