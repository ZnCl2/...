I can't find how to do that properly: ZeroNet refuses to sign and publish, and I found no helpful documentation.\n\nHere is what I did:\n1. I installed ZeroNet.\n2. In the `data` directory, I created a directory with my zite's name (let's call it `mySite`).\n3. In the `mySite` directory I put all the content from my site, including the `content.json`\n4. I launched `zeronet.py siteSign mySite myPrivateKey`\n\nHere, everything looks normal until the end, when after the usual `File content.json signed!` it now says `SiteManager Deleting orphan site from content.db: mySite`.\n\nIf I try to publish I also have an error (it doesn't recognize `mySite`)..\n\nI tried adding the site manually to `data/sites.json` but it doesn't help, even with `own` set to `true`.\n\nSo my question is: how can I install my existing site on a new machine?\n\nThanks.\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1473455015, "modified": 1473456941, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/578", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604065577, "title": "Wrongly expect \"modified\" key in content.json", "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI moved my zite on a new server, and I caught a bug in ZeroNet in the process.\r\n\r\nSo I already have a minimal `content.json` setting file, which among other things specify that `*.pdf` files are optional (I have a lot of that on my website and it would explode the 10MB limit of ZeroNet without this setting).\r\n\r\nBut I couldn't `siteSign` because ZeroNet was expecting the `\"modified\"` key to be there : \r\n\r\n    Site:1PaBLo..Mhif Content.json parse error: KeyError: 'modified' in ContentManager.py line 213 > ContentDbDict.py line 61 > ContentDbPlugin.py line 198 > ContentDb.py line 85\r\n    Site:1PaBLo..Mhif File content.json not exist yet, loading default values...\r\n\r\nBecause of that it ignored my existing `content.json` file and thus refused to sign the Zite, since it was way too big with the PDFs.\r\n\r\nThe ZeroNet documentation says that `\"modified\"` is automatically generated, so I think that is a bug and not expected behavior.\r\n\r\nFor now the fix for users in my situation is to put `\"modified\": 0` for example in the `content.json` file. Then ZeroNet accepts the existing `content.json` file and everything works as usual (i.e., do a `siteSign`, then a `sitePublish`, then visit the zite locally, and voil\u00e0).", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1479925086, "modified": 1479925086, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/668", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 2, "comment": {"1604065464_mirrored_p4bl0-_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "My problem was solved thanks to this tip:\n\nhttps://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/533#issuecomment-240293925\n\nThis should really be said in bold in the documentation :).\n", "added": 1473456941, "modified": 1473456941, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/578#issuecomment-246075244", "source_type": "github"}]}}
