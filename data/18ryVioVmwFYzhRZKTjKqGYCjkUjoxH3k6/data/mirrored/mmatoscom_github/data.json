I own a rasp cluster of 5 boards myself, and I am fixing the kubernetes there in order to get all my personal tests up and running. \r\nWill probably have news this week, and will try to run a Zeronet node on each board. My main problem I am behind many firewalls and don't know if will it work anyhow as a way to publish distributed data, however will surely know if Zeronet will work there or not, and let you know. Don't take this personal, however the project guys are maybe dealing with some issue more people needs right away- other than PI support. I will try this week. cheers!\r\n", "added": 1507443847, "modified": 1507443847, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1130#issuecomment-334994022", "source_type": "github"}]}}
