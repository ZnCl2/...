I'm trying to think through the scalability implications of hosting a large site on zeronet and this is one of my concerns. Also useful for splitting a site up so the sqllite files for each site can stay small.\n\nIs this only limited to user sites? I can think of some cases where it would be useful to use this feature even if they were coming from the same publisher. For example a reddit clone where you only want to follow and download a few subreddits not the entire reddit site.\n\nWould these sub sites have the same features as existing zeronet sites? Could you nest them however many levels deep that you want?\n", "added": 1457324662, "modified": 1457324662, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/232#issuecomment-193135078", "source_type": "github"}]}}
