They don't have to worry about installing python dependencies, as most users wouldn't even know where to begin on that. \n\nIdeally a ZeroNet Qt interface would provide panels displaying information and features such as:\n- Starting/Stopping the Zeronet service\n- Launching the web frontend in the default browser\n- A debug log viewer\n- Key information\n- Site management facilities (signing/publishing)\n- Peer information\n- Shortcuts to Zeronet sites\n- ie anything the Windows tray platform has\n\nThis may also help in creating a portable application that is easier to maintain across Windows/Mac/Linux. \n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1435979127, "modified": 1436191892, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/133", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 2, "comment": {"1604064893_mirrored_yamamushi_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "My experience with Qt ends at the C++ interface, but I will see what I can do about modifying the trayicon plugin as you suggested. \n", "added": 1436024433, "modified": 1436024433, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/133#issuecomment-118540652", "source_type": "github"}]}}
