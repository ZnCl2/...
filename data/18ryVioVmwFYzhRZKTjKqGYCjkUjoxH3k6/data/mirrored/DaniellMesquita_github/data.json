So ZeroMux was right that the ZeroNet creator is lazy to implement i2P (even the IPv6 pull request is yet open without a review). Regarding Python 3 planned to end year of 2018, I understand Tamas, as he haves no obligation to follow the roadmap, as the donations aren't even used.\r\n\r\n> And mature infrastructures have more code review & security audits. ZeroNet security is considered bad.\r\n\r\nNow I understand Tamas. He is alone building a huge project, and isn't handling well the donations he received. The administration of he is really bad, but we shouldn't forget he is a human and probably with a good will. The only things we should blame he is about creating an organization to store ZeroNet-related repos, opening this organization and ZeroNet core repo for new maintainers, and distributing the ZeroNet donations to those maintainers and making a collaborative roadmap.\r\n\r\nRegarding security, openned that issue: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1849\r\n\r\n@szh7379\r\n> https://geti2p.net/en/blog/post/2018/10/23/application-development-basics\r\n> \r\n> I think the i2p team do that for zeronet. it is python.\r\n\r\nStrad tried to help implementing i2P to ZeroNet, but was ignored. Tamas keep saying that it is difficulty, but doesn't haves dedication to that. Vuze is the proof that BitTorrent networks  (as ZeroNet) can support full i2P: https://wiki.vuze.com/w/I2PHelper_HowTo\r\n\r\n> IPFS seems too bloated and hard to use. Dat looks good.\r\n\r\nYes, but IPFS is pretty modular, which futerely will support to storing bytes on merkle tree instead of full files. On IPFS thats really bad to re-upload a whole file for just changing an comma. Dat seems to not work at this manner, being more lightweight.\r\nBoth IPFS and Dat haves their purposes, while ZeroNet's purpose is to have some cool web features and built-in Tor. But as network, I think ZeroNet is just redundant, so it is better to use another network such as Dat or IPFS.

So if you want to develop for dat efficiently, then you should use their API and no real reason to interact with zeronet-style api.\r\n\r\nIn which thing Dat works differently: because it isn't using Bitcoin addresses? because it is fundamentally better than IPFS and better than ZeroNet's network/storage layer (but Beaker is not better than ZeroNet on application layer)? because (like I've reported about Zero Games, which proves ZeroNet is not really censorship-resistant, which was a shame) Dat is really against censorship and for an open Internet (unlike ZeroNet that relies on an censurable Bitcoin address)? because Dat haves built-in archiving and versioning? because Dat is being supported by Mozilla and added support to their protocol on Firefox? Can we point more about how ZeroNet is dying as a network and storage layer, and wait for more zites being censored through Tor and the unversioned/confuse updates of ZeroNet? And if an attacker does worse than what occurred on ZeroGames and, instead of replacing index.html, putting chldporn files to give legal issues to their seeders? That's the health of ZeroNet what is in question. Or I support Dat (and we've recently had serious disagreements, but they were instructed to do that about me) or I support ZeroNet; the two networks needs to be united or only one be used. And I'm not wrong about that, because I'm sure users doesn't likes duplication. That is not a corporatism competition, where Dat/ZeroNet could think \"I want money, you make money, I'm competitor and competition is good for consumers they haves options\". Users prefers an product that supplies their needs, instead of opening Dat and ZeroNet at same time and being confuse. And competing to Dat, death for ZeroNet as a network. But ZeroNet is better at application layer, but its network will kill it. Dat already haves an microblogging with user features (Fritter), and when it gets more application-layer updates, there will be no reason for using ZeroNet, as Tor can be used through Dat. ZeroNet should do an huge and unnecessary work for rebuilding a network from scratch, while Dat (through Beaker) haves possibility to implement application-layer features: so ZeroNet is on disadvantage.\r\nDat needs an strong application-layer, and ZeroNet needs an strong storage-layer: so @pfrazee and @shortcutme , if you two really fu*k*ng cares about an open and decentralized Internet, both you should unite your efforts as each one of you haves the piece of the other side, that jointing will form an very good application/storage-layer stack that is better than IPFS (the focus is not be better than other, but to be better for users).\r\n\r\nblurHY\r\n> @shortcutme Is it possible to remove iframe by building a browser for zeronet\r\n\r\nshortcutme\r\n> Sure, it's possible.\r\n\r\nAn browser for ZeroNet is already being made, with Python.
