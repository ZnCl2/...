I think they were trying to make it so localhost is not proxied by default but it ended up not working. One of the comment said:\r\n\r\n> By default, proxies don't apply to 127.0.0.1.\r\n\r\nWhen I set network.proxy.allow_hijacking_localhost to false ZeroNet works though. Seems like this is the opposite of what is expected? I might be misunderstanding it though.\r\nThis is the ticket that changed it: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/31065", "added": 1572274653, "modified": 1572274720, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2244#issuecomment-547071378", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 2, "body": "@filips123 yeah", "added": 1572282584, "modified": 1572282584, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2244#issuecomment-547123979", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 3, "body": "@filips123 I already did, https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/32313. They closed it and pointed to a issue where they said network.proxy.allow_hijacking_localhost is set to true which makes localhost not proxied automatically. The problem is it's not working. This is my understanding at least.
