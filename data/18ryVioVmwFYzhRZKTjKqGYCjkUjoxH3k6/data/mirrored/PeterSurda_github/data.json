It's a plugin that adds a new websocket call to send a message. However I'm not familiar with ZeroNet so I have some questions.\r\n\r\n- Where should ZeroNet store the configuration for the Bitmessage API (like the username/password)?\r\n\r\n- Where should users and/or sites publish their Bitmessage addresses? You can't construct them from the existing ZeroNet identifiers, because each Bitmessage address contains two keypairs rather than one. I tried using site_data, but I don't think that I'm doing it correctly.\r\n\r\nLet me know.", "added": 1488839201, "modified": 1488839201, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/65#issuecomment-284591224", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 2, "body": "@kamikazi3728 Sure, a collaboration may produce a better result.\r\n\r\n> As for the API configuration, I think could be as simple as including the settings in users.json\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to do that but will try.\r\n\r\n> For the publishing of addresses, my method just added a zeronet identifier or two. That way it would be much more accessible to those publishing sites.\r\n\r\nHmm then I will have to add the functionality to add an address from a private key to the Bitmessage API.

What I ended up doing instead was adding new parameters using the ConfigParser interface, so you can specify them both in the zeronet.conf as well as in the command line.
