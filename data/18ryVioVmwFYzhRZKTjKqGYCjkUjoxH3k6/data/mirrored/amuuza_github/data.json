Community networks keep growing -some examples here [1]. Decentralized applications, like ZeroNet, keep growing too. Unfortunately, ZeroNet does not work in community networks when they cannot reach the Internet (at least that's what we saw on the tests we did).\r\n\r\nIf I were a developer, I would be playing with ZeroNet's code so that ZeroNet could bootstrap within community networks, with or without a connection to the Internet - being able to work not only with public addresses but with private addresses too.\r\n\r\nI think that would be a significant step towards decentralization.\r\n\r\n[1]\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freifunk\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guifi.net\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninux", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1494487335, "modified": 1522905823, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/931", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 2, "comment": {"1604066109_mirrored_rjsteinert_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "I guess this request should be merged with [this one](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/931).", "added": 1507203692, "modified": 1507203692, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1094#issuecomment-334486217", "source_type": "github"}]}}
