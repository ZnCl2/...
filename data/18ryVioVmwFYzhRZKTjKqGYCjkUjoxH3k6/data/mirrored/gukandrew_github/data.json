Without Russia we already dead body, we will be all either dead or live in brutal fascism.

I don't like double standards, the Americans annexed entire countries in Afghanistan, Iraq, and they \"protecting oil\" now in Syria, Americans also \"annexed\" Guantanamo Bay which is a true concentration camp. The real evil in this world is not China, Russia or Iran, the real evil and world's biggest terrorist which killing thousands of people with drones is the United States of America. I believe we are close to 3th world war and if that times come I volunteer to oust the Americans from Europe.\r\n\r\nDid you heard about Budapest Memorandum and the freezing of borders after World War II? They don't have any legal rights to occupy any territory of Ukraine. I hope the war between China and Russia will happen soon, and you'll feel the things that we in Ukraine feel now protecting our territory against russians nazis. I see real face of supporting terrorism from your side like Russian Federation actions related their neighbors.
