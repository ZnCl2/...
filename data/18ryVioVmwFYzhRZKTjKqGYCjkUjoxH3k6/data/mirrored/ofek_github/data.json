Quick questions:\r\n\r\n- In the benchmark up top `coincurve` is not the fastest (it appears, correct me if I read it wrong!) and that should not be the case. Could you please show how that test is set up?\r\n- It says, `Cons: It's harder and longer to compile for different platforms, No support for message encryption (required for ZeroMail)`. Can you please explain what you need for message encryption? Also, there are actually pre-compiled wheels for every major platform \ud83d\ude42 ", "added": 1544322585, "modified": 1544322585, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1773#issuecomment-445512458", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 3, "body": "@HelloZeroNet Ah makes sense, thanks!
