Looks like a lot of security depend on the javascript modified according to this message https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/157#issuecomment-138733791 which should disallow the operation of a site in a popup or an iframe. But I have no idea of why it's necessary or if it do its job.\n\nI am not really aware of the capabilities of sandboxing of an  iframe but it appears that the iframe permission are huge \"allow-forms allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox {sandbox_permissions}\" I don't really understand how with such a huge whitelist, security can be enforced. I tried to search explanation of each permission and failed to have a clear view of the situation. Can you explain what each permission does (with reference to some official site) and how they don't break the security ?\n", "added": 1457939014, "modified": 1457939014, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/157#issuecomment-196234333", "source_type": "github"}]}}
