Zeronet would drastically benefit from a DHT, as trackers tend to come and go with time... \n\nMy bet is that it would be best to bootstrap and use Bittorrent's DHT (Mainline DHT - MLDHT), as although it has a few problems, a lot of effort is put into it to keep it reliable and stable. A simple approach could be done using `announce_peer` and `get_peers`. Some more fancy stuff could be done using the post-signed-mutable-content thing (see [bep_0044](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0044.html)), but that might not be interesting for Zeronet.  \n\nFor instance I (new user) query the MLDHT : `get_peers(sha1(1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D))` and retrieve a list of the peers on it - simple. The peers would have to first announced themselves using (roughly) `announce_peer(sha1(1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D), my_ip_and_port)`\n\nAbout the dependency, I think it's inevitable, at least for some things like bencode and the MLDHT, although there seems to exists relatively small python libraries. I'll have a look at this. \n", "added": 1460986689, "modified": 1460986689, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/57#issuecomment-211461964", "source_type": "github"}]}}
