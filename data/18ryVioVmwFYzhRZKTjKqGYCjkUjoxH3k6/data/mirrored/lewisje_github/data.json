Use a browser that does not support, or has blocked, WebSockets.\r\n  2. Visit a ZeroSite.\r\n\r\n#### Observed Results:\r\n\r\n  * The user sees a message saying that the browser is outdated.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results:\r\n\r\n  * The ZeroSite loads.", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1529714427, "modified": 1530135961, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1461", "source_type": "github"}]}
