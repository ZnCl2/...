For example:\r\n> \r\n> 1. In ZeroNet you must use localStorage via ZeroFrame API only.\r\n> 2. You can't simply use XHR or `fetch`.\r\n> 3. You must add `<base>` and a script to `<head>`.\r\n> 4. And many more. You can find some of them in [my tutorial](https://github.com/krixano/ZeroNet-Dev-Center/issues/28).\r\n> \r\n> So I've added a monkey-patch to make XHR work and included ZeroFrame to your site.\r\n\r\nhello I made this Zite and I have some errors, I need your help to fix them. this is an example of a unity WebGl game.\r\n1BkyaBHKaAkc9pNSFGQrTaubj6eH5ADHod", "added": 1598881523, "modified": 1598881523, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1237#issuecomment-683896649", "source_type": "github"}]}}
