If it were me, and keep in mind this is just my opinion, depending on the content hosted; there's really no need for the site to be that big. If anything, I would host the main site via ZeroNet A, and have another service which hosts ZeroNet B which contains the files that you're attempting to serve. That ZeroNet B could be located on a dedicated server, maybe, so you only require one dedicated seeder--then clients could request the content they desired via ZeroNet. But attempting to throw all the files at the client at once even when they may never use them is pretty weird IMHO.\n\nJust my $0.02.\n", "added": 1435862093, "modified": 1435862093, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/128#issuecomment-118174263", "source_type": "github"}]}}
