It's designed to be used for application specific need. Just use `/Library/Application Support/ZeroNet` for system-wide things and `~/Library/Application Support/ZeroNet` for OS user-related.\r\n\r\nAbout the signing: yes, whole `.app` bundle must be signed, signing only executable binaries will solve request to allow listening on public network interfaces, but doesn't allow users to launch the application using double-click without the `right click -> Cmd+Open -> Open` sequence.\r\n\r\nI think the best way for zeronet will be distrubtion only launcher as an `.app` in the zip or dmg. Launcher can be signed and barely changes. All the application (python, libs, modules, sources, ...) can be stored as \"data\" in the `/Library/Application Support/ZeroNet` and kept up-to-date by the launcher. Btw, any distributed this way executables must be signed for the good.. and to suppress macos firewall messages of cause ;)", "added": 1483550088, "modified": 1483550088, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/734#issuecomment-270474536", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 2, "body": "> DMG, other apps on mac use DMG or App Store\r\n\r\nor zip.
