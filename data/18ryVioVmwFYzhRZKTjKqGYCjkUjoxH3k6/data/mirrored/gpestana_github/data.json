ZeroNet is great, good job! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \r\n\r\nWe at [hashmatter](https://hashmatter.com/) are very interested in understanding how different projects are using DHTs and P2P routing protocols and what implication it may have in privacy and metadata leaks - and to try solving privacy vulnerabilities. In the context of ZeroNet, what would be the goal of a DHT? Would it be for service/peer discovery or/and storing and requesting content? How about the latency requirements? In terms of metadata leaks, DHTs may become very problematic and proxying the DHT traffic through Tor may sometimes not be the best solution (depending on the latency requirements, peer identity requirements, etc.) I believe the best way is to define 1) what are the goals for the DHT 2) latency requirements 3) threat model (this might exist somewhere already, and I'm sorry if that's the case and I didn't research enough). There are interesting protocols that can be built on top of the DHT routing protocol (check some here https://github.com/hashmatter/p3lib) that can enhance considerably the privacy of DHT interactions without the need for routing all traffic over Tor.\r\n\r\nHappy to keep the discussion and helping if needed \ud83d\udc4d ", "added": 1560885528, "modified": 1560885528, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/57#issuecomment-503333137", "source_type": "github"}]}}
