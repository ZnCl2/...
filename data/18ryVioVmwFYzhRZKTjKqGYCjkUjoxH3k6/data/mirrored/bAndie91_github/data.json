Unicode support is pretty good nowadays. I completely disagree denying any char in zeronet filenames. When you are about to access them via http interface, you `urlEncode` them. Always. If the underlaying filesystem happens to not to cope with certain filenames, then it's a typical case of \"you can not host this site as-is\". So speaking of access via http, urlEncoding can encode all filenames which supported by any filesystem, even more, because `%00`. So please do unicode.", "added": 1563447382, "modified": 1563447382, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1678#issuecomment-512826621", "source_type": "github"}]}}
