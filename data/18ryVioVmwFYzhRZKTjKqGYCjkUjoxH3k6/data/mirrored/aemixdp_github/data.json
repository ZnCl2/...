As I understand, the number of peers one may connect is not infinite and with growth of ZN the likelihood that first source of update in your neighbourhood is the first source of update globally will decline, is this correct (1)? Also, if we have triangle like A-B, B-C, A-C, is this impossible that A starts to publish its updates to all peers but in some cases B will receive it first and publish it to C quicker than A (2)?", "added": 1482255076, "modified": 1482255076, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/613#issuecomment-268350600", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065627_mirrored_beardog108_github": [{"comment_id": 3, "body": "I definitely saw prompt on some ZN sites, like \"This is new zite for you, do you want to add it and continue?\".
