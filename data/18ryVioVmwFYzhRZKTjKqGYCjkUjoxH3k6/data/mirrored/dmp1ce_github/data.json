Since the hostname is lowercase, a bitmap can be used to prefix the lowercase hash which marks the characters which should be capitalized. It could look something like this: `http://<hexBitmap>-<hash>.zero/`. I would like to update the plugin so that all pages are redirected to a `.zero` or a `.bit`.\n\nUltimately, I think using the `zero://` scheme with a custom browser is the best. [I think an Electron app allows for custom schemes.](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/protocol/) The Brave browser is built on Electron. A custom browser for ZeroNet would be awesome!\n", "added": 1475897234, "modified": 1475897234, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/83#issuecomment-252406504", "source_type": "github"}], "1604064925_mirrored_unrealwill_github": [{"comment_id": 2, "body": "For desktop users, I think the browser plugin is a good solution.
