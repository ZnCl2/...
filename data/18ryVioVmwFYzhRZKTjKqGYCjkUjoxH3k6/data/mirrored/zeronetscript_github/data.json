Protocol prefix in url reserve the ability to support different backend, keeps protocol  version to makes protocol upgrade easy. \n", "added": 1464830613, "modified": 1464831473, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/7#issuecomment-223192141", "source_type": "github"}]}, "next_topic_id": 5, "topic": [{"topic_id": 1604065276, "title": "didn't gives error when users.json invalid", "body": "if manually edit users.json to invalid json, zeronet start with a blank page, without any warning\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1461350521, "modified": 1503590654, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/430", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604065278, "title": "more document about dbschema", "body": "Hello, I want to implement more functions ,but I don't known this is possible with dbschema:\n\nfor example ZeroBlog, can I add taglist (json array) property to 'post'  object, and map this to another table? or can I recursive map json array to another table inside data.json? can I add sqlite triggers to dbschema.json \"indexes\" to let zeronet create these custom statement? sqlite currently support json extension and Common Table Expressions(for recursive), did zeronet support this ?  thank you.\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1461351674, "modified": 1461360941, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/431", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604065281, "title": "checking select query didn't trim leading spaces leads unnecessary error", "body": "UiWebsocket.py:440  \nassert query.upper().startswith(\"SELECT\"), \"Only SELECT query supported\"\n\ndidn't consider leading spaces. this leads some unnecessary dbQuery error\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1461392330, "modified": 1461533550, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/432", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604065310, "title": "rss plugin not work when incorrect feed used", "body": "if one site provides incorrect feed (such as lacking column), all feeds  disappears. only \n\nnotification:\nInternal error: xxxxxx\nUiWebsocket.py line 98 > UiWebsocket.py line 176 > NewsfeedPlugin.py line 42\n\n it should skip incorrect ones and notify user the bad sites.\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1463282447, "modified": 1463429971, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/455", "source_type": "github"}]}
