I also think the authenticated method is the best solution. It requires much less invasive changes to ZeroNet, and because the \"someone publishes some leaked documents with a single symmetric key, which is revealed to media/the public at a later date\" bit can already be done with ZeroNet really. Just encrypt the file locally and share the file on a zite.\r\n\r\nThe password-based authentication method can be added, though imo pubkey-based first sounds like the best solution, as I imagine that'll be the more widely used one.\r\n\r\nThe per-file encryption feature is nice is theory, but quite computationally expensive and not scalable. Doing it on an authenticated request basis is much cheaper, and per-directory authentication with authentication is trivial (like web servers do so today).\r\n\r\nThere is currently a 0.169BTC bounty (or $1261.37) open for this, and adding private zites would start to allow for paid content, and giving ZeroNet sites an avenue for legitimately distributing copyrighted works over an entirely decentralized system.", "added": 1528281284, "modified": 1528281284, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/62#issuecomment-395070159", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 3, "body": "@OliverCole https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/help_zeronet/donate/#private-sites", "added": 1528286466, "modified": 1528286466, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/62#issuecomment-395100613", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 4, "body": "Couldn't this just be:\r\n\r\n* Site admin has a `access.json` file in site root that denotes which ZeroNet public addresses can access this site\r\n* When peers ask for the files of this site, they need to sign their request with a private key that matches a whitelisted address\r\n* if they do, the peer sends the file over", "added": 1570527351, "modified": 1570527351, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/62#issuecomment-539491668", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 5, "body": "> when you remove a user, do you want to re-encrypt the site content to immediately deny them access to the data?

Encryption doesn't help here. If only a select few people can decrypt some content, you can't then go and serve that content to random visitors and expect it to be useful other than just for storage.\r\n\r\n> The purpose is to have redundant hosting of content, even encrypted, so public facing visitors can host the back end encrypted content. \r\n\r\nThis is a good point, and may be required if sharing private content with a select few people ends up in the hosting not being reliable. But to solve this we need to figure out a cryptographic method of encrypting the content efficiently to multiple participants.\r\n\r\nWe could just crib off of existing solutions here, such as matrix's [olm](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm), based on [Signal's double-ratchet algorithm](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/). This works by creating a shared secret that's sent through encrypted channels to participants, and is then used to encrypt a number of messages (in this case, diffs to ZeroNet content).\r\n\r\nWhen someone leaves or joins the conversation, the key is ratcheted forward to a new one, such that the person who left isn't able to decrypt new content.\r\n\r\nAs long as people aren't joining and leaving constantly, this is actually pretty efficient.", "added": 1600247823, "modified": 1600247823, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/62#issuecomment-693366912", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065041_mirrored_ghost_github": [{"comment_id": 7, "body": "Just a heads up that the debian package code is mirrored [here](https://github.com/goodtiding5/zeronet-debian) and [here](https://github.com/anoadragon453/zeronet-debian)", "added": 1536503373, "modified": 1536503373, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/241#issuecomment-419731393", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065344_mirrored_yurivict_github": [{"comment_id": 8, "body": "I also found an issue with automatic compiling of coffeescript with the `--debug` flag on.

Ability for zites with 'admin' privileges to send web notifications that appear outside the browser.\n2. ZeroHello (or any other replacement notification aggregate) makes use of this new ZeroFrame API endpoint.\n3. ZeroHello occasionally checks for new notifications. When a new one comes in, it sends a web notification, and the users comes back to ZeroNet to see what's new.\n\nNotifications have to be sent from a ServiceWorker, so ZeroFrame will spin one up when registering for notifications. \n\nWe should thus have two new api calls.\n\n* `WrapperNotificationsRegister`, returns `\"ok\"` if successful, otherwise the error message. This endpoint takes no arguments. Will start up a ServiceWorker on the current tab that can be used to send notifications.\n* `WrapperNotificationSend`, returns `\"ok\"` if the notification was successfully shown, otherwise the error message. Provided to this will be an array of three strings, `\"title\"`, `\"body\"` and `\"icon\"`, as those are the fields allowed by the Notifications API.\n\nWe can also handle events such as the user clicking vs. dismissing a notification, but this is out of the scope for just now.\n\nThe only downside to this is that the user has to keep ZeroHello as a tab open. There are a couple options for this. For instance, we could use a [SharedWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker), which would be a ServiceWorker that could be accessed by any ZeroNet-based tab. This would mean that notifications would be shown as long as I had one ZeroNet zite open.\n\nAdditionally, we can also show notifications without *any* ZeroNet tabs open by instead using the [Web Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API), however this requires an external server to send those Push notifications. While I think this could be achieved by the Python daemon, I don't understand enough yet to say that for certain. Additionally, the Push API is not yet supported by all browsers.\n\nThus I believe we should simply start with the Web Notifications API and work from there.

ZeroHello would be the only site that needs to have admin privileges, as it would be the only site sending external notifications. ZeroMail would just send the usual in-ZeroNet notifications and then ZeroHello would notify the outside world about it.\n\nThen again, we could just allow any site to send their own external notifications and not rely on ZeroHello, simply through the user's permission. ZeroHello would just automatically be granted this permission as it's an admin site.\n\nThe only reason I see for not allowing this would be some sites would stop going through the consolidated notifications feed, only doing their own notifications. But some users may block external notifications, only wanting to see them on ZeroHello, and therefore miss things as those sites aren't sending through ZeroHello.

If you want to support alternative methods for authentication it may be possible, but it depends what those methods are.\r\n\r\n> A site system with a user account with a private message, the publication of a message on a forum or to write a product notice, the publication of an image on the forum or for the image of a product sold, the publication of an article by users, the management of their stock, the creation and customization of their shop as part of a marketplace on ZERONET?\r\n\r\nNot really sure what the question is here, but yes those features can all be done on ZeroNet.\r\n\r\n> Should I use ZeroID to implement features like these before?\r\n\r\nYou can use any ID provider, but ZeroID is the best supported. There is talk of a new provider, KxoID, coming out in the next few weeks, so keep your eyes open.\r\n\r\n> What ZeroID equivalent is used to create similar features?\r\n\r\nMaybe you mean [ZeroFrame](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/)? ZeroID is just for authentication.\r\n\r\n>  Possibility of status data for some members as \"Moderator\" or \"Administrator\" as well as features such as banning members, closing some stores that will not comply with laws, deleting an item without closing the shop entirely, the alert system? With ZeroID or equivalent? Why? Why? Why? Why?\r\n\r\nYes you can have certain users moderate your content. This should probably be fleshed out a little more though, giving users the ability to only moderate certain files (`data/users/*` and not `content.json` and the like.) Is this already possible @HelloZeroNet?\r\n\r\n> To have the possibility of implanting other cryptomonnaie than the Bitcoin to leave to the sellers and buyers a broad choice of type of payment?\r\n\r\nSure, OpenBazaar does this through centralized service, ShapeShift.io. If there were a decentralized exchange, then one could theoretically use any cryptocurrency. I know some exist, but none on ZeroNet at the moment.\r\n\r\nWe're really not limited to Bitcoin though.\r\n\r\n> Possibility of setting up a so-called \"Escrow*\" system? Is there a function to deposit his money on the portfolio on the site or on the contrary, if the customer can use his own portfolio synchronized possibly to his ZeroID account?\r\n\r\nOpenBazaar does escrow through individuals whom the buyer and seller agree on using. ZeroNet could do the same thing. We really need a bitcoin/electrum plugin @imachug :)\r\n\r\n> For the creator of the site is it possible that it is a panel with modifiable parameters like the percentage of commission, to be able to add or remove categories of products, to put a filtering system to avoid putting an article online if there are certain non-compliant words?\r\n\r\nSure, you can do whatever you like with your interface, it's just a website. You could do filtering of words as well, but it would have to not only be done when a user publishes a page, but also when another user loads a page, otherwise one could just go into the site files and change it there.\r\n\r\n> Is a market technically stable and feasible? If so, how to create a market? What are the tools, modules or functions to use to create a market site on ZERONET (ZeroID? ...)?\r\n\r\nTake a look at the [ZeroNet documentation](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/), the [ZeroNet dev resource](http://127.0.0.1:43110/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/?Page:devresources), the [ZeroNet dev center](http://127.0.0.1:43110/14pM9huTYzJdyQyHRj6v2kfhMe8DrxwpGt/?/tutorials) and [The Truth About ZeroNet](https://github.com/krixano/ZeroNet-Dev-Center/issues/28) for good documentation on ZeroNet development.\r\n\r\n> How does an escrow system work?\r\n\r\nhttps://openbazaar.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207548366-What-are-moderated-payments-\r\n\r\n> How to implement it in a zite?\r\n\r\nHave a buyer send their payment to another user (escrow). Seller sends the product. Buyer tells escrow that everything's good and escrow gives payment to Seller OR Buyer says they did not receive product and gets their money back.\r\n\r\n> Is it possible that a zite is closed by the government?\r\n\r\nNot really. That's the whole point of ZeroNet :P \r\n\r\n>  It seems to me that the Chinese firewall had blocked the p2p client's communication port, but according to the new ZeroNet update, the port changes randomly (one of the solutions was to use a fixed port (15441) that the client listens to on a random port (10000-4000000)), but does this risk still have value?\r\n\r\n10000-40000* yes. This stops the Chinese government from doing basic traffic blocking, but if they started doing deep packet inspection then we'd need to change things. ZeroNet can use Tor with Meek proxies, but I don't know if those don't work anymore since Amazon/Google stopped hosting theirs @HelloZeroNet ?\r\n\r\n> Can a user account be hacked? Knowing that he uses cryptography similar to Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nNot unless their private key is shared somehow. Don't post it on any websites or give it out to anybody willingly and you'll be fine :) Nobody can randomly guess a private key like they can for a password.\r\n\r\n> Are there large security holes that could occur on a Zeronet site (roughly if user accounts could be hacked, if spying is possible and data recovery, if one or more people could close the site) despite the p2p system.\r\n\r\nYou'll never write software that's free of bugs or vulnerabilities. OpenBazaar v1 had some bad vulnerabilities iirc. Stick to the latest versions of your software and you'll likely be pretty well off.\r\n\r\n> Is there an interest in making zite updates? Because it's very secure with block string and file cryptography.\r\n\r\nNot sure what you mean. The creator of a zite or anyone they've deemed trustworthy can update their zite.\r\n\r\n> What happens when someone hosts malicious content?\r\n\r\nUp to the zite owner to take it down, or for people to block/blacklist that content.\r\n\r\n> Advantages and disadvantages of ZeroNet?\r\n\r\nOver OpenBazaar?
