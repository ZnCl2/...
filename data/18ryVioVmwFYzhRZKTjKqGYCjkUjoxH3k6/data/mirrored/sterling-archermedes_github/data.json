The user tries to access a Youtube video through the zite. This can be done by informing the video url in a form or through a url parameter in the zite.\r\n2. The zite checks it's database to see if this video has been mirrored to IPFS already. If it has, serve the IPFS copy. If it hasn't, download the video from Youtube, play it to the user, save to IPFS and update the database.\r\n\r\nI also intended to make a federated platform so each instance administrator could curate it's database. This would prevent spam.\r\n\r\nThe problem:\r\nHow to fetch the video from within the browser? Will I run into a CORS error by just using XHR?\r\nI made some tests with node-ytdl-core and browserify but couldn't manage to use it from within the the zite, only within a normal site. And in the later case I had a CORS error.\r\n\r\nNote: Everyone feel free to steal my idea. I don't want to do this but I might because I think it's important.", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1546537862, "modified": 1560875933, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1842", "source_type": "github"}]}
