I check your source code of the 'UpnpPunch.py',and I run your debug version of the 'UpnpPunch.py' above. According to the results and some informations I get from the Internet, I want to know whether it is necessary for my router to start the upnp mapping service,transporting the data got from Port 15443 to the Port 43110? Is it possible that I face this problem because of the lack of of the control over the router? If I got the control and start the upnp service manually and set the proper parameters, will I successfully install my zeronet? I am waiting for your answer,any words would be appreciated.", "added": 1488191263, "modified": 1488191263, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/725#issuecomment-282719393", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 2, "body": "OK, it actually works today, though continuously telling me that \r\n\"[12:47:16] Ui.UiServer Web interface: http://127.0.0.1:43110/\r\n[12:47:16] Ui.UiServer --------------------------------------\r\n[12:47:17] FileServer Checking port 15441 using portchecker.co...\r\n[12:47:23] FileServer [BAD :(] Port closed: Port 15441 is closed.\r\n[12:47:23] FileServer Trying to open port using UpnpPunch...\r\n[12:47:38] FileServer UpnpPunch run error: UpnpError: Failed to communicate with igd using port 15441 on local machine after 3 tries. in FileServer.py line 74 > UpnpPunch.py line 324 > UpnpPunch.py line 315\r\n\".\r\nThanks a lot.
