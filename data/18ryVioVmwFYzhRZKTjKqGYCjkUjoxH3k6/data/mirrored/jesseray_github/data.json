However, someone pointed out at a glaring flaw in my thinking: they would need to be able to download ZeroNet, which is on Github, which is blocked by China. In essence, China has blocked access to ZeroNet and thus blocked people from downloading Lantern from me. Doh!\n\nThe problem? The ZeroNet installer is provided in a centralized way. This could be addressed by having an automated system that creates a torrent of the latest version of ZeroNet and then publishes that torrent to various torrenting websites. You can check whether a torrenting website (or any website, really) has been blocked by China by using this website: http://www.blockedinchina.net/. I have already checked http://kat.cr and it was not blocked.\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1460439218, "modified": 1583331100, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/416", "source_type": "github"}], "next_comment_id": 3, "comment": {"1604065257_mirrored_jesseray_github": [{"comment_id": 1, "body": "I was afraid of that. The directory and files exist. No errors on signing. (PS: documentation should be added about when the site is too big and you need to ignore files. I figured it out eventually, but that was annoying.) Unfortunately, I have had trouble opening port 15441. I have tried port forwarding, turning off the router firewall, putting my computer in DMZ mode, and turning off traffic shaping, but zeronet.py still says that the port is closed when I start up ZeroNet.
